          "text": "The African Action Congress, on Thursday, knocked the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), for blaming Nigerians for the failure of his government rather than shouldering responsibility for the shortcomings of his regime.\n\nThe party expressed dissatisfaction over Buhari\u2019s interview aired on Arise TV on Thursday morning, saying that it is \u201cembarrassing\u201d that the President chose when and how he speaks, even when the whole country is on fire.\n\nIn a statement signed by the party\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Femi Adeyeye, AAC said, \u201cAnother shock is how, instead of reeling out his \u2018achievements\u2019 over the last six years, the President sounded like an opposition leader. But for a closer look and the distinction of voice, one would have thought it was a member of the civil society or the NLC (Nigeria Labour Congress) being interviewed. The President in his usual style blamed everyone but himself.\n\n\u201cMay we remind the President that the youths he blamed for the insecurity that has reached the highest crescendo, are not the ones who are constitutionally in charge of the Military and the Police.\n\n\u201cTalking about infrastructure, may we also remind the President that the youths are not the ones who took loans to the tune of trillions of naira with the promise that infrastructure would be fixed. The statements of the President confirmed the suspicion in many quarters that he is not conscious of the happenings in his immediate environment and his administration, except what he is told.\n\n\u201cAway from the hypocritical guilt-tripping of President Buhari, monitoring this recorded interview, we realised that the old General has not reneged on his jackboot absolutist style. Despite popular calls by well-meaning and peace-loving Nigerians all over the world for civil engagement with the legitimate concerns of different sections of the population, he prefers the use of brute force.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe AAC seizes this medium to remind Nigerians that there is no later time to fight for liberation as it is crystal clear that only the unity of the oppressed across all regions can free the people from the ruling class that Buhari represents,\u201d the statement added.",

Abdullahi Sule, on Thursday, said the unity of the country cannot be traded for money or other selfish motives.\n\nThe governor, who said this while speaking at the official unveiling of nine books on the National Youth Service Corps and a film \u2018Call to Service\u2019 in commemoration of the 48th anniversary of the Scheme in Abuja, maintained that there was no reason to discontinue the NYSC.\n\nHe said, \u201cJust as there is no price for security, there is also no price for unity, and the NYSC defines the unity of Nigeria.\n\nALSO READ: School sacks teacher for alleged child molestation in Nasarawa\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s anybody to talk to you about profitability, you are looking at one here.

Awaji-Inombek Abiante, had in a Bill that has passed the second reading in the National Assembly called for the scrapping of the scheme.\n\nHowever, Adaramodu said: \u201cAnybody is free to sponsor a bill, but the speaker and the rest of the house believe that the scheme has come to stay in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe scheme is going nowhere and it is not the plan of the National Assembly to scrap it.

I on behalf of the Nigerian Public urge the Senate to righteously reject her nomination and confirmation forthwith.\n\nALSO READ: Ondo PDP knocks Akeredolu for building new N2bn governor\u2019s lodge amidst unpaid salaries\n\n\u201cAs a card-carrying member of the ruling party or any other party for that matter, she is unfit for the position she is nominated. I also doubt that Section 154 (3) of the constitution was complied with, which prescribes that the President nominates the INEC Commissioner in consultation with the Council of State. Paragraphs B of Part 1 of the 3rd Schedule of the constitution provides that the Council of State shall have the power to advise the President in the exercise of his power with respect to (iv) the INEC including the appointment of members of the Commission. When was this Section and paragraph complied with? If I may ask.\n\n\u201cMost importantly paragraph 14 of part I of the third schedule of the constitution as amended in Section 30 No. 1 of 2010, a member of INEC should be \u201cnon-partisan\u201d, can Ms. Lauretta Onochie be regarded by anyone in Nigeria, knowing her antecedent as the Special Assistant to the President as \u201cnon-partisan\u201d under the Nigerian context? The right answer is No.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, on behalf of the Nigerian Bar Association urge that her nomination be rejected and her confirmation be denied forthwith.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Raymond Utasaha, and Police Commissioner Imo State, Alhaji Abudu Yaro, that IPOB killed 128 security personnel in Imo State.\n\n\u201cThe above statement is not only fabricated but ridiculous and untenable. How could IPOB that is not armed be able to kill as many as 128 security personnel in one state? What an illogical and ridiculous claim!\n\n\u201cThis is nothing but one of the antics of our oppressors to tarnish our global reputation and whip up public sympathy.\u201d\n\nThe separatist group claimed that those in authority wanted to use the allegation as a \u201csmokescreen to justify \u201d their intended crackdown on its members.\n\nIPOB reiterated the group\u2019s peaceful disposition towards the actualization of Biafra.\n\nThe group pointed out that it would inform the public if it decides to adopt violence in its push to actualize Biafra.\n\n\u201cFor the record, IPOB did not kill any security personnel in Imo or any state for that matter. IPOB has been a peaceful movement since its inception with the sole mandate of restoring Biafra.\n\n\u201cWe have not changed our non-violent philosophy for the restoration of Biafra. If for any reason we need to change our peaceful approach, we shall make the same public but for now we have not gone into arms struggle, and don\u2019t intend to.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari had vowed to mobilize the military and police against IPOB and the Eastern Security Network, ESN.\n\nBuhari had issued the warning during an interview on Arise Television on Thursday.\n\nResponding, IPOB had said Buhari\u2019s threat would only make it stronger.\n\nThe group insisted that it was not afraid of Buhari\u2019s threats.",

          "text": "More reactions have continued to trail the bill before the House of Representatives, seeking to scrap the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC).\n\nThe bill sponsored by the lawmaker representing Andoni-Opobo/Nkoro Federal Constituency of Rivers State Awaji-Inombek Abiante, in the explanatory memorandum of the proposal, listed various reasons the NYSC should be scrapped.\n\nIt said the NYSC has led to the, \u201cIncessant killing of innocent corps members in some parts of the country due to banditry, religious extremism and ethnic violence; incessant kidnapping of innocent corps members across the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cPublic and private agencies/departments are no longer recruiting able and qualified Nigerian youths, thus relying heavily on the availability of corps members who are not being well remunerated and get discarded with impunity at the end of their service year without any hope of being gainfully employed. \u201c\n\nDue to insecurity across the country, the National Youth Service Corps management now gives considerations to posting corps members to their geopolitical zone, thus defeating one of the objectives of setting up the service corps, i.e. developing common ties among the Nigerian youths and promoting national unity and integration.\n\nThe bill is seeking the alteration of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria Alteration Bill, 2020.\n\nDAILYPOST recalls that the NYSC was created by former Head of State, Gen. Yakubu Gowon, on 22nd May, 1973, as an avenue for the reconciliation, reconstruction, and rebuilding of the nation after the civil war.\n\nDon\u2019t allow scrap of NYSC \u2013 HURIWA tells Buhari\n\nReacting to the bill, an Executive Director with the Civil Liberties Organisation, Comrade Steve Aluko, said, \u201cIt is unacceptable, unthinkable and very illogical in the National Assembly.\n\nAluko maintained that, \u201cIt is unpatriotic and unnationalistic given the challenges of lack of unity and the urgent need to promote national integration, commonality of ideals, thoughts and philosophy that help promote national consciousness.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe best they would have done is to weigh the advantages over the disadvantages, and recommend the best way to improve, reinvent the will at resolving targeted generational and contemporary challenges inhibiting nationhood.\n\n\u201cWhatever justification they are giving can as well be for dismembering the country and the dissolution of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe side they have taken amounts to abdications of the letter and intent of making good law, to maintain law and order and common good in the country.\n\n\u201cA National Assembly that fails in performing its oversight function cannot be said to be the catalyst to promoting national development and harmonious peaceful coexistence that prompted the NYSC scheme\u201d, he stressed.\n\nAlso reacting to the bill, a Civil Society Practitioner, Comrade Pwakim Jacob Choji, said, \u201cWhile reflecting on the reasons for the call towards the scrapping of the NYSC scheme, it\u2019s key that we give a deeper reflection considering that, the scheme has gained credibility amongst a large number of young people in the country despite that there are few others who feel that the one-year programme is a waste of youthful time which would have been used into more meaningful ventures.\n\nHe said, \u201cFor instance, the scheme should be turned into an empowerment scheme where all monies meant for the NYSC kits and monthly allowance of the corps members are given to undergraduates at graduation so as to fund a small-scale business that will be supervised by the NYSC.\n\n\u201cThe NYSC has been a great scheme of mingling, but the problem of Nigeria is not about Nigerians not mingling into other cultures and environments, but the concerns of economic and social justice that have been missing in the administration of governance by successive governments.\n\n\u201cThe cause of another Civil War is not the idea of not knowing each other\u2019s cultures, but the hopelessness, hunger, and injustice experienced and perceived by Nigerians across different regions and religions\u201d, he stressed.\n\nAccording to Comrade Japhet Philip La\u2019abes, a Civil Society Activist, in his reaction to the Bill said, \u201cAt this critical moment of turbulence in our nation\u2019s history, the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) is probably the only surviving symbol of our unity in diversity, and any attempt to scrap it will portend a dangerous signal to the corporate existence of the nation.\n\nLa\u2019abes maintained that, \u201cThe Bill seeking to end the NYSC scheme is dumb, poorly thought out and ill advised.\n\n\u201cThe House of Representatives would do well to retrace it\u2019s steps in the overall interest of the people\u201d, he admonished.\n\nIn his reaction, the Public Relations Officer, Federal Government College Jos Old Students Association, Plateau State chapter, Comrade Wakklee Nennang, said, \u201cAs a product of a unity school, I can we are privileged to have started our NYSC at that level.\n\n\u201cHowever, in the light of ongoing discussions by members of the Nigerian House of Representatives seeking to scrap the scheme which had generated mixed reactions from Nigerians with some opposing the move while others succumbing to it, it has become imperative to lend a voice in the discussion as it affects national unity and social cohesion.\n\n\u201cIn the light of the current state of the nation, the scheme poses a greater danger to the life of the prospective Corp members than to the state.\n\nNennang maintained, \u201cSelf-preservation is said to be the first natural law of humanity, and Corp members first owe themselves the duty to keep their lives without which, their dreams and aspirations of decent job cannot be achieved.\n\n\u201cIt is worthy to note here that, at the time of the inception of NYSC, the state of the nation was quite different. Now we are in a very different place and time in the nation\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cPriority now has shifted from national integration and unity towards a crisis of governance and plain simple mismanagement of public expectations.\n\nWhy NYSC should not be scrapped \u2013 Shehu Sani\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe scheme has failed in providing the needed national unity as the fault-lines of ethnicity, religion and corruption held sway, neither has it created more patriotic citizens. Unity and patriotism requires more fundamental variables.\n\n\u201cI therefore hold the opinion that, rather than having the scheme scrapped, there should be a progressive re-organization and modification of its objectives to suit the present day Nigerian situation\u201d, he admonished. \u201cCorp members are allowed the autonomy to decide where they wish to serve even if it is in their home state or states of residence as they wish.\n\n\u201cThis is expected to mitigate security risks and risk of fatalities from bad roads or other modes of transportation\u201d, he explained.\n\n\u201cThe scheme can be modelled in a way that corps members will be camped for at least six months, where they are taught vocational and entrepreneurial skills most needed for economic stimulation and growth which the nation is now in dire need of.\n\n\u201cThe Corp members can after successful completion of the camp, be given a grant as start-up capital to make them self-reliant and initiators of small and medium scale enterprises which is what is required to improve our GDP, per capita income, and unemployment rates in Nigeria.\u201d",

NLNG obey Nigerian laws.\u201d\n\nSpeaking for Finima protesters, Dagogo Brown, said many attempts to hold dialogue with management of NLNG on the matter proved abortive.\n\nBrown said: \u201cWe are tired with our tenant, NLNG. They have refused to obey the NOGICD Act of 2010 which clearly defined an host community and their rights.\n\n\u201cFinima is the landlords of NLNG and we need to be recognised as such. Finima will not rest until what we deserved by the law of Nigeria, is given to us. And NLNG as corporate citizen should respect Nigerian laws.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, women leader and former Councillor in Finima, Mrs. Prinye Kabaka, said the people were being grossly marginalised by NLNG.\n\nShe said: \u201cNLNG train 1-6 sited in Finima and even the upcoming Train-7 project is in Finima, so do we need to fight before we are recognized?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe are calling on the federal government to call NLNG to order. Let them obey the Nigerian laws as stipulated in the NOGICD Act\n\n\u201cWe have graduates and MSc holders from Finima community working as cleaners in NLNG. Scholarships are not given to us. Everything is going to Bonny. Out of 250 scholarships every year, only one or two will come to Finima.\u201d\n\nBut some youths believed to have come from Bonny caused commotion when they staged a counter protest against Finima people.\n\nThe youths reportedly attacked the Finima protesters, critically injuring nine people and destroying seven vehicles, including burning a bus belonging to Finima Youths Congress.",

I am sure you will understand what they mean. Again the youths made the same statement. So, that IPOB is just like a dot in a cycle, if they must secede, you must have access to where you are.

With the challenges we face in Nigeria today, I see an opportunity for us not to break up or break down but to break open; open up to ourselves in truth so that we may appreciate each other, understand each other, honour each other and live together in peace and prosperity.\u201d\n\nHe assured Nigerians that with the concerted efforts being put in place by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration to secure the lives and property of Nigerians and stabilise the economy, the nation will continue to get better.\n\nAregbesola said: \u201cThere will surely be light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d even as he wishes all Nigerians a happy Democracy Day celebration.\n\nThe June 12, which was the day Chief Moshood Abiola won the 1993 presidential election, which was subsequently annulled by the military government of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, was declared a public holiday by the administration of President Buhari after it was only celebrated by states in South-west since 1999 on return to present civilian rule.\n\nThis year\u2019s celebration falls on a Saturday, making the federal government to declare Monday, June 14 a public holiday.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Look at what happened with Boko Haram. If we were not in a good relationship with Niger, Chad and Cameroon, Boko Haram would have done worse things to us and you say I am going to Niger.\n\n\u201cI told you the border between us and Niger is 1, 500km. I spoke to one French man and I had to tell him this. He spoke nonsense and I told him look, in 1885, you sat down and drew lines (boundaries). I said I have first cousins in Niger. There are Kanuris, there are Hausas, there are Fulanis in Niger Republic just as there are Yorubas in Benin. You can\u2019t absolutely cut them off.\u201d\n\nBuhari stressed that Niger, which is a landlocked nation, had discovered oil, and Nigeria did not want them to do trade through Benin Republic.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe want them to come through Nigeria.

          "text": "Kenya, this week, became the first and only African market where Bolt has introduced electric bikes, tuk tuks (tricycles) and scooters on its platform. This comes as the on-demand transport company looks to tackle the twin challenge of fuel price fluctuations and environmental pollution in the East African country.\n\nBolt\u2019s addition of electric vehicles to its fleet is in line with an expansion plan for greener transport options in Kenya, particularly in its delivery unit, with the ultimate goal of reducing the company\u2019s environmental footprints.\n\nA study by the Union of Concerned Scientists finds that ride-hailing companies are responsible for nearly 70% more carbon pollution than the modes of transport they displace, like mass transit, biking, and walking. To address this, they have been called on to reduce emissions with more concerted efforts such as electrifying their fleet of vehicles.\n\n\u201cThis is a great step towards realising environmentally conscious ways for people to move around in the city, reduce our ecological footprint, decrease air pollution and increase access to clean transportation modes,\u201d Regional Director for Bolt Africa, Hillary Miller-Wise, said at the launch.\n\nFor now, the electric bicycles and tuk tuks will be used by Bolt Food couriers only. The food delivery business launched in Nairobi three months ago amid a resurgence in global coronavirus infections, with Bolt looking to tap into the boom in demand for contact-less services recorded since the Covid-19 pandemic began. It offers users access to a diverse list of restaurants and menus in the capital city.\n\n\u201cWe will be making deliveries using the newly launched tuk tuks and bicycles within Nairobi as we expand into other towns across the country. Our customers will now have more Eco-friendly and sustainable options to choose from,\u201d Bolt Food Country Manager, Edgar Kipngetich Kitur, said.\n\nThe fleet of electric scooters and e-motorbikes essentially helps Bolt fulfill the demand for light, smarter and greener modes of transport that are also less expensive to maintain. It is perhaps the cost factor that was the biggest consideration that propelled the company to introduce the new vehicles.\n\nAccording to Bolt, electric vehicles will also help evade challenges associated with a fuel price crisis that has greatly affected its drivers and couriers. Last month, the ride-hailing company raised fare prices across all cities in Kenya due to the increased cost of fuel in the country.\n\n\u201cWe trust that this is a stride forward to mitigate the impacts of constant fluctuating fuel costs and will stabilise the growth and sustainability of driver earnings and cost of doing business,\u201d Hillary added.\n\nWhile the vehicles will initially be used by Bolt Food couriers, the company plans to include them in the passenger business as well. Bolt will also expand its green transport options in other African markets where it has a presence, it said, without specifying which will come next. On the continent, Bolt Food is only available in Kenya, South Africa, and Ghana.",

          "title": "How seamless customer onboarding is transforming fintech growth",
          "text": "According to McKinsey, Nigeria is now home to over 200 fintech standalone companies. And thanks to increasing smartphone penetration, many of these services use apps. Many of these apps have extensive marketing spending to drive user growth. In recent times, Abeg app and Patricia were announced as sponsors of Big Brother Nigeria.\n\nYet, beyond marketing spend, there\u2019s another simple way that fintech startups are ensuring that people want to use their products, and it is through onboarding. Onboarding is the process of introducing a new user to your app or product.\n\nOnboarding is essential for several reasons; it can lead to customer drop-offs if the process is difficult or complicated, or it can be such a delight that customers end up telling others about your app.\n\nOn Friday, May 21, VerifyMe Nigeria and TechCabal held the \u201cDigital Identity Matters\u201d event to talk about the importance of onboarding and the nuances that surround it. The event had Babs Ogundeyi, the CEO of Kuda Bank, Dayo Ademola, the Managing director of Branch Nigeria, and Esigie Aguele, the co-founder and CEO.\n\nOne of the critical things in onboarding a customer is the Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement.\n\nWhat does the onboarding process look like at Kuda bank?\n\nAccording to Babs Ogundeyi, Kuda has different levels of onboarding because not everyone in Nigeria has the same type of identification, and some people do not have any identification at all. In June 2020, the Director-General of the NIMC, Aliyu Aziz, said only 38% of Nigerians have any form of identification.\n\n\u201cThe way we think about it is that we need to do enough to capture everybody and to give everybody a chance to be onboarded. So we have three tiers of customers, which is in line with the Central Bank guidelines for Microfinance banks.\u201d\n\nFor Kuda, the minimum requirement for KYC is that the bank needs to know what you look like, so while it asks users to take a selfie as part of its onboarding, it uses technology to be sure that the person taking that selfie is the owner of the account.\n\nIt also relies on Bank Verification Number (BVN) to compare the pictures of account holders with what is in the system. These levels of verification are important to prevent forgeries, fraud and attempt to circumvent processes.\n\nIn a nutshell, the more documents you have to corroborate, the better your onboarding process. It also helps to think of them as a never-ending process because bad actors never stop trying and fintech startups need to stay ahead of them.\n\nWhat would make the lives of customers easier?\n\nWhile BVN has been a gamechanger for verifying customer details, there\u2019s still some work to be done. According to Dayo Ademola, one important part of onboarding should be verifying the address of customers.\n\n\u201cTypically, you would ask for a utility bill but at the highest level of KYC, someone has to physically verify the address of the customer. What we are trying to do is, if we say that we are a bank in your pocket, then we have to find workarounds to make this happen.\u201d\n\nOne workaround is comparing the address on a customer\u2019s BVN with the address they have listed with a commercial bank. This is because commercial banks often physically verify the addresses of their customers.\n\nIt already sounds cumbersome in an industry where customers are asking for speed. \u201cBeing able to onboard pretty quickly is important; how quickly can customers download your app, verify their information and become an actual user instead of gaps where the app needs to verify.\n\n\u201cThe top thing that new users are really looking for is speed. Another pattern we see is that customers start to drop off when you start asking for a lot of information, you see a lot of drop-offs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, if you ask costumes to wait 24-48 hours before you verify them, that poses a problem.\u201d\n\nIn the end, bank customers will still face lengthy wait times while a bank is running verifications checks in the background. Nigeria still functions as a low-trust environment; and despite accelerated changes to our financial ecosystem, banks and their customers agree that the KYC process is crucial to prevent fraud and cybercriminal activities.\n\nFind the full video of this conversation on YouTube.

          "text": "This year\u2019s edition of Apple\u2019s annual software developer conference, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), kicked off on Monday with a roughly 90-minute keynote address that saw top company executives show off a slew of new updates for major products.\n\nKey announcements made by the American technology giant included software for iPhone, Mac, iPad, Watch and Apple TV, new health features, and updates to Siri, AirPods, and iCloud. In addition to these, Apple unveiled new updates focused on tightening the protection of its users\u2019 privacy.\n\nA particular update that stood out from Apple\u2019s several privacy-focused measures is \u201cPrivate Relay\u201d. This new feature encrypts all browsing history and prevents third parties from intercepting the communication between your device and the server you\u2019re requesting information from. When turned on, nobody can track a user\u2019s online activity \u2013 not even the internet service provider or Apple itself. This is due to the fact that the feature uses a server maintained by a third-party operator, which will assign temporary IP addresses for users as they browse the internet.\n\nApple\u2019s use of an outside party in the relay system is intentional to prevent even the company from knowing both the user\u2019s identity and what website the user is visiting, it explained.\n\nPrivate relay is the latest in a string of efforts by Apple meant to curb the tracking of its users\u2019 browsing activity by ISPs, advertisers, and other third parties. The feature is likely to go live later this year but Apple has revealed that it won\u2019t be available in some countries due to \u201cregulatory reasons\u201d.\n\nCountries where the company will not offer private relay include South Africa, Egypt, Uganda, Saudi Arabia, Belarus, Colombia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, the Philippines and China. In the latter, users live under a vast surveillance system and notorious internet censorship, and Apple has had to make several compromises on privacy to meet the demands of the ruling Communist party.\n\nIt is unsurprising to see African countries on the list of nations excluded from the private relay rollout as cutting off access to the internet and social media is common in the region. A report by privacy protection company Surfshark shows that at least 27 countries in Africa have blocked or heavily restricted social media access since 2015.\n\nLike China, those excluded by Apple have in place some kind of internet censorship regulating their citizens\u2019 online activities \u2013 often in the form of laws guiding against misinformation, hate speech, or cybercrimes \u2013 or have outrightly blocked access to social media and the internet in recent times.\n\nThe Egyptian government in particular has one of the most extensive surveillance networks in Africa and has ordered the blocking of hundreds of websites that belong to news outlets, blogs, human rights organisations, and tools such as virtual private networks used to bypass the blockades.\n\nApple is yet to disclose the outside partners it will use for the private relay system. The company also did not specify if the update will be blocked by internet providers in the countries where the feature is restricted or will simply be excluded from system upgrades for users there.",

          "text": "The latest smartphone in the product line of the Note series, the Infinix Note 10, is a device that was built to \u2018Meet Beauty with Strength\u2019. The elements of the new Note 10 are Speed, Beauty, Power, and Strength. The beautiful screen, the bodywork, and the overall design of the device, plus the strength of its processor all come together to provide an extraordinary experience for users. Infinix has gone a step further to bring upgraded and improved features to the new Note 10, while still maintaining affordable pricing for consumers.\n\nThe Infinix Note 10 Pro won the IF design award 2021 for its iconic design and flattering colour variants. The brilliant bodywork was followed with this remark by IF World design Guide, \u201cThis generation has a single appearance but two different battery cover designs. One is full of symmetrical design aesthetics \u2013 \u201cpolygonal vertical grating\u201d \u2013 while the other has more mysterious shimmering patterns and texture.\u201d\n\nAccording to Unbox Therapy, \u201c\u2026 if entertainment is one of your priorities and you need a budget smartphone the Infinix Note 10 Pro looks like it\u2019s up to the task. The Infinix Note 10 Pro will certainly satisfy with its whopper of a 6.95inch IPS display. It is definitely one for those who want their smartphone to be as big as humanly possible.\u201d And the Tech Chap, a UK top tech YouTuber, further confirmed the screen size by saying, \u201cI really love just how big the screen is. We\u2019ve got nice thin bezels around the edges; we\u2019ve got the hole punch selfie at the top. As I said, 6.95 inches \u2013 if you are watching movies or playing games, this is going to give you a really immersive experience.\u201d\n\nAnother UK tech reviewer, Tech Spurt said, \u201cThe batteries are integrated with ultra power saving mode so you can get an extra 58 hours of call time even when the battery is at 5% capacity\u201d. Another tech reviewer, the Tech Chap also said, \u201cWe do also have that fast 33W charger, which actually charges up 50 minutes faster than the previous generation of this phone \u2013 a nice upgrade there.\u201d\n\nIn the words of a British tech reviewer, SuperSarf, \u201cA 90hz refresh rate at this price, that\u2019s just insane.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "In May 2021, CribMD, a Nigerian healthtech startup, closed a $2.6 million seed round led by US-based venture capital firm, Sputnik ATX.\n\nFounded by Dr Oksana Malysheva \u2014 a physicist with stints at McKinsey and Motorola \u2014 and Joe Merrill \u2014 a former US diplomat to Nigeria, South Korea, and Bosnia \u2014 Sputnik ATX runs an accelerator programme where founders receive $100,000, with the potential for more in follow-on funding.\n\nSince its inception, the firm has invested in over 30 startups across various industries.\n\nTechpoint Africa spoke to Joe Merrill, a partner at the firm, and he gave some insights into how they invest in startups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFun fact: Sputnik is a Russian word meaning partner. It is also the name of the first artificial satellite launched into space.\n\nTell us how Sputnik ATX came about\n\nMy business partner, Oksana Malysheva, and I founded ATX in 2017 after we had managed a fund together.\n\nWe were looking for ways to improve our returns and be more impactful. In our research, we discovered a massive gap with early-stage financing that would give entrepreneurs the tools needed to grow their businesses and then follow-on funding to scale and grow quickly.\n\nWe founded Sputnik ATX so that we could do that. We joke that we teach nerds how to sell, so if they have a minimum viable product (MVP) and a customer and are looking to try and figure out how to grow their startup, we teach them how to grow and build a big company.\n\nWhat does VC investment mean to Sputnik ATX?\n\nDr. Oksana Malysheva, Managing Partner, Sputnik ATX\n\nWe are early-stage investors, and to us, VC investment is the ability to help very brilliant, gritty, hardworking, humble people get access to capital at an early stage to accelerate their company\u2019s growth.\n\nWe also help them by giving them business skills, particularly in sales and marketing, so that they can refine their product and grow their business in a sustainable way that would help them to produce an amazing company.\n\nEvery VC has an eye or eyes in specific markets. Tell us what market(s) Sputnik ATX is interested in and why?\n\nWe\u2019re not necessarily interested in specific markets but in people who have a big impact. So, for example, we talk about this thing called consumer surplus \u2014 an economic term that refers to the difference between what you\u2019re willing to pay for something and what you pay for it.\n\nAnd when we see people who are generating lots of consumer surplus, it means they\u2019re generating lots of value in the market. And we want to help them to do just that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe name Sputnik comes from the first thing mankind launched into space \u2014 the Sputnik 1 satellite \u2014 and like Sputnik, we\u2019re looking for people who are doing big things.\n\nDoes that mean you invest more in founders than in startups?\n\nIt has to be both. There\u2019s this statement about whether you invest in the jockey or the horse, and we think that you invest in both because good jockeys and good horses work together.\n\nWe think that the best ideas are where you have a fantastic person with incredible technology that the world desperately needs.\n\nBy Sputnik ATX\u2019s standards, what shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nJoe Merrill, Partner, Sputnik ATX\n\nI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a wrong answer to that question. If you\u2019re a startup founder, you should be asking yourself if what you\u2019re doing is making the world a better place, and if it\u2019s making the world a better place, then the question is how much better.\n\nSome startups that make the world a better place may not generate many financial returns, and that\u2019s okay. There\u2019s nothing bad about that.\n\nBut as venture investors, we have a responsibility to get a return for our investors. So while those are worthy businesses, the economics don\u2019t work for venture capital.\n\nWe have to invest in companies that are making an impact where additional money and resources can go a long way in building the business and generating a return for the investors, the founders, and ultimately something really great for the customers using the service or product.\n\nWhat is your average ticket size?\n\nWe start small by giving them a $100,000 cheque, and we have an option to increase that to $500,000, but we would continue to invest in companies as they grow. We have invested millions in some of the companies in our portfolio.\n\nWe\u2019re just getting started. Right now, we\u2019re raising a $100 million follow-on fund, and we have raised over half of the money. We plan to continue to write cheques worth $5 million to $10 million for companies as they continue to grow.\n\nIs there any other African startup in your portfolio other than CribMD?\n\nCribMD is probably the second. The first was Vybe Software, and even though Vybe was based in the United States, like CribMD, most of their customers were in Africa. Vybe has an app called Leia that enables people to launch a website.\n\nIt is free, but for 99 cents a month, you can upgrade and get a much nicer package. It uses artificial intelligence to build completely unique, beautiful websites for anyone.\n\nThat company did really well in Nigeria. Lots of merchants were able to create little marketplaces where they could advertise their businesses online.\n\nHow does Sputnik ATX deal with bad investments?\n\nI hate saying bad investments because bad is kind of like this judgement where something is morally repugnant, and that\u2019s not the case. What happens is someone starts a company, and the company is generating insufficient financial returns to justify the investments, but that doesn\u2019t make them bad.\n\nIt just means that it didn\u2019t work out, and there are a couple of choices. Sometimes those companies can continue to operate because they\u2019re profitable; they\u2019re not just going to get very big.\n\nHowever, if they\u2019re losing money, and if they continue to lose money, you usually sit down with the founders, and you decide if it\u2019s a good time to shut the company down. If there\u2019s some value in the asset that another company would find valuable, you sell the asset to other companies because while you may not be able to do a lot with it, someone else might.\n\nI\u2019ll be frank, it\u2019s okay if a startup doesn\u2019t work; we expect that to happen. It\u2019s how you do it that matters. If you realise your company is not viable, you shut it down in an orderly way. What you do says a lot about the quality and the integrity of the founder.\n\nWhen founders shut things down properly, we love to invest in them because they acted with integrity.\n\nWhat industries are of most interest to Sputnik ATX?\n\nWe invest in anything that is not evil. We have a strict policy of not investing in evil. We have everything, including a company that makes nutritious doughnuts.\n\nEverybody likes doughnuts, but they\u2019re not good for your health. This was a bunch of American football players with such strict diets who worked tirelessly to figure out how to make nutritious yet delicious doughnuts.\n\nWe also have a company producing an engine that will replace the one in cars, and it\u2019s beautiful. This thing would single-handedly stop greenhouse gas emission, and Shell just announced that they are investing in that company.\n\nIt works, and in 20 years, we could all be using this product. So when we see companies with amazing technologies like these, we want to invest in them.\n\nWhat opportunities have Sputnik ATX regrettably passed on, and why?\n\nMy biggest regret is a company called FloatMe. It\u2019s in San Antonio, and we almost accepted them. We limit the number of companies that we can accept to between five and seven for each group. They were the company that just missed the cut.\n\nWe liked the founders, and we should have done it. The company has been very successful. I still love the founders. They\u2019re incredible, and I think the world of the company.\n\nIt\u2019s such an incredible service. It puts a little money into people\u2019s accounts when they are about to overdraft them. I wish we had invested, but it turns out they didn\u2019t need our money, and they\u2019ve done very well.\n\nThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m just happy to see smart people do awesome things that help other people even if we don\u2019t get to invest.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nThey can go to sputnikatx.com. They can also find me on Twitter @Austin_VC. I get and accept DMs from people.\n\nMy business partner is @Oksana_ATX. You can read all about her on our website. I also have a blog where I write about business, economics, and startups because I\u2019m an economist and an entrepreneur.\n\nI talk about Nigeria ever so often on my blog. I love Nigeria.",

Terms and conditions apply.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nPossible Twitter negotiations with the Nigerian government\n\nAndroid 12 beta 2 launch and Apple iOS 15\u2019s features\n\nTwitter reaches out to the Nigerian government for negotiations\n\nNigeria\u2019s online space has been abuzz since the government announced the suspension of microblogging and social media platform, Twitter on Friday, June 4, 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, according to Channels Television, Minister for Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, says Twitter has reached out to the government to negotiate. He made the statement on Wednesday, June 9, 2021, while addressing the State House correspondents after the Federal Executive Council meeting.\n\nThe Minister added that the suspension has been effective, saying Twitter has made significant losses since the ban.\n\nNothing from Twitter: However, the social media platform has kept mum about negotiating with the Nigerian government.\n\nBut the company, via its Public Policy account on June 5, 2021, said that the platform would \u201cwork to restore access for all those in Nigeria who rely on Twitter to communicate and connect with the world.\u201d\n\nAsk Malami? When Mohammed was questioned about the section of the law that prosecutes Nigerians who continue to use Twitter, he referred journalists to the country\u2019s Attorney General, Abubakar Malami\u2019s comment.\n\nTwitter should pay tax too: The Minister discussed the Federal Government\u2019s move to ensure social media and over-the-top (OTT) platforms \u2014 WhatsApp, Facebook, Netflix, et al. \u2014 are registered in the country and pay tax for the billions they earn.\n\n\u201cQuiz 1: How many topics did we discuss in the first edition? Mention two.\u201d\n\nOn a non-Twitter related note, Apple has announced the new features coming to its new iOS 15.\n\nThe announcement was made during Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). The event, dedicated to software, is held annually to showcase new features coming to operating systems across Apple\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nThis year\u2019s edition kicked off Monday, June 7, and will end Friday, June 11, 2021.\n\nFaceTime, a feature known to be exclusive to iOS devices, will now work outside the ecosystem; it will include options to share screens like video conferencing platform, Zoom. The new operating system will continue Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency feature that started with the previous upgrade.\n\nAnother interesting feature coming to the new iOS is Live Text. The iPhone camera will now be able to recognise text within an image. So, texts \u2014 phone numbers, words, symbols \u2014 in an image can be copied and saved.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before: While this feature is new to iOS, it bears a close resemblance to Google Lens on Android devices, which can translate and save text from an image using the camera. However, whatever upgrades Apple has introduced to this feature will be ascertained when the operating system launches officially.\n\nThere\u2019s more on Apple\u2019s WWDC here.\n\n\u201cQuiz 2: If you noticed, Emmanuel and Oluwanifemi did something different with previous Thursday editions. What was the first topic in this trend?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of Android, Google has released the second beta version of its latest operating system, Android 12. Launched Wednesday, June 9, 2021, the second version will come with more of the features promised at the Google I/O event in May.\n\nPer TechCrunch, Google will bring more beta testers on board with the Android 12 beta 2 release. They will be testing out features like the new privacy dashboard, Quick Setting toggle, and Internet Panels that make switching between Internet providers easy.\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nHow to install the developer beta of iOS 15.

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing\n\nNigeria\u2019s information minister\u2019s invitation for questioning over Twitter ban\n\nNigerian Uber and Bolt drivers\u2019 partnership with local ride-hailing companies\n\nBolt\u2019s electric tuk-tuks and e-bikes in Kenya\n\nNigeria\u2019s information minister invited for questioning over Twitter ban\n\nIn yet another twist to Nigeria\u2019s Twitter saga in Nigeria, the House of Representatives has invited the Minister for Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, to brief the house over the ban on the social network.\n\nThis is coming after widespread criticism by citizens over lawmakers\u2019 silence since the ban was announced. We even had some lawyers discuss the legality of the ban.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the resumption of plenary duties, the House set up a Committee on Communication, Justice, Information and Culture, and National Security and Intelligence.\n\nWhat has been said? The speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, ordered the Committee to investigate the legality of the Federal Government\u2019s ban and report to the house within 10 days.\n\nHe noted that the legislative body recognised the value of social media as a tool for communication and commerce in the country but insisted that it must be balanced with the need to protect national interests.\n\nExternal pressure? Various bodies, including High Commissions and Embassies of foreign nations spoke out against the Twitter ban. However, this is the first response by the country\u2019s lawmakers.\n\nUber and Bolt drivers set to partner with local companies\n\nFighting back? The National President, Professional E-Hailing Drivers and Private Owners Association (PEDPA), Mr Idris Shonuga, has announced plans by members of the body to ditch Uber and Bolt in favor of local companies, Active Rides and My Cab App.\n\nThe drivers hope that this new arrangement would improve their welfare and customer service while giving the Association a greater say in decisions affecting its members.\n\nRecall that in April 2021, riders on Uber and Bolt drivers embarked on a week long warning strike. They called on the ride-hailing companies to review prices in line with increased living expenses in the country.\n\nUber responded with a 13% price hike for its UberX offering. However, it appears that the drivers remain dissatisfied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe not enough: While it seems drivers are getting improved conditions with this new arrangement, it is not yet clear how the Association\u2019s plan to partner with the local ride-hailing companies would play out. Its success would most likely hinge on users\u2019 adoption of the two partners which are relatively unknown.\n\nGo deeper with this article: Uber, Bolt drivers move to dump ride hailing companies, partner with indigenous firms\n\nBolt unveils electric tuk-tuks in Kenya\n\nBolt Foods electric motorcycles. Source: Techish\n\nBolt has unveiled electric tuk-tuks \u2014 tricycles \u2014 and e-bicycles in Kenya. The move is geared towards eliminating the challenges associated with fluctuating fuel prices.\n\nWith this, Kenya becomes the first African country where Bolt has launched its electric bike service as it continues a trend of eco-friendly initiatives in the country.\n\nIn March 2021, the mobility startup introduced Bolt Green using electric and hybrid cars to reduce emissions during trips.\n\nFor now, only Bolt Food couriers would use these bicycles and tuk-tuks as they look to expand into other towns.\n\nThese initiatives are part of Green Plan \u2014 Bolt\u2019s global environmental strategy \u2014 which aims to reduce the company\u2019s environmental footprint by providing commuters with eco-friendly options.\n\nOur reporter, Joy Matthew, delved deeper into this story here.\n\nSME Clinic by Techpoint\n\nOne of the lessons we learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic was how technology could make a difference for small and medium enterprises.

          "title": "Scrapping of NYSC: Scapegoating Only Aggravates Our Woes \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nIt\u2019s longer news that the corporate existence of Nigeria is threatened by the unabating attacks of insurrectionists, bandits, terrorists and the aberration of unknown gunmen. Due to the helplessness of the government to curb this ugly and incessant attacks on the precious lives and property of the citizens, Nigerians are taking recourse to their primordial ethnic cocoons which decimates the Nigerian state to the threshold of near collapse.\n\nThe security conundrum has put everyone in danger. The activities of these anti-state actors have imperiled farmers, traders, students, political leaders, travelers and ofcourse corps members who are entrusted with the patriotic mandate of rendering selfless service to the motherland.\n\nConcerned Nigerians are asking what the way out of the quagmire could be. It is this existential question that has birthed a precipitous bill seeking to scrap National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). Sponsored by Awayi Abiante from Rivers State, the bill has now reached the second reading at the Green Chamber. This bill has brought NYSC to the stead to be a whipping boy for our insecurity as lawmakers debate it relevance to the nation after 48 years of existence.\n\nHon. Awaji-Inombek Abiante in the explanatory memorandum of the proposal, listed various reasons why the NYSC should be scrapped.One of the reasons, according to Abiante, is due to incessant killing of innocent corps members in some parts of the country due to banditry, religious extremism and ethnic violence.\n\nHon Abiante also gave economic exploitation of Corpers by private agencies as another reason for his bill seeking the discontinuation of the scheme as they \u201care no longer recruiting able and qualified Nigerian youths, thus relying heavily on the availability of corps members who have not been well remunerated and get relieved with impunity at the end of their service year without any hope of being gainfully employed.\u201d\n\nApart from serving in their various places of primary assignment, corps members are often deployed for key assignments such as working as ad hoc electoral staff during elections which he also explains endangers the safety of corps members since elections in Nigeria are most times volatile.\n\nIt is worthy to note that since the inception of nysc itself in 1973 the program has been trailed by waves of protest . Just so you know that the scheme has always been a bone of contention right from the day it\u2019s decree was promulgated in 1973. In the words of the scheme\u2019s founder, Gen. Yakubu Gowon \u201cthe establishment of the scheme was followed by a protest throughout the length and breadth of the country\u201d\n\nThe administration of Gen. Gowon established the NYSC with the promulgation of Decree No 24 of May 22, 1973, the objective was to ensure that Nigeria remained an indivisible entity that would be focused on sustainable development and four decades later the scheme can do better but it\u2019s relevance to the socio economic fabrics of Nigeria can be attested to by well meaning and patriotic citizens of Nigeria though not devoid of challenges.\n\nIt was the same General Yakubu Gowon who launched the famous 3Rs which are reconstruction, rehabilitation, reconciliation in order to galvanize the wartorned Nigeria after the devastating civil war the giant of Africa was plunged into between 1967 to 1970 and he found young graduates as one of the veritable tools of nation building. Reconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation should be seen as an ongoing efforts of nation building just as government is a continuous process.\n\nThe NYSC posts Corps members to cities or villages and states far from home and states of origin, where they are expected to mix with people of other tribes, social and family backgrounds where they could learn the culture of the indigenes in the place they are posted. This of course fosters mutual understanding of the country\u2019s diverse cultures and national cohesion. What if there was no NYSC?\n\nNYSC should be seen as a work in progress. The government should strengthen the scheme to ensure it meets the current socio-economic reality of our country but scrapping it because of insecurity is like a farmer throwing away his hoe because he\u2019s unable to use it. The problem is not the hoe but the farmer\u2019s inability to use it.\n\nNigeria is one of the most terrorized countries in the world and no society can thrive in an atmosphere of severe insecurity like the one in Nigeria. Government must live up to it\u2019s primary responsibility of providing security of lives and property to citizens. This is the least citizens can ever ask of any government.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSinafi Omanga is a serving corps member with the Nigerian Observer.\n\nEmail: benomanga01@gmail.com\n\n...",

          "title": "Why we are honouring Daily Times icons \u2013 Fidelis Anosike",
          "text": "Dr. Fidelis Anosike, Chief Executive Officer of Folio Holdings, publishers of the Daily Times Newspaper, has lined up activities to honour heroes of the newspaper, as part of activities designed to mark its 100-year anniversary.\n\nIn this interview, Anosike, an astute media entrepreneur who founded Folio Communications at 24, the company that went on to acquire Daily Times in 2004, explores his journey into the media industry, as well as speaks about the activities he is lining up to honour former MDs and editors of Nigeria\u2019s oldest surviving newspaper.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nYou have come a long way. You set up Folio Communications at 24. How did it all start?\n\nI will say that I started life rather early. I got into the university drawing portraits, so I am a graphic and creative artist. I graduated from the University of Benin. I still tell people that the creative industry is not just my passion, it is my job. I also did loads of self-development. I got enrolled at Harvard Business School Owner President Management course (OPM 39). So, to that extent I am a Harvard alumnus, and being at Harvard made me understand how to businesses properly.\n\nYes, at 24, I established Folio Communications, which went on to acquire Daily Times of Nigeria, the oldest surviving newspaper and noteworthy media organization in Nigeria. Since then, I have been trying to see the much I can do with the resources available to me, both access to capital and knowledge, to expand the frontiers. Besides the media, I also have investments in other areas such as water resources and renewable energy, and I am also financing some global companies on major research on mobility and renewable energy space.\n\nOn how I was able to set up a company at 24, I think it\u2019s important for us as human beings to pray for God to give us consciousness. You can get consciousness at 10, you can get consciousness at 30, you can get consciousness at 70. If you pray for the grace of God, you can get consciousness early. I think I was lucky to get consciousness early and importantly, an opportunity. So, how did I set up Folio? There is an uncle of mine who worked with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). He introduced me to the Head of Communication at the bank, a certain Mr. Bolarinwa of blessed memory, and one Mr. Amobi. They allowed me to enter for CBN creative jobs. At that time, if they want to make a Christmas or Eid cards, or something like that, they would make the bid open and whoever wins; that is if, they pick your design, you will be commissioned to do the work. I won on three occasions, and the price for each was N14,500. With that, I was able to get my office, and went on to create an ecosystem of my friends that studied graphics with me. Whenever a company needed design services, we all made design submissions and as fate often had it, one of us always won. Together we won on many occasions and got contracts from institutions like First Bank, NNPC and CBN.\n\nThat was how I was able to build up capital to go into the communication business. I created a standard for myself and my friends and became a relationship manager for them because they were all on paid jobs. Whoever made a design that was successful shared the proceeds with others. It was a case of all for one and one for all. We designed, restructured and produced all the diaries of NNPC for two years running through open and competitive bid process. We introduced Nigerian idioms into those diaries rather than white labeled ones from FT and so on, which gave it local content. This is because we felt that we should promote our own country. I am full Nigerian. I am proud of my ethnicity as an Igbo man, but this is Nigeria, our country. None of us chose to be here, but we are here all the same, and we must make our country work.\n\nWhen exactly was Folio Communications established?\n\nThat was in 1991. In 2004, Daily Times was put up for sale. Before then, they had tried to sell the shares through public offer via the stock exchange. But it failed, so BPE resorted to Core Investor Sale which refers to a situation where whoever buys it, takes full management control. Folio Communications was already a thriving communication company, and so felt that we needed a media voice and had to create a media company. Long before then, I was already involved in some creative work for ThisDay, and that was how I met Chief Dele Momodu. I had a lot of background knowledge. I reasoned that if I had to make my dream known, I needed a media voice. Therefore, I entered the bid as the singular company involved, others were consultants and consortiums. We were pre-qualified, and made a deposit of $10,000 and put in our technical bid. We were number one. We actually scored 81 per cent. The terrain was known to me. I learnt under Dele Momodu and Nduka Obaigbena; these are men who are far ahead of their time.\n\nI\u2019m sure that until Dele celebrated his 60th birthday, people may have thought he was 90, same as Nduka. They are my pillars, including Okagbue Aduba. About how I was able to understand Nigeria and how it works, I connected with their energy which was infectious. At that point I already had $1 million for the bid bond. This is a security for your integrity, and so no bank will lend you money for a bid bond. You can only finance it with equity. It is money you lose if at the end of the day, you did not pay the bid price. Daily Times Bid Bond then was N100 million. Like I said, they had tried selling it via shares, hoping that people will buy and someone will acquire the majority share, but nobody came in. This was because the media industry in Nigeria is not bankable; it has not been restructured so it doesn\u2019t have capital flowing into it. We bid and attracted N1.25 billion into the media industry as far back as 2004. Our first bid was, I think N327 million. Our competitor, bid N800million in their first bid. That was N500 million above us. But we knew the bid was in two rounds. Our second-round bid was N1.25 billion, while our competitor\u2019s second round bid was N1.05 billion, so we won.\n\nWhen we bought and took over Daily Times, its liability was N1.9 billion. The assets were N2.3 billion. The enterprise value was N700 million or slightly above that. We bought Daily Times at almost twice the price the government was hoping to get. It is on record, and I was about 35 years old then. Nobody would have given an \u2018Igbo boy\u2019 a chance to buy Daily Times. I am a testimony that things can work in Nigeria if you believe. I had no godfather, only by faith and audacity of hope.\n\nThe Folio Media Group (FMG) has come a long way. Today, it has access to the technology space and we are also doing consolidated media offering to clients. the Folio Investment and Trading Company (FITC) is an investment company focused on media, creative and cultural industry investment and innovation. We also have as part of the group, Folio Media and Creative Academy (FMCA), which is working in tandem with relevant authorities to train journalists and creative industry practitioners. The aim is to train 50,000 in those key fields in five years.\n\nDoes the Creative African eXchange perform the same function?\n\nNo, that is Folio Media and creative Academy. The Creative African eXchange (CAX.caxafrica.com) is part of the Folio Media Group. It is part of the initiative we are trying to use to consolidate the continental space of the creative and cultural industry.\n\nCan you shed more light on 1st October and Miss Nigeria as offshoots of Folio Media Group?\n\n1st October Limited is a publishing company that we set up in 2007 to publish the birth of Nigeria. It has evolved overtime because we have done over 10 different publications on Nigeria and state governments. It also went ahead, in 2014, to give birth to a global public perception movement for Nigeria called \u2018Nigeria, Our Heritage.\u2019 This was launched at the Kennedy Centre, and it was the first ever African event at the Kennedy Centre, Washington DC on the sideline of Obama African heads of Government meeting. What we are trying to do with 1st October and Nigeria, Our Heritage, is to see how we can transition the love of Nigerians to love of Nigeria. We saw a gap there in terms of country branding. We want to create a platform that will enable us to use Nigerians, specially those in the Diaspora, to drive the love for country. This is important because at the end of the day, other countries spend millions of dollars in country branding. Even the United States spends up to $240 million annually to brand their country. You see, once you are in Europe as a Nigerian, you take a 30 per cent cut. If Aliko Dangote walks into an office in New York, and says he is a Nigerian, he takes a 30 per cent minus. That is huge! That\u2019s one of the reasons our national development is stunted; because our brand, the brand Nigeria, has so much deteriorated. There are many reasons: political instability, military government of thirty plus years, advanced fee fraud, imperialistic gang up and many more. So you can see the reason it has happened over the years.\n\nSo we as Nigerians, we doing what we can to change this for the future because people only do business with those they can trust. Without that trust, we cannot have foreign direct investment coming to Nigeria. You can have $10 billion like in Lagos State, and you are happy, but you could have $100 billion. You can begin to see how that affects national security, the issue of banditry and so on. The problem is image. Nobody wants to do business with anybody that is dirty. If you wear dirty clothes, you become non attractive. There are options; people can sit down in New York and put their money in Scottish windows or savings accounts and make returns. But if you want people to come from China or America, you must present yourself in a way that will make them to fly in first before realising that there are challenges. Of course, there are challenges everywhere. Afghanistan is probably receiving more investment than Nigeria even as they are beset by terrorism. So it is a matter of how you package yourself as a country. Nigerians must help to improve the whole because when the whole collapses, the part, which may be fantastic, will automatically collapse. That is what 1st October is doing. It is a big project. We just recently partnered with the Nigeria Diaspora Commission, and in October, we will start an immersion programme, which is going to bring 100 young Nigerians from all the Ivy League schools in the Diaspora to Nigeria. We will train them on issues of national development and deploy them to about 100 companies, and expose them to what Nigerians are doing right. We know that a lot of things are going wrong, but let\u2019s amplify the right ones and let\u2019s also inculcate this into the young people. So, it is going to be a deliberate effort to raise 1000 people young people that can become advocates for the country. This is what 1st October is all about. This is a positive national development platform.\n\nWe have also remodeled Miss Nigeria to become more than just beauty pageant. It\u2019s more of female empowerment platform. It was founded in 1957. It gave life to all other pageants in Nigeria. Our very first Miss Nigeria is still alive at 86, Chief Mrs Grace Oyelude. We shall also institute a commemorative lecture in her honour as a DTN icon. Every Miss Nigeria is an ambassador of the Green Girl Company, with projects like Green Dignity Kit (GDK) and Green Girl Academy, among others. Nigeria is our country, nobody chose it; it chose us and we have to make it work. We must not use all the energy we have to think of how to break the country. What is happening today is a consequence of long-time inaction; of doing the wrong things, and not having ideas for doing the right thing. Most of the governors were busy building airports they don\u2019t need, but neglected the primary schools that are supposed to train people that would shape the future. They neglected education, and dwelt on less important things. So when you lose empathy, you start approaching things from the middle. That explains why conspiracy theory comes in.\n\nWhat attracted you to the Daily Times and what has been your experience running the company?\n\nDaily Times has huge pedigree. The company was created by Adeyemo Alakija and the London Mirror Group. It went on to have Dr. Ernest Ikoli, Alhaji Babatunde Jose, Amb. Dele Cole, Aremu Segun Osoba, Chief Tunji Oseni, Prince Tony Momoh, Dr. Yemi Ogunbiyi, Chief Innocent Oparadike, Dr. Onyema Ugochukwu, Chief Sam Amuka Pemu among others. The Daily Times was the biggest mouthpiece in the country. At one time, Alhaji Jose was asked if he would run for president, and he said he was already chairman of Daily Times. That was how big the Daily Times was. It was indeed the fourth estate of the realm. Because I did appreciate the enormity of what I took upon my shoulder when I took it over, the commercial problems arising from property didn\u2019t weigh me down. I am not a property person, the only personal property I own in Abuja was bought with my money. No government or minister can claim to have given me any land.\n\nWhen we took over Daily Times, there were about 400 staff in the company. Money from the government was not coming anymore, so we had to restructure. We had to downsize, and fought with the union for two years. During the fight, the business was closed down. Then Hallmark Bank, which loaned us the money, took over the company. We didn\u2019t recover the company through legal means until September 2007. So, I acquired the company in 2004, it was hijacked by Hallmark Bank. Everyone was interested in the assets, but no one was thinking about the liabilities. We had to go to court. There was this man, Mr Adrian Wood, one time CEO at MTN who joined us at Folio Communications. His mandate was to revive Daily Times, and put it on the same pedestal as the New York Times. He employed people from all walks of life; both Nigerians and other Africans to make it a model. We knew that without a dominant and strong media organization in Nigeria, the issues of national development will fail. That is why in America, they have Fox, CNN, etc., based on their ideological beliefs, and tied to politics.\n\nWithout a strong media, there will be fragmentation, and that explains why the masses don\u2019t have a voice. We wanted to make Daily Times what it used to be. Thereafter, all sorts of people started taking us to court. All these people came from third parties because Folio acquired Daily Times alone. In the typical Nigerian context, everything is contentious, not to talk of when you acquire a national asset. We adapted to many things in the course of all these.\n\nWe have continued to push. The first Times Heroes Awards [email protected] in 2017 was massively supported. We interacted with many governors in the process. See what Nyesom Wike of Rivers State is doing today. We are proud of him. We saw the character the man brought with him to the office from day one, and gave him an award. We gave award to people like Yahaya Bello of Kogi State. You know, sometimes you have to encourage people with potential or you lose them.\n\nWhy did you retain the name Daily Times after acquiring it? Is it because of its influence?\n\nNo, it is not because of the influence. Daily Times owns the largest archives. It is 95 years now, and will be 100 years in five years. How many media companies in Nigeria are 100 years old? Daily Times is beyond a newspaper company. It was here before Nigeria. It created the Nigeria Stock Exchange. It has produced two or three state governors. It is a national development company.\n\nDaily Times will mark 100 years in five years. You have lined up events to mark the anniversary. Can you tell us about that?\n\nYes, in the run up to our 100 anniversary, we have created an event to celebrate icons of Daily Times \u2013 our heroes; Times Heroes. The first one that we have designed is for Ambassador Dele Cole. We are hoping to do these in their states of origin. Ambassador Cole\u2019s event will be held in Port Harcourt. It will be a two-day event. On day one, we are going to train about 500 journalists in the area. On day two, there will be a proper Lecture where the likes of Dr. Mrs Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Dr Adewunmi Adeshina and other distinguished scholars and technocrats of Nigerian origin will be invited as Keynote Speakers. There is nothing like making impact in your home state. We have lined up about 15 of our former heroes. The first one will be in Rivers State because that is where Amb. Cole comes from. We don\u2019t want to keep celebrating people when they are dead; we want to celebrate them while they are alive, and learn something from them. We will talk about national development and the role the media play.\n\nIn Nigeria, we let out heroes die without transferring knowledge. We need to have teach History in Nigeria because if you don\u2019t know where you are coming from, you won\u2019t know where you are going. We must return history to our schools. And that is what we are doing at Folio Communications. It is important therefore, that we get this first one right.\n\nSecondly, we are developing a book, which Dr. Onyema Ugochukwu will co edit with Chief Tunji Okegbola, DTN Librarian of over 40 years, to be launched at our 100-year celebration. Amb. Dele Cole proved himself to be an epitome of politics without bitterness, media game changer and diplomat per excellence. He created the legacy of The Guardian and revived the legacy of Daily Times, and when the government was becoming overbearing, he created a new legacy at The Guardian.\n\nWe are also planning for the First Onyema Ugochukwu\u2019s lecture, which will hold on 9th November, 2021. We will celebrate Ernest Ikoli, the first ever indigenous and founding editor of the Daily Times. We are also looking at celebrating Allahaji Babatunde Jose, Aremu Segun Osoba, Dr Yemi Ogunbiyi, Chief Sam Amuka-Pemu, Mrs Grace Oyelude \u2013 first miss Nigeria, Prince Tony Momoh, among others. Our goal between now and the next five years, is to institute a minimum of 10 lectures. Each of them will be in respective home state of the icon, most of them and their governors have accepted. Indeed, they are all excited about it. We will send a letter to Governor Wike believing he will be gracious enough to accept and host the 1st Amb Patrick Dele Cole lecture.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari, has said that the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has businesses everywhere, adding that his government had mobilised and would continue to mobilise the military and the police to go after them.\n\nBuhari who spoke in in a pre-recorded interview on Arise News Television, categorized all Igbo People as IPOB members, noting that despite having businesses everywhere, nobody is disturbing the group.\n\nHe said some leaders of the South South, had approached him to say they have no business with IPOB, which according to him, means that they will be encircled.\n\n\u201cIPOB is just like a dot in a circle and they have nowhere to turn to. They are spread everywhere and they have investments and properties everywhere and in other areas,\u201d Buhari said.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know what they are doing. How we will handle them is to mobilise the police and the military to go after them. I\u2019m happy that some South-South leaders came to me and said they have nothing to do with IPOB, so they will be encircled\u201d\n\nBuhari also contradicted himself while trying to defend his administration\u2019s nepotism and lopsided appointments.\n\nSpeaking on the general perception that his administration had concentrated appointments in the North than Southern Nigeria, the president said \u201cYou better get the list of our civil servants if you think there are no people from the South East. There are people from the South East, but they know they have to go through the mill.\u201d\n\nOn the failure of his administration to adequately include people from the South East and the entire southern region in his government, especially into security services and Ministries Departments and Agencies (MDAs), he said: \u201cPeople who have been there for 18 years\u2026they trained in Zaria or in Abeokuta, they climbed through the ranks and because they found [themselves] under all the circumstances, the crisis and everything, and they gradually rise to that status and you think [I will] just pick somebody just to balance up? These positions have to be earned. There are people who have been there for 10-15 years.\u201d\n\nHe added that geographical balance should not be the basis for appointing security chiefs.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t join, you\u2019re not forced to join, but when you join, you go through the rigmarole\u2026and you learn by the system,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the massive retirement of major generals from the army over their subordinate as Chief of Army Staff, he said: \u201cDo you know where he (Major General Farouk Yahaya) was serving before he became the Chief of Army Staff? You can\u2019t just pick somebody because he is wearing seniority (sic). You will put somebody who has suffered with the soldiers, they know him, he fought with them and so on. I tell you the truth, on individual basis, I have forgotten some of these chaps, I don\u2019t know them.\u201d\n\nAsked if years of operational experience did not matter in appointing the service chiefs, Buhari said \u201cIt is, [but] for the soldiers to be effectively led, it must be somebody they know\u2026\u201d\n\nThe president also defended his government\u2019s decision to spend $1.9 billion on a rail project to the Niger Republic, saying he has family members there.\n\nAccording to him, his government\u2019s decision to build rail lines from Kano to the country was to allow his Nigerien relatives easily have access to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI have cousins, family members, etc., in Niger Republic. I shouldn\u2019t just cut them off,\u201d Mr Buhari said.\n\nHe also cited transportation of oil from the neighbouring country to Nigeria and job creation as other reasons for constructing the rail line.",

Josiah Haroun, to revisit the matter is with a view to reversing the clampdown order placed on the security organisation to give room for proper steps that would be democratic and in conformity with the law of the land.\n\nThe Coalition, in a signed statement said, the outrage occasioned by the NSA\u2019s order was borne out of the peoples observations that, \u201cthe order contravene some rules of law and democratic ethos,\u201d admonishing that, \u201cin a civilised clime like ours, things are expected to be done in line with democratic norms and democratic principles.\u201d\n\nThe NGO was reacting to the declaration that the NATFORCE is an illegal security outfit by the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major-General Monguno (Rtd), an action the coalition view as \u201chasty, pre-emptive and undemocratic.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Oduduwa Republic: Agitators To Protest June 12 \u2014 Daily Times Nigeria\n\nThe statement reads further: \u201cit appears undemocratic and hasty because it is in the public domain that the National Assembly, the two legislative houses of the land are already in possession of a Bill on the matter for deliberation. The deliberation has reached the second reading stage. One expects that the office of the NSA should exercise patience till the end of the legislative efforts before striking. The action, against this background, to us, is pre-emptive, hasty and undemocratic.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, the action, which came after a court of competent jurisdiction has given the outfit a clean slate of health by declaring it legal, appears against the rule of law. It is expected that, the action should not have come before the vacation of the court verdict said to have been given since 2013.\n\n\u201cWe should quickly add at this juncture that, the Coalition has no vested interest in the NATFORCE floated by Dr. Baba Mohammed beside the general national interest on how the country would be secure, our concern is the setback the clamp down on it could cause for the fight against insecurity in the land.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the almost 300, 000 youth it would clear off the streets and the labour market through employment is of great satisfaction to us. And the retention of that population on the streets and in the labour market when the outfit is banned from operation is also, equally of great concern to us.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, the Coalition suggested that, such an outfit and others like it should be supported and assisted to contribute their quotas to augment the efforts of the authorities in the fight against all forms of security challenges in the country, asserting that, doing so with patriotic zeal would be of great relief to all and sundry.",

These range from pain, swelling at the site of the inoculation, to body pains and nausea.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, 52 cases of moderate to severe incidents of AEFI have been reported. These presented as fever, vomiting, diarrhea headaches, dizziness and allergic reactions.\n\n\u201cFive states have the highest records of the AEFI namely: Kaduna (970) Cross River (859), Yobe (541), Kebbi (511), and Lagos (448),\u201d he disclosed.\n\nAccording to Shuaib, as of today, April 16th, 1,071,346, representing 53.2% of the eligible persons targeted with the AstraZeneca vaccine had been administered their first dose in this vaccination phase.\n\nHe said the data were based on reports received from states through the Electronic Management of Immunization Data (EMID) system only and did not take into account vaccinations that were not yet captured in the system.\n\n\u201cWhat this number means is that these are the people who have their information already uploaded on our data base, while others are awaiting upload, potentially due to network problems and the high traffic of those coming in to take their shots at the same time.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to optimize our registration and immunization data system, we also encourage the state teams to deploy the most suitable internet service for their locations in order to speed up the data entry process, so that we can have the actual number of vaccinated people at any given time,\u201d he said.\n\nShuaib added that in many states, the inoculation of frontline health workers had been completed and that they had begun offering vaccination to the elderly, particularly those that were 65 years and above.\n\n\u201cWe are glad to be able to progress quickly offer immunization to more members of the community.\n\n\u201cOur rollout has been marked by safety, efficiency, best practice, and speed. The National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) and its development partners, have a platform of Senior Supervisors that engage in daily evening review meetings to determine the status of the COVID-19 vaccine implementation in all States & the FCT.\u201d",

At about 2:30 p.m. the rain and wind became heavier just as the IGP was being introduced.\n\nAs soon as the National Anthem was over the rain increased in intensity while the raging wind pulled down canopies covering both journalists and senior police officers.\n\nBoth the police and journalists scampered for safety.\n\nAt that point the IGP and AIG Zone Two Lagos, Johnson Kokumor, as well as AIG Force CID Galandi, CP Odumosu, and other senior officers rushed out \u2013 and then the canopy collapsed.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria, NAN, reports that the IGP arrived at the Command at about 1:40 p.m. and was only able to take the National Anthem before the downpour started.\n\nThe wind blew up all the canopies erected. This development forced the IGP and other senior officers to run to the conference room while others and journalists sought safety in available.\n\nThe IGP on arrival in Lagos at 10:00 a.m., had visited Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu at the Lagos House, Marina, and the Oba of Lagos before coming to the command headquarters at about 1.40 p.m.\n\nOn arrival at the command, he met briefly with some senior officers at the conference room before coming to address other senior officers, including Area commanders, DPOs, squadron commanders before the rain started.\n\nIGP Baba later briefed the press, where he pointed out the areas that needed to be improved on by his men.\n\nHe listed them to include: crowd control, which he said should be done by policemen according to the norms of discharging their responsibilities.\n\n\u201cThere is the need to also control the use of arms. Officers should lecture their men that once they are assigned rifles, there is a time and reason for their use. You need to guard them and use them responsibly.\n\n\u201cWe must also be civil in discharging our responsibilities. Never should we allow our stations to be overrun to the extent that we will not be able to handle situations because of cowardice or lack of professionalism,\u201d he said.\n\nThe police chief added that his mission in Lagos was to familiarise himself with and address officers of the Command on how the Nigeria Police will be administered under his leadership.\n\nBaba said that there was also the need to talk to police officers that they had a duty to perform which should be done while some things were taken cognisance of.\n\n\u201cIt is good to remind ourselves of the enormous task of policing in a democratic system.\n\n\u201cWe have not got all we need to discharge our duties in terms of welfare, logistics, and equipment. But with the available limited resources, we will do our jobs with more dedication and professionalism.\n\n\u201cI want to congratulate us that the government and the people are taking cognisance of our duty.\n\n\u201cWe have the support of every Nigerian like never before and it has become obvious that we are neccessary in maintaining equilibrium,\u201d he said.\n\nThe IGP also urged senior Police officers to motivate their men through rewards and sanctions.\n\nAccording to him, rewards will motivate the men while sanctions will serve as deterrent to others.\n\nThe police boss said the Police was beginning to witness increase in its personnel, improvement in logistics and welfare and that recruitment was ongoing.\n\nHe added that the police was also taking delivery of some tools from the Police Trust Fund and that the request of the Lagos Commissioner of Police, CP Hakeem Odumosu, for equipment was noted.\n\nBaba added that the police authorities would focus on training and retraining of policemen so that they would be able to discharge their duties with professionalism.\n\n\u201cWe need to restore our professional calling by way of discharging our responsibilities through technology based practices and go by the enabling laws,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that the police was also working toward the rehabilitation and the reconstruction of barracks and effective housing scheme project which would serve as retirement homes for officers after service.\n\nHakeem Odumosu, the commissioner of Police in Lagos, CP said that Lagos State had been calm and relatively peaceful as crimes and criminality had been suppressed.\n\nHe stressed that the command was able to arrest 2,228 suspects connected with offences ranging from armed robbery, cultism, murder, hooliganism, and defilement/rape in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201c87 arms and 129 ammunition of various calibres were recovered. In addition, 36 stolen vehicles were recovered by the command within the period under review.\u201d\n\nOdumosu solicited the assistance of the IGP in the rehabilitation of Police facilities that were burnt during the #EndSARS protests.\n\nHe stressed that the damaged facilities had affected the operations of the Command in tackling crime.\n\n\u201cWe lost six personnel. 16 Police stations and 13 Police posts were set ablase then. Similarly 106 Police personnel were injured while 62 patrol vehicles were burnt and some others vandalised,\u201d he said.",

Tarel was quickly arrested after the swipe Tuesday, which caught Macron in the face with an audible thwack as the French leader was greeting a crowd in the region.\n\nTarel acknowledged hitting the president with a \u201crather violent\u201d slap. \u201cWhen I saw his friendly, lying look, I felt disgust, and I had a violent reaction,\u201d he told the court. \u201cIt was an impulsive reaction\u2026 I was surprised myself by the violence.\u201d\n\nWhile he said he and his friends had considered bringing an egg or a cream pie to throw at the president, he said they dropped the idea \u2014 and insisted that the slap wasn\u2019t premeditated.\n\n\u201cI think that Emmanuel Macron represents the decline of our country,\u201d he said, without explaining what he meant.\n\nTarel told the court that he supported the yellow vest economic protest movement that shook Macron\u2019s presidency in 2019. He told investigators that he held right- or ultra-right political convictions without being a member of a party or group, according to the prosecutor\u2019s office.\n\nThe charge of violence against a person invested with public authority is punishable by up to 3 years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of 45,000 euros ($54,000).\n\nMacron wouldn\u2019t comment Thursday on the trial, but insisted that \u201cnothing justifies violence in a democratic society, never.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not such a big deal to get a slap when you go toward a crowd to say hello to some people who were waiting for a long time,\u201d he said in an interview with broadcaster BFM-TV. \u201cWe must not make that stupid and violent act more important than it is.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the president added, \u201cwe must not make it banal, because anyone with public authority is entitled to respect.\u201d\n\nAnother man arrested in the ruckus that followed the slap, identified by the prosecutor as Arthur C., will be judged at a later date, in 2022, for illegal possession of weapons.\n\nThe prosecutor\u2019s office said as well as finding weapons, police who searched the home of Arthur C. also found books on the art of war, a copy of Adolf Hitler\u2019s manifesto \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d and two flags, one symbolizing Communists and another of the Russian revolution.\n\nNeither Tarel nor Arthur C., also 28, had police records, the prosecutor said.\n\nVideos showed Macron\u2019s attacker slapping the French leader\u2019s left cheek and his bodyguards pushing the man away during a quick meet-and-greet with members of the public, who were kept back behind traffic barriers in the winemaking town of Tain-l\u2019Hermitage.\n\nThe attacker was heard to cry out \u201cMontjoie!

          "text": "Onicha Ugbo indigene, Eze Asia has disowned a purported voice conversation with Azuka Jebose on Idumuje Ugboko crisis.\n\nSpeaking from Turkey where he resides, Asia dismissed the voice notes in circulation by Azuka as fake and labeled him serial blackmailer\n\nBelow is a recorded voice message along with transcript of Asia\u2018s rejoinder disclaiming any audio chat with Azuka.\n\n\u201cThe recorded voice sent to social media and everywhere, I was not the one who recorded it. Azuka Jebose did it, because the first time I traveled down here (Turkey) was after three days he called me on phone.\n\n\u201cHe was asking me some certain things \u2013 how they went to Ugboko; how they killed somebody from Kogi or something like that; asking me how somebody died in swimming pool; asking how they killed Onicha Ugbo people and I was there. I replied him. I said Azuka, you are a very useless man. How do you think they will kill an Onicha Ugbo man when I am working with Hon. Prince Ned Nwoko and I will keep quite?\n\n\u201cBut he said that they said Ned always sends us. I said you said they said, is he a military man? And that if people are telling you things concerning Ned and you are writing it and you did not verify, you are wasting your time; that everybody is aware; that you are asking me that during the time of Ugboko crisis we mobilised our men to go there and destroy. I said Azuka, bros, it\u2019s like you want enough insult\u2026you are a useless man. During the time of the crisis at Ugboko, I was in the hospital, lying down in the hospital.\n\n\u201cThis young man you are asking me that we should blackmail and let\u2019s plan together and write against him, that if not for this man I would have been a dead man by now. If Ned did not spend money on me during the time I was lying down at the hospital, he spent nothing less than N5million\u2026concerning my leg issue.\n\n\u201cYou are asking me now to give you information. Somebody in the hospital, can I fly in the hospital to come tell you what happened in Ugboko; am I (a) witch? If something happened in Ugboko, I was not aware. The way they told you was the way I heard it. Before you write against somebody you have to verify well. Like the way you are Azuka Jebose, somebody will come and meet me because I am from Onitcha Ugbo, because I know you, I should come and tell them bad things about you; what will I tell them?\n\n\u201cOkay you want me to start telling you things about Ned, like what you said that you want to nail Ned. You want to destroy his political career; that you want to do many things. Has Ned ever one day called me to go and kill somebody? Ned cannot send me to go and kill somebody\u2026 I am not a thug and he is not using me as a thug.\n\n\u201cThis young man you are accusing, if not because of Ned I wouldn\u2019t have been here (Turkey) today. He was the one who assisted me with money to leave the country. So what do you want me to tell you about him? You were asking me that somebody died in the swimming pool and how can I be from Onicha Ugbo and such thing happened.\n\n\u201cI said thank God you said I am from Onicha Ugbo and you now feel that I am from Onicha Ugbo and they will kill my own brother in my presence and I will keep quiet; that you are a stupid man. You were asking me about Prince Nonso. I told him, stop putting mouth in things that do not concern you. Nonso and Ned are brothers. The day two of them will settle none of you will be there. Steer clear of a matter you don\u2019t know. I have no business in Ugboko because I am not from Ugboko.\n\n\u201cYou were asking me how did they kill somebody; I was not aware because I was at the hospital. Those people telling you what to write still go and meet them to tell you what to write. By the way, how did you get my number? You were telling me to forget about that one that we should work.\n\n\u201cWhat work?. Working together to blackmail my boss, a man who saved my life; a man who has spent a lot of money on me? That if not for the man Ned Nwoko I would have been a dead man by now. If not for Ned I would not have travelled out. How many youths from Onitcha Ugbo did you help? You said you are a big man, how does it affect me?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know you to start with. I only hear about your name. I don\u2019t know you and I don\u2019t want to know you. So stop telling me that I should come and write against my boss. Because I did not accept what you told me, the next thing, you moved to go and manipulate my name to write against me with my voice. But anything you are doing, God is watching you. God will bear witness\n\n\u201cI will be the last person in this life, this world, that will fight against Ned. Ned has never one day treated me bad. If not for the young man I wouldn\u2019t have been alive today. So you want to spoil my name. You want to destroy my life; you are destroying your life, not me.\n\n\u201cThe voice note you sent to people, I have received it. Thank you very much. But you will also remember that everybody has evidence. Everything you said about Ned was recorded. I reserved my comment for now, till then. May God keep us alive; but anybody planning evil for my life or against my family, evil will go back to that person. I never one day planned evil against anybody. If I have offended someone I will be the one to meet the person and say I am sorry. I work on my own; I don\u2019t look for trouble.\n\n\u201cTelling me I should come and write against my Oga, what am I going to tell you. Has he sent me one day to go and destroy? Has he told me to go and do something stupid? What am I going to tell you? A good man, a man of all people. Somebody who is trying to help the community. You are not from there. You are destroying their own community. Go back to your own town. That was what I told you.\n\nYou were asking me about Prince Nonso. Does he know me? The prince knows it was police who arrested him. You were asking me how did we carry prince. Who is the prince? Have I ever one day called Ugboko youths to come out? Have they ever seen me fighting in Ugboko? What am I going to write; something I know or something I don\u2019t know? I will never wish Ned Nwoko evil because he always wished me good luck.\u201d",

          "text": "The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has commenced continuous capacity building of its personnel across its Commands and Units on safety measures, as part of effort to avert further air mishaps.\n\nThe Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao made this disclosure while declaring open the 2021 Mobility Command Safety Seminar held in Abuja.\n\nRepresented by the Managing Director, Nigerian Air Force Investment Limited (NAFIL) Air Vice Marshal Emmanual Wonah, the CAS that the seminar is specifically focused on the enhancement of safety in the conduct of air operations.\n\nHe noted that the timing could not have been more appropriate, considering recent unfortunate occurrences that have impugned the flight safety records of the NAF.\n\nAir Marshal Amao who was also the Special Guest of Honour at the occasion said: \u201cI am personally enthused by the thematic focus of the Seminar, which is: \u2018Managing Adverse Weather Conditions for Safer Air Operations in the NAF\u2019. This is because adverse weather is a natural phenomenon that we cannot wish away or control. In extreme cases, it poses very grave threats and danger to flight operations. All we can do as aviators, is to manage these \u201cmanifestations of mother nature\u201d, for the safe and effective conduct of our flight operations. Therefore, a thorough knowledge of weather patterns and trends, as well as the characteristic features of prevailing weather conditions on our flight routes can facilitate a pilot\u2019s quick and accurate decision making for mission accomplishment\u201d.\n\nHe further explained that, \u201cSeminars of this nature afford us opportunities to take stock and appraise our safety procedures for enhanced operational efficiency. It is also gratifying to note that the holding of this Seminar is in line with my Vision of \u2018enhancing and sustaining critical airpower capabilities required for joint force employment in pursuit of national security imperatives\u2019 and is particularly geared towards updating the knowledge base of personnel towards producing thoroughly skilled and professional airmen in fulfilment of one of the key drivers of my Vision which focuses on the \u2018pursuit of purposeful training and human capacity development\u201d.\n\nHe implored participants, as safety managers, to imbibe the salient points that would emanate from this Seminar to improve safety consciousness in their respective units.\n\n\u201cI expect the discussions at this Seminar to be open, frank and incisive. We must use the medium to bring all safety concerns to the fore and professionally deliberate on them in order to proffer realistic and lasting solutions to our flight safety issues. The resolutions at this Seminar are therefore expected to be articulated towards making the NAF a safer, more effective and efficient instrument of National Power,\u201d he concluded.\n\nIn his opening remarks the Air Officer Commanding Mobility Command, Air Vice Marshal Aliyu Bello said the idea of the Seminar was conceived after the unfortunate fatal accident of 21 May 2021, which claimed the lives of our very senior colleagues and threw the entire nation into mourning.\n\nHe said: \u201cConsidering the potential role that adverse weather may have played in the accident, it became necessary for us, in Mobility Command, to create a forum, such as this, where we can draw from the knowledge and experiences of our senior pilots, some of whom are retired, to educate our young and upcoming pilots on the practical means of managing prevailing adverse weather conditions in furtherance of safe flight operations in the NAF.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we are having this Seminar today, is indicative of our collective resolve to embrace continuous training to promote a robust safety culture as a veritable tool for preserving NAF\u2019s valued assets and the lives of our personnel. It is through such preservation that we can also \u2018Foster a Disciplined Workforce Essential for Combat Readiness\u2019 as one of the drivers to achieving the Chief of the Air Staff\u2019s Vision for the NAF\u201d.\n\nHe added that the Mobility Command intends to constantly update its personnel towards upholding best global practices in the safe and professional conduct of airlift operations and other ground duties.\n\nEarlier the Command had conducted a safety sensitization seminar, which focused on domestic safety of its personnel and members of their families.",

You have to pass through the ranks. You cannot just pick someone just because he is wearing a uniform with a senior rank. You pick someone who has worked with the soldiers on the field, whom they know and trust\u201d.\n\nIn the case of several Army Generals billed for forced retirement over the appointment of a new Army Chief, the President said: \u201cDo you know where he was serving before he became Chief of Army Staff? Maiduguri in Operation Lafiya Dole.\n\n\u201cYou look at the NNPC, you look at the military, people who have been there for 15 or 10 years, they trained in Zaria or in Abeokuta and they came through the ranks. They served under all the circumstances and crises, and they gradually rose to the status and you think we will just pick someone just to balance up? It has to be earned\u201d.\n\nOn his controversial tweet on treating \u201ctrouble makers in the language they understand\u201d, he insisted that \u201cwe will organize the military and the police to pursue them. That is what we can do, and we will do it\u201d.\n\nRefusing to comment on the Twitter ban controversy, Buhari simply said \u201cthat (Twitter) I will give to myself\u201d.\n\nThe President further argued that corruption is not being swept under the carpet in his administration as being speculated, stressing that \u201cNigerians have being unfair to him\u201d.\n\nOn allegations of building infrastructures from Northern Nigeria into Niger, Buhari insisted that it will be good for Nigeria, as Niger would now prefer to carry their products through Nigeria instead of Benin.\n\n\u201cHow many neighbours we have? You have to carry your neighbours along so you don\u2019t be in trouble. If we had not being in a good relationship with Niger, Chad and Cameroon, Boko Haram would have finished us,\u201d he added.\n\nSounding more threatening, Buhari said the North West would receive his fire-power very soon. \u201cI am convinced we have done well in the North East and in the South South. But I am being overwhelmed by the North West, but they will have it soon,\u201d Buhari threatened.\n\nBuhari apparently referring to youths in the South East, advised leaders at the state and local government levels to \u201ctell their youths that if they want jobs, they should behave themselves, because no one will invest in an insecure environment\u201d.\n\nHe also called for deliberate synergy between the Nigerian Customs and the Nigerian Immigration Service to fight the persistent trend of smuggling of petroleum products across Nigerian borders.\n\nWhile stating that he will continue to convince Nigerians that he doing well, President Buhari noted that he would retire back to his farm in Daura to take care of his cows after retirement from the Villa in 2023.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari Thursday in Lagos reiterated that his directive to security agencies, to shoot any person or persons found illegally wielding AK-47s and other assault weapons, remains in place.\n\nThe President also vowed that his administration will act firmly and decisively \u2018\u2018against any and all persons fomenting or carrying out attacks on our Police Force and other security personnel.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe President spoke at the handing over of security equipment by the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu to the Lagos State Police Command during his one-day official visit to the State.\n\nPresident Buhari warned that \u2018\u2018a nation that turns its Police personnel and infrastructure into targets of violence and destruction is a nation on the path of self-destruction.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018As Commander-in-chief, my primary responsibility remains the security of the country and the safety of all citizens. Despite the many challenges we are facing, I want Nigerians to rest assured that we will secure this country.\n\n\u2018\u2018We will secure our infrastructure, our highways, our communities, and our forests, and we will secure the lives of our people,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nREAD ALSO: Maritime Crimes: Buhari Inaugurates New Security Assets To Combat Piracy\n\nThe President told members of the Nigeria Police that as the government strives to improve their welfare and capacity, the citizens equally had expectations from them.\n\n\u2018\u2018First let me commend the Inspector-General of Police and the entire Force for the recent efforts to restore peace to troubled parts of the country.\n\n\u2018\u2018I have charged the Inspector-General to leave no stone unturned in rebuilding the morale of his officers and men, especially in the aftermath of the mindless violence associated with the EndSARS protests, as well as the recent spate of attacks on Police Stations in some parts of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nCommending the Lagos Governor on the newly acquired security equipment and assets, the President noted that it would go a long way in boosting the morale of the Police, and further enhance their capacity to fight crime and combat criminality.\n\n\u2018\u2018This is even more touching in the light of the unwarranted violence that ensued in the wake of the ENDSARS protests last October, which saw the security architecture in Lagos State being severely damaged,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President added that it was commendable that Lagos State, the Centre of Excellence, has shown a truly resilient spirit, in the face of the massive destruction it suffered last October.\n\n\u2018\u2018You did not allow yourselves to be deterred by the severe setback; instead you have bounced back and are now boldly rebuilding the confidence of residents and investors in the State.\n\n\u2018\u2018I acknowledge the initiative taken to kick-start the rebuilding process, through the establishment of the Lagos State Rebuild Trust Fund, and through this very laudable effort by the Lagos State Security Trust Fund. I enjoin other State Governments to emulate your bold, proactive and resourceful initiative,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President also used the occasion to reiterate that the \u2018\u2018Federal Government takes very seriously our constitutional oath to secure the lives and properties of the Nigerian people, adding that his administration was conscious of the fact that lasting security is a necessary foundation for business, investment, and true prosperity.\n\nPresident Buhari declared that no Federal government since 1999 has been as committed as his administration in reforming and repositioning the Nigeria Police Force and national policing architecture.\n\n\u2018\u2018In 2019, I signed into law the Act establishing the Nigeria Police Trust Fund, the first in the history of the Force, to provide guaranteed funding to support Police welfare, logistics, and equipment.\n\n\u2018\u2018In September 2020, I assented to the Bill amending the Nigeria Police Act, which was originally enacted in 1943.\n\n\u2018\u2018This new Act, a vast improvement over the old one, among other things spells out the modalities for the implementation of a National Community Policing Scheme in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018This new scheme will build confidence within our local communities and make them active stakeholders in the safety and security of their environs.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are currently recruiting 10,000 new Police officers to reinforce our personnel capacity across the country. In addition to this, I have directed the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission to carry out an upward review of Police salaries and benefits,\u2019\u2019 he said.",

It is also a demonstration of government\u2019s strong commitment to ensuring security.\n\n\u2018\u2018This intervention, no doubt, will facilitate a conducive environment for the maritime sector to thrive and contribute to the diversification of the Nigerian economy,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President commended the Ministers of Transportation, Defence, the Chief of Naval Staff, the Director-General NIMASA, members of the Steering Committee, the Project Management Team and all other government stakeholders who have worked together to bring this initiative of the administration to fruition.\n\nAssuring of the government\u2019s commitment to ensure the project\u2019s sustainability, the President urged all critical stakeholders to work collectively for the greater benefit of all Nigerians, member states of the Gulf of Guinea and the global maritime community.\n\nAt the inauguration, the President, who witnessed the demonstration of a range of assets to tackle maritime security, supervised the naming of two Vessels, Deep Blue Abuja (DB-Abuja) and Deep Blue Lagos (DB-Lagos) by the Minister of State, Transportation, Senator Gbemisola Saraki.\n\nWe Will Continue To Prioritise Railway System \u2013 Buhari\n\nIn a similar vein, President Buhari on Thursday inaugurated the commercial operations of the Lagos-Ibadan railway project at the Mobolaji Johnson Railway Station, Ebute Metta, Lagos, and stressed that his administration will continue to prioritise the railway system.\n\nHe described the project as another milestone in the drive of his administration to revitalise the railway system and establish it as a choice mode of transportation for both passengers and freight.\n\nThis was disclosed in a statement signed on Thursday by Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina.\n\n\u201cThe President pledged that his administration would continue to prioritise the railway system as a transportation backbone that can transform industrial and economic activity in the country,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nOn the benefits of the Lagos-Ibadan corridor as well as other on-going railway projects across the country, President Buhari said, \u2018\u2018This vital line establishes an end-to-end logistic supply chain in railway transport within its short corridor, Lagos \u2013 Ibadan, as goods to the hinterland would now be transported by rail directly from the Apapa port Quayside straight to the Inland Container Depot located in Ibadan from where it can be distributed to other parts of the country.\u201d\n\nHe said further that \u201cin clear recognition of the challenges posed to our economic growth by absence of strong and effective infrastructure, we have in the rail sector, further to other ongoing railway infrastructure projects, embarked on the completion of the outstanding segment of the Lagos \u2013 Kano railway, which is Ibadan \u2013 Kano.\u201d\n\nThe President said the Lagos \u2013 Kano railway project when completed will link the Kano \u2013 Maradi line at Kano and a rail link from the Nigeria southern ports of Lagos to Maradi in Niger Republic will be achieved.\n\n\u2018\u2018The connection through rail would position Nigerian ports as the choice for import and export business of the people of landlocked Niger Republic.\n\n\u2018\u2018This would be beneficial to the economy through employment from new business opportunities and wealth creation.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe President expressed delight that his directive to the Federal Ministry of Transportation and Ministry of Finance on reaching financial agreements with appropriate co-financiers to partner with the Federal Government for the development of the Ibadan \u2013 Kano railway was yielding results.\n\nHe noted that the Ibadan-Kano project would have a connection to the Tin Can Island port as well as the West-East Coastal rail line from Lagos to Calabar linking Onitsha, Benin, Warri, Yenagoa, Port Harcourt, Aba, and Uyo.\n\nShortly after he inaugurated the project, President Buhari took a ride from Ebute Metta Station to Energy Nature Light (ENL), Terminal, Apapa Port, Lagos.",

The atmosphere within the KASU community has of late been intense, following certain government decisions that have not gone down well with the lecturers, students, and their parents.\n\nA few weeks ago, the Kaduna State Government decided to increase school fees at the tertiary institution, a hike that saw fees rise between 300 and 500 percent. This was a bitter pill to swallow for many students and their guardians who will now pay N150,000 per student, instead of N24,000 which used to be the minimum.\n\nREAD ALSO: KASU Students Block Road To Govt House In Protest Over Hike Tuition Fees\n\nEnraged by what they describe as an outrageous increase, students have continued to stage protests against the hike. The students have not been alone in this struggle, as their lecturers who are members of the ASUU joined in the protest, rejecting the tuition increase.\n\nReacting to this development, Osodeke described the situation as sad and terrible, especially at \u201cthis time when an average parent can hardly feed and can hardly take care their children\u201d.\n\nThe ASUU President further stated that he will stand by the students, adding that he hopes the parents and indigenes of Kaduna will rise up against the dictatorial attitude which is prevalent in El-Rufai\u2019s government.\n\nEl-Rufai has no right to direct KASU Vice-Chancellor to punish a staff\n\nSpeaking on the issue of lecturers allegedly sacked by the Kaduna State Government for participating in a protest organised by the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), Professor Osodeke said the Kaduna State Governor has no right to direct the KASU Vice-Chancellor to punish or sack staff.\n\nWhile noting that no ASUU member has been queried nor has anyone gotten a letter of dismissal, Osodeke said that a back-door sacking cannot be put past the Kaduna State Government.\n\nHe, however, stated that the ASUU branch in Kaduna has met with the KASU Vice-Chairman who denied that such an action has been taken by the university governing council.\n\nThe ASUU President stressed that Governor El-Rufai does not have any say in the recruitment and dismissal of a KASU staff, adding that it is purely in the purview of the governing board.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the governing council that recruits staff and can dismiss or punish a staff following the appropriate process laid down,\u201d Osodeke stressed.",

Europe is back.\u201d\n\nThe clearest illustration of that is set to come from Budapest, where it is hoped the new Puskas Arena will be packed to capacity.\n\nBut the majority of the 11 venues, all in different countries, will only be partially-filled for matches, although Denmark on Thursday announced it would lift mask rules and allow 25,000 fans, instead of 16,000, to attend games in Copenhagen.\n\nMunich aims to host a minimum of 14,500 fans \u2014 around 22 percent of the Allianz Arena\u2019s capacity, the lowest of the stadiums being used.\n\nDublin and Bilbao were dropped from the list of hosts after being unable to give guarantees they could meet UEFA\u2019s requirement of accommodating limited numbers of spectators, but Seville stepped in for Bilbao while Dublin\u2019s games went to London and Saint-Petersburg.\n\nREAD ALSO: [Super League] \u2018Big Six\u2019 To Pay \u00a322M Settlement To Premier League\n\nFrance the favourites\n\nOn the pitch, France will be firm favourites despite being one of the few traditional giants not to have any games at home.
