The right for political parties to internally regulate themselves is an essential part of their freedom of association, in as much as their actions do not violate the constitution and the Electoral Act\u201d, he said.\n\nWhile insisting that democracy is a process and not an event, Olawepo-Hashim submitted that \u201cit is therefore hypocritical that INEC that has postponed many elections on the very day of election, will now be insisting that her suggested dates of primaries, which are outside the provisions of the law, are sacrosanct.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in a testy transition process where flexibility is needed within the limits of the law. It is also amazing that everyone is keeping quiet about this whole thing, some sections of the media are justifying it and criticising the political parties for requesting for more time for their primaries,\u201d he said.\n\nOlawepo-Hashim also countered what he described as \u2018the spurious argument that time is needed for dispute resolution in courts\u2019 and wondered \u201cwhen has it become the business of INEC to set up calendars for judicial matters that can go on for years into the tenure of the next administration.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Hence, our strong commitments to Transboundary Water Organizations like the Niger Basin Authority.\n\n\u201cThe degradation of water quality and the effects of Climate Change on water resources are significant concerns of River Basin Management Organizations like ours.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the efficient and integrated management of the water resources available to meet the requirements of the various users in the basin requires our Countries and our Joint Institution, the NBA, to have a better knowledge of this resource.\n\n\u201cIt is important to state that the evolution of water resources quality in the basin and the discharge of wastewater have to be monitored, given the continuous increase in industrial, mining, and agricultural activities. Indeed, wastewater management poses many legal, institutional, financial, economic, and cultural challenges.\n\nHowever, the Minister called on stakeholders to comply and act collectively to improve water quality as it is expected of participants at the workshop to come up with standard measures to mitigate release of pollutants.\n\n\u201cIt follows therefore, that individuals and organizations must comply and act in the collective interest to improve water quality and protect water resources. To this end, it is crucial during this Workshop to propose concrete and standard measures to mitigate the release of pollutants, particularly those of anthropogenic origin.\n\n\u201cFor the next five working days, you will deliberate on issues that will improve water quality of the Niger River, and hence this Workshop will allow member Countries to: make amendments to and validate the document on standards for the discharge of wastewater into the NBA; identify and plan strategies for sharing data on water quality in the watershed between member countries and the NBA; and share experiences on water quality monitoring between experts from different Basins present at the workshop (Niger and Danube)\u201d, he stated.\n\nEarlier, the Regional Director and Country Representative for Nigeria and ECOWAS, UNIDO Regional Hub Nigeria, Jean Bankole, pointed that Nigeria plays leading role in regional integration within ECOWAS, and commended the Nigerian Government and UNIDO for organizing the workshop.\n\nBankole said: \u201cNigeria have a crucial role to play in the region, we can try to address the climate change challenges and address the issue of water pollution, because the best strategies we can get a very good qualitative water which can help people living in this Basin, not only to get very good water but also ensure that water is equally well managed in the region and serve to drive all social and economical activities in the region.\n\n\u201cIt is important to have common understanding on the best strategies for a good management of water for this Basin, because it is not only important for domestic use or climate change only, Water is important also for productive activities like industry and that\u2019s why UNIDO is here to conduct this workshop to get the best practices and experience from each countries of the nine countries of the Niger Basin.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Very expensive. And when you spend money and can\u2019t get it back, it can be a real hindrance, so discouraging.\n\n\u201cFor three years now, we have been spending money and we\u2019ve not been able to get it back, but we are being optimistic, being positive because this venture is driven by passion. Everything is not just about money.\n\n\u201cI want to sacrifice the much I can to make the difference, and in such a manner that even when I leave, there will be a legacy to sustain and improve on beyond my time.\n\n\u201cWe must begin to change our mindset to be more sacrificial and leave a legacy, than everybody being desperate to get rich without wanting to make lawful efforts. We must encourage ourselves.\u201d\n\nResponding, the AWCN Commandant, Maj Gen Alabi told Izomor, \u201cWe are impressed by what we have seen. And your consideration for the protection of the personnel handling the equipment is very commendable.\n\n\u201cSo you are doing a lot and I know that these initial challenges will be there, but with time you will surpass them.\n\n\u201cSince Defense has indicated interest to buy, when they are tested, when their results will come out and they are useful, they would call for more and you might even become a major platform for achieving such interests.\u201d\n\nHe said the report and recommendations of the College may further help in strengthening Defense\u2019s confidence in what the company is developing, urging MVG to even consider expanding beyond marine into land equipment.\n\nAside serving security needs, MGV engineering expertise, cutting across research and development, production, fabrications, procurement, commissioning and more, serves a wide clientele including the oil industry and other marine stakeholders.\n\nVanguard News",

But party leaders warned against losing 2023 poll on technical grounds.

They raised the alarm that the opposition PDP is waiting in the wings to take APC to the cleaners in court.\n\n\u201cThe NWC, which also exercises the powers of the National Executive Committee of the party, decided to adjust the timetable for the primaries to adhere to INEC guidelines.\u201d\n\nAsked about the shrinking of the timetable for presidential primaries, the source added: \u201cThe adjustment cuts across all elective offices.

At that meeting, we expressed our displeasure that Facebook was becoming a power of choice for those who stay outside Nigeria, in particular, to incite violence, killings, burning of government properties, killing of soldiers and policemen.\n\n\u201cAnd that they should do more than what they are doing now in looking at the contents, which are unwholesome, which are being used on their platforms.\n\n\u201cIncidentally, the BBC did a documentary on this particular issue and found out that some of them who call themselves social media warriors in England, in France and other places, have in recent times, be using the Facebook platform to incite violence in Nigeria. And we\u2019ve all seen the real life impact of those war mongering, the young couple who are going to marry, soldiers who were gruesomely murdered.\n\n\u201cOver this weekend in Anambra state police men were killed, military barracks were attacked.

          "text": "\u2022Declares FG has no plan to ban Facebook\n\n\u2022FEC okays N169.7bn private sector investments in road Infrastructure\n\n\u2022Approves N3.4bn for purchase of aviation property\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has the final say on the fate of members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) who decided to renounce their political ambitions and remain in the cabinet, so says Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed.\n\nMohammed also disclosed that the federal government had no plan to ban the social networking website, Facebook, in Nigeria over alleged biased reportage of happenings in some parts of the country.\n\nThe disclosure came as FEC approved N169.7 billion private sector investments for road infrastructure through the government\u2019s Tax Credit Programme (TCP), during the weekly virtual meeting.\n\nFEC also approved the sum of N3, 491,622,340 for the purchase of a property in Abuja for the Ministry of Aviation.\n\nMohammed, who briefed newsmen after the FEC meeting yesterday at the State House, Abuja, said he would need to confirm the status of the returning ministers from the president.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe question about ministers returning or not going, I think you need to give me more time so that I can tell you exactly what the situation is. Right now, I need to crosscheck.\n\n\u201cI need to confirm again from Mr President what the situation is. You see, the final decision on who is going, who\u2019s coming back, who\u2019s not, lies with Mr. President.\u201d\n\nPresidency sources yesterday told THISDAY that President had since asked the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami and the Governor of the Central Bank, Godwin Emefiele to stay on in their jobs even though they had initially nursed the ambition of contesting the 2023 election. While Malami had purchased forms to vie for Governor in his home State of Kebbi, a group of rice farmers purchased forms for Emefiele to contest for ticket to vie for the presidential election.\n\nMinister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige; his Women Affairs counterpart, Dame Pauline Tallen; Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami; and Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timpre Sylva, had rescinded their decisions to contest for elective offices in the 2023 general election.\n\nMalami was physically present at yesterday\u2019s council meeting, while Tallen and Sylva attended the meeting virtually from their offices in Abuja.\n\nNgige was said to be away on official engagement in South Africa, where he was attending the global conference on child labour in Durban, organised by the International Labour Organisation (ILO).\n\nThe information and culture minister also shed more light on the recent meeting between the federal government and Facebook\u2019s management over the alleged biased coverage of the country by the blogging platform. He said both parties had a fruitful discussion, adding that the government is not contemplating banning Facebook operations in the country.\n\nMohammed stated, \u201cWe had a very robust discussion with Facebook. Facebook saw our point and they said they\u2019re going to do much more than what they were doing. So if they do that, why would we ban them? We don\u2019t ban for banning sake. We ban or we only suspend operations if, for any reason, lives are threatened and they do not listen.\u201d\n\nHe also said the government was able to express its reservation about some of the reports on Facebook.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAt that meeting, we expressed our displeasure that Facebook was becoming a power of choice for those who stay outside Nigeria, in particular, to incite violence, killings, burning of government properties, killing of soldiers and policemen. And that they do more than what they are doing now in looking at the contents, which are unwholesome, which are being used on their platforms.\n\n\u201cIncidentally, the BBC did a documentary on this particular issue and found out that some of them who call themselves social media warriors in England, in France, and other places, have in recent times been using the Facebook platform to incite violence in Nigeria. And we\u2019ve all seen the real life impact of those war mongering, the young couple who are going to marry, soldiers who were gruesomely murdered.\n\n\u201cOver this weekend in Anambra State, policemen were killed, military barracks were attacked. And we did warn Facebook to, please, do more than what they are doing now. And I must say that their response was quite encouraging. They said they are going to do much more.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the approval of N169.7 billion private sector investments for road infrastructure through the government\u2019s TCP, Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, who also briefed newsmen, stressed that the programme was initiated in 2019, through Executive Order 7 signed by the president, which allowed the private sector to finance public infrastructure in lieu of tax and then offset it overtime using tax credits.\n\nFashola said the first project FEC approved, based on TCP, was the 234-kilometre road from Bali to Sheti through Gashaka to Gembu in Taraba State at the sum of N95, 232,474,010.72. He disclosed that an existing N20 billion, under NNPC Tax Credit Scheme, would be used to kick-start the project.\n\nFashola said the second project, under the tax credit scheme, approved by Council covered three roads.\n\n\u201cThe applicant in this case is Mainstream Energy Solutions, a major energy player in the country, is now seeking to also participate in this policy by investing a total of N74, 486,577, 050,\u201d he said.\n\nFurthermore, Mohammed, who briefed journalists on behalf of his colleagues in aviation, power, and agriculture, said FEC approved the sum of N3, 491,622,340 for the purchase of a property in Abuja for the Ministry of Aviation. He said the property to be acquired was to enable the ministry co-locate with many of its agencies.\n\nThe minister stated, \u201cThis property will enable the ministry to be in the same building with many of its agencies. As of now, many of the agencies operate from rented properties and this is a drain on government, apart from the fact that it does not allow for good coordination of activities.\n\n\u201cNecessary checks and legal searches have been made and the council approved the purchase today.\u201d\n\nThe minister also said Council awarded a N553.575 million contract for the establishment and deployment of Advanced Report Generation Utility Engine Web-based Reporting Tools in favour of Messrs Sinecou Limited with delivery date of 12 months.\n\nMohammed further disclosed that the power ministry got approval for the upward review of the original contract sum in respect of the construction of 232 kilometres Yola, Song, Gombe, Mubi, Gulako 132 KV double circuit transmission line, from $16 million plus N1.248 billion, to $16.698 billion plus N2,337,643,640. He added that the sum of N409 million was approved for the power ministry to purchase replacements of defective circuit breakers, and disclosed that a memo from the Minister of Agriculture seeking approval for a National Agricultural Technology Innovation Policy was approved.\n\nMohammed stated, \u201cAnother memo by the Minister of Power also sought approval for the repair and refurbishment of defective nine sets of 330 KV, 13 sets of 132 KV, and 26 sets of 33 KV Crompton grips circuit breakers for the Transmission Company of Nigeria. Some of these circuit breakers are weak, having been there for more than 35 years and the total sum is N409, 089,841. And this is to help the network of the TCN.\n\n\u201cA memo of the Minister of Agriculture seeking approval for a national agricultural technology innovation policy was approved. It is a policy that aims at better synergy and alignment with MDAs to overcome inadequate coordination on policy implementation. It will address the issue of fragmentation of mandates and rivalries among MDAs in the agricultural sector. It will help livestock development and it will support the establishment of functional models of ranches, grazing reserves and integrated meat and dairy processing among others.\n\n\u201cThe policy is also going to help promote knowledge creation and transfer through reorganising, unbundling and strengthening agricultural research and training systems. The policy will give access to mechanisation via tractor and implement hiring scheme. It will also impact on quality extension service delivery, leading to enhanced technology adoption to strengthen the value chain for quality crops, fisheries and aquaculture, among others.\u201d\n\nMinister of State for Budget and National Planning, Clement Agba, who also spoke after the FEC meeting, said the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, presented a memo on the Phase 3 of the Lighthouse programme on digital infrastructure of voluntary assets and income declaration scheme bids and tax harmonisation normalisation analytics and application programme interface.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "The 23 APC Members Seeking to Replace Buhari",
          "text": "When all is said and done \u2013 after all the back and forth, the frenzy by both pretenders and contenders \u2013 only 23 aspirants are up for screening. Twenty-four actually returned their nomination forms. But Akinwumi Adesina pulled out of the race a few days ago, leaving these 23 members (22 men and one woman) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to slug it out for the presidential ticket.\n\nBut questions remain about the strange rush to make a visible impression on the APC presidential dashboard. What do they really want? Why such an unwieldy number for just one office? Has the presidency become an all-comers affair? Is the motivation really the love of country, or personal aggrandisement, or just pursuit of ambition? How many of the aspirants actually have the capacity to manage a society as complicated as Nigeria?\n\nHow is the ruling party going to manage this huge number of people ready to take over from President Muhammadu Buhari without creating needless crises that may even ruin the party?\n\nThe questions are endless. But the D-Day is almost here.\n\nMeet the 22 men and one woman who want to succeed Buhari. They come from diverse backgrounds \u2013 reflecting Nigeria\u2019s rich diversity.\n\nYemi Osinbajo\n\nVice-President Yemi Osinbajo is believed by many as ordinarily the most ideal to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari after working together for almost eight years. And against all odds, Osinbajo, on April 11, 2022, declared his intention to succeed his principal, Buhari, through a short video uploaded on all the social media platforms. With his form submitted and consultations going on in almost every part of Nigeria, the die is cast.\n\nAhmad Lawan\n\nNews that the current President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, was eyeing the presidency was like a rumour many had thought would not evolve into reality and this was for obvious reasons. Interestingly, he is among the 23 other aspirants and appears to truly mean business. Even as many continue to say God forbid to Ahmad\u2019s presidential ambition, Lawan is unperturbed. No one knows what the owners of Nigeria have up their sleeves. Since he joined the race, he is not crisscrossing the country to woo delegates. Well, who knows, maybe his confidence comes from his backers \u2013 that he doesn\u2019t need to woo delegates. Or maybe it\u2019s just a reflection of his nature and how he treats otherwise important issues with levity \u2013 like the way he conducts Senate\u2019s business. He has practically turned the senate and by extension, the federal legislature into an appendage of the executive. This ironically, has remained what he\u2019s been selling in his public statements in the name of being cooperative with the executive. Everyone is waiting to see how he will emerge.\n\nBola Ahmed Tinubu\n\nIn many respects, a lot of political analysts, have begun to think that the tide is slowly tilting in the favour of a former governor of Lagos State, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. This though changes nothing about the swirling perception about him \u2013 his corrupt disposition \u2013 it has however, improved his standing in the race for the APC ticket. For a man, who considers this project a life-long ambition and the first to publicly declare his intention, he knows this is definitely not a sprint and is ready for whatever lays ahead.\n\nIbikunle Amosun\n\nThe former governor of Ogun State and senator for Ogun Central, Ibikunle Amosun, comes to the race with credibility, nobility and record of stellar performance as governor. A close ally of the president, Amosun boasts not just very deep knowledge in finance \u2013 combined with his executive and legislative exposures \u2013 he is not just ready for the race for the presidential ticket, but the task of leading the country to the next level. With his forms filed for consideration, maybe he is ready.\n\nAjayi Boroffice\n\nA senator from Ondo State, Ajayi Borrofice, incidentally, made it to the point of submission, even though the misgivings about his decision to run have yet to subside. The fact that he has also crossed this one line, counts form him in many ways, even though it has not fundamentally altered the subsisting beliefs about his aspiration and his true intentions.\n\nOgbonnaya Onu\n\nAt this stage, the Minister of Science of Technology and Innovation, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, is arguably one of the names to watch out for. Unlike some of his colleagues, who chickened out, when the reality of what might be lurking next door stared at them, Ogbonnaya is not joking with the demand for a president from the South-east part of the country, albeit for Nigeria and Nigerians. While some still have reservations about him, he certainly would stand shoulders higher than many of the other contenders.\n\nDimeji Bankole\n\nFormer speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Dimeji Bankole, might have sent a clear message too, staying up to this stage. Earlier considered as one of the jokers in the race, he cannot be described as such again, having made it to the second round. But how he plans to waltz through the political landmines and beat the heavyweights to their game, is yet to be seen. Young and personable, being Nigeria\u2019s president requires more, lest, he knows.\n\nYahaya Bello\n\nKogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, is one seemingly indomitable spirit in the race for Buhari\u2019s job. Despite many things working and standing against his plausible choice and decision, especially, the unsavoury public perception about him, he has continued to give his all, just to prove he was not in the race to play around. Bello remains one interesting character in the race for the APC ticket and can no longer be taken for granted.\n\nDave Umahi\n\nEbonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi, is in the race for justice, equity and fairness, which the Igbo demand. In addition, he is convinced he has the gravitas to turn things around. Interestingly, he has some good record of performance, after serving Ebonyi for nearly eight years now. But how far his record of a relatively small Ebonyi would take him cannot be taken out of the concerns for his decision, when push comes to shove.\n\nRochas Okorocha\n\nSenator and former governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, has always wanted to be president of Nigeria and this is about his fourth attempt. He might come off simple and sociable, he is equally of a serious and progressive standing. He means business and is determined to give all that it would take to, not only emerge candidate of the party, but also ensure that the Igbo gets its rightful place in the body polity.\n\nChukwuemeka Nwajuiba\n\nUnpredictable Minister of State for Education, Hon. Chukwuemeka Nwajuiba, appears to be one candidate setting the pace for the others in many respects, an indication he is not in the race to while away time. He obtained his form first and was the first to resign after Buhari handed the order. He submitted his form as quickly as he could and was ready early enough for screening. He is following rules and setting his own standards. Whoever underrates this south-easterner would do so at a huge cost, in addition to the fact that some northern elites seem to have a thing for him.\n\nGodswill Akpabio\n\nSince the former Minister of Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio, declared his intention to run for president, he has yet to catch the sort of attention expected to underscore his seriousness. Although he has been holding some skeletal consultations in view of his aspiration, Akpabio has not come out as strong as some of the frontliners. Yet, he is not one to be pushed behind in the scheme of things. He is grounded and understands the terrain as well as its tricks. With record of outstanding performance as governor, albeit largely superficial, he is probably coming into the race with an uncommon resolve to change the face of the presidential run.\n\nUju Kennedy Ohnenye\n\nAs the only female aspirant in the race for the APC presidential ticket, Uju Kennedy Ohnenye, has fought a good fight so far and to the awe of many, who had thought she would have long fallen by the way side. At this stage, nothing can be put past this woman of courage as she trudges on. Her confidence and belief in her ability to turn the tide are indeed, notes for file.\n\nTunde Bakare\n\nIf there was a list of people deemed as likely to chicken out from the race, one name most certainly to be missing in that list is the General Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church, Lagos, Pastor Tunde Bakare. He has not only been calling himself the number 16 to the office of the president, succeeding Buhari; he has been working to realising it too for some time. Thus, crossing the second round was not a surprise, and how far he would push this further is also not what anyone can envisage.\n\nNicholas Felix Nwagbo\n\nYoung and unknown Nicholas Felix Nwagbo, has sent a subliminal message to his critics by crossing the second stage of the process of his aspiration. A US-based Nigerian pastor at the Miracle Church International, is the second pastor in the race for APC ticket after Bakare. Whatever he intends to achieve with this, only time will tell.\n\nKayode Fayemi\n\nEkiti State Governor, Dr. John Kayode Fayemi, who has led his colleagues as Chairman of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), is without a doubt, a man of class, panache and character. And with capacity and competence not in question, he is one of those who has marked up the ranks and quality of those aiming Buhari\u2019s job, more so from the Southwest. Even though he kept this ambition close to his chest, he has never pretended about it and has always meant business. For Fayemi, the game is on and right.\n\nRotimi Amaechi\n\nUnquestionably the most-experienced in the race, having not just held different offices in the past 23 years, but has remained in government for that stretch of time since the return of civil rule in 1999, the immediate past Minister of Transportation, Hon. Rotimi Amaechi, is one issue, whose name is expected to send jitters each time it is mentioned. He knows the game, especially, palace politics, and has since declaring for the office of the president, shown the stuff he is made of. Amaechi is one man to watch out for and whose capacity for showing up insidiously is top notch. He boasts competence too.\n\nKen Nnamani\n\nRenowned largely for killing former President Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s third term agenda, a former Senate President, Ken Nnamani, is another face of the South-east in the race that cannot be taken for granted. He has capacity, experience, maturity and has shown to know Nigeria and her challenges. Despite his personal inadequacies, he wouldn\u2019t stop getting a deserved mention until this is over.\n\nAbubakar Badaru\n\nA prominent and critical factor in some of the APC power centres is the Jigawa State Governor, Abubakar Badaru. He cannot be pushed back as far as the race for the APC ticket is concerned. Whilst a majority of the people think his being in the race is to negotiate the office of the vice-president, who says if the South mismanages their chance, he would not gladly take the presidency itself? This is why this Jigawa governor cannot be underrated.\n\nSani Yerima\n\nFormer governor of Zamfara State, Senator Sani Yerima\u2019s presidential ambition is one that a lot of political observers have yet to situate in context. But from the time he obtained his forms to submitting them, he has neither flinched not fidgeted about what he wanted. He clearly has some plans up his sleeves. Whatever they are, all eyes on him as the battle for the APC ticket thickens.\n\nIkeobasi Mokelu\n\nA former Minister of Information and Culture during the late Gen. Sani Abacha junta, Chief Ikeobasi Mokelu, was among the last to venture into the race for the APC ticket. But, he is already boasting that his presidency would apply honour, character, and integrity in the application of efficient and sustainable governance at all levels and in the three arms of government. Whatever his end game is, the floor is open, at least, for now.\n\nBen Ayade\n\nFustian and unashamed, the Cross River State Governor, Professor Ben Ayade, is another presidential hopeful on the APC long list of aspirants, whose intention is hard to decode. Disadvantaged from many points, this timid-looking former member of the opposition PDP, is gradually wearing a serious look, having crossed the second round of the nomination process. Although not much has been seen of him in terms of consultation, the question of how much of home support he could garner has kept coming back each time is name is put up in focus\n\nTein Jack-Rich\n\nForty-seven years old Tein Jack-Rich is the President and Founder of Belemaoil Producing Limited, a company often described as the first indigenous oil exploration and production company in Nigeria, even though that consideration is arguable. Coming from an oil producing community in Akuku-Toru Local Government Area of Rivers State, not a few understood yet what a completely apolitical Jack-Rick was doing flexing muscles in an otherwise muddy political terrain. But he seems convinced about his decision and is leaving nothing to chance as the journey to the presidential primaries continues.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "FG Declines Consent to Seplat, Mobil Oil Producing Assets Acquisition Deal",
          "text": "Obinna Chima\n\n\n\nThe federal government declined its consent to the proposed acquisition of oil and gas assets belonging to Mobil Oil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (MPNU) by Seplat Energy.\n\nThe government among others, cited overriding national interest as one of the reasons for rejecting the deal.\n\nThe Chief Executive, Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), Engr. Gbenga Komolafe, stated these in two separate letters addressed to the Chairman/ Managing Director, Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited, Mr. Richard Laing as well as the immediate past Chairman of Seplat Energy, Dr. ABC Orjiako. Both letters obtained by THISDAY yesterday, were dated May 13, 2022.\n\nSeplat Energy had in February this year, announced its acquisition of oil and gas assets belonging to MPNU. But the deal was subject to Ministerial Consent and other required regulatory approvals. However, few weeks after, it was reported that the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited had opted to exercise its Right of First Refusal (RFR) on the sale of the assets, which then put a hold on the transaction.\n\nBut Komolafe in the letter stressed that regardless of the mode of the transaction, Mobil Oil still remains to all intents and purposes, the assignor of the asset under the Nigerian law.\n\n\u201cWe also note that MPNU failed to follow the procedure for assignments laid down in the Guidelines by not providing the requisite notices to the Commission at all relevant stages of the transaction. Even if the transaction has been between Seplat Energy Offshore Limited and the MPNU shareholders, responsibility to ensure compliance with Nigerian laws, rules and regulations always remain that of MPNU, the entity that was awarded the assets.\n\n\u201cWe regret to inform you that His Excellency, the Minister of Petroleum Resources has declined his consent to the transaction.\n\n\u201cNothing in this letter shall be deemed to be a waiver, on the part of the Commission, of any rights under the Guidelines, any law, rule or regulation, and the Commission reserves all its rights in respect of the subject matter. Please accept the assurances of my highest esteem,\u201d the Commission\u2019s boss stated in the letter addressed to Laing, with reference number: NUPRC/LD/1189/01, titled: \u201cRe: Potential Sale and Purchase of the Equity (Shares) of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited.\u201d\n\nHe also made reference to the multinational oil company\u2019s letter dated March 30, 2022 with Ref: MPN-PGA-NUP-CCE-0322-0027 on the above subject matter.\n\nKomolafe highlighted contents of the letter MPNU wrote then to the NUPRC on the proposed acquisition, and in particular, the section that stated that the transaction was between parties who were not privy to the Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) between the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and the MPNU dated June 28, 1990, and that does not trigger any relevant rights or obligations under the JOA for either NNPC or MPNU. Also, the MPNU had stated in the letter that the sale of shares by shareholders of MPNU would have no bearing on the consent or preferential right and option requirements of the JOA in favour of NNPC and that the NNPC does not have preferential rights in respect to the transaction.\n\nIn addition, the regulator made reference to another aspect of the letter Mobil wrote to it on the matter that, the MPNU shareholders would be proceeding with their efforts to satisfy the conditions required for the approval of the proposed transaction, and the procurement of the consent of the Minister of Petroleum Resources.\n\nFurthermore, the Commission pointed out that: \u201cYou may also be aware that the Commission is in receipt of a letter of 10th March 2022, written by Seplat Energy to the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, requesting the consent of the Minister of Petroleum Resources to the transaction. This letter was received by the Commission on March 30, 2022.\n\n\u201cPlease be advised that even if the transaction in question were between parties who are not privy to the JOA, MPNU remains the leaseholder of the assets subject to the transaction and the focal point of contact with the federal government of Nigeria on any matter or dealings with the assets.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, you may wish to note that paragraph 3.1 of the Guidelines and Procedures for Obtaining Minister\u2019s Consent to the Assignment of Interest in Oil and Gas Assets 2021 provides, in line with extant Nigerian law, that \u2018an Assignment involves the transfer of an OPL, OML, MF or OGPL or an interest, power or right therein by any company or person with equity, participating, contractual or working interest in the said OPL, OML, MF or OGPL, through merger, acquisition, take-over, divestment or any such transaction that may alter the ownership, equity, rights or interest of the assigning company in question, not minding the nature of upstream arrangement that the assigning company may be involved in, including but not limited to Joint Venture (JV), Production Sharing Contract (PSC), Production Sharing Agreement (PSA),Service Contract (SC), Sole Risk (SR) or Marginal Fields operation.\u2019\n\n\u201cAlso note that overriding National interest will always be the compass of the law. Paragraph 3.1.1 of the guidelines also expressly restates that assignment shall include, but not be limited to: \u2018assignment by way of exchange or transfer of shares: This shall entail the acquisition of part or all of the shares of a company which holds an OPL, OML, MF or OGPL in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAccording to the regulatory commission, until an assignment was completed, including the granting of Ministerial consent to such assignment, the leaseholder remains the registered owner of the asset and the only one with the locus to interact with the government in respect of the asset.\n\nAlso, in the letter addressed to Orjiako, the regulatory commission also highlighted relevant sections in the Guidelines and Procedures for Obtaining Minister\u2019s Consent to the Assignment of Interest in Oil and Gas Assets 2021.\n\n\u201cThus, regardless of the mode of the transaction, MPNU, remains, to all intents and purposes, the assignor under Nigerian law and is the proper person to bring an application for Ministerial consent to the transaction, not Seplat. Consequently, you are hereby requested to revert to MPNU, the assignor, to receive updates on your application,\u201d it stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Chidera Eze, a five-year-old pupil of the Redeemers Nursery and Primary School in Ogba, Lagos state, has died during a swimming session.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pupil was said to have drowned during a swimming lesson organised by the school at the Ivory Health Club in the Ikeja axis of the state.\n\nEze and his colleagues were said to have been playing close to the pool during the training when he suddenly slipped into it.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH, Anthony, the pupil\u2019s father, alleged that the school\u2019s officials neglected his son, resulting in his death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to him, he had dropped Eze in school on Monday morning and left for work.\n\nAnthony said Adeola Oladipo, the school\u2019s headteacher, later called to inform him that his son was involved in an accident and rushed to the Ikeja Medical Centre.\n\n\u201cI dropped my children at the Redeemers Nursery and Primary School on Acme Road, Ogba, on Monday morning, and I went to work. At 10.52am, I got a call from their headteacher, Mrs Adeola Oladipo, and she told me that my son was involved in an accident and that he had been rushed to the Ikeja Medical Centre,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI rushed down there, but what I saw was the lifeless body of my son. I asked the headteacher what happened and she said she did not know. I asked the doctor what happened and he said he was brought in dead. I asked the teachers, caregivers and workers at the club what happened and they gave no explanation.\n\n\u201cAs I was crying, my wife came in; I was trying to manage the information, but the headteacher also informed her and as she ran into the hospital, I became totally confused. I went to the Area F Police Station and after the policemen took pictures of my son\u2019s corpse, we went to the club.\n\n\u201cWhen we got there, we discovered that it was the adult swimming pool section that they took the pupils to. I was alarmed and while the policemen were investigating, we realised that CCTV was installed at the club. So, we demanded to check the CCTV footage and it revealed everything.\u201d\n\nCiting CCTV footage of the facility, Anthony also claimed his son was not attended to in the pool for over 30 minutes before he died.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe further alleged that his son\u2019s corpse was discovered by someone who came to swim in the pool.\n\n\u201cIn the footage, we saw that the school brought more than 15 children, took them to the adult side of the swimming pool and made them sit at the tip with their legs in the water and without wearing any kits. We saw only one caregiver in the video and she was just going in and coming out, leaving the children unmanned,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cMy son was at the tail end of the line when he slipped into the pool the first time but he was able to bring himself out of the pool. But the second time he slipped into the water, he could not come out. All these happened and none of the teachers, caregivers, and lifeguards took notice of what was happening.\n\n\u201cMy son was under the water for over 30 minutes and we were all shouting as we watched the video. Another pupil also fell into the water, but her colleagues raised the alarm and they pulled her out and while this was going on, nobody noticed my son was inside the water.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy son died because of the recklessness of these people who were supposed to take care of him. I want justice to forestall this kind of thing from happening again. The caregivers, lifeguards, school management and the Ivory Health Club can\u2019t go unpunished. My son\u2019s corpse has been deposited in the morgue.\u201d\n\nThe school has not reacted to the incident as of the time of this report.\n\nTheCable Lifestyle also contacted Benjamin Hundeyin, the Lagos police spokesperson, for comment on the matter.\n\nHe, however, did not respond to calls and text messages sent to him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopyright 2022 TheCable.

          "text": "Chidera Eze, a five-year-old pupil of the Redeemers Nursery and Primary School in Ogba, Lagos state, has died during a swimming session.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pupil was said to have drowned during a swimming lesson organised by the school at the Ivory Health Club in the Ikeja axis of the state.\n\nEze and his colleagues were said to have been playing close to the pool during the training when he suddenly slipped into it.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH, Anthony, the pupil\u2019s father, alleged that the school\u2019s officials neglected his son, resulting in his death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to him, he had dropped Eze in school on Monday morning and left for work.\n\nAnthony said Adeola Oladipo, the school\u2019s headteacher, later called to inform him that his son was involved in an accident and rushed to the Ikeja Medical Centre.\n\n\u201cI dropped my children at the Redeemers Nursery and Primary School on Acme Road, Ogba, on Monday morning, and I went to work. At 10.52am, I got a call from their headteacher, Mrs Adeola Oladipo, and she told me that my son was involved in an accident and that he had been rushed to the Ikeja Medical Centre,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI rushed down there, but what I saw was the lifeless body of my son. I asked the headteacher what happened and she said she did not know. I asked the doctor what happened and he said he was brought in dead. I asked the teachers, caregivers and workers at the club what happened and they gave no explanation.\n\n\u201cAs I was crying, my wife came in; I was trying to manage the information, but the headteacher also informed her and as she ran into the hospital, I became totally confused. I went to the Area F Police Station and after the policemen took pictures of my son\u2019s corpse, we went to the club.\n\n\u201cWhen we got there, we discovered that it was the adult swimming pool section that they took the pupils to. I was alarmed and while the policemen were investigating, we realised that CCTV was installed at the club. So, we demanded to check the CCTV footage and it revealed everything.\u201d\n\nCiting CCTV footage of the facility, Anthony also claimed his son was not attended to in the pool for over 30 minutes before he died.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe further alleged that his son\u2019s corpse was discovered by someone who came to swim in the pool.\n\n\u201cIn the footage, we saw that the school brought more than 15 children, took them to the adult side of the swimming pool and made them sit at the tip with their legs in the water and without wearing any kits. We saw only one caregiver in the video and she was just going in and coming out, leaving the children unmanned,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cMy son was at the tail end of the line when he slipped into the pool the first time but he was able to bring himself out of the pool. But the second time he slipped into the water, he could not come out. All these happened and none of the teachers, caregivers, and lifeguards took notice of what was happening.\n\n\u201cMy son was under the water for over 30 minutes and we were all shouting as we watched the video. Another pupil also fell into the water, but her colleagues raised the alarm and they pulled her out and while this was going on, nobody noticed my son was inside the water.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy son died because of the recklessness of these people who were supposed to take care of him. I want justice to forestall this kind of thing from happening again. The caregivers, lifeguards, school management and the Ivory Health Club can\u2019t go unpunished. My son\u2019s corpse has been deposited in the morgue.\u201d\n\nThe school has not reacted to the incident as of the time of this report.\n\nTheCable Lifestyle also contacted Benjamin Hundeyin, the Lagos police spokesperson, for comment on the matter.\n\nHe, however, did not respond to calls and text messages sent to him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopyright 2022 TheCable.

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Disney+ today launched in South Africa.\n\nEarlier in January, the Walt Disney Company confirmed the expansion of its streaming service, Disney+, to 42 new countries, including 6 African countries\u2014Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, and South Africa.\n\nLaunched in the US, Canada, and the Netherlands in 2019, Disney+ is currently present in 64 countries, with 137.7 million subscribers worldwide.\n\nIts entry into South Africa will mark the service\u2019s first ingress into the continent, where it joins other international streaming services such as Amazon Prime Video, Shomax, and Netflix.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan, at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum. The plan, similar to Disney+\u2019s $8 plan in the US, allows users to stream concurrently on 4 devices and access unlimited downloads across 10 devices.\n\nOn the service, South Africans will access original Disney content like the Star Wars series and Encanto; and features from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) like Moon Knight. South African users will also access Disney+\u2019s Star Hub where they can view features from other platforms like FX, Hulu, Freeform, and 20th Century Fox.\n\nMore competition for DStv\n\nComparatively speaking, Disney+ is the cheapest international streaming service available to South Africans, beating Amazon Prime Video at R136 ($8.55)/month and Showmax at R225($14.14)/month. While Netflix does have an affordable R49/month Mobile plan in South Africa, the plan only allows 1 user and 1 device. The only Netflix plan similar to Disney+\u2019s Standard R119 plan is Netflix\u2019s Premium plan which costs R199 plan and allows Ultra HD streaming on up to 4 devices.\n\nDisney\u2019s launch will also bring more competition for DStv which has been struggling to retain its users\u2019 on the platform. Last year, it lost over 100,000 high-value subscribers in 6 months after it cut off access to some sports channels from its packages.\n\nDStv, however, does have cheap monthly plans at R59 ($3.71) and R115 ($7.23) and is still the preferred streaming service for most South Africans with over 12 million subscribers (58% of DStv\u2019s total subscribers) glued to the platform.\n\nWhile platforms like Netflix, Disney+, or Amazon Prime Video offer access to more international content, they also come with a major disadvantage, compared to DStv: users need to be connected to the internet to access their services.\n\nData is expensive in South Africa with 1GB costing an average of R78.50 ($5). An hour of streaming on Netflix consumes 1GB of data at standard definition, and 3GB at high definition. Watching just 20 hours of Netflix a month is equal to R1,560 ($98), almost twice the cost of DStv\u2019s most expensive Premium plan.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Adora Nwodo is a 25-year-old software engineer based in Lagos. She currently works as a cloud engineer at Microsoft and is the author of Cloud Engineering for beginners. I\u2019m bringing Adora to Centre Stage because she has shown great commitment to strengthening developer communities across Nigeria and is an advocate for African women in technology.\n\nAdora Nwodo on cloud engineering and mixed reality\n\nKoromone Koroye: Hi Adora, thanks for agreeing to speak with me. Please, tell me a little about yourself.\n\nAdora Nwodo: I am a software engineer currently building mixed reality on the cloud at Microsoft. I am also a public speaker, published author, digital creator, and occasional DJ.\n\nKK: Are there any differences between cloud and software engineering, or are the terms interchangeable?\n\nAN: There are differences. Anyone who designs, builds, implements, and maintains software applications is a software engineer.\n\nCloud engineers are typically hired to deploy or scale up new and existing cloud resources. Cloud engineers literally do their engineering on the cloud, whether software engineering or DevOps engineering.\n\nKK: What does it mean to build mixed reality (MR) products?\n\nAN: Before I talk about mixed reality, let me briefly explain the difference between augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\n\nAR is essentially an enhanced and interactive version of our physical and real world. If you have ever used Snapchat or Instagram filters, you have interacted with AR somehow.\n\nOn the other hand, VR is a computer-generated environment that usually requires a head-mounted display (HMD) or headset to enjoy a fully-immersed digital experience.\n\nMixed reality blends both AR and VR and provides an interesting middle ground for both technologies. MR gives you the immersive VR experience and the chance to interact with multiple digital objects. Furthermore, MR gives you the illusion that these digital objects exist in your physical space. I can see holograms in my room when I wear a mixed reality headset, but I still get to experience my room as it exists in real life.\n\nKK: Fascinating! What do you enjoy about building mixed reality products in your current role?\n\nAN: I\u2019m building a platform called Mesh for Microsoft. Mesh is the engine that will power the metaverse. Building Mesh has been an exciting experience, primarily because most of the ideas we are working on are relatively new and unknown. Sometimes, building in uncharted territory without a pre-existing playbook to fall back on, can be frustrating. Still, I choose to enjoy the learning process of pioneering a new industry or sector.\n\nDigging deeper with Adora Nwodo\n\nKK: How did you get into cloud engineering? What piqued your interest?\n\nAN: Before joining Microsoft, I already had a vested interest in technology, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and cloud engineering. When I found out about the Microsoft role and that it involved working with mixed reality, I was immediately interested in being a part of the team. During my early months in Microsoft, I primarily worked on the HoloLens before transitioning into cloud-related projects.\n\nKK: Is there a learning curve to accommodate cloud engineering? What are the specific courses people need to take?\n\nAN: If you\u2019re trying to come into cloud engineering, taking an introductory computer science course is essential. The cloud is basically a network of computers, so you need a foundational understanding of computers to understand what is going on. Take any fundamental course on computer science; learn about Linux, operating systems, networking, and cloud fundamentals of the computer.\n\nKK: Let\u2019s talk about your professional growth. Did your career kick off at a startup?\n\nAN: No, it didn\u2019t. I worked with an advertising agency as a software developer before moving to Microsoft.\n\nKK: What was it like transitioning from working at an agency to moving to a more structured and global company like Microsoft?\n\nAN: Joining Microsoft was a breath of fresh air for me, and it wasn\u2019t necessarily about the company as much as it was about the team. I\u2019m a big advocate for working with great teams rather than just great companies. The transition was easy for me because I was excited about the opportunity to build solutions I am passionate about and become the kind of engineer that I have always dreamed of.\n\nAdora on being an African woman in technology\n\nKK: What changes do you think need to be made for gender biases to be eradicated in our ecosystem? It\u2019s obviously going to take a while, but practically speaking, what kind of changes do you think need to be made?\n\nAN: When we talk about gender bias, some people think it\u2019s always conscious, but unconscious biases also exist. I implore African startups and businesses to hold recurring bias training sessions for their employees throughout the year. We can\u2019t start the mindset shift if we don\u2019t educate people and expose them to their conscious and unconscious biases.\n\nHannatu Asheolge: You are pretty influential in the Nigerian tech ecosystem. You\u2019re also a blogger, published author, and active YouTuber. How has putting yourself out there helped you grow?\n\nAdora Nwodo: Putting myself out there is one of the reasons I got into Microsoft at the time that I did. Being active in the developer community and on LinkedIn at that time put me on a recruiter\u2019s radar; it helped me acknowledge that I\u2019m a big fan of learning in public. If I didn\u2019t try to learn in public by posting tweets about things I was reading or learning, people wouldn\u2019t have reached out to me to offer help. Finally, it helped me build my network. Going to ecosystem-related events, meeting new people, and taking on collaborative projects has helped my professional growth.\n\nHA: You recently announced that you were accepted into a Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB) programme. What does this acceptance mean to you as a young Nigerian woman?\n\nAN: I am excited about learning career-accelerating skills like leadership and business management, and I get to be a part of the impressive GSB network.\n\nHA: Do you have any tips you\u2019d like to share about balancing work life and school?\n\nAA: First of all, I don\u2019t know if balance is achievable. I like to think we just try our best and leave the rest to vibes, to a great extent. Delegation is a skill everyone needs to learn on the job. You don\u2019t have to do everything, primarily when you work with a team of talented people. How you prioritise your tasks and assignments matters as well. Prioritise, delegate, and ask for help.\n\nMy calendar has also made my life easier recently. I use it to schedule most of my days to avoid wasting time on unnecessary tasks.\n\nHA: You\u2019re very vocal about your non-work-related hobbies and interests. Can you share some of your favorite hobbies or after-work activities?\n\nAN: I love going around drinking wine and eating steak and mashed potatoes. I enjoy the whole restaurant-hopping thing with a bunch of my friends where we\u2019re just eating good food and drinking wine. I also DJ at lounges and curated events.\n\nHA: You\u2019re currently part of several communities. Can you share a few that have helped shape your professional and personal growth?\n\nAN: I\u2019ve been a part of several communities, but the one that really helped a lot at the start of my career was Google Developer Groups(GDG). I was a co-organiser for GDG Ajah and a member of GDG Lagos. My involvement with them helped me meet many tech people at that time. Currently, I\u2019m VP for the Nigerian chapter of the VR/AR Association. The goal is to advocate for VR and AR usage in this region and let the world see what Nigerian companies are doing with VR and AR technology.\n\nHA: You\u2019re a young woman with a thriving career. Do you see yourself sticking with cloud engineering for a long time, or is there a career pivot in your future?\n\nAN: There\u2019s a career pivot in my future. I see myself taking on more roles that allow me to make business decisions within tech organisations pretty soon. Engineering decisions are fun, but I definitely want to take on roles that will enable me to make more business and product decisions at some point in my career.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nDid you know that YouTube can identify the most replayed parts of your video? This means you can skip some boring parts of YouTube videos. And no, you haven\u2019t missed out because the feature was introduced yesterday, May 18, 2022.\n\nThe company said it added a graph that people can use to quickly locate and watch parts played the most by other users. Per YouTube, \u201cif the graph is high, that part of the video has been replayed frequently.\u201d\n\nYouTube is also introducing another feature, Single Loop, which allows users to loop a video indefinitely. Moreover, in full-screen mode, a new panel will appear to display video information like the video description, video chapters, and comments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, YouTube is expanding support for video chapters to smart TVs and gaming consoles. It\u2019s a feature that enables users to skip ahead to a specific video section or easily rewatch that section.\n\nSo, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAutochek\u2019s new acquisition\n\nTikTok\u2019s Branded Mission\n\nBamba\u2019s $3.2 million seed\n\nJumia\u2019s earnings for Q1 2022\n\nAutochek acquires Morocco\u2019s KIFAL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutochek, a digital automotive commerce company, has acquired Morocco\u2019s KIFAL Auto.\n\nThis follows Autochek purchasing Cheki\u2019s subsidiaries in Ghana and Nigeria and collaborating with the CFAO Group to launch the network in Ivory Coast last year.\n\nConsequently, Autochek is now available in West Africa (Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast). It\u2019s also present in East Africa (Kenya and Uganda). And thanks to the acquisition of KIFAL Auto, it now has a presence in North Africa, specifically Morocco.\n\nLaunched in 2019 by Nizar Abdalaoui Maane, KIFAL claims it\u2019s one of the leading auto marketplaces in Morocco, one of Africa\u2019s largest markets for used and new cars.\n\nKIFAL Auto, like Autochek, connects car buyers and sellers and, through partnerships, provides financing and insurance.\n\nFollowing this acquisition, Maane and the KIFAL Auto team joins Autochek to lead the company\u2019s North African expansion efforts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Autochek, it has 1,500 dealers as partners across its markets and partnerships with over 70 financing partners, including Access Bank, Ecobank, UBA, Bank of Africa, and NCBA Bank.\n\nFor more information on this acquisition, listen to today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast here.\n\nTikTok to roll out a new ad product\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTikTok has announced the launch of \u201cBranded Mission,\u201d a new advertising product.\n\nWith this product, creators will be able to connect with brands and potentially earn rewards for their videos using this product.\n\nAdvertisers can use the new ad product for crowdsourcing content from creators and turning top-performing videos into ads. Also, they can launch branded campaigns and encourage creators to participate in them.\n\nThey\u2019ll create a brief and distribute it to the creator community to encourage them to participate in Branded Missions. TikTok creators can then choose which Branded Missions to join.\n\nIn summary, Branded Mission allows emerging and aspiring creators to respond to ad casting calls directly on TikTok.\n\nSo, who is eligible to participate? Branded Missions are open to all creators who are 18 years old and above and have at least 1,000 followers.\n\nPer TikTok, eligible creators whose videos are chosen by brands will \u201cbenefit from a cash payment and increased traffic.\u201d\n\nAlso, the company believes that this product will allow the TikTok community to have a creative hand in brand campaign ads.\n\nBranded Mission is currently in beta testing and is available to brands in over a dozen markets. Plus, it will be available in more markets later this year.\n\nSimilar, but kinda different: Recall that earlier this month, TikTok introduced Pulse, a new advertising program that allows brands to place advertisements alongside the platform\u2019s most popular videos.\n\nWell, the company emphasises that it is constantly looking for innovative ways to support creators and assist brands in reaching users on its platforms with relevant content.\n\nBesides, the product is currently available in 12 countries, with plans to expand into additional markets by the end of the year.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022) will take place in two days!

The startup is focused on simple tools for merchants to manage their customers, record stocks, receive payments, make payments, and access cash advances against their future cash flow.\n\nBamba aims to be one of the innovators in addressing the lack of digital solutions for record-keeping and payments, which creates a barrier that prevents these businesses from scaling due to insufficient access to credit facilities.\n\nConsequently, it plans to use the funds to expand its engineering team and user base in 12 sub-Saharan African countries where mobile money is prevalent.\n\nJumia\u2019s Q1 2022 report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJumia, the pan-African e-commerce company, announced its first-quarter financial results on Tuesday, May 17, 2022.\n\nOn today\u2019s podcast, Chimgozirim refers to Jumia as \u201c\u2026the guy who never fulfils his potential.\u201d What?! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d That was brutal, if you ask me. What do you think?\n\nAnyway, when you compare this report to the first quarter of 2021, you\u2019ll see how Jumia\u2019s results demonstrated consistent growth.\n\nNow, you\u2019re asking me how. Well, I\u2019ve got you. The report shows that Jumia experienced significant growth in orders, gross merchandise value (GMV), and revenue.\n\nIn other words, orders increased by 40% year on year, from 6.6 million to 9.3 million. GMV increased by 27% year on year, from $198.9 million to $252.7 million. And Jumia\u2019s revenue reached $47.6 million, up 44 percent from $33 million in Q1 2021.\n\nHowever, these figures fell far short of where the eCommerce giant ended 2021, with the last quarter recording GMV sales of $330 million, revenue of $62 million, and orders of 11.3 million.\n\nDespite \u201ccontinued global supply chain volatility for these categories,\u201d food delivery grew 86% year over year, while phones and electronics grew 19%.\n\nOther negatives include its Q1 2022 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) loss, at $53 million, up 70% year on year.\n\nIf you want to know why Chimgozirim said what he said, don\u2019t forget to listen to the podcast.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nSEC\u2019s rules: Crypto exchange CEOs to retire after 10 years\n\nOpportunities\n\nDo you breathe crypto or are you simply crypto-curious?

Using the National Identification Number (NIN), the organisation wants to track financial transactions in the country to tax Nigerians effectively. Your NIN will be required for any transaction you engage in, including paying school fees or purchasing a car.\n\nThis was how we kicked off proceedings on the Techpoint Africa podcast today. While this development could increase government revenues, Oluwanifemi wondered how good this could be in light of revelations that cast doubt on the safety of data collected by Nigerian government agencies.\n\nNext was a look at Jumia\u2019s financial report for the first quarter of 2022. Compared to Q1 2021, the company witnessed impressive growth with revenue growing to $47.6 million, orders growing to 9.3 million, and gross merchandise value hitting $252.7 million.\n\nWith the company announcing that it had acquired a payment service solution provider license (PSSP), we explored the possibility of the company growing its fintech footprints. We also touched briefly on its healthtech ambitions and its chances of survival.\n\nWe rounded up the day\u2019s discussion with news of Autochek\u2019s acquisition of the Moroccan cars marketplace KIFAL Autos and the viability of the BNPL model for cars. Emmanuel shared a Technext report that revealed that most car marketplaces in Nigeria made up to 150% profit from car sales. With many Nigerians earning below 200,000, it\u2019s not clear how profitable these companies could be in the long run.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion, please follow the links attached to get this episode on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and Google Podcasts.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued rules and guidelines for all crypto and digital asset service providers on Friday, May 13, 2022.\n\nThe rules in the document, New Rules on Issuance, Offering Platforms and Custody of Digital Assets, include:\n\nNew licence requirements for platforms that deal with digital assets\n\nCategorisation of the platforms\n\nGuidelines for their operations\n\nSEC Rules for virtual asset service providers (VASPs)\n\nAnyone offering crypto or digital assets-related service in Nigeria is a VASP. The categorisation of VASPs is further broken down into:\n\nDigital Assets Offering Platforms (DAOPs): These platforms enable the issuance of digital assets for fundraising purposes. They can also be called Initial Coin Offering platforms. You can liken it to a place where public companies offer their stocks for sale, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).\n\nDigital Asset Custodians (DACs): According to the SEC, \u201cthis means a person who provides the services of providing safekeeping, storing, holding or maintaining custody of virtual assets/digital tokens for another person\u2019s account.\u201d These are crypto wallets like Metamask and Trust Wallet. Crypto exchanges fall into these categories too because they offer wallet services.\n\nDigital Assets Exchange (DAX): This is \u201can electronic platform which facilitates the trading of a virtual asset or digital asset.\u201d They are simply crypto exchanges such as Binance and Quidax.\n\nWho are considered VASPs?\n\nThe SEC identifies any platform that facilitates trading, exchange, issuance, and digital and virtual assets transfer as VASPs. It is an umbrella term for a person or entity that uses/offers any crypto-related services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Commission did not mention any monetary requirement for the registration of VASPs, but there are several requirements and obligations for the registration.\n\nRules for crypto exchanges\n\nIn addition to the general requirements for all VASPs, registering as a Digital Assets Exchange (DAX) \u2014 crypto exchange \u2014 operator requires the following:\n\n\u20a6100,000 application fee ($240)\n\n\u20a6300,000 processing fee ($722.46)\n\n\u20a630 million registration fee ($72,000)\n\nMinimum paid-up capital of \u20a6500 million ($1.2 million)\n\nEvery exchange serving Nigerians must be duly certified by the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). This means exchanges such as Binance and Paxful will have to be registered with the CAC.\n\nEvery exchange will also have a SEC-approved board. The Commission will also approve the appointment of CEOs and other principal officers in exchanges.\n\nCEOs will hold office for no more than ten years. In the words of the SEC, \u201cThe Chief Executive Officer of a DAX Platform shall hold office for five years in the first instance and may be re-appointed for a further period of five years and no more.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commission did not clarify if the CEO\u2019s tenure period will be applied at one crypto exchange or at different exchanges.\n\nThis model is similar to the Nigerian Stock Exchange. The Nigerian Stock Exchange CEO, Oscar Onyema completed his 10-year tenure in April.\n\nExchanges will now be required to submit weekly and monthly trading information, quarterly, and annual financial reports, including compliance reports to the Commission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe SEC must also be notified before an exchange can cease trading operations. They are also not allowed to grant financial assistance to investors or employees to trade digital tokens.\n\nBefore any token or digital asset can be listed for trading on an exchange, the SEC must first issue a \u201cno objection\u201d approval for the token.\n\nThe exchange needs to demonstrate some level of information concerning the token or project. It must have the project\u2019s whitepaper \u2014 an informational document that contains why a token is being created, a roadmap and an incentive for investors \u2014 know its level of security, how secure its blockchain is and the number of nodes it has.\n\nIn addition, it should reveal if the project has suffered any hacks in the past and any security vulnerabilities it has.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s rules on exchanges signify a thorough understanding of how cryptocurrencies work. This has helped the Commission develop measures to protect crypto traders from trading scam tokens and ensure the safety of their funds in exchanges.\n\nHowever, sharing data with the SEC could be a privacy concern for many. Cryptocurrencies, after all, were created to give pseudonymity to financial transactions.\n\nSEC crypto regulations on creating or issuing tokens\n\nThere are currently 19,443 crypto tokens in existence, according to CoinMarketCap. Creating and issuing tokens is relatively easy, making it possible to develop scam tokens.\n\nWith crypto scammers stealing up to $14 billion in 2021, the need for even more protection for investors has never been more apparent.\n\nThe ease of token creation has led to the creation of popular scam tokens such as the Squid Token, which saw investors lose $3 million in two weeks.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s rules on token issuance are to tackle this problem and minimise victims of scam tokens.\n\nThe SEC will now require any business or entity looking to conduct an initial asset offering or initial coin offering (ICO) in Nigeria or targeting Nigerians to submit an assessment form and a draft of its white paper \u2014 an informational document that contains why a token is being created, a roadmap, and incentive for investors.\n\nAfter receiving all necessary filings, the Commission will take 30 days to determine if the project should be offered to Nigerians.\n\nBefore the assessment is complete, all digital asset offerings must have the disclaimer in the whitepaper clearly stating that the SEC has not determined if the asset is suitable for offerings or considered a security.\n\nAccording to the SEC, some digital assets can now constitute securities. The problem of identifying digital assets and cryptocurrencies has always been a major obstacle to their regulation.\n\nIf the SEC considers a digital asset a security under the Securities Act of 2007, the asset will be registered as a digital asset and security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does the SEC determine digital assets as security?\n\nGenerally, a security is a financial instrument that holds monetary value, can be traded publicly, and represents part ownership in a company that has gone public.\n\nFor example, company stocks, bonds and mutual funds are examples of securities. Buying Tesla stock, for example, means you own securities and are a part-owner of the company.\n\nTherefore, it can be inferred that a digital asset that has the characteristics of a security will be considered a security by the SEC.\n\nIn the crypto world, governance tokens are examples of such tokens. They represent a level of ownership or control of an entity, and holders of the token have a right to vote on how a company should be run.\n\nThere\u2019s a \u20a610 billion ($24 million) cap on the amount of money that can be raised through digital assets.\n\nIn recent years, we\u2019ve seen crypto-focused companies try to raise money by issuing crypto tokens to the public. The SEC\u2019s new rules would mean that if a company, say Bitmama, wants to raise funds by issuing tokens, it has to do so on a platform that is VASP registered.\n\nIf the asset offering is to raise money for an entity that deals with digital/virtual assets, then it is a VASP and will need the proper registration to be considered as such.\n\nRules for Digital Assets Offering Platforms (DAOPs)\n\nDAOPs are platforms where digital assets are issued. They can also be called ICO platforms. Tokens are issued on these platforms for people to buy by entities looking to raise money. It is the same way public companies like Tesla and Google sell stocks. Registration for DAOPs is also quite similar to DAXs.\n\nApplication fee of \u20a6100,000 ($240)\n\nProcessing fee of \u20a6300,000 ($722.46)\n\nRegistration fee of \u20a630 million ($72,000)\n\nMinimum paid-up capital of \u20a6500 million ($1.2 million)\n\nAccording to the SEC, DAOPs are expected to carry out due diligence on all digital asset offerings and determine whether to approve them or not. They\u2019re also expected to provide investors with updated information on all digital asset offerings.\n\nLimitations to SEC\u2019s rules\n\nDecentralisation of the crypto space has been a significant challenge to its regulation, and the SEC\u2019s rule does not clearly state its regulatory plans for VASPs operating in the decentralised space.\n\nWhile the Commission can control what goes on in centralised exchanges, it is unaware of what people do on decentralised exchanges where no know-your-customer (KYC) protocol is required.\n\nEnforcing the rules on token issuance and determining which are securities is also limited by decentralised structures of crypto tokens.\n\nTokens that have the characteristics of securities are usually governance tokens mainly used by Decentralised Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and are governed by smart contracts that carry out any actions agreed upon.\n\nWhile the SEC has its rules, following them could be a choice for some VASPs. However, the SEC can bank on investors to only invest in VASPs approved by the Commission for their safety.\n\nOf course, this is not a given.\n\nFor centralised and international crypto companies like Binance, it will be interesting to see how the SEC plans to enforce its rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has decried the country\u2019s over-dependence on crude oil, restating the need to enhance the nation\u2019s global competitiveness through increased investment in agriculture.\n\nThe governor, who described the dependence on oil as unsustainable, noted that with increased investment in agriculture, the country will be able to grow sufficient produce to ensure food security, create jobs and improve the livelihoods of citizens.\n\nObaseki spoke while addressing members of the Plantation Owners Forum of Nigeria (POFON), who were on a courtesy visit, at the Government House, Benin City.\n\nPredicting a bleak future with the country\u2019s current overreliance on crude oil, Obaseki said there\u2019s an urgent need to diversify as the nation\u2019s dependence on oil has not been able to enhance the global competitiveness of its economy.\n\nThe governor, however, noted that his administration remains committed to economic diversification through agriculture and will sustain programmes and reforms aimed at boosting the sector and ensuring food security.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs a people and as a country, it is all about economic competitiveness. Whether we like it or not, the current DNA of the Nigerian economy is being forced to change. That means our overreliance on crude oil has not increased our global competitiveness, particularly in the oil trade.\n\n\u201cFor us in Edo, we, fortunately, saw this coming and we have prepared ourselves for this transition that we are witnessing. We are in a race against time, just reading the news and seeing what other countries are going through as a result of the Ukrainian war.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cIt\u2019s really scary that we cannot continue in this direction. Last week, Indonesia and Malaysia banned the export of oil palm. Specifically for us in Edo, agriculture is key because food production is our priority. First, let\u2019s feed ourselves and the extra we have, we will use it to trade.\n\n\u201cWe are glad that we have members of the Plantation Owners Forum of Nigeria. You can say whatever you want about agriculture, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s about skill and the training of the personnel, which I believe is the most important aspect in agriculture.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get all of these right, we cannot compete. We need to be able to produce at a competitive rate to be able to sell. So, that is why I want to encourage you to continue what you are doing. For us in Edo, we have a huge opportunity and a unique advantage because you can\u2019t transverse Nigeria without coming to Edo,\u201d the governor added.\n\nEarlier, the Chairman of POFON, Mr. Emmanuel Ibru, who identified the importance of agriculture to the economy, said Edo is one of their major palm oil-producing states in the country as most of their major stakeholders are from Edo.\n\nCommending the governor for his initiatives to boost agriculture development in the state, he noted, \u201cWe know that Edo has been making giant strides in various oil palm initiatives. We want to commend you once again.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, on Wednesday, received members of the Bayelsa State Due Process Bureau who were in the state to understudy Edo\u2019s e-procurement system, with the governor charging states on effective management of resources to improve the lives of the citizens.\n\nObaseki, while speaking to the delegates at the Government House in Benin City, noted that e-procurement remains key for states with scarce financial resources to deliver on their mandate, ensuring sustainable growth and development.\n\nThe governor said Edo State\u2019s procurement process has moved from analog to digital system which introduced a new level of transparency that has continued to address all forms of manipulations and corruption in the procurement process.\n\nHe noted, \u201cIn view of the scarcity of resources, it is important to appropriately manage the resources available and put them to proper and greater use for the benefit of the people. It\u2019s only an effective and transparent e-procurement process that can make it possible to achieve this.\n\n\u201cE-procurement helps in managing scarce financial resources effectively and it propels development and progress. E-procurement is key, especially for states that don\u2019t have much financial resources. Effectively managing the little resources available helps the developmental efforts.\u201d\n\nObaseki further stated, \u201cAbout 12 years ago, we had the privilege of seeking budget support facilities from the World Bank and the emphasis was on the need for a stronger procurement unit. Nobody wants to give you money if they are not sure that you can spend it properly.\n\n\u201cWe have one of the oldest e-procurement units in the country. We have moved from the analog era to the technology era in our procurement system in Edo State. We have a system where we procure properly. We have found that technology is the way to go. We now use technology to facilitate our procurement process in the state.\n\n\u201cTechnology introduces a different level of transparency that will fight all forms of manipulations because it allows everyone to see the records at the same time, unlike manual process, thereby eliminating all forms of corrupt acts.\n\n\u201cThe transparent procurement process has a lot of benefits for the state as it helps in so many ways. When procuring infrastructure and other services, it is important to have a robust system that becomes a culture. It is important because it\u2019s in the best interest of the people, and the best approach to improving the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cIGR is difficult to collect and after collecting it, it becomes obligatory to explain to the people how you spent the money,\u201d the governor added.\n\nThe leader of the delegation, Aaron Nicodemus Timiye, who is the Director-General of Bayelsa State Due Process Bureau hailed Edo for establishing a world-class procurement process that has become a template for other states.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are here to study the public procurement process, specifically the e-procurement system. We are here to exchange notes and ideas on e-procurement, and possible ways of improving our e-procurement process as Edo State is far ahead of Bayelsa State in terms of e-procurement.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

The governor must do something urgently.\n\n\u201cWe are appealing to the government of Edo state for a solution to plight at hand.\n\n\u201cMoreover, Edo State should be concentrating on how to move the economy of the state forward, not forgetting the potentials of making Edo state the number one tourist state in Nigeria if not in Africa especially now that our stolen \u2018Benin bronzes\u2019 have been returned\u201d, she said.\n\nOboh-Macleod said the people of Ugboha, Ubiaja and other neighbouring communities in Esan land have continued to live in perpetual fears consequent upon the activities of the killer herdsmen who have constantly rain terror on them.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s being done to the people of Esanland in Edo state is inhumane. It\u2019s like genocide.\n\n\u201d Esan people are mainly farmers and the land and the forest means a lot because that\u2019s where we get our livelihood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now being occupied by barbaric hoodlums masquerading as purported Fulani herdsmen whom are alleged to be heavily armed always\u201d, she said.\n\nShe alleged that the herdsmen are raping women in front of their husbands and children in front of their parents, actively kidnapping asking for ransom but allegedly killing most and harvesting their human organs in a professional way and still collecting ransom because they know that traditionally, they believe in laying to rest their dead ones.\n\nShe said this act is becoming rampant hence this call to Save Esan Land.\n\nShe also alleged that the security force have turned a blind eye or are inadequate so they urge the governor of Edo state as their elected Chief Security Officer to save their lives and properties because they are now afraid to go out of their houses, with their farms occupied.\n\nAccording to her \u201cWe are now starving and we fear they we come and drive us out of our home soon, a close relative said to me recently.\n\n\u201cThe high level of insecurity is unacceptable.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government has declined giving approval for the proposed Seplat Energy\u2019s acquisition of oil and gas assets belonging to Mobil Oil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (MPNU).\n\nThe federal government, in its formal response declining the approved, cited overriding national interest.\n\nThis was made known by the Chief Executive Officer of Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), Engr. Gbenga Komolafe, in two separate letters dated May 13, 2022, addressed to the Chairman/ Managing Director, Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited, Mr. Richard Laing as well as the immediate past Chairman of Seplat Energy, Dr. ABC Orjiako.\n\nKomolafe had in the letter maintained that regardless of the mode of the transaction, Mobil Oil still remains to all intents and purposes, the assignor of the asset under Nigerian law.\n\nKomolafe stated, \u201cWe also note that MPNU failed to follow the procedure for assignments laid down in the Guidelines by not providing the requisite notices to the Commission at all relevant stages of the transaction. Even if the transaction has been between Seplat Energy Offshore Limited and the MPNU shareholders, responsibility to ensure compliance with Nigerian laws, rules and regulations always remain that of MPNU, the entity that was awarded the assets.\n\n\u201cWe regret to inform you that His Excellency, the Minister of Petroleum Resources has declined his consent to the transaction.\n\n\u201cNothing in this letter shall be deemed to be a waiver, on the part of the Commission, of any rights under the Guidelines, any law, rule or regulation, and the Commission reserves all its rights in respect of the subject matter. Please accept the assurances of my highest esteem,\u201d the Commission\u2019s boss stated in the letter addressed to Laing, with reference number: NUPRC/LD/1189/01, titled: \u201cRe: Potential Sale and Purchase of the Equity (Shares) of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited.\u201d\n\nKomolafe in his letter obtained by ThisDay, also made reference to the multinational oil company\u2019s letter dated March 30, 2022 with Ref: MPN-PGA-NUP-CCE-0322-0027 on the above subject matter.\n\nHe highlighted the contents of the letter MPNU wrote then to the NUPRC on the proposed acquisition, and in particular, the section that stated that the transaction was between parties who were not privy to the Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) between the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and the MPNU dated June 28, 1990, and that does not trigger any relevant rights or obligations under the JOA for either NNPC or MPNU.\n\nSimilarly, the MPNU had stated in the letter that the sale of shares by shareholders of MPNU would have no bearing on the consent or preferential right and option requirements of the JOA in favour of NNPC and that the NNPC does not have preferential rights in respect to the transaction.\n\nIn addition, the regulator made reference to another aspect of the letter Mobil wrote to it on the matter that, the MPNU shareholders would be proceeding with their efforts to satisfy the conditions required for the approval of the proposed transaction, and the procurement of the consent of the Minister of Petroleum Resources.\n\nGoing further, the Commission pointed out that: \u201cYou may also be aware that the Commission is in receipt of a letter of 10th March 2022, written by Seplat Energy to the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, requesting the consent of the Minister of Petroleum Resources to the transaction. This letter was received by the Commission on March 30, 2022.\n\n\u201cPlease be advised that even if the transaction in question were between parties who are not privy to the JOA, MPNU remains the leaseholder of the assets subject to the transaction and the focal point of contact with the federal government of Nigeria on any matter or dealings with the assets.\n\n\u201cAlso note that overriding National interest will always be the compass of the law. Paragraph 3.1.1 of the guidelines also expressly restates that assignment shall include, but not be limited to: \u2018assignment by way of exchange or transfer of shares: This shall entail the acquisition of part or all of the shares of a company which holds an OPL, OML, MF or OGPL in Nigeria",

Nigeria, like every other multinational state requires leaders who can formulate ideologies, policies and programmes aimed at galvanizing or harmonising the diverse component units at all times.\n\n\u201cThis accounts for such federal government schemes as the National Youth Service, Federal Government (unity) Colleges and other unifying national bodies.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, remarks with centrifugal dynamics are deliberately avoided in order to engender a genuine unity for the multicultural and multinational units of the country.\u201d\n\nThe group added, \u201cWe reiterate that the broadcast by Baba Ahmed is a threat to peace and unity of the country and the security agencies should act on time to serve as a deterrent to some others harbouring such mindsets against the unity and corporate existence of Nigeria.\u201d",

          "text": "The Sir Ahmadu Bello Memorial Foundation (SABMF) has noted with serious concern the myriad of challenges bedeviling Nigeria including insecurity (especially in Northern region), poor educational system (disruption of academic activities in the tertiary institutions), economic backwardness, epileptic power supply and weak social and moral institutions.\n\nThis is just as the foundation also averred that the socio-economic unrest in the north could eventually turn everywhere to miasma of bloodletting, if necessary, steps were not taken.\n\nThis formed part of a communique issued at the end of the 26th joint meeting of the Board of Trustees and Advisory Council during which the Foundation reviewed the challenges of the Country.\n\nAccording to the communique which was signed by the Director-General/CEO Engr Abubakar Gambo Umar, the meeting urged the federal government to redouble its efforts to bring an end to the alarming rate of insecurity in the country which has instituted fear and uncertainty in the land, hampers people\u2019s self-confidence, and endangers their mobility across the nation.\n\nThe foundation noted that the sad event has also limited farmers\u2019 access to their farmlands which results in lack of adequate food security in the country. It added that insecurity has contributed to the unbearable upsurge in the prices of food items and other essential amenities which makes life difficult for many Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on all concerned security agencies to check and control the escalating rate of kidnappings and several other acts of banditry which are on the prowl in almost all nooks and crannies of the country, especially the North.\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate situation is a serious threat to the status of the country\u2019s internal security, despite efforts and strategies put in place by the government to end the menace, the situation continues to spread unabatedly like wildfire, devastating lives, and properties of innocent citizens.\n\n\u201cThe meeting condemned the broad daylight attack on the Kaduna International Airport by bandits and the deadly attack on the Abuja-Kaduna bound train that left many dead, wounded and several others abducted. These attacks are in addition to several other attacks on soft spots across the Northern region especially Kaduna, Katsina, Sokoto, Taraba, Zamfara and Niger states.\n\n\u201cThe meeting noted that the state of socio-economic unrest in the North will eventually turn everywhere to miasma of bloodletting. Therefore, necessary actions need to be taken immediately to prevent the occurrence of the predicted event.\u201d",

          "text": "It was end of the road for a notorious cult leader of the Iceland Confraternity, Otobong Moses, who was killed in a bloody shootout with the Military Joint Task Force (JTF) during raids of militants\u2019 hideouts in Etim Ekpo and Ukanafun local government areas of Akwa Ibom State on Wednesday night.\n\nThe operations, which lasted for two days, were carried out by the JTF, comprising operatives of the Police and Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) led by troops of the 2 Brigade of the Nigerian Army, Ibagwa, Abak local government area of the State.\n\nIt was gathered that the cult leader, who was said to have killed over 25 people in Etim Ekpo and neighbouring Ukanafun LGAs, was shot dead during the raid of his \u2018palace\u2019 in Obon Ebot village in Etim Ekpo.\n\nThe Assistant Director in-charge of Army Public Relations at 2 Brigade, Capt. Samuel Akari, told journalists that two of Moses\u2019 gang members were captured alive, adding that two kidnapped victims were also rescued during the operations while assorted ammunition were recovered.\n\nHe listed the items to include assorted charms, sub-machine guns, magazines, 67 rounds of 9mm ammunition, two motorcycles, 16 mobile phones, one AK-47 rifle, magazine with 30 rounds of 7.62mm special ammunition and nine machetes.\n\nBesides, two military monkey jackets, one helmet strapped with military camouflage, one military Police beret, one Police camouflage face cap, one military pullover, ATM cards, two TV sets, a standing fan, decoder and four generating sets were recovered.\n\nAkari, who explained that the operations were in line with the operational directive of the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) and Akwa Ibom government, to rid the State of criminal elements, warned that no stone would be left unturned in restoring peace in troubled areas of the State ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cThe raid operation was as a result of sustained surveillance of the activities of the notorious kingpin and his syndicate.\n\n\u201cThe first phase of the operations was conducted on May 12, and during the operation, troops raided the criminal hideout, but on sighting the troops, the criminals abandoned their hideout and fled.\n\n\u201cThe gallant troops rescued the kidnapped victims and arrested other collaborators and set ablaze the shrine, the hideout and assorted charms.\n\n\u201cFurther investigation revealed that the criminal gang is known for terrorising the locals, kidnapping them for ransom, killing and burying others who could not pay the ransom in shallow graves,\u201d Akari said.\n\nMeanwhile, there was jubilation by the locals in Etim Ekpo, over the killing of the cult leader, who, according to them had usurped the powers of several village heads in Etim Ekpo, especially Obong clan.\n\n\u201cHe used to hold court and administer judgment of people in his palace. If a husband err, according to his ruling, you will be flogged by your wife and fine imposed on you. If you are not able to pay the fine, your property would be seized. It is a big relief for us in Obon Ebot village because the village can no longer preside over cases,\u201d Imaobong Akpan, a resident told journalists.\n\n\u201cHe was in the habit of raping people with his gang members and most of his activities were encouraged by our local politicians here, who used him against political opponents in election season like this,\u201d Eteudobong Inyang, one of the jubilant locals also said.\n\nA village head, who would not want his name in print, lamented that, \u201cI have been chased away from my palace several times by these gangsters.\n\n\u201cThey would stop harvesting of the village palm trees for a year. After that Oto will order his gang members to harvest them and sold to village women with all the proceeds seized.\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, urged Governor Udom Emmanuel to ensure the dreaded confraternities in the state are completely outlawed.\n\nRecall that Governor Emmanuel had since 2019 placed a ban on no fewer than 64 cult groups operating in the state and amnesty granted to several of them, who came out of the bushes, renounced cult membership and dropped their arms for government\u2019s sponsored vocational jobs.",

This conduct is exemplary.\n\n\u201cWe also salute him for his bold declaration that there can be no advancement unless there is restructuring. Aspiring politicians to public office must have a clear vision of how to solve socio-economic problems.\n\n\u201cThe ability to identify issues of development and the capacity to tackle the same mark out genuine leaders.\n\n\u201cIt is mollifying to witness the growing acceptance of experimentation, conceived as an exigent but integral and indispensable part of a comprehensive programme for an effective security system in a country which faces serious challenges of redefinition.\n\n\u201cThis acknowledgement is an open challenge to all the States, which have availed themselves of the benefits of an outfit borne of ingenious and audacious insistence to protect lives and property, to keep improving to clear the vestiges of doubt arising from misunderstanding or outright mischief.\u201d",

We enjoin all patriots to look critically into the issues bordering on the challenges faced by the country as a result of the current system.\n\n\u201cDevolution of powers must be perceived as necessary for the development of the country.\n\nThere can be no meaningful progress in a system where the Federating units are treated as mere outposts for the central administration.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe just read in the news the statement credited to the Governor of Bauchi State and presidential aspirant on the platform of the People\u2019s Democratic Party, Dr Bala Mohammed, on the Western Nigeria Security Network, code-named Amotekun.\n\n\u201cHe spoke on the need to restructure the polity for real development. He identified this ingenious design to save the lives and property of our people as necessary.\n\n\u201cWe commend him for the rare courage exhibited at a time when it is considered expedient to cling to equivocation and outright denial of the obvious for political correctness. This conduct is exemplary.\n\n\u201cWe also salute him for his bold declaration that there can be no advancement unless there is restructuring. Aspiring politicians to public office must have a clear vision of how to solve socio-economic problems.\n\n\u201cThe ability to identify issues of development and the capacity to tackle the same mark out genuine leaders.\n\n\u201cIt is mollifying to witness the growing acceptance of experimentation, conceived as an exigent but integral and indispensable part of a comprehensive programme for an effective security system in a country which faces serious challenges of redefinition.\n\n\u201cThis acknowledgement is an open challenge to all the States, which have availed themselves of the benefits of an outfit borne of ingenious and audacious insistence to protect lives and property, to keep improving to clear the vestiges of doubt arising from misunderstanding or outright mischief.\u201d",
          "summary": "The chairman of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum (SGF) and governor of Ondo State, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has faulted the 1999 Constitution (as amended), which places security in the exclusive legislative list.\nAkeredolu also faulted the concept of federalism being practised in the country.\nHe said, \u201cWe hold it as self-evident that a federal state must put in place a system of administration which reflects its heterogeneous character.\n\u201cThe Federating units must progress from the semblance of autonomy to the recognition of their unique features which justify their existence.\n\u201cThe ability to identify issues of development and the capacity to tackle the same mark out genuine leaders.",

There was a building which was about to collapse, so our attention then was to get an excavator to ensure the building didn\u2019t fall on the general public. So that\u2019s what we were busy doing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe building now collapsed and the issue of whether it\u2019s a cylinder or not is not our own priority then. Our priority was to rescue the people who are inside the building that collapsed.\n\n\u201cSo now the government will set up a committee to fully investigate the actual cause of the explosion. So it doesn\u2019t matter whether the welder was using electricity or gas cylinder. The investigation will show whether he was using electricity or not. But all we are saying is that it\u2019s not a bomb blast,\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople can say anything because they want negative thinking. But if it\u2019s a bomb blast, and it has already happened, what is the interest there? Why do people insist it must be a bomb blast? What happened has already happened.

          "text": "Minister of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), Mallam Muhammad Musa Bello, has revealed that the violence that erupted at one of Abuja\u2019s popular markets in Dei-Dei was not triggered by religion or ethnicity, but criminal elements.\n\nMallam Bello who spoke Wednesday evening when he visited the market to ascertain the cause and extent of the violence which claimed four lives and resulted in the razing of shops and vehicles within the market.\n\nAccompanied by the Chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council, Mr Abdullahi Adamu Candido, FCT Commissioner of Police Mr Sunday Babaji and other top security and senior officials of the FCTA, the Minister met with the various market and community leaders and took an assessment tour of damage in the market.\n\nSpeaking passionately after the tour, the Minister said \u201cAfter an emergency security meeting with the relevant security agencies including the Commissioner of Police and the Director of the DSS and senior management officials of the FCT, we decided to come here.\n\n\u201cAnd we came here specifically because on the social media, all kinds of stories are being circulated saying there is an inter-ethnic crisis in Abuja with one tribe fighting against the other. I have come here and met the leadership of the market, I have met the leadership of the communities and met the political leadership as represented by the Chairman and vice chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council, and what really came out very clearly was that this was an accident that occurred when a lady on a commercial motorcycle fell off and a vehicle ran over her and unfortunately, she passed on.\n\n\u201cAs a result of this incident tension rose and hoodlums took over and like they do everywhere in the world, their target is economic assets and they burnt down a substantial part of the timber market and other markets around here and they burnt many vehicles.\n\n\u201cThere was no communal clash here and I appeal to all residents of Abuja to continue to live here as we have always lived in peace as the center of unity.\u201d\n\nThe Minister called on the community leaders to work at fishing out the bag eggs within their folds and help in bringing them to justice.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhat I told the community leaders is that they have to fish out the hoodlums and the bad eggs amongst them. This is because this time around, hoodlums carried arms and they shot innocent people. This is very sad and totally, unequivocally, unacceptable in Abuja.\u201d\n\nHe said a full scale investigation will be carried out by the security organisations with the full collaboration of the affected communities adding, \u201cI am appealing to other communities within the FCT that this is not a tribal or religious misunderstanding.

Though the process is ongoing, agitation and struggle over delegates among 2023 presidential aspirants are making it difficult for the party to conclude the process.\u201d\n\nThe source also disclosed that \u201cthe party is working round the clock to resolve all issues and complete the compilation of the delegates\u2019 list to meet up with the INEC deadline.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "title": "Border Demarcation, A Big Challenge In The Curbing Of Petrol Smuggling \u2013 Customs",
          "text": "\u2026stakeholders call for deployment of technology\n\nThe Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has identified inappropriate border demarcations and massive physical territory at Nigeria\u2019s borders with neighboring countries as major challenges in stemming the increasing rate of petrol smuggling.\n\nThe disclosure is coming on the heels of a recent investigation by The Cable, which exposed that petrol smuggling across Nigerian borders is booming and aided by a conspiracy between security agencies, cartels, and non-state actors.\n\nDeputy Comptroller of Customs, Timi Bomodi, who made known the challenges of Customs in tackling petrol smuggling in the border communities, said the service has been devising strategies to reduce smuggling along Nigeria\u2019sporous borders.\n\nHe disclosed that the customs service is applying the rules in ensuring that bad eggs within and outside the service are dealt with appropriately.\n\nBomodi\u2019s revelations came during an anti-corruption radio programme, PUBLIC CONSCIENCE, produced by the Progressive Impact Organization for Community Development, PRIMORG, Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nExplaining the difficulties with border demarcations, Bomodi had this to say: \u201dWe have families that are spread between both countries, and we have houses that are sitting in the middle of these borderlines, and you can\u2019t tell. The frontage of a house may be in Nigeria, and the back of the house is in Niger, so it is in Cameroon, so it is in Benin, and in these other places.\n\n\u201cCommunities are split between Nigeria\u2019s neighboring countries because their lives are always interfacing. It becomes difficult to manage since it is not a straightforward approach that any government can adopt, but it is important to note all these factors. Then you can appreciate the efforts of the Nigeria Customs Service is making to stem the incidence of smuggling petroleum products.\u201d\n\nBomodi, who doubles as the Public Relations Officer of Customs, also disclosed that the Service is confronted by a lack of adequate personnel to man the border territories while assuring their continued efforts to fight corruption within the service. He added that strategies and technology are already reducing petrol smuggling across Nigeria\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cIn the past three or four years, the service (NCS) has dismissed, demoted, and suspended a huge number of its complicit personnel in any smuggling.\n\n\u201cIt is not only border officers. We are talking about officers that work even in the ports or airports, there are sanctions, and the current Comptroller General is indeed very strict about this.\n\n\u201cNigeria Customs Service is gradually tilting towards minimizing physical contact in all its activities. We are deploying technology and moving into the era of e-Customs,\u201d Bomodi stated.\n\nReacting to the investigation, the Executive Director, Center for Transparency Advocacy, Faith Nwadishi, noted that impunity is the primary reason petrol smuggling is still thriving across Nigeria\u2019s borders. She backed the deployment of technology in customs operations at the border posts while urging citizens to demand accountability from public servants and always report corruption.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we keep giving estimates of local consumption of petrol that we have in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe solution is that Nigerians should wake up. We have to demand accountability because when we don\u2019t demand accountability, nobody gets it. It is not for the security agencies alone, or those in government or NASS,\u201d Nwadishi said.\n\nOn his part, the Executive Secretary, Anti-corruption Network, Hon. Ebenezar Oyetakin stated that different forms of corruption plague Nigeria and that the lack of will is a major reason smuggling could not be nipped in the bud.\n\nOyetakin suggested the establishment of petrol stations in neighboring countries to reduce smuggling drastically.\n\nHe backed the calls for technology to be deployed in Customs operations.\n\nEarlier on, an investigative journalist with TheCable, James Ojo, had disclosed that petrol smugglers at borders communities across the country are organized in connivance with security personnel.\n\nAccording to Ojo, smugglers pay an agreed amount to have a free passage with the petrol they bought from the Nigerian side.\n\nTo stem the tide of smuggling of petrol within Nigeria\u2019s borders, Ojo called for more robust border control and urged the Nigeria Customs to evaluate and monitor the activities of their personnel more.\n\n\u201cWe (NCS) have to carry out evaluations to ensure that the officials are doing what they are supposed to do. We need a strong border control system, and there should be a kind of monitoring or a kind of whistleblower policy to track the area or places involved in all these corrupt activities,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), 116.46 million liters of petrol valued at N18. 88bn was stolen in 2021. Consequently, the increased smuggling of petrol across Nigeria\u2019s borders has pressured the NNPC to meet the national daily demand, currently estimated at 72.72 million liters.\n\nPublic Conscience is a syndicated weekly anti-corruption radio program used by PRIMORG to draw government and citizens\u2019 attention to corruption and integrity issues in Nigeria.\n\nThe program has the support of the MacArthur Foundation.",

          "text": "By Eunice Orike\n\nAs part of economic diversification priority of the present administration, the Federal Government and Czech Republic has launched a Call for Public Proposals on Delta-2 Programme worth $16.2 million Co-funding Research and Development R&D,project.\n\nThe Delta-2 Programme is the cooperation model of the Technology Agency of Czech Republic TA CR, running for the period from 2020-2025, through which TA CR sponsors applied research and innovation of manufacturing companies and innovative institutions.\n\nNigeria had just become new beneficiary of the programme.\n\nIt could be recalled that Nigeria and Czech Republic signed a Memorandum of Understanding MoU, in 2014, in Prague by NASENI and TA CR on some critical areas of technology transfer and innovations which had resulted in the Co-Funding of Czech-Nigeria Bilateral R&D Project on Delta-2 Programme.\n\nSpeaking at the launching of the programme, the Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive of the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure NASENI, Engr. Prof. Mohammed Sani Haruna said the Call for Public Proposal for the Delta-2 programme is one of the projects to be implemented under the Agreement between the two countries.\n\nAccording to Haruna, the priority areas of the MoU which includes Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Research, agricultural and Food Technology, Mining Industrial Development among others were unable to take off earlier due to bureaucracy until the Presidential Implementation Committee PICTT, on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between Nigeria and Czech Republic, PICTT was inaugurated by President Muhammed Buhari in November 2020.\n\n\u201cThe PICTT would be sourcing technologies from the Czech Republic\u2019s manufacturing companies; tertiary; research; and development institutions. The sum of CZK 250 million (250 million Czech Koruna, approximately US$10.5 million) has been a allocated as research fund by the government of the Czech Republic, through the TA CR and will be supplemented by NASENI on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria to the sum of 2,000,000,000 or US5.7 million\u201d.\n\n\u201cTechnology acquisition and domestication through this collaboration will help in bridging technology gap between Nigeria and the advanced countries of the West and to facilitate Nigeria\u2019s transition to a manufacturing economy. Indeed, deployment of technology is crucial to mitigate our socio-economic and security challenges. The Delta-2 Programme is uniquely designed to catalyze technology transfer and mobilize positive interventions and investments among private sectors and relevant stakeholders in Nigeria and Czech Republic for technology advancement. The project seeks to mobilize investments to help developing countries like Nigeria meet their needs for environmentally sound technology\u201d, he explained.\n\nHowever, he noted that the output of the collaborative projects are expected to yield patents, pilot plants, development of proven technologies, industrial designs, prototypes, functional samples, software, certified methodologies processes and specialized maps, databases, commercialization among others.\n\nIn his welcome address, the Chairman Presidential Implementation Committee on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Czech Republic, Dr. Muhammed Dahiru said the Launch of Call for Public Proposals which is simultaneously being hosted by the TA CR and at least eight other participating countries is the first part of the project procedure/schedule on TA CR Delta-2 programme for Bilateral cooperation in Applied Research and Technology Transfer for Agriculture, Mining and General Manufacturing.\n\n\u201cResearch and Development R&D, proposals are now invited from Nigeria academic community, research and development institutions, as well as private companies or entrepreneurs and independent researchers on the three priority areas of Agriculture and Food Technology; Mining and Industrial Development; and General Manufacturing for SMEs Development\u201d, he said.",

          "text": "New York state authorities have launched an investigation into several social media platforms they believe the accused Buffalo grocery store gunman used to plan, promote and broadcast the attack that left 10 dead, state Attorney General Letitia James said on Wednesday.\n\nGovernor Kathy Hochul unveiled several additional measures aimed at combating domestic terrorism, including legislation to tighten New York gun laws and a directive for state police to exercise their authority to disarm individuals deemed a public threat.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nJames, responding to a referral letter from Hochul to investigate social media\u2019s role in the massacre, said her inquiry will focus on Twitch, the live video service owned by Amazon.com (AMZN.O), as well as the internet chat site Discord, online message boards 4chan and 8chan, and other platforms \u201cthe shooter used to amplify his attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis terror attack again revealed the depths and dangers of these platforms that spread and promote hate without consequence,\u201d James said. \u201cWe are doing everything in our power to stop this dangerous behavior now and ensure it never happens again.\u201d\n\nThe FBI said Payton Gendron, who is white, committed an act of \u201cracially motivated violent extremism\u201d on Saturday when he opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle at a grocery store in a predominantly African-American neighborhood of Buffalo, shooting 13 people. Most of the victims were Black. Ten died.\n\nAuthorities said Gendron, 18, had broadcast the attack in real time on Twitch before surrendering to police, and was believed to have posted a white supremacist manifesto and a lengthy check list and account of his preparations on social media before the rampage.\n\nGendron has been jailed without bond on a charge of first-degree murder. He pleaded not guilty.\n\n\u2018FEEDING FRENZY\u2019 OF HATE\n\nTwitch said in a statement the day of the shooting that it had removed the livestream less than two minutes after it started and was working to ensure no other accounts re-posted the content.\n\nHochul, blaming social media platforms for a \u201cfeeding frenzy\u201d of violent extremist ideology propagating on the internet, said Twitch should have taken down the video of the shooting \u201cwithin a second.\u201d\n\nScreenshots from the broadcast circulated on social media through the day, including some that appeared to show the gunman standing over a body in the grocery store.

          "title": "VP Osinbajo Laments Unprecedented Leakages in Nigeria\u2019s Tax System",
          "text": "Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, on Wednesday said Nigeria is confronted with unprecedented leakages in tax administration.\n\nHe said the situation had threatened fiscal stability in all the tiers of government adding that the revenue leakage is not unconnected with corruption in the tax system.\n\nThe vice president spoke at the opening of the 24th Annual Tax Conference of the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (CITN), themed, \u201cGlobal Disruption and Digitisation: Implications for Socio-Economic Development.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo also warned that signing unto the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) corporate tax treaty would further, \u201ccompound the issue of leakages in our tax system\u201d.\n\nIn October 2021, Nigeria rejected the tax agreement signed by 136 countries, to enforce a corporate tax rate of at least 15 per cent.\n\nThe countries agreed to the pact amid concerns that multinational companies were re-routing their profits through low tax jurisdictions to cut their bills. The measures were also part of efforts to take advantage of the emerging digital economy.\n\nHowever, justifying the decision of the country not to endorse the deal, Osinbajo said it would worsen leakages in tax administration.\n\nRepresented at the conference by the Executive Chairman, Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Mr. Muhammad Nami, the VP said the conditions set out in the agreement would further shortchange the country of the needed revenues.\n\nYet, there had been growing concerns by experts that the country stands to benefit more by signing unto the agreement.\n\nBut the VP, while addressing the gathering of tax professional clarified that, \u201cWe didn\u2019t sign not because we wanted to do it in our own way but one, you have a requirement that for you to be able to tax any digital player or any multinational enterprises globally, that company of enterprise must have annual turnover of $20 billion. That was the first concern.\n\n\u201cThe second concern is the averaging mechanism. This $20 billion turnover is not just for the accounting year but for an average of three years. So that enterprise must make $20 billion for three consecutive years otherwise that enterprise would never pay in any country it operates in except to the country of origin.\u201d\n\nContinuing, he said, \u201cAnother key thing that caught our attention is that 20 per cent of this $20 billion must be generated in a country like Nigeria else, whatever business that enterprise does in Nigeria, we cannot subject it to any tax in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAbove all, we should not forget our tax law. The minimum turnover you require as a business in Nigeria to be able to register with the FIRS and pay taxes in Nigeria today is just N25 million.\n\n\u201cAnd for somebody that makes less than 10 per cent of $20 billion which I believe is about $2 billion in Nigeria and that person will not pay tax in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI think that injustice is unimaginable, it is wrong and we will stand firm and say we will not accept it, and that\u2019s why we rejected signing the agreement.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo said, \u201cIf a company operating in Enugu generated only N25 million ($60,000) is going to open an office in Nigeria, pay for utilities, employ staff , and still pay tax to Nigeria; but somebody who generates maybe $1 billion should walk away with the gross revenue without paying tax to this country, we feel that should not be done.\n\n\u201cNigeria is the only country that we have and we should not be sensational in discussing these issue, we should not be emotional about it but let\u2019s remain patriotic because if we sign this, then you can name all the multinationals operating in the country, in as much as their global turnover is not up to 10 per cent of what they earn in the country, then they will stop paying taxes in this country.\n\n\u201cThat is why we didn\u2019t sign and we are not being arrogant about it, we are not trying not to move the way the world is going but the right thing should be done.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Osinbajo pointed out that the lingering issues of insecurity and criminality, inadequate social economic infrastructure among others, could only be addressed if there\u2019s adequate revenue in the hands of government through effective taxation and compliance.\n\nHe charged the CITN and Nigerians in general to ensure compliance with extant tax rules, and \u201cencourage others to comply and report those who are not complying\u201d.\n\nHe said the CITN remained a critical part of the taxation ecosystem in the country pointing out that tax constituted a key driver of social harmony, political stability and economic development and growth.\n\nThe VP said until the present administration took steps to diversify the economy, past administrations had relied almost exclusively on revenue from crude oil.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have however, learnt from recent market trends that crude oil like other commodities is not a sustainable source of domestic revenue.\n\n\u201cThis is because as you are aware, the world had witnessed uncommon modulation in prices of crude oil since 2015 when this administration started.\n\nAnd in the long run, this would dove-tail into a global move towards green energy which will further weaken the demand for crude oil. In all these, one message stands out- if we must make progress as a nation, all of us; countrymen and women must surrender an adequate part of our substances for the sake of national development, social harmony and political stability and economic growth.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo said tax professionals must be aware of the costly impact of non-compliance by taxpayers who they hold brief for on government\u2019s revenue adding that the larger society remained crucial and must be given topmost priority in tax administration.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Chairman, Osinbajo Consolidation Organisation, Mr. Oyeniran Oyebamidele has said the vice president would consolidate on all projects and programmes established or initiated by the present administration if elected president next year.\n\nThe group disclosed this yesterday, in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Pastor Godwin Arome.\n\nThe group described the vice president as a development icon, who has made his mark on the country\u2019s political history by being resourceful, energetic, politically suave and the epitome of democracy.\n\nThe statement quoted Oyebamidele to have said the country would notice the present effort being made by the Buhari\u2019s administration to put in place a solid foundation for the country\u2019s transformation through, laying of development infrastructures, industrialisation, social investment and economic directions, the benefits of which he said were yet to realise, owing to global issues that had created devastating effects on many fronts of development initiatives across the world.\n\nHe expressed satisfaction with the vice president\u2019s performance, saying he had demonstrated remarkable tact and maturity in supporting the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari as a worthy deputy, whose loyalty and credible leadership quality have not been in doubt; with unshakable focus.\n\nAlso, the Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Jibrin Yusuf, who is also a member of Board Trustees of the group, said most members are grassroots politicians and would work to ensure the success of breeding people that would carry the message of the presidential aspiration of Osinbajo to the nooks and crannies of the country and amongst the APC delegates, who would decide on the party\u2019s presidential flag bearer at the National Convention for Presidential primary.\n\nOn his part, the National Secretary and the Chief Strategist of the organisation, Dr. Yakubu Ugwolawo emphasised the need for all hands to be on the deck to work strenuously and harmoniously for the emergence of Osinbajo as the party\u2019s standard bearer.\n\names Emejo and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja",
