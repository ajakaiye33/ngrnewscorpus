          "text": "Civil rights advocacy group, Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, has called on the National Judicial Council and the Code of Conduct Tribunal to probe the corruption allegations levelled against the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Tanko Muhammad, serving justices of the Supreme Court.\n\nIn a statement signed by the group\u2019s National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, on Wednesday, HURIWA stated that the CJN should step down as Chairman of the NJC for the investigation to be conducted.\n\nThe group noted that the failure of the NJC and the CCT to investigate the allegations against Muhammad was tantamount to injustice considering the fact that the former CJN, Walter Onnoghen, was removed on a controversial note following allegations against him which were probed by both the NJC and the CCT.\n\nThe PUNCH had reported that Justices of the Supreme Court had, in a joint petition, accused the CJN of corruption, maladministration and incompetence.\n\nHowever, Muhammad denied the allegations and described the petition of the Justices as \u201cdancing naked at the market square\u201d. He also lamented the effect of the economic situation of the country on the apex court.\n\nHURIWA, however, said an intervention by the Body Of Benchers would mend the broken fences between the Justices and the CJN.\n\nThe statement reads in part, \u201cThe NJC, the CCT and the National must swiftly probe the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Tanko Muhammad. The corruption allegations levelled against him are too weighty to be ignored considering the fact that these are allegations from Supreme Court justices.\n\n\u201cThe matter should not be left for Muhammad to resolve as he can\u2019t be a judge in his own case since he is being accused of corruption. It is a big disappointment if those allegations are validated because of the fact that people who should uphold the law are not to break it with impunity. But of course, these are all mere allegations but merit thorough independent investigation.\n\n\u201cHURIWA calls on the NJC, the CCT, the National Assembly, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, and the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission to probe Muhammad just as they all investigated his predecessor, Walter Onnoghen. This is what justice and equity mean. There must be no sacred cows.\u201d",

We contracted it out to a company to come drill the borehole. On Sunday 22 of May they started the drilling and on Tuesday while they dug to about 2000 feet they had to pull putt the pipe because gas had started coming out from the well.\n\n\u201cThe drillers were afraid that there might be fire outbreak as a result of the gas emission so they contacted us and we in turn invited the fire service who stood on as the drillers pulled out their pipes.\n\n\u201cThe next day as we continued to make contact with relevant agencies, that was when fire erupted from the gas emission. That was when we intensified our calls to the Governor, other relevant agencies to inform them that their was problem at hand.\n\n\u201cThey all responded, the Governor came visiting with all the relevant agencies and we held series of meeting on how to put off the fire.\n\n\u201cWe started brainstorming on how to put off the fire and the way forward to tackle the emission.\n\n\u201cThe meetings were centered on how the fire will be put off. Several attempt were mad by various agencies of government and even professionals contracted by the school to put off the fires but all attempt failed as the fire continued to burn.\n\n\u201cThe fire eventually went off on its own , an incident the school has decided to tagged as a miraculous feat, though the scientist may come up with an explanation which we await soon .\n\n\u201cBut it is worthy of note that on our part the light went off on its own after several efforts to put it off. We say that God in His infinite mercy helped us put off the fire.\n\n\u201cA very important point to note is that through out these 21 days the fire kept burning the tie was no causality of any sort has no one was hurt or injured. Also when the fire went off the gas also stopped emitting the same time.\n\n\u201cA look at the well as inspected by the relevant agencies it was so dry that no gas was found inside it. These are the issues I must emphasis.\n\n\u201cI also want to thank all the agencies involved most profoundly for their efforts throughout the period . And the Governor pf the state for the synergy in helping us through the period.\u201d",

Although details of the meeting were not disclosed to the press, it may not be unconnected to how to poach Wike from the PDP to the ruling All Progressives Congress ahead of the 2023 presidential election.\n\nRecall Wike had lost the PDP presidential ticket to Atiku Abubakar, while fingering his counterpart southern governors within the PDP of betrayal.\n\nWike had claimed that he could have scuttled the PDP presidential primary, but for his love for the party\n\nHis statement, \u201cI have never seen how people can violate procedures and guidelines. Somebody has spoken, it is at that point he was speaking that he would have said I am withdrawing. You don\u2019t call him back. I just said, \u2018Look, this our party must not be destroyed.\u201d\n\nThe Rivers State governor was tipped to be the favourite of the PDP selection committee as Atiku\u2019s running mate, the former vice president snubbed rather nominated Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State, who is also a key player in the Atiku\u2019s emergence, in the place of Wike.",

It occurred at Oyoma near Oporoma and eight people died. One of the boats, the local boat, stopped and the other one rammed into it.\u201d\n\nBayelsa Police spokesman Asinim Butswat, also confirmed the Wednesday incident, saying that the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in charge of the area confirmed the tragedy.",

          "title": "Afghanistan: Villagers bury dead, dig for survivors after quake kills 1,000",
          "text": "(AP)\n\nVillagers rushed to bury the dead Thursday and dug by hand through the rubble of their homes in search of survivors of a powerful earthquake in eastern Afghanistan that killed at least 1,000 people. The Taliban and the international community that fled their takeover struggled to bring help to the disaster\u2019s victims.\n\nUnder a leaden sky in Paktika province, which was the epicenter of Wednesday\u2019s magnitude 6 earthquake, men dug a line of graves in one village, as they tried to lay the dead to rest quickly in line with Muslim tradition. In one courtyard, bodies lay wrapped in plastic to protect them from the rains that are hampering relief efforts for the living.\n\nThe quake was Afghanistan\u2019s deadliest in two decades, and officials said the toll could rise. An estimated 1,500 others were reported injured, the state-run Bakhtar News Agency said.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have anything to eat, they are wondering what they can have to eat, and it is also raining,\u201d a Bakhtar reporter said in footage from the quake zone. \u201cTheir houses are destroyed. Please help them, don\u2019t leave them alone.\u201d\n\nThe disaster heaps more misery on a country where millions already faced increasing hunger and poverty and the health system has crumbled since the Taliban retook power nearly 10 months ago amid the U.S. and NATO withdrawal. The takeover led to a cutoff of vital international financing, and most of the world has shunned the Taliban government.\n\nHow the international humanitarian community, which has pulled back significant resources from the country, will be able to offer aid and whether the Taliban government will allow it to remain in question. In a rare move, the Taliban\u2019s supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzadah, pleaded for help from the world Wednesday \u2014 but a U.N. official said the government had not requested that the world body mobilize international search-and-rescue teams or obtain equipment from neighboring countries.\n\n\u201cWe ask from the Islamic Emirate and the whole country to come forward and help us,\u201d said a survivor who gave his name as Hakimullah. \u201cWe are with nothing and have nothing, not even a tent to live in.\u201d\n\nThe full extent of the destruction among the villages tucked in the mountains was slow in coming to light. The roads, which are rutted and difficult to travel in the best of circumstances, may have been badly damaged in the quake, and landslides from recent rains have made some impassible. Though just 175 kilometers (110 miles) directly south of the capital, Kabul, some villages in hard-hit Gayan District took a full day\u2019s drive to reach.\n\nWalls and roofs of dozens of homes in the district collapsed in the quake, and villagers said whole families were buried under the rubble. Associated Press journalists counted some 50 bodies in the area alone, as people laid out their dead in front of their houses and in their courtyards.\n\nMuch of the rubble was too large for people to move with their hands or shovels. They said they hoped large excavators would make it out their remote homes. For now, there was only one bulldozer in the area.\n\nWhile modern buildings withstand magnitude 6 earthquakes elsewhere, Afghanistan\u2019s mud-brick homes and landslide-prone mountains make such quakes more dangerous. Shallow earthquakes also tend to cause more damage, and experts put the depth of Wednesday\u2019s at just 10 kilometers (6 miles).\n\nRescuers rushed in by helicopter \u2014 and AP journalists also saw ambulances in the quake zone on Thursday \u2014 but wider relief effort could be hindered by the exodus of many international aid agencies from Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover last August. Moreover, most governments are wary of dealing directly with the Taliban.\n\nStill, officials from several U.N. agencies said the Taliban were giving them full access to the area.\n\nTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid wrote on Twitter that eight trucks of food and other necessities from Pakistan arrived in Paktika. He also said Thursday that two planes of humanitarian aid from Iran and another from Qatar had arrived in the country.\n\nObtaining more direct international help may be more difficult: Many countries, including the U.S., funnel humanitarian aid to Afghanistan through the U.N. and other such organizations to avoid putting money in the Taliban\u2019s hands.\n\nIn a news bulletin Thursday, Afghanistan state television made a point to acknowledge that U.S. President Joe Biden \u2014 their one-time enemy \u2014 offered condolences over the earthquake and had promised aid. Biden on Wednesday ordered the U.S. international aid agency and its partners to \u201cassess\u201d options for helping the victims, a White House statement said.\n\nThe death toll reported by Bakhtar was equal to that of a quake in 2002 in northern Afghanistan. Those are the deadliest since 1998, when an earthquake that was also 6.1 in magnitude and subsequent tremors in the remote northeast killed at least 4,500 people.\n\nWednesday\u2019s quake was centered in Paktika province, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) southwest of the city of Khost, according to neighboring Pakistan\u2019s Meteorological Department.\n\nIn neighboring Khost province\u2019s Speray district, which also sustained serious damage, men stood atop what once was a mud home. The quake had ripped open its timber beams. People sat outside under a makeshift tent made of a blanket that blew in the breeze.\n\nSurvivors quickly prepared the district\u2019s dead, including children and an infant, for burial. Officials fear more dead will be found in the coming days.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to gather all the exact information because it is mountainous area,\u201d said Sultan Mahmood, Speray district\u2019s chief. \u201cThe information that we have is what we have gathered from the residents of these areas.\u201d",

          "text": "(AP)\n\nEuropean Union leaders on Thursday are set to make Ukraine a candidate for joining the 27-nation bloc, a first step in a long and unpredictable journey toward full membership that could take many years to navigate.\n\nMaking Ukraine a contender now seems to be a done deal after national leaders were initially divided on how quickly to embrace the war-torn country\u2019s request to become an EU member, which the Ukrainian government submitted only a few days after Russia invaded its neighbor on Feb. 24.\n\nAccording to several diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity before a leaders\u2019 summit in Brussels, Ukraine will receive the unanimous approval required for candidate status and the launch of eligibility negotiations.\n\n\u201cThis is a decisive moment for the European Union,\u201d European Council President Charles Michel, the EU summit chair, said, describing the question of Ukraine\u2019s candidacy \u201ca geopolitical choice that we will make today.\u201d\n\nMembers of the European Parliament endorsed Ukraine\u2019s bid hours before the summit started, voting to pass a resolution that calls EU heads of state and government to \u201cmove without delay\u201d and \u201clive up to their historical responsibility.\u201d\n\nThe EU\u2019s 27 nations have been united in backing Ukraine\u2019s resistance to Russia\u2019s invasion, adopting unprecedented economic sanctions against Moscow. However, leaders were at first split on how quickly the EU should move to accept Ukraine as a member, with the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark among the most skeptical.\n\nBut Ukraine\u2019s application got a boost last week when the EU\u2019s executive arm, the European Commission, gave its seal of approval based on the country\u2019s answers to a questionnaire received in April and early May.\n\nUkraine received another shot in the arm when the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and Romania visited the country and vowed to back its candidacy.\n\nIn another indication of how important EU candidacy is for Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he spoke with 11 EU leaders on Wednesday, following calls with nine the day before. He said the meeting in Brussels will be an \u201chistoric session of the European Council.\u201d\n\nEU candidate status doesn\u2019t give an automatic right to join the bloc, though, and doesn\u2019t provide any security guarantees.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that membership talks could start before next year, with the prospect of the war dragging on for a very long time adding to the uncertainty.\n\nThe beginning of the accession discussions depends on Ukraine meeting essential political and economic conditions.\n\nTo be admitted, potential newcomers need to demonstrate that they meet standards on democratic principles and absorb a gigantic corpus of rules. To help countries with candidate status, the bloc can provide technical and financial assistance throughout negotiations, but can also decide to revoke the status if the required reforms aren\u2019t implemented.\n\nEuropean officials have said that Ukraine has already implemented about 70% of the EU rules, norms and standards, but they also have pointed to corruption and the need for deep political and economic reforms in the country.\n\n\u201cConsiderable efforts will be needed, especially in the fight against corruption and the establishment of an effective rule of law,\u201d Belgian Prime minister Alexander De Croo said. \u201cBut I am convinced that it is precisely the (post-war) reconstruction of Ukraine that will provide opportunities to take important steps forward.\u201d\n\nLeaders will also debate Thursday a recommendation for the European Commission to grant Moldova \u2014 a tiny, non-NATO country that borders Ukraine \u2014 EU candidate status. A stalled process for moving Western Balkans countries on the membership path is also on the summit agenda.",

          "text": "From Adanna Nnamani, Abuja\n\nFollowing the dismissal of 2,357 teachers by Governor Nasir el-Rufai\u2019 in Kaduna State recently, the national leadership of the Nigerian Union of Teachers (NUT) has threaten to embark on strike if the action is not reversed immediately.\n\nNUT Deputy President, Kelvin Nwankwo, disclosed this after the union\u2019s National Executive Council (NEC) meeting, Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nThe Kaduna State Government, last weekend announced the sack of 2,357 including the National President of NUT,Comrade Audu Titus Amba, allegedly for failing competency and failing to appear for the test.\n\nBut the union said its president, did not fail the test, insisting that the whole concept of competency test which the Kaduna State Government relied on to sack 2,357 teachers in the state last week was \u201cdesigned to achieve its inglorious aim of casualization of the teaching profession in Kaduna State.\u201d\n\nNUT declared the action of el-Rufai as null and void and threatened to declare strike across the country in solidarity with teachers in Kaduna if the state government fail to act a\u00e7cording to its demand.\n\n\u201cYou know our members are well dedicated people. This is the only union that does not have one illiterate among us. Remember that because of the competency test issue, we went to court. We are law abiding citizens and we felt that is the only way we can resolve this. But if it becomes necessary that we must go on strike,it would be a nation-wide strike\n\n\u201cThe very concept of competency test is an aberration and absurd having regards to the fact that the teachers in Kaduna State have prior to their recruitment in the state public service, attended schools and institutions statutorily saddled with the responsibility of teacher education and these institutions have certified them to be competent, fit and proper to be teachers.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the same Kaduna State Government had subjected the teachers to scrutiny and test to ensure their suitability or otherwise for employment as teachers before they were recruited by it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is in the context of the above that the whole concept of a competency test which is only peculiar to Kaduna State is akin to a cocktail of absurdities and leaves a sour taste in the mouth, thereby validating the position of NUT that the intentions of the Kaduna State Government on this issue is everything but altruistic.\n\n\u201cKaduna State is the second most indebted state in Nigeria and the state government is on a free roller coaster move to satisfy the conditionalities handed down to it by its creditors, which normally includes down sizing of the public service without even the remotest regards to our peculiar circumstances.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole concept of competency test was designed by the Kaduna State Government to achieve its inglorious aim of casualization of the teaching profession in Kaduna State.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, how else can one attempt a rationalization of the fact that the same Kaduna State Government in the year 2018 dismissed/retired in one swoop 21,780 teachers purportedly for not passing its unilaterally and arbitrarily administered competency test and purportedly in replacement thereof recruited about 20,000 new teachers, who according to it were subjected to vigorous test and confirmed to be competent before they were recruited into the Kaduna State Public Service.\n\n\u201cThe manifest intention of the Kaduna State Government is to prey on the rather unfortunate existing non employment status of our teeming school leavers by recruiting them as teachers only to subsequently subject them to the raw deal it subjected the purported 20,000 teachers, thereby achieving its aim of casualization of the teaching profession in Kaduna State. \u201c\n\n\u201cHe was not dismissed then for failure to write the competency test. The question that readily agitates the mind in the circumstance is, what has changed in 2021/2022?\n\n\u201cIt is also rather very sad and curious that the dismissal letter relative to the NUT President was in the Public domain via the social media even when it has not been served on him.\n\n\u201cThe intention clearly is to intimidate the NUT President and embarrass the Teachers in Nigeria. This like other anti labour and people policies of the Kaduna State Government has failed on arrival. We got news for His Excellency Mallam Nasiru El-Rufai and his co-travelers to wit:- power is transient,\u201d the union stated.\n\n\u201cNUT therefore, reaffirmed its commitment to stand with its revered President, Comrade Audu Titus Amba and all the teachers in Kaduna State, who have fallen victim of the anti-labour policies in Kaduna State and which policies have defied all logic and lacking in milk of human kindness,\u201dit further said. NUT stated.",

That is certainly why we are starting with one boat and we are going to expand. It is a sustainable idea, we already run ambulance services, we are only expanding to include the waterways and we have the human resources to run it,\u201d Ogboye added.\n\nAccording to him, residents in riverine communities can access the services of the floating clinic through the Lagos State Emergency Services numbers, saying \u201cOnce you contact the emergency numbers, the clinic will be deployed.\n\n\u201c LASWA can also deploy the clinic during emergency responses on the waterways. If there is a call about an emergency on the waterways, remote and riverine areas, the emergency process will be activated,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking, the General Manager, LASWA, Mr. Damilola Emmanuel, envisaged that the initiative will further integrate emergency and rescue systems being put in place for commuter safety in riverine communities.\n\nEmmanuel said: \u201cAs you know, for us at LASWA, we have been gradually building emergency and rescue efforts and gradually seeing how the safety on the waterways keeps improving year after year. This is just another initiative to further add to the integrated emergency and rescue system\u201d.\n\nEarlier, the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Health, Dr. Oreoluwa Finnih, stated that one of the core tasks of the Floating Clinic Boat is medical outreach services to riverine communities for providing primary healthcare services including immunisation, disease prevention and health promotion to citizens.\n\n\u201cMost people have the impression that Lagos is a completely urban city but for us, we realise that Lagos has a lot of communities along the waterways, which are not necessarily connected to the city. Mr. Governor, recognising this, directed that medical services be taken to these areas as part of the mandate to achieve universal health coverage. When this initiative was brought to his attention, this was one of the factors that led to the quick acquisition of the boat to bridge the identified gap in health access\u201d, she explained.",

He has agreed to that and he is going to make a statement very soon to that effect.\n\n\u201cThat extension also involves additional machines, additional ad-hoc staff, and of course, he\u2019s going to collaborate with the security agencies to make sure that is also done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo, all the prayers of the motion were approved and all members of the committee were there, including the mover of the motion.\u201d\n\nBut briefing journalists after plenary, Dukku said INEC didn\u2019t agree to the request of the lower legislative chamber.\n\nDukku said Mahmood Yakubu, INEC chairman, only promised to \u201clook at\u201d the request of the lower legislative chamber.\n\n\u201cPart of what INEC told the house through the committee on electoral matters is that they are going to look at our request. However, whatever happens, they cannot be able to open the registration for the next 60 days because of the activities lined up before the general election,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe registration of voters is one aspect. There are other schedules that have to be done which the chairman explained. Such include the printing of voter cards, distribution of the cards and the pasting of list of all persons registered in all 774 local governments nationwide.\n\n\u201cAnd so, it will not be possible. This is the statement\u2014 for INEC to extend for the days we requested. However, they will go back and look at their timeline and look at how possible they will be able to increase the days for registration.\n\n\u201cMind you, they are already in court. The court has stopped them from closing the date for registration. In essence, INEC will inform Nigerians as to how many days they will be able to extend the registration in view of other milestones that they have to achieve.\u201d",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Kune, a Kenyan food tech startup that delivered ready-to-eat meals at affordable prices, is closing down today, the company\u2019s founder and CEO Robin Reecht announced.\n\nIn a statement posted to his LinkedIn page, Reecht cited a stifled economy and inflated food prices as circumstances that contributed to Kune\u2019s closure. \u201cWith the current economic downturn and investment markets tightening up, we were unable to raise our next round. Coupled with rising food costs deteriorating our margins, we just couldn\u2019t keep going,\u201d he said.\n\nThe announcement comes just 4 months after the startup began its commercial operations at established meal centers around Nairobi. Around that time, Kune leadership also declared its intentions to raise $3.5 million in its second round of funding.\n\nBut while Kune was well-liked by its customers, the startup\u2019s journey wasn\u2019t without its fair share of controversy. Last June, Reecht faced the mighty lash of Kenyans on Twitter (best known as KoT) after he shared in a TechCrunch interview that he was inspired to launch Kune after taking a trip to Kenya in November 2020 and having trouble finding affordable, ready-to-eat meals.\n\n\u201cAfter three days of coming into Kenya, I asked where I can get great food at a cheap price, and everybody tell [sic] me it\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible because either you go to the street and you eat street food, which is really cheap but with not-so-good quality, or you order on Uber Eats, Glovo or Jumia, where you get quality but you have to pay at least $10.\u201d\n\nReecht, who is white and French, founded Kune just one month later.\n\nKenyans were aggrieved by his comments, and did not hesitate to voice their critiques. They argued that Reecht\u2019s ability to secure funding so quickly was due more to his white privilege than his business plan, which some believed aimed to solve a nonexistent problem. Those discussions gave way to a larger conversation about white privilege and favouritism in tech, as well as Kenya\u2019s neglect of its local founders.\n\nIn his statement, Reecht said that even though Kune had sold more than 55,000 meals and acquired more than 6,000 individual customers and 100 corporate customers since the start of the year, its $3 per meal price point wasn\u2019t enough to sustain its growth.\n\nAddressing Kune\u2019s investors, he said, \u201cNot only did you invest in Kune but you gave us your time, brain-width, connections, and emotional support. I am deeply sorry that Kune\u2019s vision didn\u2019t come true. To betray your confidence is something for which I will never forgive myself.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "These founders are helping companies make decisions with data",
          "text": "On a drab January day in 2018, in Pamplemousses, Mauritius, 2 friends, Joseph Rutankangwa and Eric Sewankambo, sat in Rutakangwa\u2019s apartment and decided to start a company. It wasn\u2019t their first time venturing into business together; only the previous year they\u2019d tried building an aggregator to curate data from various African countries which multinational companies could use. The problem was: there was simply no available data to be gathered. Generally speaking, data about Africa is scarce, and even when it is available, it can be inadequate and outdated.\n\nAt the time they decided to give their business aspirations a second chance together, Rutakangwa and Sewankambo had been consulting for multinational consumer goods companies that were looking to expand into African markets. In their work, they often encountered the data gaps. Government ministries and countries\u2019 chambers of commerce (did not have detailed information about consumer persona and behaviour in Africa\u2019s markets. While these offices might, for example, present data on what percentage of a country had electricity, they had nothing on how many homes exactly had power, or how many of them experienced power cuts each month, or how long these power cuts lasted. A solar company entering into many African markets would thus have little information to work with. Such gaps in the data cost businesses money in wasted marketing efforts, and make it tough for the continent to attract further investment.\n\nRutakangwa understands why these costly business errors occur: the data the multinational companies rely on\u2014often collected by market research firms\u2014is assumed African countries to be monolithic and did not provide companies with enough detail with which to make market expansion decisions.\n\nAnd so, when Rutakangwa and Sewankambo launched Rwazi, a Mauritian-based startup that provides multinational organisations with on-ground data to facilitate effective decision making, they decided that they\u2019d collate data that dealt in the specifics. \u201cI want to know the details,\u201d Joseph tells me, firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to tell me the market share of this [brand] is 75%. What is 75%? Is it 6,255 outlets? Is it 10,800? I don\u2019t want the percentage. I want the exact number, exact location, exact contact, and exact images [of these shops].\u201d\n\nDespite Rutakangwa and Sewankambo understanding the problems with multinational consumer goods companies accessing useful data, figuring out the most effective way to collect this data was initially challenging.\n\nAt first, they tried using retailers and sales reps to collect information. But both groups proved inefficient as they are incentivised to falsify the data\u2014retailers because claiming that they stock products they actually don\u2019t have gets them freebies from companies; and sales reps because success in their jobs meant reporting, always, that their products were in stores.\n\nThey changed their approach. They figured companies were trying to sell to consumers, not retailers or sales reps; only a consumer would be truthful about the availability of a product and their access to it. So, Rutakangwa and Sewankambo employed regular local consumers, called \u201cmappers\u201d, to collect the data from shops and households.\n\nThese mappers collect data within the neighbourhoods closest to them at any given time. Think Uber, but for data collection.\n\nIllustration: For shops, when a mapper signed up to the Rwazi platform receives a mapping order from a toothpaste company to find out how many shops around them sell toothpaste and what brands they carry, the mapper accepts the request, then proceeds to locate and count how many shops in the area sell toothpaste. They also document what brands they stock, and at what prices. For households, the mappers meet consumers in their homes and quiz them on the brand of toothpaste they use, why they use it, their experience using it, what it costs them, and so on.\n\nA mapper can only submit data while they are still at a shop or household. Every shop is already geotagged on the Rwazi platform. When a mapper submits the data, Rwazi verifies the information by checking that the shop or household\u2019s geocoordinates matches the mapper\u2019s current location.\n\n\u201cSynergy\u201d\n\nFor this story, I spoke to Rutakangwa and Sewankambo 3 days apart, but some of the things they told me could easily have been convergent thoughts from 2 people in the same room at the same time. The week of our conversation, they are in Los Angeles participating in the Techstars Accelerator, and they have been stunned by how differently from the rest of the world success for African founders is defined. They have met with Western founders whose startups make up to $3 million in annual revenue but who consider this feat modest. \u201cBack home,\u201d Sewankambo says, \u201cif you\u2019re making $3 million dollars [a year], you\u2019re a conglomerate!\u201d\n\nRutakangwa and Sewankambo have been friends for 7 years, having met as business management undergraduates on the Mauritian campus of the African Leadership University, where Rwazi\u2019s story first began to shapen. Their roles as COO (Sewankambo) and CEO (Rutakangwa) may state sharply defined responsibilities\u2014Sewankambo deals with operations and customer delivery while Rutakangwa\u2019s handles customer acquisition\u2014but they are not fussy about the demarcation. \u201cWe tend to switch, depending on who can do it faster or better,\u201d Sewankambo says. \u201cSometimes, I talk to clients, sometimes he talks to the operations team.\u201d\n\nThey both say \u201csynergy\u201d when describing their partnership, painting a picture of complementariness, where, during conflict, one founder\u2019s scepticism is another\u2019s faith. A few months into Rwazi\u2019s launch, they had begun receiving mapping orders from clients from outside the consumer goods industry\u2014medicine, pharmaceuticals, hospitality, fintech. Sewankambo was concerned about them servicing these orders that had nothing to do with consumer goods as that could mean Rwazi taking on work in industries they had no prior experience in. But Rutakangwa saw things differently: in principle, mapping data for hospitals and pharmacies was the same as mapping for beverage and liquor companies. They ended up accepting these orders, which they claim increased their revenue and client base.\n\nWhere next, after Techstars?By 2050, Africa will make up 25% of the world\u2019s population; Rutakangwa and Sewankambo have this at the back of their minds as they use the access granted by Techstars to court more US-based clients looking to understand consumer habits and trends in African markets, raise seed worth $3 million, and evolve Rwazi\u2019s product by incorporating machine learning and AI into it so it can perform simulations, make forecasts, and generate automatic reports. Today they have 20,000 mappers spread across 60 countries and over 100 cities; by the end of the year, they aim to onboard 1 million mappers spread across their current coverage.\n\nMy Life in Tech (MLIT) is a biweekly column that profiles innovators, leaders, and shapers in the African tech ecosystem, with the intention of putting a human face to the startups and innovations they build.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "Throwing eggs at the glass ceiling",
          "text": "The clamour for more women to get into the leadership space has continued to gain momentum, especially with the increase in feminist agitation.\n\nNigerian women recently secured a victory against the Federal Government on affirmative action that gives them a mandatory 35 percent of public offices. This, obviously was celebrated as a significant win for the female gender and I agree, but I felt this was putting a plaster over a decaying foot.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nEvery election year, we see women from all walks of life coming out to contest public offices. One common thing is that more often than not, they play the gender card. Educated, experienced and over-qualified women reduce their worth to campaign on the idea; \u201cI am a woman\u201d\n\n\u201cI have done this and that as a woman\u201d\n\n\u201cI have handled my family and career despite all the challenges, now reward me because I am a woman\u201d\n\n\u201cI have fought through hell and brimstone, and I am a victorious woman\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a woman discriminated against\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen have suffered, it is our time and our turn\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a man can do\u2026\u201d You get the point.\n\nWhat these concepts, slogans and agenda have done is to reduce the women to one tag \u201cshe is a woman.\u201d Very few women have campaigned without the gender card and fewer have won elections.\n\nI can already hear the eye-rolling and the accompanying insults to \u201ca young girl that is a male apologist.\u201d That is incorrect. I firmly support the equality of genders but I would like to present an argument here that is solely based on my personal experiences and my perspective.\n\nAs a young female in politics, one thing I quickly realised was that I am an exception to the rule. More often than not, I find myself in a political meeting where I am the only female.\n\nMore often than not, I have to remind my colleagues that I am actually a female and more often than not, I have to tell other women that I am indeed pursuing a career in the political field and not \u201caimlessly following politicians around.\u201d\n\nWomen want to get into politics. That should be encouraged. However, the fact remains that previous strategies have failed to make this dream a sustainable reality. In my opinion, the reason for this is relatively straightforward.\n\nNigeria\u2019s political space is a very toxic environment. It will take an unusual amount of patience, grit and enormous sacrifice for a woman to achieve the same political achievement as her male counterpart with similar age and experience.\n\nThis is the reality. We can complain about it, but this will not change anytime soon.\n\nNow, what to do about this?\n\nI think the answer is also very clear. Currently, women\u2019s representation in public offices is less than 6 percent. This will not dramatically change even with the 35 percent affirmative action upheld by the court. Why?\n\nBecause sincerely, women are not ready to take advantage of the opportunity presented. We have spent a lifetime complaining about marginalisation and discrimination.\n\nWe have spent time and resources focusing on the problems, setting up NGOs, civil societies, sponsoring protests, etc. without actually training young girls on how to navigate the Nigeria political space.\n\nSo, how about this.\n\nRather than the never-ending conferences and TEDx talks, women in leadership positions can make conscious efforts to hire and train young women as mentees. Instead of the one talk that you believe will change the young lady\u2019s life, invest an hour per week to give truthful realistic guidance and advice on relevant skills young women can get to make politicking easier for them.\n\nNot everybody should contest elections. Why don\u2019t we encourage other career paths that shape politics without being a politician? Young women can be Personal aides, legislative aides, advisers, assistants, and executives at different political parties, political communicators, etc.\n\nRead also: One of these five women may become Nigeria\u2019s First Lady soon\n\nThese positions give you a front seat on how Nigerian politics work and will better prepare young women to contest elections if they eventually choose to do so.\n\nTo counter the disadvantages we face as women in the world and Nigeria in particular, we cannot keep waking up one morning and deciding to run for office without any relevant skill to back up such ambition.\n\nLike every career path, public service is a path that one should grow in. Such steady growth will give the woman confidence, skills, public service experience and the right network to support her ambition. To start with, politics is local.\n\nBefore any woman should announce her desire to run for office, like her male counterpart, such a woman should register in a political party at her ward level and serve the party. We cannot keep requesting for power to be served on a platter. We are women; sacrificing is in our DNA.\n\nLet us channel that spirit of sacrifice to our desire for public service and actually do the right thing in pursuing a career in politics. Maybe, just then, the eggs we have been throwing will eventually break the glass ceiling.",

          "title": "Anxiety as fuel scarcity lingers in Abuja",
          "text": "Queues of motorists struggling to purchase premium motor spirit, popularly called petrol, persist for about the sixth week since they were first noticed at retail petrol outlets in Abuja, as the essential commodity remains elusive.\n\nWhile most of the filling stations are shut, a few dispensing the product have hordes of customers with apprehension written all over their faces as they spend valuable man-hours \u2013 sometimes days on vehicular lines. By the way, the above scenario is said to be playing out in some other parts of the country where fuel scarcity continues to exist.\n\nSadly enough, it is not only at gas stations that queues are witnessed as a result of the scarcity. Oftentimes, a large crowd of commuters could be seen at bus \u2013 terminals under the intense heat of the sun \u2013 waiting for the arrival of any available public or private transport service to convey them to their various destinations.\n\nNaturally, the petrol shortage has afforded agents like \u201cBlack Marketers\u201d the opportunity of cashing out big from their illegal brisk business. Strategically positioned near gas stations where they obtain fuel from unscrupulous attendants at exorbitant costs \u2013 usually in the dead of the night, the racketeers make humongous gains selling the product in jerry cans of 5,10, and 20 litres. These allegedly go for as much as N5,000, N10,000, and N20,000 respectively in blatant contravention of extant laws.\n\nExpectedly, though, almost every aspect of human endeavour is impacted by the ripple effect of the notorious petroleum saga.\n\nAside from grounding economic activities in the nooks and crannies of the burgeoning nascent federal capital as well as other parts of the nation, the imbroglio has engendered an astronomical rise in transportation costs for both inter and intra-city movement said to have quadrupled to about 200 percent.\n\nSimilarly, prices of essential food items have skyrocketed with a lot of families having difficulties in affording balanced diets every day.\n\nIn the aviation industry, several flights of local airlines hit by the nation-wide shortage of Jet-A1 fuel which rose to about N700/litre before interventionist measures by government have been cancelled. This has led to hike in air fares.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Bank has predicted that the rising prices of goods and services in the country will push 7 million Nigerians into poverty this year.\n\nAt this juncture, we must interrogate why the hydra-headed monster under review has remained an albatross over the years. Investigations carried out reveal the current fuel crisis in Abuja is about the third in its series to be recorded this year. Lending some credence to the revelation, the Socio-Economic Rights and\n\nAccountability Project (SERAP) in a letter to President Muhammadu Buhari dated March 5, 2022, observed that the first sign of fuel scarcity in the year was noticed about January 24, 2022, ahead the Nigeria Labour Congress\u2019 nationwide protests against the planned Federal Government removal of petroleum subsidy by July 2022.\n\nAccording to a report by Kemi Busari in the Online edition of the Premium Times of January 4, 2018, captioned \u201cThe real reasons for fuel scarcity in Nigeria \u2013 Kachikwu,\u201d minister of state for petroleum resources, Ibe Kachikwu was quoted as saying that lack of sufficient reserve, low clearance speed of petrol at the ports, (and) diversion of products were some of the reasons for the ongoing fuel crisis in Nigeria.\n\nHow then do we chart the way forward as a means of proffering solutions to the lingering crisis? Dr. Ahmed Adamu, a petroleum economist in an article titled, \u201cFuel scarcity: Issues and solutions,\u201d published in the Online edition of The Nation newspaper, February 23, 2022, had recommended the stoppage of petroleum importation and removal of subsidies.\n\nWhile calling on the government to encourage use of alternative fuels like Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), Adamu canvassed petroleum consumption reduction programmes to include investments in light rail transit.\n\nThrowing its weight behind privatization of the sector, the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) while attributing disruptions in smooth distribution of fuel nationwide to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has explained that \u201cthe current N165 per litre pump price for PMS cannot fit in into the present realities (of things) without the pricing template being reviewed.\u201d (The Guardian Newspaper, Online edition of 6th June, 2022).\n\nIn a tweet on her verified twitter handle @obyezeks December 23, 2017, Dr. (Mrs.) Oby Ezekwesili had made a strong case for full deregulation of the oil and gas sector in Nigeria as a panacea for controlling the recurring petrol scarcity. The one-time Minister for education maintained that government severing of the knots of politics would unleash productive incentives.\n\nRead also: Fuel market crisis deepens as subsidy swells\n\nWriting on \u201cWhy fuel scarcity may persist,\u201d in the Online version of the Nigerian Tribune of February 27, 2022, Sulaimon Olarenwaju had said; \u201cSo, if NNPC is unwilling to punish those who imported adulterated fuel and the government is unwilling to fix the nation\u2019s refineries while people are unwilling to put the government on its toes, what guarantee is there that what is will not continue to be?\u201d One could not agree with him more.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s pertinent to note that only a few days ago, the federal government raised the freight rate for petroleum products in Nigeria. Although the gesture is expected to alleviate challenges faced by marketers in trucking fuel across the country, it remains to be seen how the said upward review would engender disappearance of queues from retail outlets nationwide.\n\nIn conclusion, as we await the full operationalisation of the 650,000 barrels-per-day Dangote Refinery in Lagos which Minister of Information and Culture has described as \u201ca game-changer capable of driving refining revolution in Africa\u201d, the imperatives for convocation of an urgent emergency summit by the government, industry players with relevant stakeholders towards advocating proactive measures for a radical transformation of the oil and gas sector cannot be overstressed. After all, a stitch in time, they say, saves nine.\n\nWemambu, a social commentator, writes from Abuja",

          "title": "How Nigerian firms can retain tech talents",
          "text": "The rising incidents of tech talents leaving abroad amid global economic squeeze is a major challenge for businesses seeking for specialised skills in Africa\u2019s most populous nation, Nigeria.\n\nThe development, according to experts, is having negative impacts on organizations and businesses in the country like banks, contributing to glitches in transactions, among others.\n\nIn a recent statement, Abubakar Suleiman, the chief executive officer of Sterling Bank referred to the exit of these tech talents as a \u201cgreat resignation\u201d.\n\nBusinessDay reached out to experts in the tech ecosystem who outlined various ways businesses in Nigeria can retain talents.\n\nMuhammad Habib, a software engineer explained that the government have a crucial role to play in keeping tech talents from leaving the country.\n\n\u201cIf the Nigerian government and business can guarantee the security of her citizens and provide basic amenities like constant electricity. I think people will be happy to stay,\u201d he said.\n\nHabib also stated that most companies in Nigeria have to start seeing tech talents as part of the production process and add value to their work.\n\n\u201cUnethical behaviour at work has to stop if businesses really want to retain tech talents. As this may sound somehow, it happens in many workspaces where an intern developer is turned into an errand boy and girl all because they are searching for experience to develop themselves. Some are not even paid but have to tolerate the kind of behaviour from their bosses,\u201d Habib said.\n\nThe software engineer disclosed that most companies take advantage of the high unemployment rate in the country and give low remuneration, overusing their tech talents in the name of wanting to provide the best, which leads to unhealthy work and life balance. He said, \u201cif businesses can follow due process in software development like agile development process, flexible working hours and pay what the employee is worth, I think the migration will reduce.\u201d\n\nAkinola Olumide, Finacle and C24 scripting officer in one of Nigeria\u2019s tier one banks, noted that businesses in Nigeria have to adopt the practice of remote work in order to keep their tech talents.\n\nAccording to him, the covid-19 pandemic serves was an eye-opener for many tech talents as some were seen handling works for various companies at the same time. He stated that after the period, most developers started aiming higher and none wanted to return to physical jobs.\n\n\u201cCompanies should encourage the practice of remote work to retain their tech workers. Since the pandemic, developers or tech people no longer want to take jobs that are not remote. Any job offer I get these days that is not remote, I always decline it. The pandemic opened a lot of people\u2019s eyes that you can actually be more productive when you work from home and a lot of our banks and tech firms are starting to recall their staff back to work physically,\u201d Olumide said.\n\nHowever, the web developer did not shy away from the fact that most tech talents abused the work-from-home privilege as some were caught engaging in side hustle during work hours.\n\nHe said, \u201cA colleague was doing Uber driving business during work hours and unfortunately for him, he picked up a senior person while he was on a team meeting at work. But then its positives outweigh its negatives. Luckily now, there are inventories of monitoring tools that can be deployed on workstations to monitor uptime and work hours on a system while working from home.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that security personnel in the country also have a part to play in the area of retaining tech talents. He stated that they need to find a means to differentiate a fraudster and a tech developer.\n\nRead also: Tech talent exodus, glitches frustrate money transfers\n\n\u201cOur police and securities should start doing well also and know that everyone carrying a laptop is not a cybercriminal. When I was working at Surulere, I can\u2019t count the number of times I was stopped by the police. Even when I had my ID and the laptop clearly showed it belonged to a company,\u201d Olumide said.\n\nMeanwhile, a UK-based Nigerian tech engineer who pleaded to remain anonymous said the need for Nigerian companies to start employing a higher number of junior developers who will eventually take over from the senior colleagues when they have the need to go.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows very few Nigerian companies can afford to compete with what people are paid on freelancing platforms. So it should be expected that experienced people may still leave for other good opportunities. Nigerian companies need to start to value junior developers in terms of giving them the opportunity to work with their senior engineers, so that when the senior leaves, the junior would have learnt much and be able to fill in for the senior engineer before a new boss comes on board,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also disclosed that allowing the junior engineer to practice along with the senior colleague serves as a win-win for both the company and the junior developer.\n\nCiting the banks, he explained that the system is too rigid for developers like him. He said most Nigerian banks are still running in an old manner and, \u201cthis is a big issue for developers especially those that have worked outside the banking system. Some banks still do full onsite for their IT staff which is a problem for developers that are experienced because there are international companies that are willing to give them a token that is more than the salary paid by the Nigerian companies and with a good level of flexibility.\u201d\n\nThe engineer stated that Nigerian companies and businesses should also start paying their workers, especially tech talents, by the value they bring to the organization and not by the number of years spent in the industry or by age.\n\nMeanwhile, he explained that they should also give out rewarding incentives to their workers and give them reasons to always find value in what they do.",
          "summary": "In a recent statement, Abubakar Suleiman, the chief executive officer of Sterling Bank referred to the exit of these tech talents as a \u201cgreat resignation\u201d.\nBusinessDay reached out to experts in the tech ecosystem who outlined various ways businesses in Nigeria can retain talents.\nMuhammad Habib, a software engineer explained that the government have a crucial role to play in keeping tech talents from leaving the country.\n\u201cUnethical behaviour at work has to stop if businesses really want to retain tech talents.\n\u201cEveryone knows very few Nigerian companies can afford to compete with what people are paid on freelancing platforms.",

The foundation was set up by a former Inspector General of Police (IGP), Solomon Arase, who celebrated his 66th birthday.\n\nCommending Arase and other residents for their support in tackling insecurity in the state, the governor expressed satisfaction that \u201ccitizens of Edo State on their own spend time to rethink the security situation of the State, task themselves and raise resources to complement the government\u2019s efforts at tackling the security challenges in the state.\u201d\n\nObaseki further charged leaders across the country on selflessness, urging them on the need to give back to society, contributing effectively to the development of their communities.\n\nHe said leaders must invest in giving back to the society that made them, ensuring the empowerment of the less-privileged in society.\n\nCommending the philanthropic gesture of former Inspector General of Police, Arase, the governor said, \u201cWe thank you for your support and leadership. You are not one of the wealthiest of public officers but rich in terms of spirit. It\u2019s not how much you have received but how much you have given back to society.\n\n\u201cOur society requires so much from us. What is important for us now as elites is what we can give back to society. You are one of the best, finest, and most intelligent police officers ever produced in this country. We are proud of your achievements as you are passionate and in love with the profession of policing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sole responsibility of the government is to provide security. Without security, we have no need for the government. This shows the importance of security in Nigeria. I am glad you are now in the vanguard of pushing for citizens\u2019 policing in the country,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, Arase said, \u201cThe people must come together to fight insecurity, which is our common enemy. This should be the model we must use and leave behind for Edo people. We have to team up as there are a lot of ungoverned spaces in this country. We must galvanise our youths to deepen security in the state and ensure the safety of our people.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe items donated include one sienna vehicle, 500 motorcycles, over 1,000 customised T-shirts, face caps, raincoats, torch lights, and ant whistles. These kits should be judiciously utilised to improve the security situation in the state. This foundation was set up in 2016 when I was retiring from the police force.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecurity is capital intensive and we all need to support the government to combat crime in our society as the government cannot do it alone unless through our collaborative efforts,\u201d Arase added\n\nReassuring of improved security in the state, the Edo State Commissioner of Police, Abutu Yaro pledged, \u201cWe will fight crime and criminality to the highest level in Edo State. We will not be reactive but proactive in fighting crime.

          "title": "N40,000 Minimum Wage In Edo: Kudos To Governor Obaseki \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe thoughtful increase in substantial percentage and commencement of payment of the new Minimum Wage from N30,000 to N40,000 in May 2022 by Edo State Government, is evidently a humane testament of Governor Godwin Obaseki\u2019s genuine concern for workers\u2019 quandary in the Nigeria system.\n\nIn the same vein, Governor Godwin Obaseki also judiciously approved the harmonisation of Pensioners\u2019 take home, to cushion their pain and lack in the midst of current economic free fall across the country. This harmonisation, obviously led to the recent verification of all the pensioners in the State properly tagged: \u201cI am Alive.\u201d\n\nAll these put together, is an eloquent expression of the Governor\u2019s desire, not only to incentivise workers against the spike of inflation, unregulated economy as well as the prevailing harsh standard of living in the country, but also a manifestation of his verifiable understanding of the possibilities of inherent genuine principles of affirmative Federalism in our system.\n\nIn an ideal situation for instance, the considerate Minimum wage, such as the newly implemented increase in Edo and the gesture towards the pensioners for example, both have the obvious consequent of not only impacting direct motivational factor on workers; whether active, retired or potential employees; but should also affect immediately, economic viability, standard of living and most importantly, less mobility of qualified and efficient workers in the State civil and public service.\n\nIn other words, Minimum wage, depending on the prevailing inflationary trend, has the potential value to affect productivity, income inequality, economic growth, self-improvement and employee retention.\n\nAlthough not precisely justifiable, the State labour Union for example, with obvious understanding of the complex predicament of the current Nigeria system, could not legitimately or morally demand for the inevitable increase, due to the very fact that there is a prevailing prescribed National Minimum Wage, which many states are still negotiating and others very belligerent to implement.\n\nIt is therefore imperative to generally appreciate the patience and understanding of labour in this regard, as well as the general cohesive policy of Edo State Government being collectively harnessed for a better and harmonious Edo State Civil Service.\n\nTo this end therefore, it is important to appreciate, commend and give Governor Godwin Obaseki enormous kudos for his thought-visibility in the increase of the new Minimum Wage in Edo State.\n\nGovernor Obaseki, without doubt, equally deserves legendary gratitude for his vision and focus, not only expressed so far in the improvement of infrastructure in the State, but also as it affects the gratified government personnel who are sincerely excited by the gesture. This is particularly so, in the sense that the recent increase of the minimum wage from N30,000.00 to N40,000.00 in the State, was solely prompted by the Governor, processed and effected as a form of economic empathy, without any pressure or coercion from any stakeholder.\n\nThis is particularly reassuring in the fact that Edo State Government, under the leadership of Governor Godwin Obaseki, in spite of the limited and scarce revenue resources, is manifestly capable of engaging ingenuous positive strategies as could be necessitated by policy preferences, fiscal demands and excellent discretion in governance.\n\nThe speed and promptness with which the minimum wage increase was processed and implemented, visibly expressed the genuine heartfelt of Edo State Government for its workforce, who on the long run, are persistently being pressed by the repressive Nigeria political and economic nuances.\n\nSpecifically, the basic essence of minimum wage for workers and labour is to be able to provide sufficient food, shelter and other basic necessities for self and family. Of all these basic and necessary securities, research has shown that government can hardly and sufficiently regulate these comfort or provide them in abundance for its workforce and its people through wage alone.\n\nThis is largely so, due to pervading believe that government has no business in the production of consumable goods and services. Instead, they are tend to perpetually concerned themselves with the need to providing enabling environment through policies. Ironically, these enabling environments have continued to be subjugated by some private individuals usually called small, medium or large scale investors.\n\nGoing by this thought process, it will absolutely be very difficult for any government, whether at the local, state or federal level, to control, regulate service providers, sanctions defaulters or even fix the prices of goods and services that could be commensurate with any minimum wage. In other words, Government cannot adequately and successfully fix and regulate the price of goods and services they do not produce, especially with the absent of strong regulating institutions in the country.\n\nThis ambivalent scenario would at all times, leave the wage earner and even the government at the mercy of market forces, whose managers, even under normal circumstances, are only concerned with immediate and overkill profit for their capital and legitimate investments.\n\nThis conundrum therefore, will certainly continue to reverberate as a result of the ever dwindling value of the Nigeria currency \u2013 the Naira, imperfect values and reactionary policies and lack of sustainable government involvement in production processes. It will as well continue to manifest, due to the greed and insincerity on the part of private exploitative individuals, just as the collective shylocks system appear to be very visible in every department of our social lives without any feelings or concerned for the wage earners or the collective wellbeing.\n\nIn this regard, it is very unfortunate therefore, to logically explain that a dedicated worker, who has been loyal and committed to his duties and responsibilities, having put in thirty-five (35) years in the service is hardly able to build a living house for himself and family, ride a good car and train his/her children in good schools. These underlying indices, in line with capacity, efficiency and competitive productive engagements are what should normally define earned wage on the long run and help to break the painful chain of poverty and recycle penury for the average worker and eventual pensioners.\n\nNevertheless, it is very important therefore, to emphasise that the substantial review and the prompt implementation of the new minimum wage in Edo, which is higher than the statutory prescription in Nigeria, as well as more than any other state in the country by the Edo State Governor, is absolutely in the right direction and highly commendable.\n\nThis gesture will certainly spur Edo State workers to be hopeful, believing that their Governor, Godwin Obaseki is certainly concerned with the economically-induced dwindling value of their wage, understands their plight and very ready and willing to do the possibilities whenever and wherever necessary.\n\nIn the light of the foregoing therefore, it is suffice to say that Governor Godwin Nogheghase Obaseki has sufficiently done very well in this regard and has eternally added another constructive legacy, which will remain ever positive in the annals of posterity.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",
          "summary": "In the same vein, Governor Godwin Obaseki also judiciously approved the harmonisation of Pensioners\u2019 take home, to cushion their pain and lack in the midst of current economic free fall across the country.\nIn other words, Minimum wage, depending on the prevailing inflationary trend, has the potential value to affect productivity, income inequality, economic growth, self-improvement and employee retention.\nIt is therefore imperative to generally appreciate the patience and understanding of labour in this regard, as well as the general cohesive policy of Edo State Government being collectively harnessed for a better and harmonious Edo State Civil Service.\nTo this end therefore, it is important to appreciate, commend and give Governor Godwin Obaseki enormous kudos for his thought-visibility in the increase of the new Minimum Wage in Edo State.\nSpecifically, the basic essence of minimum wage for workers and labour is to be able to provide sufficient food, shelter and other basic necessities for self and family.",

South Korea has announced aid and Pakistan, Iran and Qatar have sent food supplies and other essential items to the country.\n\nThe country, already in its worst drought in three decades, has also been hit hard by the recent surge in food prices, fueled by the war in Ukraine.

It is a situation where what the body needs is there but the body is starving. That is the current situation of our nation Nigeria. Starvation in the midst of enormous abundance and resources.\u201d\n\nThe cleric also read an emotional letter from a kidnap victim, who was held captive by bandits in northern Nigeria for about 18 months.\n\nThe letter, which moved many to tears, exposed the horrific and terrible things kidnap victims go through in capacity.\n\nHe added, \u201cI am so amazed that most of our people in this country behave as if everything is alright. I encountered a woman recently that was in captivity of terrorists for about one and half years.\n\n\u201cShe wrote a letter to me from the terrorists\u2019 camp, but she said there was no means to send the letter (from there), so when she saw me in person, she delivered the letter.\n\n\u201cIn the letter, she revealed horrible things kidnap victims go through on a daily basis.\n\nThe letter reads in part:\n\n\u201c\u2026We have gone through pain and agony that is unexplainable. Some Christian mothers and sisters have stayed here for about four, three, two and one years and some have stayed for five months.\u201d\n\n\u201cYoung ladies are being forced to convert or are given out for marriage. Ladies who refuse to convert are turned to sex slaves and some are being forced into hard labour, while people like uniform personnel, NGO workers and so on are killed brutally. Sometimes,they demand huge ransom for their release.\n\nYoung boys are seized from their mothers and seized to join them\u2026.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs she recounted her story, it is unbelievable that we live in such a country where such a demonic agenda is being perpetrated.\u201d\n\nPastor Enenche, therefore, declared God\u2019s judgment on killers and their sponsors in Nigeria.\n\nHe decried how wasters of lives are arrested and allowed to scotfree without being prosecuted, a development he described as very \u201csad and terrible.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I have bad news for them, the nation shall be the burial ground for every killer and their sponsors in the land.\u201d\n\nThe cleric also called on Nigerians, irrespective of religion or ethnicity, to get their Permanent Voters Card so they can participate in the forthcoming general elections in 2023.\n\nHe said gone were the days when people thought votes don\u2019t count. He believes that when people unite with one voice, things will change and good leaders would be enthroned.\n\nThe programme featured special intercession for the land.\n\nGovernment representatives, music ministers and pastors from different denominations were also part of the crusade.",

          "text": "Germany triggered the \u201calarm stage\u201d of its emergency gas plan on Thursday in response to falling Russian supplies but stopped short of allowing utilities to pass on soaring energy costs to customers in Europe\u2019s largest economy.\n\nThe measure is the latest escalation in a standoff between Europe and Moscow since the Russian invasion of Ukraine that has exposed the bloc\u2019s dependence on Russian gas supplies and sparked a frantic search for alternative energy sources.\n\nThe decision, announced by the economy minister, marks a stark shift especially for Germany, which has cultivated strong energy ties with Moscow stretching back to the Cold War.\n\nLower gas flows sparked warnings this week that Germany could fall into recession if Russia supplies halted altogether. S&P Global\u2019s flash Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) on Thursday showed the economy losing momentum in the second quarter.\n\n\u201cWe must not fool ourselves: The cut in gas supplies is an economic attack on us by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin,\u201d Economy Minister Robert Habeck said in a statement, adding Germans would have to reduce consumption.\n\n\u201cIt is obviously Putin\u2019s strategy to create insecurity, drive up prices and divide us as a society,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is what we are fighting against.\u201d\n\nGas rationing would hopefully be avoided but cannot be ruled out, Habeck said.\n\nRussia has denied the gas supply reductions were premeditated, with state supplier Gazprom (GAZP.MM) blaming a delay in return of serviced equipment caused by Western sanctions.\n\nUnder its Phase 2 plan, Berlin will provide a credit line of 15 billion euros ($15.76 billion) to fill gas storage facilities. In addition, a gas auction model will be launched this summer to encourage industrial gas consumers to save gas.\n\nThe government activates the second \u201calarm stage\u201d of a three-stage emergency plan when it sees a high risk of long-term supply shortages. It theoretically allows utilities to pass on high prices to industry and households and thereby help to lower demand.\n\nA move to the next phase has been the subject of speculation since Gazprom cut flows via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline across the Baltic Sea to just 40% of capacity last week.\n\nFacing dwindling gas flows from main supplier Russia, Germany has since late March been at Phase 1 of its emergency plan, which includes stricter monitoring of daily flows and a focus on filling gas storage facilities.\n\nRISK OF FULL DISRUPTION\n\nIn the second stage, the market is still able to function without the need for state intervention that would kick in the final emergency stage.\n\n\u201cWe have seen some serious cuts already,\u201d a gas trader in Europe said. \u201cThe system is still coping, but there\u2019s not much left,\u201d he said.\n\nThe benchmark Dutch wholesale gas contract for July delivery rose as much as 4%, to 131.50 euros per Megawatt/hour (MWh) before settling at 128 euros/MWh by 0835 GMT, still up for the day.\n\nNord Stream 1 is due to undergo maintenance on July 11-21 when flows will stop.\n\nRussia may cut off gas to Europe entirely to bolster its political leverage, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Wednesday, adding Europe needed to prepare now.\n\nRussian gas flows to Europe via Nord Stream 1 and through Ukraine were stable on Thursday, while reverse flows on the Yamal pipeline edged up, operator data showed.\n\nSeveral European countries have outlined measures to withstand a supply squeeze and avert winter energy shortages and an inflation spike that could test the continent\u2019s resolve to maintain sanctions on Russia.\n\nThe supply cuts have also driven German companies to contemplate painful production cuts and resorting to polluting forms of energy previously considered unthinkable as they adjust to the prospect of running out of Russian gas.\n\nThe European Union on Wednesday signalled it would temporarily turn to coal to plug energy shortfalls, while describing Moscow\u2019s gas supply cuts as \u201crogue moves.\u201d\n\nThe bloc\u2019s climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said on Thursday that 10 of the EU\u2019s 27 member countries have issued an \u201cearly warning\u201d on gas supply \u2013 the first and least severe of three crisis levels identified in EU energy security regulations.\n\n\u201cThe risk of full gas disruption is now more real than ever before,\u201d he said.",
          "summary": "Lower gas flows sparked warnings this week that Germany could fall into recession if Russia supplies halted altogether.\nRussia has denied the gas supply reductions were premeditated, with state supplier Gazprom (GAZP.MM) blaming a delay in return of serviced equipment caused by Western sanctions.\nIn addition, a gas auction model will be launched this summer to encourage industrial gas consumers to save gas.\nThe government activates the second \u201calarm stage\u201d of a three-stage emergency plan when it sees a high risk of long-term supply shortages.\nRussian gas flows to Europe via Nord Stream 1 and through Ukraine were stable on Thursday, while reverse flows on the Yamal pipeline edged up, operator data showed.",

          "title": "Nigeria: INEC Has Powers to Reject Lawan and Akpabio, Says Falana",
          "text": "Lagos-based lawyer, Mr Femi Falana, SAN, has stated that Nigeria\u2019s Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is empowered by both constitutional and electoral provisions to reject the names of candidates from political parties that ought not to be on the ballot in any election.\n\nFalana\u2019s remarks was in reaction to a statement attributed to a National Commissioner of INEC, Mr Mohammed Haruna, to the effect that the commission\u2019s responsibility did not include rejection of names submitted to it for an election by political parties.\n\nHaruna spoke against the backdrop of the submission of the names of Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, and former Minister of Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio, as senatorial candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 general election.\n\nBoth Lawan and Akpabio contested the presidential primary of APC. While Akpabio later stepped down, Lawan lost to Senator Bola Tinubu, who won the party\u2019s ticket.\n\nYet, APC sent the names of Lawan and Akpabio as Yobe and Akwa Ibom states\u2019 senatorial candidates, respectively, even though, both men never bought the expression of interest and nomination forms of their party for the position of senator, and they were neither screened nor did they participate in the primary elections for such position.\n\nWhile the Akwa Ibom Resident Electoral Commissioner, Mr. Mike Igini, faulted the action of APC, Haruna, on the other hand, claimed that the electoral umpire had no power to reject names sent to it by political parties. In justifying his position, he maintained that primaries were the sole prerogatives of parties, adding that INEC\u2019s responsibility is merely to monitor the primaries and make sure they abide by their own regulations, the Electoral Act and the Constitution.\n\nBut Falana faulted Haruna based on the provisions of the Electoral Act, stressing, \u201cSection 84 (1) clearly states that a political party seeking to nominate candidates for elections under this Act shall hold primaries for aspirants to all elective positions, which shall be monitored by the commission. The monitoring by INEC is mandatory. To that extent, any primary of a political party not monitored by officials of INEC is illegal.\n\n\u201cContrary to the views credited to Mr. Haruna, the powers of INEC have gone beyond \u2018merely to monitor\u2019 party primaries. For the avoidance of doubt, Section: 84 (13) unequivocally provides that, \u2018where a political party fails to comply with the provisions of this Act in the conduct of its primaries, its candidate for election shall not be included in the election for the particular position in issue.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe said the legal implication of the provision is that INEC shall not include the candidate for the particular election.\n\nFalana stated further, \u201cFurthermore, Section 29 (1) of the Electoral Act, 2022, which provides for the submission of lists of candidates and their affidavits by political parties, states that, \u2018Every political party shall, not later than 180 days before the date appointed for a general election under this Act, submit to the commission, in the prescribed forms, the list of the candidates the party proposes to sponsor at the elections, who must have emerged from valid primaries conducted by the political party.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to Falana, Section 29(1) has imposed a duty on political parties to ensure that the candidates whose names are submitted to INEC have emerged from valid primaries.\n\nHe said this position was quite different from the provision in Section 31 of the repealed Electoral Act 2010 (as amended), which provided that INEC could not reject the name of any candidate submitted by the parties for any reason whatsoever.\n\nFalana said, \u201cThus, in the present law, the parties can only submit for the commission\u2019s acceptance, the names of candidates who emerged from valid primaries conducted by the parties and monitored by INEC.\n\n\u201cThis position is clearly fortified by Section 84(13). Thus, INEC having sent a team of monitors across its 36 states offices and the Federal Capital Territory, to monitor the primaries, is legally obligated to check the names submitted to it and ensure they are confirmed by the various reports compiled by its officials.\n\n\u201cIf the candidates, whose names are submitted to INEC have not emerged from the primaries, the commission will reject such names in exercise of its power under Section 84(13) of the Electoral Act 2022. That was what INEC did in Zamfara State, when that power was not even expressly provided for.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, most shocking to read in the social media statements attributed to some INEC National Commissioners to the effect that INEC is bound to accept the names of candidates, who did not participate in valid party primaries.\n\n\u201cWith respect, the statement that INEC does not have power to reject names of persons submitted by political parties that did not emerge from valid primaries is grossly misleading. In fact, the embarrassing statement amounts to abdication of statutory duty under the above quoted provision of the Electoral Act aimed at sanitising the process of nomination of candidates for national elections in Nigeria.\u201d",

We cannot afford to lose them,\u201d Fani-Kayode tweeted.\n\nWhen THISDAY contacted him on what informed his Tweet, Fani-Kayode said the lawmakers were very unhappy and had concluded plans to defect en masse soon.\n\nHe said this was why he raised the alarm so that those concerned in the party hierarchy might try to save the situation before it gets out of hand.\n\nFani-Kayode claimed the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, and National Secretary of the party, Iyiola Omisore, and himself had started to engaged with some of the senators.\n\nAduda: PDP May Soon Form Majority in Senate\n\nMeanwhile the new Senate Minority Leader, Philip Aduda, boasted that PDP might soon form the majority in the Senate, with the number of senators defecting to his party.\n\nAduda stated this while addressing journalists in Abuja.

          "text": "National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu, met with senators elected on the platform of the ruling party behind closed doors, on Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking with journalists after the meeting with the APC caucus in the senate, Adamu said the party was worried by the gale of defections among senators. He however, said it was a usual occurrence in election periods and not peculiar to the ruling party.\n\nTwo senators from Bauchi and Imo states resigned their membership of APC and PDP, on Wednesday, further compounding the woes of their parties.\n\nThat was as other senators from the ruling party, who were said to have planned their defection for next week gave conditions under which they would halt the trend. They said only justice could reverse the gale of defections currently rocking the party.\n\nA chieftain of the APC and former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, hinted that no fewer than 22 more APC senators might dump the party for the main opposition PDP soon.\n\nSimilarly, the new Senate Minority Leader, Senator Philip Aduda, on Wednesday, boasted that the opposition PDP would soon form majority in the senate if the gale of defection by APC senators was sustained.\n\nIn a related development, Lagos-based lawyer, Mr Femi Falana, SAN, insisted that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was empowered by both constitutional and electoral provisions to reject the names of candidates from political parties that ought not to be on the ballot in any election.\n\nSpeaking after addressing the senators, Adamu said, \u201cThe meeting with the senators was most fruitful. The issue of defection is an unfortunate development, when it happens, but this is a season where there are all sorts of behaviours in the political space and ours is not an exception. In every election year, this kind of thing gives cause for stakeholders to sneeze and Nigeria is not an exception, so is the APC not an exception.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about what is happening in other parties, my focus is on the APC. But we all know that the occurrence is not only happening in the APC; it\u2019s happening across other political parties, too. And because we are the ruling party, our problems are exaggerated before the public.\u201d\n\nThe APC chairman said he did not know if the problem of defection was surmountable.\n\nHe added, \u201cThere is no responsible leader that would not be worried, when he loses one member, not to talk of two. At the moment, we are faced with the stark reality of our problems.\n\n\u201cI have committed my colleagues at the National Assembly to face the problem squarely and see the problem as solvable. We are in politics, I don\u2019t know what would happen tomorrow, and nobody does.\u201d\n\nSenators Lists Conditions to Halt Defection\n\nTHISDAY learnt from some senators, who attended the meeting that Adamu, that he cited intelligence reports available to the party leadership as reason for convening the parley.\n\nA senator from the North-west told THISDAY, on the condition of anonymity, that the APC national chairman said he learnt that some APC lawmakers were planning massive defections on the floor of the two chambers next week.\n\nBut he said his colleagues told Adamu that only justice could reverse the gale of defections rocking the party, noting that they sought the immediate intervention of the APC leadership to stem the tide.\n\nThe senator said, \u201cThe national chairman said the essence of his meeting with us was to find out the reasons APC senators were defecting. Adamu said he had intelligence reports that many senators were planning massive defections next week and he came to find out what could be done to halt the action.\n\n\u201cSome senators actually stood up to give different scenarios of the type of injustices they suffered in the hands of their governors. Adamu, after listening to them, promised that the National Working Committee of the APC and the leadership of the senate would meet soon to address the lawmakers\u2019 grievances.\u201d\n\nNo fewer than eight APC senators, including the Majority Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi, have so far dumped the ruling party on the floor of the red chamber.\n\nTwo senators from Bauchi and Imo states resigned their membership of both the APC and the PDP. Senator Dauda Jika, represents Bauchi Central and was elected on the platform of APC, while Senator Ezenwa Onyewuchi, representing Imo East Senatorial District, was elected on the platform of the PDP.\n\nJika and Onyewuchi stated their decisions in separate letters addressed to the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, where they gave reasons for resigning their membership of APC and PDP, to join the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) and Labour Party (LP), respectively.\n\nJika said, \u201cI hereby wish to notify you of my defection from the APC to the NNPP, whose ideals are in line with my political aspirations.\u201d\n\nOnyewuchi, on his part, said, \u201cI wish to inform Mr. President and the distinguished senators of my defection from the PDP to the Labour Party. This is after due consultation with my family, constituents and supporters. This will enable me participate fully in the movement for a new Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s defection brought the number of APC senators to 61, with members of the minority parties standing at 48.\n\nThe minority parties in the senate were five as at, Wednesday, June 22. They are the PDP, Young Peoples Party (YPP), All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), NNPP, and Labour Party.",
