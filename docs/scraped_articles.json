          "title": "How we\u2019ll leverage tech to make CUSTECH world-class university\u2014 Gov. Bello",
          "text": "Kogi State Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello has said the goal of his administration for its newly established university, Confluence University of Science and Technology (CUSTECH), Osara, Kogi State, is to make it a world class citadel of learning that will groom graduates grounded in science and technology.\n\nHe said this on Thursday during the maiden matriculation ceremony for pioneer students of the university held at Osara, Kogi State.\n\nThe governor described the matriculation ceremony as a watershed in the history of educational development of Kogi State.\n\nHe said his administration was greatly disturbed by the painful experiences of hundreds of Kogi youngsters who were unable to pursue careers in Science and Technology due to very limited openings in universities outside Kogi State, hence, the establishment of CUSTECH.\n\n\u201cWe found that even with impressive scores in the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), cutthroat competition for limited spaces and unfavorable catchment considerations usually put our children at a greater disadvantage.\n\n\u201cOver the years, access to such programmes as Medicine & Surgery, Pharmacy, Architecture, Engineering and others in this category kept dwindling for Kogi secondary school leavers.\n\n\u201cThis trend became so worrisome that we just had to act as a Government to bring it to the only logical end. Problems make me combative for solutions. It is my default mindset that leaders exist to find solutions to the problems of those they lead or they lose their moral authority to leadership. It was thus my duty and the duty of my Administration to solve this particular problem too for Kogites using all the resources of Government at our disposal.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, and in line with the Administration\u2019s avowed commitment to providing a wide spectrum of educational opportunities for our younger generations, we decided to take action by establishing a specialised university of our own, dedicated to science and technology. Not only was this action imperative but it was also very much in sync with best practices in educational progressivism all over the world.\n\n\u201cIn fact, we were so driven by the need to reduce the pains of our young ones as quickly as possible that we may have set a record for the shortest gestation period ever in the history of Nigerian universities\u201d, he said.\n\nHe said the goal of his administration was to ensure the university becomes a world class citadel of learning and can compete favourably with its peers in any part of the globe.\n\n\u201cIn establishing CUSTECH, our ultimate goal is to achieve a world-class citadel. It was designed and built to provide first-grade training in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines for our youth.\n\n\u201cBy leveraging ICT and artificial intelligence (AI), it is our plan to rapidly move the institution forward till it becomes comparable to similar schools anywhere on the globe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I talk about making this school at par with its peers across the world, I do not refer to academic output alone. Indeed, not long ago we flagged off the commencement of works on more physical facilities for the first phase of the Campus development.\n\n\u201cThis phase will deliver the University Senate Building, the University Library, Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Computing and Informatics, and Faculty of Basic Medical and Health Sciences. This Administration is also building a massive Reference Hospital in Okene which will be equipped with facilities which any ultramodern tertiary health institution would be proud of.\n\n\u201cIt will be equipped for the diagnosis and treatment of most diseases prevalent in Nigerian society. When completed in the next couple of months, it is projected to be one of the best among its kind in the country. We are also designating it to provide Teaching Hospital services to this great institution.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to remark here that CUSTECH has just received a boost from the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) for both physical and academic developments on campus. This support will help us achieve our desire to make this university of international standard all the more faster\u201d, he said.\n\nSpeaking on the government\u2019s choice of location for the university, he said it was \u201csubstantially guided by the principles of fairness and equity, succinctly captured under our EBIGO policy and philosophy. Hitherto, the Eastern and Western Senatorial districts already have the Prince Abubakar Audu University, Anyigba, and the Federal University, Lokoja respectively. Thus, for geographical balancing, the Central Senatorial District easily had the strongest case. God knows that if the situation was otherwise I would not have hesitated to plant this school where equity demands.\u201d\n\nHe assured that for as long as he will be governor, he would ensure all the institutions are fully supported and strengthened to achieve the greatest heights possible in their core competencies.\n\nThe governor charged the newly matriculated students to consider the opportunity delivered to them to study at CUSTECH as \u201cgolden and priceless.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are the lucky pioneers of generations of young Nigerians who will pass through the portals of this great institution and come out reconstructed into Changemakers for our nation and our world.\n\n\u201cYour admission into this set has put much responsibility on you to excel in character and learning in order to justify your place in this Honour Guard of history. You must therefore cherish what you have here and allow it to guide you into the path of greatness.\n\n\u201cRemember that education has always been nationally acknowledged as the niche of Kogi indigenes and sustain that record with superlative performance\u201d, he said.\n\nHe commended CUSTECH\u2019s management led by Prof. Engr. Salawu Sadiku for relentlessly driving the Government\u2019s vision of quickly bringing this university to full functional order.\n\n\u201cSo far, you have all proven that we did not make a mistake in your appointments. Keep it up and we shall have no problems. I am challenging management to produce graduates for us in this first batch of students who are so excellent at what they do that future generations of students will be sought after from all over the world even before they graduate. In or out of Government, we want to have that great sense of fulfilment which will come from seeing CUSTECH graduates taking the driver\u2019s seat in national and international development\u201d, he said.\n\nA total of 245 Students were matriculated on Thursday by the management of the institution.",

We\u2019re intensifying efforts to rescue victims \u2013 Police\n\nBy Steve Oko\n\nIt was a tale of horror and agony in Isuikwuato Local Government Area of Abia State as bandits suspected to be Fulani herdsmen, Thursday evening, abducted 10 passengers and took them into the bush.\n\nThe hoodlums were armed with dangerous weapons. According to reports, the travelers who boarded the vehicle at the motor park opposite the Abia State University Uturu were on their way to Akara in Isuikwuato.\n\nTheir vehicle was said to have been flagged down by the bandits who immediately marched the travelers into the bush. The victim\u2019s identities are yet to be ascertained as of the time of filling this report.\n\nAccording reports the hoodlums were later engaged in a gun duel by soldiers in a nearby military checkpoint but they managed to escape with their victims.\n\nThere is no information yet about the victims as their abductors are yet to make any contacts.\n\nThis is as a woman in a separate incident was abuducted and raped to death by a gang of bandits also suspected to be Fulanis whose menacing terrorist activities especially around Uturu axis in the recent times have assumed threatening dimension.\n\nThe victim who was reportedly stabbed by the bandits hailed from Amagu, Mbaugwu, Uturu in Isuikwuato LGA.\n\nConfirming the dastardly incidents to our Correspondent, the Isuikwuato LGA Chairman, Hon. Chima Agbaeze decried the activities of Fulani herdsmen in the area.\n\nHe regretted that despite spirited efforts by the Council to stem the tide, bandits still terrorize innocent folks.\n\nThe Council boss particularly expressed shock and rage that bandits successfully abducted travelers despite having many security checkpoints on the same road.\n\n\u201d It\u2019s so annoying that I have four security checkpoints comprising the Army, police and local vigilante on that road between Uturu and Isuikwuato yet such thing happened\u201d, Agbaeze fumed.\n\nThe Council boss who said that security remained the first charge of his administration vowed not to relent until his people are secure.\n\nHe said he was collaborating with his Umunneochi and Okigwe counterparts for a joint efforts against the menace.\n\nAccording to him, intelligence revealed that some of the bandits operate from Lokpanta where there is a concentration of Fulani community at the Cattle market, hence the synergy with Umunneochi LGA where the regional market is domiciled.\n\nOn the identity of the abducted travelers, the LG boss said efforts were ongoing to unravel it.\n\nHe also said that frantic efforts were on to rescue the victims.\n\nAbout two months ago commuters including lecturers and students of the Abia State University Uturu were abducted around the same axis.\n\nIn a separate incident too, students of ABSU and other passengers enroute Okigwe were also abducted by Fulani herdsmen who have virtually taken control of the area.\n\nThis is as the Fulani herdsmen, also recently, killed a final year student of Marist Comprehensive Academy Uturu when they shot at the school coaster conveying the students.\n\nThe incident took place opposite the gate of Okigwe LGA headquarters in the nearby Imo State.\n\nKidnapping for ransom by Fulani bandits have become a regular occurrence around Isuikwuato LGA and some parts of Abia North.\n\nWhen contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer PPRO, Geoffrey Ogbonna, also confirmed the incident but said efforts were on to rescue the victims.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The International Labour Organisation (ILO) says the elimination of child labour is critical to the growth and development of West Africa. TOBA AGBOOLA reports.\n\nA RESEARCH by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) has indicated a potential increase to the 160 million children trapped in child labour worldwide.\n\nOf this figure, 72.1 million of children are found in Africa, where COVID-19 has affected economies and more children are burdened with responsibilities.\n\nThe impacts of child labour on our safety and development cannot be over-emphasised.\n\nDirector of the ILO Abuja Country Office for Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ghana, Nigeria, Ms. Vanessa Phala, said at a forum in Abuja on child labour that there was the need to close the gap in the prevalence of child labour in the region through accelerated action by each member state, and monitoring and evaluation of efforts by the ECOWAS Commission for maximum impact in improving social protection, social security, social safety nets and economic growth.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe latest global estimates by the ILO and UNICEF indicated that in terms of prevalence, nearly one of four children in sub-Saharan Africa is in child labour while West and Central Africa account for a significant number of these children.\n\nAcknowledging the efforts of the ECOWAS Commission, in collaboration with ILO, for the evaluation of the implementation of the first ECOWAS Regional Action Plan (RAP) for the elimination of the worst forms of child Labour, she noted that the assessment of the implementation of RAP was informative and identified successes and gaps that require interventions.\n\nNoting that the evaluation informed the development of the draft of the second cycle RAP document set for validation, she expressed optimism that the effective implementation of the RAP by member states and monitoring by the ECOWAS Commission would ensure the elimination of child labour across the region.\n\nThe ILO is collaborating with ECOWAS in the evaluation, development and validation of the RAP, under the framework of the Accelerating action for the elimination of child labour in supply chains in Africa (ACCEL Africa) project, funded by the Netherlands Government.\n\nHowever, given the global increase in the number of children trapped in child labour to an alarming 160 million \u2013 from 152 million in the last four years, the ILO Director said: \u201cOur efforts in Africa requires acceleration as there is the need to implement innovative actions that will ensure positive impact through strengthened partnerships.\n\n\u201cThrough targeted actions in agriculture and artisanal gold mining supply chains, by projects like the ACCEL Africa, the ILO is supporting national stakeholders in the elimination of child labour.\n\n\u201cWe are supporting communities with the most prevalent cases of child labour by promoting economic empowerment, strengthening of legal frameworks, supporting communities to take ownership of the fight against child labour, providing withdrawal, prevention and rehabilitation services to children in or at high risk of child labour and promoting community well-being to ensure the sustainability of the actions.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cAs we review and validate this regional strategy to prevent and respond to the exploitation of children in the workplace, it is important to observe the implications of our actions in achieving SDG Target 8.7. It is hoped that the implementation of this RAP will contribute to the achievements of SDG 8.7.\n\n\u201cTake immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in its forms.\n\n\u201cTherefore, as custodians of society, it\u2019s our responsibility to secure the future by communicating effectively, using a synergy of messaging harmonised into the single ambition to eliminate forms of child labour in Nigeria by 2025.\u201d\n\nCommending the ECOWAS Commission for its achievements in the elimination of child labour and protection of children, she said with the validation, ECOWAS had implemented its International Year for the Elimination of Child Labour (IYECL) pledge.\n\nDeputy Director, Inspectorate, Ministry of Labour and Employment, Olaolu Olaitan, cautioned that not all work done by children are child labour, saying there are differences between child labour and child work.\n\nShe said: \u201cNot all work done by children should be classified as child labour. Whether or not particular forms of \u2018work\u2019 can be called \u2018child labour\u2019depends on the child\u2019s age, the type and hours of work performed, the conditions under which it is performed and the objectives pursued by individuals or parents for engaging in such work.\n\n\u201cChildren or adolescents\u2019 participation in work that does not affect their health and personal development or interfere with their schooling is regarded as child work and something positive.This includes activities such as helping their parents around the home, assisting in a family business or earning pocket money outside school hours and during school holidays. These activities contribute to the development and welfare of their families; they provide them with skills and experience, and help to prepare them to be productive members of society during their adult life.\u201d\n\nShe stressed that the worst child labour involved children enslaved to serious hazards and illness or left to fend for themselves on the streets \u2013 often at a very early age.\n\nOlaitan insisted that while child labour takes various forms, the priority was to eliminate the odious practice without delay in accordance with Article 3 of the ILO Convention No 82.\n\nShe listed poverty, ignorance on the part of families and children of the risks involved in child labour, poor access to decent work, limited understanding of what child labour is, high demand for cheap labour, especially by small and medium scale enterprises in the informal sector, death of parents or caregivers, natural disaster and climate change, conflict situations, inadequate laws and enforcement, existing laws and codes of conducts often violated and national laws often include exemptions.\n\nTo the Acting Director, Inspectorate of the ministry, Ajuwon Dauda, child labourers are mostly found in agriculture, mining, domestic service, construction and transportation.\n\nHe said some of the children working in the various sectors were either victims of trafficking, forced or bonded labour subjected to both national and international flows, mostly within the ECOWAS region.\n\nIn mining, Dauda said child labour was prevalent in quarries and artisanal or small-scale mining, which mainly involved individuals, groups, families, or cooperatives with minimal or no mechanisation.\n\nAlso, the age group involved in quarrying is 11 to 15 with a predominant male distribution where children are involved in various dangerous activities such as digging, breaking, chiselling, heating, cracking, crushing, hammering, excavating and carrying of rocks, stone dust and sands.\n\nIn the construction industry, child labourers are involved in the task of brick-making, carrying and stacking bricks and other construction materials. Children\u2019s work in this sector often accounts for between three and four hours after school and longer during weekends and holiday periods.\n\nIn the transportation sector, the involvement of children often occurs at an early age when they are vulnerable to unhealthy influences and peer pressure. The gender distribution is skewed towards boys, with girls involved in providing ancillary services such as the sale of food and alcoholic drinks.\n\nTo tackle the menace, Dauda said the ministry was reviewing the Labour Act CAP L1, LFN, 2004 and other labour laws to address the gaps in labour administration and elimination of child labour.\n\nHowever, he pointed out that about 43 per cent of children between five and 17 were engaged in economic activities, an indication that modern slavery and child labour are still prevalent in Nigeria; and have remained formidable challenges.\n\nTo tackle child labour, Dauda said united efforts among governments, institutions, civil society organisations and individual entities in line with the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning multinational enterprises and social policy were urgently needed.",

As such, no resources and efforts will be spared in painstakingly following up on the trail of those who derive joy in attacking and killing innocent citizens and destroying their homes and means of livelihoods.\n\n\u201cI expect the security agencies to deploy everything at their disposal to arrest those who carried out the crime no matter how long it takes. Government will not take any excuse for failure to achieve this directive\u201d.\n\nLalong while commiserating with the victims and families of those killed, assured that they will get justice as Government will stop at nothing to unravel those behind this ugly incidences that continue to disrupt the livelihoods of the people of the Local Government.\n\nLalong also directed the Plateau State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) and the Peace Building Agency (PBA) to immediately visit the area and assess the level of damage with a view to carrying out immediate intervention and bringing succour to people who are in need as a result of the barbaric attack.",

The police and other security agencies had been mobilised to intensify surveillance, patrol in pursuit of the criminals. And it\u2019s not only about Abuja and Kaduna. Yes, Abuja-Kaduna belt was discussed specifically but we appreciated the fact that we are in the season of festivity. So, all agencies committed to providing security for Nigeria and the maintenance of law and order have been ordered to improve on their activities, intensify surveillance and minimize, if not eliminate totally any threat to law and order anywhere in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAsked if the military or the police would be taking the lead, he said: \u201cPolice, as I said, is the lead agency on internal security. So, whatever I\u2019ve said about maintenance of law and order will start with the police and then extend to all the other security agencies, certainly.\u201d\n\nOn if the issue or bandits collecting ransom, taking over and administering some areas in the country were discussed, he said: \u201cSpecific orders have been given to all our security agencies. And we\u2019ll see an improved response to all those challenging the sovereignty of Nigeria in whatever form and creating insecurity in whatever form anywhere. The council, today took firm decision on what to be done and I can assure Nigerians that with the charge from the President and the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces today, there will be an improved response to all forms of criminality in any part of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn whether there were new strategy to that effect as this will not be the first time such charge would be given, the minister said: \u201cBut what I know is that for as long as there is life, we must not rest until our objective of making Nigeria safe for Nigerians is made possible. So, I am convinced that with the renewed charge to our security agencies, from the military, to the police, intelligence organizations and all other security forces, certainly Nigerians will feel and live better going forward.\u201d\n\nHe said Buhari was also particularly happy with the news that the Head of INTERPOL National Central Bureau, Assistant Inspector General of Police, Garba Umar, has been elected vice president (Africa) and executive committee member of the International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL).\n\nThe minister said President Buhari was particularly pleased with the outcome of the November 6 gubernatorial election that produced former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Charles Soludo, in the Anambra State governorship election.\n\n\u201cThe president was particularly happy with the fact that a free and fair election was made possible by the INEC and our security agencies. And he was quite happy that the combination of INEC and the security agencies from the military to the police and all the other agencies made that possible with the support of the people and the government of Anambra.

          "text": "*Seeks policy intervention to douse appetite for white-collar jobs\n\n*Sets up body of experts to evaluate applications\n\n*FG hails initiative, says it will boost economic growth, reduce graduate unemployment\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nGovernor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday launched the apex bank\u2019s N500 million Tertiary Institutions Entrepreneurship Scheme (TIES).\n\nSpeaking at the launch of the scheme in Abuja, Emefiele said the intervention would create an enabling business environment that supports innovation. It would also enable the youth to unleash their entrepreneurial potential, by redirecting their focus from seeking white-collar jobs to embracing a culture of entrepreneurship, he said.\n\nThe initiative, which the CBN governor hinted at earlier this year, was expected to boost entrepreneurship in higher institutions of learning.\n\nEmefiele stressed the need for the environment to provide support in re-orientating, training, and providing a financing model apt to the peculiarities of the sector within which the businesses operate.\n\nHe urged government at all levels to evolve policy measures to support entrepreneurial development among the youth in the country. The CBN governor said this was particularly crucial given that about 600,000 students graduate yearly from Nigerian tertiary institutions without commensurate employment opportunities in both the public and private sectors.\n\nEmefiele said the essence of the intervention was to create a paradigm shift from the obsession for white-collar jobs among graduates and promote entrepreneurship. He said the CBN was particularly concerned about the current level of unemployment among the youth population.\n\nHe explained that the intervention consisted of three main components, including term loan, equity investment, and development grant.\n\nEmefiele said the scheme would make it easy for youths to access credit and create jobs for themselves and others. He warned that the finance to be provided was not a grant but a loan, which should be used for the intended purposes.\n\nHe said entrepreneurship remained an integral part of any economy, adding that entrepreneurs play a key role in driving growth and innovation, which in turn results in job creation.\n\nEmefiele said in line with its mandate of ensuring monetary and price stability, and its developmental mandate of ensuring inclusive growth in the economy, the central bank had introduced several programmes to create an ecosystem that allowed the flow of affordable credit to the real sector.\n\nHe added that these interventions were industry-led and designed to support the resilience of targeted priority sectors and segments for growth and job creation.\n\nHe explained, \u201cWith an estimated population of 213 million, out of which two-third are youth, aged under 35 years, the nation is faced with a historic opportunity, particularly as the demography continues to create clear evidence of their relevance to economic development, as accentuated by the global recognition of Nigerian tech start-ups and continued growth of businesses in the technology space owned by the youth.\n\n\u201cIn realisation of this, the CBN has introduced several innovative financing programmes designed to extend low-cost financing to youth entrepreneurs across the country.\n\n\u201cThese interventions have continued to receive resounding commendations, as they have proven effective in extending credit to youth entrepreneurs across the country.\u201d\n\nEssentially, he said TIES was conceived as part of measures to promote entrepreneurship development among the graduate and undergraduate youths of Nigerian polytechnics and universities, with the release of the implementation guidelines and the opening of a portal for submission of applications in October 2021.\n\nThe scheme aims at providing an innovative financing model that will support the development of innovative entrepreneurial ideas among graduates and undergraduates of tertiary institutions in the country, the CBN governor said.\n\nThe ceremony also witnessed the inauguration of the Body of Experts (BoE) by the CBN governor. The body, chaired by the Group Managing Director/Chief Executive, Sterling Bank Plc, Mr. Abubakar Suleiman, among other professionals, seeks to evaluate and rank entrepreneurial presentations made by the tertiary institutions under the development (grant) component.\n\nEmefiele said members of the body were professionals of impeccable standing, drawn from the academia, professional bodies, and industry. He said part of their job was to recommend projects with high potential and transformational impact for grant awards.\n\nOther members of the BoE include Chief Financial Officer, First Bank Plc, Mr. Patrick Iyamabo; Mr. Adamu Lawani (Zenith Bank Plc); Ms. Ngover Ihyembe-Nwankwo (Rand Merchant Bank); Mr. Ashafa Ladan (National Universities Commission); Mr. Abbati D.K. Muhammad (National Board for Technical Education); Dr. Friday Okpara of the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN); Mr. Tope Fasua (Global Analytics Consulting); Brigadier-General Folusho Oyinlola (National Defence College); and Ms. Bolanle Adekoya (PWC). Mrs. Temitope Akin-Fadeyi of the CBN is the body\u2019s secretary.\n\nEmefiele said the official launch of the TIES and subsequent inauguration of the BoE for the scheme\u2019s development component was a testimony to the important role the youth play in building new blocks for economic growth, particularly as national growth was highly dependent on strong and competitive businesses.\n\nHe said bridging their financing gaps and enhancing access to low-cost credit to drive development of business was a task that could only be addressed by an innovative financing model that correlates with the complexity and dynamics of these small businesses.\n\nEmefiele said the scheme was designed to address three verticals of the segment namely, term loan component, which provides direct credit opportunities to graduates of Nigerian polytechnics and universities of not more than seven years post-graduation.\n\nHe said an applicant, if successful, should be eligible for a maximum of N5 million for an individual, sole-proprietorship or small company; and a maximum of N25 million for a partnership or company.\n\nThe tenure of the facility is a maximum of five years, with a one-year moratorium, and at an interest of five per cent per annum, which shall revert to nine per cent from March 2022.\n\nThe pilot phase of the scheme is presently being implemented through the Bank of Industry (BOI) with the development of an application portal and processing of submitted applications.\n\nThe equity investment component is designed to support start-ups, existing businesses requiring expansion, and ailing businesses seeking resuscitation, and shall be implemented under the bank\u2019s AGSMEIS equity window.\n\nThe investment limit shall be subject to the limit prescribed by the AGSMEIS guidelines and the investment period not more than 10 years.\n\nEmefiele also noted that the development grant component was aimed at raising awareness and visibility of entrepreneurship among undergraduates of Nigerian tertiary institutions. He explained that here, polytechnics and universities in the country shall compete in a national biennial entrepreneurship competition where undergraduates are presented by the tertiary institutions to pitch innovative entrepreneurial or technological ideas with transformational potential.\n\nAccording to him, three top institutions at the regional levels shall proceed to the national level, where the top five shall be awarded grants ranging between N120 million and N250 million.\n\nHe insisted that the grant awards should be used by the tertiary institutions solely for the development of the award-willing ideas.\n\nFurther commenting on the genesis of the scheme, Emefiele said, \u201cAs you are all aware, at the occasion of the 51st convocation of the University of Lagos, in July 2021, I delivered the convocation lecture, titled, \u201cNational Development and Knowledge Economy in the Digital Age: Leapfrogging SMEs into the 21st Century.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt that event, I promised that the central bank would seek fresh collaboration with the nation\u2019s tertiary institutions to develop entrepreneurship programmes, and to support \u2013 through the provision of access to finance \u2013 graduates and undergraduates who have bankable ideas, to bring the ideas to fruition.\n\n\u201cEngagements have been on-going between the central bank and the leadership of some of our tertiary institutions regarding the framework for an innovative financing model that will support entrepreneurship development among our graduates and undergraduates.\n\n\u201cThis launch of the Tertiary Institutions Entrepreneurship Scheme today, is a culmination of the engagements and fulfilment of that promise.\u201d\n\nHighlights of the event included the presentation of commemorative cheques to five youth entrepreneurs whose proposals were found worthy of CBN\u2019s financing under the pilot scheme.\n\nSpeaking during the launch of the initiative, Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha, hailed the efforts of the central bank to ensure that the economy remained afloat despite the disruptions occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nRepresented by the Director, Public Affairs and Bilateral Relations, Office of the SGF, Mr. Olakunle Fashina, Mustapha said, not only would the TIES boost economic growth and reduce graduate unemployment but it would also provide well-grounded incentives for the ever-growing graduate population.\n\nHe urged the tertiary institutions to deploy merit in the selection of the proposed beneficiaries of the scheme as well as monitor key performance indicators as applications are submitted.\n\nSpeaking at the occasion also, Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, described the intervention as a laudable effort by Emefiele to promote entrepreneurial skills in the ivory towers. He said the CBN was playing a significant role in laying a solid foundation for technological development in the tertiary institutions.\n\nThe minister, who was represented by the ministry\u2019s Director, University Education, Mrs. Rakiya Iliyasu, he said no country could make appreciable growth in sound technological innovation and sustainable development without focusing on the base, which is the institutions responsible for training the students in the fields of agribusiness, information technology, creative industries among others.\n\nHe said it was on record that the scheme was designed to create a paradigm shift among graduates from the pursuit of white-collar jobs to entrepreneurship geared towards job creation and economic growth.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "FG: Nembe Oil Spill Now Under Control",
          "text": "*Proposes stiffer penalty for erring firms\n\n*Aiteo mobilises massive equipment to halt leak\n\nDeji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Nume Ekeghe in Lagos\n\nThe federal government yesterday announced that the OML 29 oil spill in Nembe, Bayelsa State, had been brought under control, with necessary personnel and equipment deployed to begin recovery and remediation efforts.\n\nThis came more than three weeks after the eruption that affected several communities in the state.\n\nMinister of Environment, Sharon Ikeazor, who made disclosed the control of the spill at the weekly ministerial press briefing organised at the State House, Abuja.\n\nThe unfortunate incident was said to have been brought under control after the Aiteo Eastern Exploration Company (AEEPCO) succeeded in mobilising heavy equipment to the site of the Santa Barbara wellhead leak, in what it described as a \u201cwell kill\u201d operation.\n\nIkeazor likened the incident to the atomic bomb site in Hiroshima City in Japan, which was devastated when the Allied Forces dropped a bomb on it during the Second World War.\n\nShe explained, \u201cThe situation has been brought under control. I got a brief from the Director General, National Oil Spillage Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), who was out on the field. So, now, work has to start on the proper clean up.\n\n\u201cSo, is this something we must tackle head-on? We are beyond talking and having workshop. On the issue of penalties, I mentioned earlier the review of NOSDRA bill. You know most of the Acts we have passed years ago. You will see that they will give maybe N100 fine, anyone can pay that and go back and re-pollute.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Arise News Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY, yesterday, Minister of State for Petroleum, Chief Timipre Sylva, who spoke about his visit to the host community for on the spot assessment of the impacted area, had assured that he would produce a report, after the inspection, which would be submitted to President Muhammadu Buhari for immediate action.\n\nSylva, also disclosed that the federal government and Aiteo oil company had moved to contain the massive oil spill. He thanked the host community for their peaceful conduct.\n\nSylva stated, \u201cThe company, Aiteo, is making reasonable effort to contain the spill and ensure that the Christmas tree is repaired.\n\n\u201cWe will produce a report that will be submitted to Mr. President. We want to thank the community for being peaceful and not taking the laws into their hands.\u201d\n\nAiteo, in a telephone chat yesterday night, confirmed the leak had been contained, stating that the company has already embarked on measures to control the spillage, shutdown and kill the well.\n\nTHISDAY learnt yesterday that AEEPCO had as of last night fully mobilised to the site and had reinforced its efforts to put an end to the saga.\n\nVideos of the operation sighted by THISDAY indicated that while the, \u201cwell kill\u201d operation was going on, several barges carrying cranes and other equipment were on their way to the location to begin recovery of the hydrocarbons.\n\n\u201cThese are pumping and stimulation equipment loaded with calcium fluoride for the well kill operation. To minimise down time, what we are doing is to arrange all key lines. We have begun work already. By the time this barges get there, the leak must have been arrested.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s just for us to hook up the lines and the hoses into the well. We have cranes and at least three barges and with these, the spill will be contained in no time,\u201d a source said.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission, Mr. Gbenga Komolafe, assured that \u201cthe matter would be resolved in a way that will not negatively impact the area.\u201d\n\nIkeazor stressed the need to put an end to artisanal refineries, which she said had continued to cause pollution in the Niger Delta. She also disclosed plans to institute stiffer penalty for companies involved in oil spill in the country, adding that the operating company is blaming locals for the latest incident in OML29, Nembe.\n\nIkeazor said the ministry was engaging other relevant government agencies to come up with stiffer punishments for erring oil multinationals.\n\nShe said, \u201cI got briefings and what I saw in terms of the pollution either through oil refining or illegal oil refining and otherwise \u2013 the devastation of the Niger Delta is massive. As we are cleaning up, what we are cleaning up is minute compared to the devastation going on.\n\n\u201cSo, it is something that government needs to tackle head-on. I hope they would have put the picture on (slide show), it was like a Hiroshima site.\u201d\n\nThe minister said a bill was being worked out to amend the law establishing NOSDRA to build its capacity and give it \u201cthe needed teeth to bite.\u201d\n\nShe said the operating company of the OML29 in Nembe had blamed the most recent oil spillage in the country on sabotage by the locals.\n\nAccording to her, something must be done about the on-going gas flaring\n\nShe said the country could not be committed to zero net emission and be flaring gas at the same time.\n\nIkeazor said, \u201cOn the Santa Babara Aiteo oil spills, you remember the Ministry of Environment issued a statement stating what happened and the action being taken. It\u2019s a collective action between the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, the Ministry of Environment, and the oil company involved.\n\n\u201cIt goes beyond the oil companies giving out palliatives, they must put measures in place to prevent such accidents from happening.\n\n\u201cThey are also claiming that the spill was due to sabotage by the local communities. We are going to have a targeted approach to illegal bunkering, tampering with oil installation and artisanal mining in the Niger Delta to get alternative livelihood for the young people of the Niger Delta, so that they would desist from this because it is further polluting the environment.\n\n\u201cWe need to put stiffer penalties, build the capacity of NOSDRA, which is the regulatory agency in the oil sector, to be able to have the teeth to bite. Without enhancing their capacity and reaffirming the legal framework, getting it stronger, they cannot do much. These are areas we are looking in to, it has to stop.\n\n\u201cGovernment is working on alternative livelihood for the communities so that we can move them away from illegal activities and further polluting of the environment.\u201d\n\nThe minister also lamented the rate of deaths from smoke-induced illnesses, especially among women in the country, which is said to be the highest in the world. She said the federal government was hoping to reintroduce clean cookstove and the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cookstove initiative to ameliorate the problem and protect the nation\u2019s biodiversity.\n\nOn the Ogoni clean-up exercise, the minister noted that the work could not be completed in one or two years as she stressed the need to end artisanal refining of crude oil.\n\nShe stated, \u201cWe must accelerate also the Ogoni cleanup, to make sure that the remediation is completed in time for the good people of Ogoni. But at the same time, we must tackle the issue of artisanal refining because as we are cleaning, some are still polluting the environment and we ask that this must stop, for us to have a clean and decent environment.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Oil Market Defies US-led Coalition\u2019s Strategy to Lower Rising Prices",
          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nDespite the United States-led coalition\u2019s strategy to cool oil prices, the market remained steady yesterday, with Brent, Nigeria\u2019s benchmark oil, still above $80 per barrel.\n\nPrecisely, Brent crude futures gained seven cents to $82.32 a barrel yesterday, while the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell marginally by 12 cents, or 0.2 per cent, to $78.27 a barrel, still a far cry from the coalition\u2019s expectations.\n\nInvestors are waiting for how major producers respond to the emergency oil release designed to tone down prices, with the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and allies, called OPEC+, expected to meet on December 1st and 2nd to set policy.\n\nBut OPEC expects the United States\u2019 release to swell a surplus in oil markets by 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd), a source from the group said, although for now the decision by the coalition has largely backfired.\n\nThe United States and other high oil-consuming nations, including China, Britain, India, Japan and South Korea, had on Tuesday made good their threat to counter a slower-than-expected release of oil barrels by OPEC in a coordinated bid to reduce rising crude prices.\n\nOPEC+ producers have repeatedly ignored calls for more crude by the US President, Joe Biden, prompting the country to mobilise a handful of high oil consuming nations to release the commodity from their Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR).\n\nCrude oil prices recently touched seven-year highs and although they are still some way short of levels reached between 2011 and 2014, when they broke through $100 a barrel, many consumers are feeling the pain of a dramatic increase from a year ago.\n\nWhile the US announcement is for a release of 50 million barrels, the equivalent of about two and a half days of the country\u2019s demand, India would release 5 million barrels, while Britain would allow the voluntary release of 1.5 million barrels of oil from privately held reserves, according to the agreement.\n\nOPEC has been struggling to meet existing targets under its agreement to gradually increase production by 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) each month \u2013 a pace Washington sees as too slow.\n\nNigeria, an OPEC member has said that even if prices fall to between $50 to $60, it won\u2019t be much of an issue, with the country\u2019s oil benchmark for the 2021 budget being $40.\n\nThe cartel\u2019s situation has been further worsened by the inability of mostly African countries led by Nigeria to meet their allocation, due largely to waning investment, ageing upstream infrastructure and disruptions by some local host communities.\n\nThree sources told Reuters yesterday that OPEC+ was not discussing pausing its oil output increases, despite the decision by the United States, Japan, India and others to release emergency oil stocks.\n\nOPEC members the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait said they were fully committed to the OPEC+ agreement and had no prior stance ahead of next week\u2019s meeting. Nigeria, a strong member of the organisation has always aligned with the decision of the majority.\n\nIraq, also an OPEC member, said it backs continuing OPEC+\u2019s existing plan of raising output by 400,000 bpd a month, saying the outlook for the oil market was unclear due to turbulence in global markets.\n\nHigh oil prices have added to inflationary concerns, with the coordinated release expected to add around 70-80 million barrels of crude supply to markets, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe US Department of Energy had launched an auction to sell 32 million barrels of strategic petroleum reserves(SPR) for delivery between late December to April 2022. It plans to release another 18 million barrels soon.\n\nSome OPEC delegates warned this week that releasing strategic reserves may lead to the alliance holding back crude supply in January, a development that will further starve the market of its much needed supply.\n\nIn addition, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has accused Saudi Arabia, Russia and other major energy producers of creating \u201cartificial tightness\u201d in global oil and gas markets, urging OPEC+ to accelerate the return of supplies.\n\nPredictions on the response are mixed. Citigroup Inc. said OPEC+ is likely to stick to its planned increase of 400,000 barrels a day for January because reducing supply would erode the group\u2019s claim of providing public good by stabilising oil markets, while others feel the alliance will suspend the hike to provide a buffer to demand headwinds.\n\nHowever, the OPEC advisory body has predicted that the excess in markets would expand by 1.1 million barrels a day in January and February to 2.3 million and 3.7 million a day, respectively. That is, if 66 million barrels are injected by major consumers over the two-month period, according to a document leaked to the public.\n\nIf Nigeria keeps to its assurances to ramp up production by the end of this year, according to the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), the country would be producing as much as 1.8 million bpd by December ending.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

We are also calling on the mass media to interrogate the allegations of corruption in ASCSN.\n\n\"The world can now see why the embattled defacto Secretary-General (SG) of ASCSN has refused to retire at sixty years in line with public service rules and at over sixty-five years he has succeeded in demonising the union and promoting mass fraud in the union. \"Presently under the SG 'Comrade' Alade Bashir Lawal, ASCSN has been brought to disrepute. We now know why Lawal has been manipulating members of the union to stay in office beyond sixty-five years. We now know why Lawal has plotted the removal of the President of ASCSN Comrade Bola Innocent Audu and we now know why Lawal has sacked close to twenty young Nigerian workers in ASCSN within a month. We now know why Lawal has installed his stooge, Dr Tommy Okoh as the de facto President of ASCSN.\n\n\"To all members that have been sitting on the fence, it is time we woke up. It is our welfare and our check-off dues that are at stake. Lawal must pay for his crimes against Civil Servants and humanity. We call for Lawal's investigations. Lawal Must Go.\"",
          "summary": "The anti-corruption agency, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has invited about 25 members of the Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria (ASCSN), for questioning over alleged corruption, SaharaReporters has learnt.\n\"Our source also confirmed the interrogation of the Kwara State secretary of the union, Comrade Joseph Meshech.\nAmong those also invited for interrogation include the Deputy Secretary-General of ASCSN Comrade, Apebo Joshua.\nGroups like the All Workers Convergence (AWC) and the Congress of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria (CSCSN) have been raising alarm over the rot in the labour movement especially in the Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria (ASCSN) which has assumed a crisis situation.\nLawal must pay for his crimes against Civil Servants and humanity.",

          "text": "International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law has accused the Nigerian army of unjustly detaining no fewer than 95 persons abducted from Obigbo, Rivers State and Orlu, Imo State in Kaduna Prisons.\n\nThe human rights watch also known as Intersociety said the detainees had been denied access to their families and lawyers since their abduction by Nigerian soldiers in October and November 2020.\n\nFile Photo\n\nIntersociety also disclosed the names of the detainees comprising 89 males and six females to include Humphrey Onyii, Kenechukwu Paul, Kacil Ude, Antonio Obi, Oluchi Nwaba, Ben Akachukwu, Mebechukwu Ifeanyi, Ebube Uche, David Akudo, Nnamdi Ndidi, Francis Collins, and Ozioma Anurika (female).\n\nThis was contained in a statement issued by Intersociety, which was obtained by SaharaReporters on Thursday.\n\nIt was titled, \u2018Fresh List Of 95 Obigbo & Orlu Residents Abducted By Soldiers Discovered In Kaduna Prisons, 257 Others Missing\u2019 and jointly signed by the Board Chair, Emeka Umeagbalasi; Head, Civil Liberties and Rule of Law Department, Obianuju Igboeli Esq and Head, Campaign And Publicity Department Chidimma Udegbunam Esq.\n\n\n\nThe statement read, \u201cIt is with the rudest shock and deepest dismay that the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law (Intersociety) is informing the whole world about the fresh discovery of 95 abducted Obigbo and Orlu residents including six females and 89 males in Kaduna Prisons and Lock Centers.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, the total number of unarmed and defenceless citizens abducted from Obigbo and Orlu located in Rivers and Imo states by soldiers of the Nigerian Army and bundled to different secret military and policing custodies in Kaduna is '357', out of which 95 were in October 2021 discovered in the Kaduna Prisons and Lock Centers.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe total number discovered was 100 persons and out of same only one whose father has links in the military has regained freedom. Four have died including Citizen Ugochukwu, who died of Asthma, leaving 95 others remaining and presently languishing in the Kaduna Prisons and Lock Centers.\n\n\"The discovery of the above followed information obtained from three of the victims interviewed by some local and international human rights activists and lawyers who visited them.\n\n\n\n\u201cTill date, the whereabouts of the remaining 257 others held in different parts of the State have remained unknown. Intersociety had in its recent statements, raised alarms stating that unarmed and defenceless Igbo citizens in their multiple hundreds, abducted by soldiers in Obigbo were secretly being held in the Northern part of the country including FCT, Benue, Nasarawa, Niger, Kaduna and Zamfara States and as of date, not less than 400 have been freed and scores killed in custody.\"\n\nIt further said, \u201cWe are therefore raising alarm that the Nigerian Government and its security forces are engaging in grisly and egregious ethnic profiling and cleansing in Igbo Land in particular and Old Eastern Region in general. We are also deeply saddened by the silence, inaction and lukewarm attitudes of political leaders, socio-cultural organizations, Christian and traditional institutions\u2019 leaders; as well as philanthropists and the educated class residing in Igbo Land or outside Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe hereby call on those parents and guardians, relatives and associates who have been searching or looking for their missing loved ones since October/November 2020 in Rivers State and Obigbo in particular and Imo State and Orlu and environs in particular since February 2021 to check the list of the 93 names and unnamed two others and see if they are among the list so as to find ways of getting in touch with them in the Kaduna Prisons and Lock Centers for the purpose of securing their release through administrative or court bails.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt must be pointed out that most of the 95 located victims of the Army abduction discovered in Kaduna Prisons who are all Igbo citizens of Christian faith were discovered to have been abducted by soldiers of the Nigerian Army during their genocidal invasion of Obigbo area of Rivers State in response to October 2020 country-wide EndSARS protests in the State.\n\n\u201cContrary to the provisions of the Chapter Four or the Fundamental Human Rights Charter of the 1999 Constitution and the country\u2019s acceded Int\u2019l and Regional Rights Treaty Laws as we as the Access to Criminal Justice Act of 2015, soldiers of the Nigerian Army and the Nigeria Police Force have brazenly and arbitrarily resorted to abduction and detention of citizens using fraudulent remand warrants or orders. Sometimes they abduct or arrest citizens and detain them for several months and in the end dump them in Prisons without open court remands or having arraigned them in open courts.\u201d",

And this Request for Proposals will describe what and what we are asking for,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou will now go and send us a document that you are proposing to partner us and this is what you are giving us.\n\n\u201cThen we will sit down, evaluate, discuss and choose a strategic partner or partners for this airline.\n\n\u201cSo Request for Proposals are going out next week and by the grace of God we will continue to pursue that and people will show up.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe minister also said that the 46 percent stake that will be owned by Nigerians would be acquired through shares purchase.\n\n\u201cIt will be purchased exactly the way you buy shares in every company,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is because Nigeria Air is a limited liability company for now, registered under the law of the land and structured in a public-private partnership (PPP) manner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo you purchase it the same way you purchase shares in any company and later it is our hope that it will be listed and go through IPO (Initial Public Offering) and so on.\u201d\n\nHe said that the maintenance, repair and overhaul facility for the carrier and others will begin operating next year in Abuja and that 12,000 hectares of land will be used for the facility.\n\n\u201cIn that 12,000 hectares of land, which all of it is a free zone, there will be the MRO facility, a second runway, new terminal building and various businesses,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is going to be a whole airport city.\u201d\n\nHe said the MRO partners had been addressed and that work would start in April 2022 once approved by FEC.\n\nSirika said that the facility would save Nigeria millions of dollars because of the high cost of flying a plane outside the country for maintenance.\n\nThe minister said the cost range was about $250 thousand each, to and fro.\n\nTilmann Gabriel, the transaction adviser to the government for the national carrier, said efforts were ongoing to ensure that the airlines were certified.\n\n\u201cA lot of work has been done and it did not start today, rather it started three years ago. An Air Operator Certificate (AOC) is to be applied for in the next couple of days from the NCAA, which is the regulatory authority,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "African female founders need access to high-impact mentors",
          "text": "Beyond funding, African female entrepreneurs need access to high-impact mentors and who are willing to open up their network and teach what they know.\n\nA few weeks into January this year, Eloho Omame and Odunayo Eweniyi announced their female-focused angel investment fund. Aptly named FirstCheck Africa, the angel fund is on a mission to \u201cadvance equity, capital and leadership for a generation of women in Africa through technology & entrepreneurship\u201d. While FirstCheck argues that African women in tech are \u201cover-mentored\u201d and \u201cunder-funded\u201d, early-stage female founders need some handholding. Our ecosystem is still male-dominated, and female entrepreneurs need experienced mentors to guide them on their journey to success.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to not have a cart-before-the-horse mentality when it comes to helping African female entrepreneurs succeed. Of course, funding women-led businesses is important because entrepreneurs need capital to scale. But it\u2019s also important to level the playing field, invite female founders to join active networks, and connect them to successful high-impact mentors.\n\nFor Africa to build a more equitable tech ecosystem, mentoring and funding African women in tech must work hand-in-hand, not one after the other. Local and global investors must do the work of creating short-term or long-term mentorship programs that cater to underrepresented female founders. These mentorship programs should teach African women in tech how to network, grow their social equity, pitch to accelerators or funds with larger check sizes, and much more.\n\nThe conversation about mentorship is tricky because most female entrepreneurs are interested in getting the capital they need to run their businesses. But venture capitalists like Sohaila Ouffata believe that working with highly trained and experienced mentors is just as important as applying to receive funding from accelerators and venture funds. So Ouffata founded The African Tech Vision (ATV) to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for ambitious African female founders and executive leaders.\n\nEmpowering African female entrepreneurs at scale\n\nThe African Tech Vision is a free entrepreneurial programme designed to support early-stage African female founders and help them achieve their goals. Over six weeks, selected female founders are paired with mentors and industry experts from local and international startup scenes and technology hubs. During the programme, participants gain access to hands-on mentoring and coaching sessions provided by vetted ATV mentors. While most accelerator and mentorship programs are held in-person at specific locations, ATV kicked off its inaugural program online in April of this year. Hosting virtual mentoring sessions means more African female founders can apply to the programme without worrying about visa applications, travel fees, and sourcing for accommodation.\n\n\u201cThe style of the hands-on mentoring session is based on virtual interactions. Most mentors prefer video calls and structure the session based on the needs of the entrepreneur,\u201d said Ouffata in an emailed response to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cWe spent time with each entrepreneur at the beginning of the programme to define areas in which they are looking for mentorship. This is also the basis for matchmaking with selected mentors. For example, some founders prefer to speak multiple times a week with some of their mentors. Others prefer to ping their mentors with questions over WhatsApp. As we are a founder-friendly programme, we leave the decision to the founders and their mentors.\u201d\n\nATV offered its inaugural cohort a mix of recorded and live workshops, founder stories (events where experienced founders shared stories of success, challenges, and failures in their fields), and social activities every week. In the last programme, some of the content models made available to the cohort of African female founders include \u2018Engaging with Mentors\u2019, \u2018Elevator Pitch\u2018, \u2018Investors 101\u2018, \u2018Product Market Fit\u2019, and \u2018Sales Fundamentals\u2018.\n\nSome of the previous cohort\u2019s early-stage female founders were from Ghana, Rwanda, Morocco, Tunisia, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. Therefore, Ouffata and her team need to pull as many female founders from different African countries as possible before their next program kicks off in 2022.\n\nSource: TechCabal Insights\n\nWhy is The African Tech Vision betting on African women?\n\nFor Ouffata, betting on African female founders is a personal decision that fits into the larger vision of The African Tech Vision program.\n\n\u201cThe African Tech Vision was born out of a desire to honour my African heritage and to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for other African women,\u201d said Ouffata. \u201cOur vision is to connect female entrepreneurs with experienced international role models and aim to inspire and nurture the next generation of purpose-driven African female entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nNo doubt ATV\u2019s vision is audacious, but Africa\u2019s male-dominated technology and business ecosystem is a reality that can longer be ignored or explained away. ATV\u2019s model is designed to spotlight, empower, and back high-impact female founders in Africa.\n\nBeyond sentiments and national pride, ATV\u2019s reasons for backing female entrepreneurs are also rooted in profitability and nation-building. Businesses owned or founded by women are said to deliver higher revenue and better bet to a group of niche investors. Additionally, women typically reinvest up to 90% of their income back into their families and extended communities. This means that more girls and women need to be included in the global economy through education, employment, and mentorship.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In Nigeria, insufficient purchasing power among middle-class citizens, coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing, puts car purchases out of reach for over 90% of the population. Also, most taxis and public transport buses in Nigerian cities are leased by drivers, who have to deliver rental fees to the owners periodically.\n\nThat means ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Bolt that launch in Nigeria are likely to face a shortage of driver-partners, especially if they\u2019re looking to cover all of the country\u2019s major cities.\n\nEarlier this year, Bolt launched a vehicle financing programme that offered drivers a flexible plan through which they could purchase their own vehicles. The scheme allows drivers to own a car or motorbike with low equity repayment for about four years and no interest.\n\n\u201cAs we expand our presence into more cities across the country, it is important to provide solutions that ensure working with Bolt is more flexible and profitable for drivers,\u201d Bolt\u2019s Country Manager, Femi Akin-Laguda, said at the time.\n\nAfter a pilot phase, which Akin-Laguda tells TechCabal \u201cenjoyed great success\u201d, the company has now partnered with Metro Africa Xpress (MAX), a Nigerian mobility company with a fintech play, to expand the program in the country.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMAX originally started out as a motorcycle-based operator for delivery services. With its mobile app, users could order pickup riders who could fulfil deliveries quickly in the congested city of Lagos. By 2017, MAX had expanded into bike hailing, becoming the first company to pioneer the innovation in Nigeria. But in February 2020, the Lagos government\u2019s restrictions on passenger motorcycles threatened the company\u2019s growth in Nigeria\u2019s largest city.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, MAX\u2019s CFO, Guy-Bertrand Njoya, explains that the company has had to double down on its other mobility solutions since the ban. One of these is a subscription platform for low-to-zero emission vehicles in five cities across Nigeria, and Ghana. The subscription product includes credit and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) services, which the more than 13,000 drivers on its platform opt into.\n\nFor the partnership with Bolt, the company\u2019s alternative credit-scoring technology will allow access to proprietary performance and revenue analytics to underwrite the Bolt car loans for drivers.\n\n\u201cMAX is a renowned vehicle subscription platform with the capacity to support a truly wide placement of this type of partnership,\u201d Akin-Laguda said on Bolt\u2019s preferred car financing partner in Nigeria. \u201cTheir approach and insight to meet our goal of empowering drivers suited our desired proposition.\u201d\n\nMAX motorcycle riders.\n\nThe car financing programme is currently open only to drivers in Lagos and Abuja, with Bolt planning to expand the offer to all active drivers across Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Bolt, an agreement can be reached for up to 100% of the purchase, both for new and used cars, within 24 hours of signing up. This is given that drivers have provided all the information required. They can choose to pay back their loans using a percentage of the weekly revenue generated while driving on Bolt for up to five years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to expand our commitment to helping those on the Bolt platform to earn more and at their own pace, either driving full-time or part-time,\u201d Akin-Laguda said. \u201cImproving the earnings of drivers is fundamental to our business operations.\u201d\n\nFor drivers, Bolt\u2019s loan repayment process is more flexible than what traditionally exists in the market. Loan tenors from Nigerian banks often don\u2019t exceed two years whereas Bolt\u2019s repayment duration ranges from two to five. In the long run, Yamaha-backed MAX plans to add electric vehicles to the financing mix.\n\nIn addition to extending the lease-to-own framework to more e-hailing drivers, the partnership is expected to enable drivers access value-add services provided by MAX. These include licenses and permits, insurance, health coverage, and other financial products.\n\nThe low rate of vehicle ownership in Nigeria is similar across Africa, a continent with the lowest per capita vehicle ownership in the world.\n\nWith the majority of Africa\u2019s more than one billion population having limited or no access to vehicle financing, the continent recorded fewer than 900,000 new vehicle sales in 2019, compared to more than 17 million in the United States alone.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The collapse of DealDey, a Nigeria-based online deals aggregator, three years ago, laid bare the difficulty of operating an internet-based commerce business in the country, especially with the similar failures of Efritin and OLX at the time.\n\nMuch like Groupon, DealDey connected customers with merchants that offered goods and services at slashed prices, a proposition that appealed to a largely low-income population. In some cases, consumers could purchase items at discounts of more than 90%.\n\nFounded in 2011 by Sim Shagaya, DealDey was a precursor for many e-commerce platforms in the country. And at its peak, the startup could claim to be sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s largest online deals platform.\n\nIt had more than 400 employees, over one million users, 15,000 active merchants, and 20,000 verified listed businesses, raised millions in equity funding, and looked set to play a big role in the Nigerian e-commerce space for decades to come.\n\nThat was before things went south. As Nigeria\u2019s 2016 economic recession bit hard, DealDey cut over 60% of its staff and reportedly owed merchants for months. In less than a year, the platform was sold to Ringier Africa Deals Group reportedly for $5 million, rather than the $75 million at which it valued itself, before eventually shutting down in late 2018.\n\nSo much has changed in the country since then. For one, more Nigerians now shop online, and arguably, younger populations in urban areas have more spending power. Interestingly, some of DealDey\u2019s former managers\u2014including Mohammed Abubakar, Juwon Ajao, and Joy Amadi\u2014now have an opportunity to take another shot at building the continent\u2019s largest online deals platform, but this time under the ThankUCash brand.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA multi-merchant rewards platform\n\nSince its founding in 2018, ThankUCash\u2014a service that helps companies grow customer loyalty and increase revenue with data analytics and customer rewards\u2014has become a household name among bargain hunters.\n\nThe platform is the brainchild of Connected Analytics, a company founded by Simeon Ononobi (CEO), Suraj Supekar (CTO), Madonna Ononobi (COO), and Harshal Gandole (Senior VP). The founding members of ThankUCash, a kind of rewards platform hardly seen in African markets, were inspired by the need to address a significant market gap Simeon Ononobi and his team observed: the lack of consumer data and loyalty among businesses.\n\n\u201cWe saw that there were no records on buyers, which affected customer retention as people only bought what they needed and never came back. So we moved to solve this problem, and that\u2019s what brought about ThankUCash,\u201d he told TechCabal. \u201cWe also realised the need to make consumers happy and excited about spending.\u201d\n\nThankUCash enables merchants to give rewards (in the form of cashback, discounts, and points) seamlessly to their customers via a data analytics-powered reward system. Within the ThankUCash app, customers can use the rewards to buy deals, airtime, pay for utility bills, and cable TV subscriptions.\n\nBy giving such rewards, the startup hopes to help build customer loyalty and increase revenue for merchants while also collecting customer data for analytics, targeting, and decision-making purposes.\n\nIn this sense, Connected Analytics generates revenue by using one of the most common business models available: being a middleman. It charges a 30% commission on customer rewards, a monthly SaaS fee from merchants using its predictive analytics platform, and an upfront partnership fee for partners looking to use the platform, and commissions on future transactions.\n\nAs of March this year, ThankUCash had over 500 merchants it was helping to grow their businesses. These include Trebet, Dana Airlines, Gleeword, ENYO Retail, MedMart, PriceRite, Choplife, and CET Energy, among others. The startup claims to have also secured strategic partnerships with major banks and financial institutions in the country, such as UBA, Sterling Bank, First City Monument Bank (FCMB), and Wema Bank.\n\nWith 734,000 users, 90,000 of which are active monthly, the multi-merchant rewards platform has clearly gained significant traction across key indicators so far. But Connected Analytics is not resting on its laurels as it plans to add a new segment to its business offerings: Groupon-like deals.\n\nJuwon Ajao, Mohammed Abubakar, Simeon Ononobi and Joy Amadi.\n\nSucceeding where DealDey struggled\n\nBy expanding its service to include daily deals, Connected Analytics is stepping into a territory where very few Nigerian companies play, ever since the collapse of DealDey three years ago. Some platforms currently offer deals but not on the same scale as the pioneering startup did.\n\nThe decision to re-assemble the DealDey team, according to Simeon Ononobi, was necessitated by the need to tap their experience in achieving the startup\u2019s goals. \u201cWe realised we couldn\u2019t do this on our own and resorted to bringing on the team that had done it in the past,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nBut how does the company plan to avoid the pitfalls that brought down DealDey after seven years of operations?\n\nDealDey\u2019s collapse was based largely on the economic downturn of 2018 when the country\u2019s budget was approved late and consumers\u2019 buying power was affected. Customers wanted to get the same price points and same value. \u201cWith thin margins, we needed to sell more to cover overhead, and at that particular time, it was a tall order,\u201d Abubakar said.\n\nThankUCash intends to leverage its existing analytics capabilities in order to do things better now, according to Simeon Ononobi.\n\nAbubakar, who was the city manager at DealDey, and now serves as ThankUCash\u2019s deals manager, believes the surge in online commerce activity among Nigerians bodes well for the foray into daily deals by Connected Analytics.\n\n\u201cThings are different now compared to when DealDey shut down. More people are inclined to shop online and e-commerce numbers are increasing,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, there are many online platforms doing food delivery, event ticketing, hotel bookings, and other professional services that were not there three or four years ago.\u201d\n\nConnected Analytics plans to hire even more ex-DealDey staff and has also poached top employees from companies like KPMG, Jumia, and Econet Media.\n\nAccording to Simeon Ononobi, some failed businesses could have had better chances of survival if they had a better knowledge of their customers and leveraged that data to make decisions. ThankUCash\u2019s analytics platform solves this problem, and with the addition of the daily deals vertical, it can help businesses, from banks to airlines and hotels, boost sales.\n\nTake a hotel with a 70% occupancy rate during holidays, for instance. Instead of having vacant rooms while overhead costs remain constant, the company could salvage some revenue by offering discounts on bookings via ThankUCash.\n\nSimeon Ononobi is bullish on ThankUCash\u2019s chances of becoming a super aggregator of such deals, helping businesses grow and consumers access bargains. \u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d the CEO said of his company\u2019s ambitions in the online deals space. \u201cWe\u2019re planning a lot of things and intend to cover a wide range of product categories like DealDey did.\u201d\n\nFor Abubakar, he and his former (and now current) colleagues have a chance to \u201cfind our mistakes, fix them, and then innovate more\u201d at ThankUCash.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "The next frontier for fintech: Disruptive business models",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, we introduced our latest series, The Next Frontier, and talked about the shape of the edtech industry in the future. This week, as you\u2019ve probably guessed, we\u2019ll be talking about fintechs.\n\nAfrica\u2019s fintech industry is one of the largest and probably the most advanced. Having produced five of Africa\u2019s seven unicorns and some of the largest funding rounds we\u2019ve seen, that\u2019s probably a safe assumption.\n\nBut what\u2019s the next big thing? What kind of models can we expect to see? This week, we talked with Adedeji Olowe (Trustee, Open Banking Nigeria) and Abdul Hassan, Mono Founder and CEO.\n\nDisclaimer: We can\u2019t necessarily tell the future. All opinions in this article are educated guesses and might not happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next big thing\n\nThe very first question we asked Olowe was the level of growth the industry has achieved so far.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had significant growth so far. But the interesting bit to me is not where we are coming from, it\u2019s how far we still have to grow. So whatever is exciting you about fintech right now, you haven\u2019t seen anything. I don\u2019t think the space has grown up to 2-3% of its capacity.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, using the example of Nigeria\u2019s average transaction size for transfer, he believes transfers would be free.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get to a level where transfers of a certain amount would be free, and after that, we can actually bring in financial inclusion for everybody. So you will now see transactions like, \u2018Oh, I want to send \u20a650 to Ogheneruemu,\u2019 \u2018 I want to spend \u20a6100 to buy bole,\u2018 and then it would be free.\u201d\n\nOf course, he agreed that there would be a limit to transferable amounts, putting the benchmark at \u20a610,000 weekly. But in his words, \u201cat that level, it would just become explosive.\u201d\n\nHow soon will this happen? Well, he believes this could happen as soon as next year, helping to drive Nigeria\u2019s sluggish cashless policy.\n\nOn the other hand, the first question Techpoint asked Hassan centred around the direction the industry would be going in. His answer, three phases of growth.\n\n\u201cI believe that there will be a lot of regulatory involvement in the next two to three years. And what this means is that we would see the regulators actually actively helping the ecosystem. I\u2019m someone that supports regulation because where there\u2019s regulation, I feel like there would be a lot of innovation as well.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlowe had a similar opinion, albeit somewhat different. \u201cI know that people don\u2019t like CBN (Central Bank of Nigeria) regulating prices. But the funny thing is that CBN\u2019s pricing has done more to expand the market than anything else.\u201d\n\nFor some context, at some point, transfers in Nigeria cost \u20a6100; now, they cost between \u20a610 and \u20a650.\n\nThe second phase, according to Hassan, however, would be a hotbed of mergers and acquisitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Nattanan Kanchanaprat from Pixabay\n\n\u201cI think there will be a lot of mergers and acquisitions coming up next year because I feel like there are a lot of companies doing similar things. And it doesn\u2019t really make sense to have about 20 companies doing the same thing when they can all put together the demand power, the resources, and the talent to build something that is really massive out of Africa.\u201d\n\nThe third phase is a companies-funding-companies stage.\n\n\u201cWe would see more fintech companies, funding more fintech companies. And what this means is that you could see a company like Mono investing in other interesting companies that are, for example, using our infrastructure. We\u2019ve seen this happen with Visa and Mastercard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already happening, but people are not talking about it. But I think it will be more public next year, and this is mostly because of the traction we\u2019ve seen in the fintech industry.\u201d\n\nFor him, all of the attention the fintech industry is and would be getting would be very helpful to aid other industries in getting more funding. Olowe agrees.\n\nNew technology or new business models?\n\nCurrently, the fintech industry is very API and cloud computing driven. However, Olowe and Hassan believe that rather than disruptive technologies, it would be a more disruptive business model.\n\nCiting companies like Inflow Finance and Sproutly Nigeria, Hassan says infrastructure like Mono\u2019s would be the base of novel business models.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy sense is that we would see more business models, more developers, and more interesting companies coming up because of infrastructure like us. I mean, if you look at it, in 2016 and 2017, Paystack made PiggyVest possible. Without Paystack, PiggyVest wouldn\u2019t be a company.\n\n\u201cThat was a new business model that wasn\u2019t available in Nigeria before Paystack. So I think that kind of emergence of new business models and successful companies is what we will see in the next couple of years. And that\u2019s what excites me most.\u201d\n\nFor example, a business model that enables seamless confirmation of transactions or rounds up the remainder of every transaction made into money that can be put into savings.\n\nBut maybe some technology\n\nFor Olowe, apart from free transfers, one aspect he believes has been severely overlooked is contactless cards. Interestingly, according to him, banks have been given out contactless cards in the past year.\n\nA quick Google search reveals that a contactless card would look something like this with a sideways WiFi signal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by kreatikar on Pixabay\n\nTo confirm this, we did a quick experiment using both old and new debit cards. We found that the new cards had sideways WiFi signals while the old cards didn\u2019t.\n\nEssentially, a contactless card can be used without being handed to PoS merchants or shop attendants. You can place it directly on the machine, and your transaction is immediately approved.\n\nSo, why are they not being used? Olowe gives two reasons: acceptance and payments.\n\n\u201cThe only challenge is that the amount to spend is not on those cards. Number two, the PoS needs to accept contactless cards, and those two things need to meet each other.\u201d\n\nAccording to Olowe, these contactless cards are supposed to act as a limited store of value. For example, the Cowry cards used for payment in the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in Lagos State. You have to put some money in the card to use it, essentially transferring a specific amount to be used for payment.\n\nSo, for this to work, you need to transfer money for use into the card itself and not your bank account, and then readers for these cards must be available.\n\nMerging the old with the new\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn July 2021, Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) changed its name to Guaranty Trust Holding Company (GTCO). According to Group CEO Segun Agbaje, \u201cWe believe that a holding company structure will allow us to take advantage of new business opportunities in the emerging competitive landscape and strengthen our earnings base.\u201d\n\nWhile there have been no outright moves, there have been speculations that this signals the company\u2019s shift into a more technological arena.\n\nWe asked Olowe what he thought of banks playing in the fintech space in the future, and he believes it would be pretty impossible.\n\n\u201cTraditional banks would go into fintechs, and they would fail miserably, and that is not a guess. Why? Because they don\u2019t have the DNA to run a fintech. Banks can\u2019t be agile. Banks don\u2019t place customer service, user experience as paramount. Forget about them talking about it. It\u2019s not just part of them.\u201d\n\nHe says it is doubly worse for traditional institutions in the insurance space.\n\nInterestingly, Hassan disagrees, and he believes this could mean better and stiffer competition and even more acquisitions.\n\nOther predictions\n\nEvery week, I receive a newsletter from Samora Kariuki called Frontier Fintech. I first subscribed in August 2021. Since then, he has talked about several things like the modernisation of banks, the possibility of an African super app \u2014 one of my favourites \u2014 and digital bank valuations.\n\nIn last week\u2019s newsletter, Kariuki made some interesting predictions, which you can find here.\n\nIntrigued?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2021 has been a good year for African startups. This year, the continent has already minted five unicorns. After the lull in investment activities in 2020, investments in African startups are on track to exceed the $2 billion record set in 2019.\n\nAs has been the case in previous years, the bulk of the funding has gone to fintech startups with the fragmented nature of the continent\u2019s financial system providing an opportunity for innovative founders and investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurin Hainy, CEO and Co-Founder of FairMoney\n\nAs of October 2021, Africa: The Big Deal reported that 57% of the amounts raised which was slightly above $1.6 billion has gone to fintech startups. One such fintech is FairMoney, a digital bank that currently offers lending services in Nigeria, India, and France.\n\nIn July, the startup raised a $42 million Series B led by Tiger Global to consolidate its position in India and Nigeria. This follows its $10 million Series A round raised in 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, November 18, 2021, the company hosted investors, the media, and industry leaders at its first investor conference. Following a brief introduction, the CEO and co-founder, Laurin Hainy took to the stage to share the startup\u2019s journey since inception.\n\nIn his welcome address, Hainy revealed that the conference was \u201cconceived to provide an avenue for capital market operators, investors, fintech players, regulators, industry associations, and other financial industry participants to discuss the role of digital financial models in providing meaningful financial inclusion for Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL \u2013 R: Patryk Kalisz, Head of Controlling and Reporting, FairMoney; Siddharth Kulkarni,\n\nExecutive Sponsor, Lending, Nigeria at FairMoney; Nicolas Berthozat, Co-Founder\n\nFairMoney and Juris Rieksts-Riekstin\u0161, Head of Risk, Nigeria, at the FairMoney investor\u2019s\n\nconference.\n\nIn Nigeria, traditional banks have typically shied away from offering loans to individuals and small businesses without collateral. This is the segment FairMoney serves and Yaw Mante, the startup\u2019s Head of Finance revealed that not only have they been able to offer loans to these people, but they have also had a very low default rate.\n\nHe disclosed that in order to do this, the startup makes use of data science and underwriting algorithms to predict how likely an individual is to default on their loan before deciding how much risk they are able to take.\n\nIn the absence of data on users, the startup may initially give such customers smaller amounts to gauge their ability to repay the loans. Depending on how the borrower performs, they are then able to offer higher amounts to them. So far, in 2021, the startup has given out loans worth more than \u20a670 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL \u2013 R: Oluwatomide Oluwole, Finance Manager, FairMoney; Henry Obiekea, VP Capital\n\nMarkets, FairMoney; Yaw Mante, Head, Finance \u2013 FairMoney and James Edeh, Head,\n\nCompliance, FairMoney, at the FairMoney investor\u2019s conference.\n\nHaving recently acquired a microfinance license, Mante explained the reason for that, \u201cLoans are not the only products that our customers need. They need to be able to pay, they need to be able to save, they need to be able to invest. The way that we think about our business is that we look at our customers, we look at what they need and we try to work with them to provide that.\n\nIn order to do all of these things, we need to upscale our license and hence why we acquired the microfinance license. Over time, we\u2019ll look at our options to continue to provide more complex products and services to our customers.\u201d\n\nWith several players in the fintech industry, Mante discussed the startup\u2019s evolution towards a multi-product full-fledged digital bank. \u201cOur unique selling point is we want to be able to provide all of the banking needs of our customers but we start with the product we think is the most pressing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a lot of startups, a Series B is often followed by expansion. However, Hainy says FairMoney would consolidate its position in its current markets. \u201cI think we\u2019re very excited about the opportunities in Nigeria and India. They are two out of the four biggest countries in the world and they\u2019re very underserved.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Obiekea, VP Capital Markets, FairMoney\n\nHe also pointed out that while the fintech space in India and Nigeria possess some similarities, there are more people in India who possess some level of digital identification compared to Nigeria.\n\nThere was also a panel session on the role of fintech startups in financial inclusion in Nigeria. It featured Nicole Yembra, Founder and Managing Partner of Chrysalis Capital, Sonnie Ayere, GMD/CEO, DLM Capital Group, Yaw Mante, Head of Finance, FairMoney, and Bayo Rotimi, Managing Director of Greenwich Merchant Bank.\n\nDespite the progress recorded by fintech startups in the country, the jury is still out on how much impact they really have with the vast majority of the country still lacking access to the financial system. Hainy sees this as a challenge and believes that FairMoney is perfectly positioned to solve this challenge.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This is just above the global average of 11.7%.\n\nThe report was based on a survey conducted on 1,205 Nigerian Internet users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Nigeria is the sixth country with the highest rate of NFT adoption out of the 20 countries surveyed. The top five countries were the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam.\n\nSurprisingly, the US, UK, and Japan, were the bottom three. The survey also went on to estimate that Nigeria\u2019s NFT ownership rate could reach 35% as 21.7% of the surveyed Internet users, plan to own NFTs.\n\nHold on a minute. Can 1,205 Internet users out of 101.72 million tell the true story about NFTs in Nigeria?\n\nHowever, if we consider the fact that Nigeria also ranked sixth in the 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis maybe Finders.com\u2019s report isn\u2019t too far fetched.\n\nWhat do you think? Are Nigerians really that big on NFTs? Hit reply and let\u2019s know what you think.\n\nAsilimia\u2019s $2m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsilimia team. Source: TechCrunch\n\nAfrican fintech startup, Asilimia, has raised $2 million to help African Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), digitise their operations and connect them to the formal financial economy. The funding comprises a $1 million pre-seed and $1 million in debt financing.\n\nThe round saw investment from serial entrepreneur, Fredrik Jung Abbou, Co-founder of two unicorns \u2014 Kry, a telemedicine startup and fintech startup, Lendo. Other investors include Norrsken Impact Accelerator, Bpifrance and GreenTec Capital Partners\n\nHow does Asilimia work? The startup helps MSMEs digitise and formalise their operations \u2014 payments, revenue collection, and accounting \u2014 with its digital platform while providing them with credit facilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFounded by Tekwane Mwendwa and Morgane Kablan, it helps business owners track expenses, payments, and get financial insights on their mobile phones.\n\nWhile Asilimia\u2019s mission could formalise MSMEs on the continent, in sub-Saharan Africa, only 45% were subscribed to mobile services by the end of 2019 according to the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA). That number, however, is expected to reach 50% by 2025.\n\nThe startup plans to grow its team and expand into more East African markets with the funding.\n\nOnePipe\u2019s $3.5m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnePipe team\n\nNigerian fintech API, OnePipe, has closed a $3.5 million seed, co-led by Atlantica Ventures, Tribe Capital and V&R Associates. Other investors include Techstars, Ingressive Capital and Canaan Partners.\n\nOnePipe CEO and Founder, Ope Adeoye, told TechCrunch, that the startup offers embedded banking or banking as a service, \u201cmeaning, we make it possible for non-financial institutions, or businesses in general, to offer banking services to their customers.\u201d\n\nA little back story: Adeoye was a Senior Software Engineer at Interswitch before moving to Zain Nigeria.\n\nInterestingly, he moved back to Interswitch to lead the creation of Quickteller. After eleven years at Interswitch, Adeoye built OnePipe in November 2018 to create seamless partnerships between fintechs and banks.\n\nWith this new funding, the startup has plans to expand into other African countries through a partnership with Sendy, a logistics and freight company.\n\nWant to know more about OnePipe?

          "text": "Prospects of Nigeria\u2019s pharmaceutical industry in attaining self-sufficiency could be realised if local producers build strong and productive synergy with leading global producers looking to expand frontiers, experts have said.\n\nThey say the increased demand for affordable medicines that has followed the rise in global demand for good health care is encouraging global and regional companies to join forces with local business partners to help navigate new markets, especially in Africa.\n\nOpportunities lie in these quests for local companies with idle capacities estimated to have a $4 billion growth potential that key stakeholders say can be unlocked through contract manufacturing.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Representative of Overseas Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (NIROPHARM) sector analysis, African markets are diverse in consumer choices, pricing, manufacturing, and distribution. There has been a significant increase in the number of these partnerships in manufacturing, contract manufacturing, and distribution over the last 10 years. These partnerships also manage the complex regulatory landscape for global partners.\n\nRead Also: Repositioning Nigeria\u2019s pharmaceutical industry for competitiveness\n\n\u201cThose interested in owning a factory must see the current importers as potential partners and they must be able to demonstrate capacities, that their factories that can manufacture in volumes, produce the desired quality in a transparent way that is verifiable by both parties,\u201d Sammy Ogunjinmi, vice president, NIROPHARM, said.\n\nThe group also proposes that the country can stop poor capacity utilisation and address the wide margin between drug demands and supply from within, by ensuring manufacturing facilities are adequately equipped to meet global standards for general manufacturing practice (GMP).\n\nAlready, there seems to be a clear indication of the growing investment in higher quality drug manufacturing in Nigeria. Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Group, a sub-group of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (PMG-MAN), in 2015 announced that four Nigerian drug manufacturers had met the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) requirements for good manufacturing practice.\n\nIn 2018, Mckinsey, an international consulting firm, reported that there were only six companies in sub-Saharan region with WHO pre-qualification, indicating more qualified capacities could bring fortune to the local industry.\n\nAlso, NIROPHARM believes more can be tapped from regional trade integration across Africa. For instance, the recent movement for freer trade across Africa encapsulated in the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement, which plans to integrate trade across the 55 members of the African Union, is one solution.\n\nIn 2018, representatives of over 40 out of 55 member countries of the African Union (AU) signed the AfCFTA agreement, with plans to remove tariff barriers to trade, among member states.\n\n\u201cContract manufacturing will significantly improve manufacturing capacity utilisation, improved technology transfer, which will deliver lower operating costs and encourage pharmaceutical exports from Nigeria,\u201d the body said in its position paper seen by BusinessDay.\n\n\u201cAll of the above factors support the case for a strategic contract manufacturing plan for Nigeria,\u201d it said.",

          "text": "Ahead of the December 10, 2021, inauguration date for the newly elected members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), Nigerians have tasked the Iyorchia Ayu-led executive to urgently reposition the party for victory in 2023 and beyond.\n\nAlthough, still basking in the euphoria of a successful National Convention that heralded a fresh breath of air for the party, after a turbulent period, the executive members-in-waiting have been urged to brace up for a serious job ahead.\n\nObservers say that the new NWC must immediately embark on a rebuilding exercise to try and bring all the state chapters together, while reinvigorating the party as a vibrant opposition force ahead of future elections.\n\nPerhaps, one of the key issues that has remained controversial is where the party should zone the presidency in 2023.\n\nPundits say the NWC must be smart and strategic in dealing with the issue, as it has the potential of plunging the party into a fresh crisis.\n\nAlthough the PDP has not taken any categorical position on the issue of zoning, there are already debates of possible implications if the party should zone the ticket to the North or the South.\n\nRead Also: PDP convention: We\u2019re ready to rescue Nigeria \u2013 Okowa\n\nObservers believe that the ability of the leadership to navigate the seeming intricate issue would determine the very future of PDP.\n\nThey also advised that the in-coming NWC must look beyond self, but put its gaze at a larger picture of reversing the current socio-economic and political negative narrative and give Nigerians a new lease of life.\n\nIn the last few weeks, a number of chieftains of the party across the country have been signifying their intentions to contest the presidency in 2023. Among them are two former Senate presidents, Bukola Saraki, Pius Anyim; Bala Mohammed, Bauchi State governor, and Sam Ohuabunwa, a pharmacist and business executive.\n\nThere are also some others who though, have not verbalised their intentions, have already set up groups that are already drawing up support for them at the background.\n\nKunle Okunade, political analyst, says the new leadership has the immediate task of resolving crises in their state chapters, especially, states that could not hold successful congresses, and should focus on canvassing for new eligible electorate who may buy into their ideas.\n\n\u201cThe new executives need to work on repositioning and rebranding the party in the polity because without it, the party may not be able to win the heart of the people.\n\n\u201cPDP has the advantage of canvassing new eligible electorates who may buy into their ideas. That is, the leadership should focus on winning new registrants into their support base,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that the All Progressives Congress has failed, and it is a great opportunity for PDP, but it depends on how they are about to strategise, remember it is not easy to defeat a ruling party in Nigeria,\u201d he states further.\n\nSegun Adewale, a chieftain of the PDP in Lagos State and member of the South-West executive, warns that the new NWC must decide where the party should zone the presidential ticket to, adding that such decision must be carefully taken so that the party\u2019s chances in 2023 presidential election would not be jeopardised.\n\n\u201cFor me, I think the immediate task now for the NWC is to decide where the PDP should zone the presidency to in 2023, especially since the APC may want to zone to the South.\n\n\u201cWe have to watch very carefully, it is important so that we don\u2019t make a mistake and zone to where numerically we don\u2019t have the strength and we lose out. It is a key decision that could determine the party\u2019s fate in the 2023 general election,\u201d Adewale notes.\n\nCollins Anene, a member of the party, states that the new NWC should avoid the \u201cbanana peel\u201d on the floor of the party\u2019s headquarters at Wadata Plaza, Abuja, by taking a decision to serve all the members of the party, and in the best interest of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cMy advice is not just to Senator Ayu, but to all the members of the NWC. They must work as a group and towards a common goal. There are already some \u2018banana peels\u2019 that they must avoid so as not to be brought down accidentally. They know where they are coming from and the onerous tasks ahead of them,\u201d Anene states.\n\nAccording to Anene, \u201cThey were elected at a very crucial period of our great party, when their wealth of experience is seriously needed. They must not be seen as being anybody\u2019s boy; but must be seen to be transparently discharging their duty in the interest of every member of the party. They must work hard to stabilise the party in all the state chapters and strategise to see how to bring back aggrieved members who left the party.\u201d\n\nAnene notes further: \u201cIn fact, I would say that the new leadership should take the party to \u2018profitability\u2019 as it is said in the business world.\u201d\n\nThe new leadership of the party will be sworn-in after the expiration of the tenure of the current NWC members led by Uche Secondus comes to an end on December 9, 2021.\n\nThe 21-member NWC was elected on October 30 during the party\u2019s convention in Abuja. The new leadership just had a two-day retreat, which it said was aimed at re-strategising to rescue Nigeria from the hands of the ruling APC.",

And this Request for Proposals will describe what and what we are asking for,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou will now go and send us a document that you are proposing to partner us and this is what you are giving us.\n\n\u201cThen we will sit down, evaluate, discuss and choose a strategic partner or partners for this airline.\n\n\u201cSo Request for Proposals are going out next week and by the grace of God we will continue to pursue that and people will show up.\u201d\n\nThe minister also said that the 46 percent stake that will be owned by Nigerians would be acquired through shares purchase.\n\n\u201cIt will be purchased exactly the way you buy shares in every company,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is because Nigeria Air is a limited liability company for now, registered under the law of the land and structured in a public-private partnership (PPP) manner.\n\n\u201cSo you purchase it the same way you purchase shares in any company and later it is our hope that it will be listed and go through IPO (Initial Public Offering) and so on.\u201d\n\nHe said that the maintenance, repair and overhaul facility for the carrier and others will begin operating next year in Abuja and that 12,000 hectares of land will be used for the facility.\n\n\u201cIn that 12,000 hectares of land, which all of it is a free zone, there will be the MRO facility, a second runway, new terminal building and various businesses,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is going to be a whole airport city.\u201d\n\nHe said the MRO partners had been addressed and that work would start in April 2022 once approved by FEC.\n\nSirika said that the facility would save Nigeria millions of dollars because of the high cost of flying a plane outside the country for maintenance.\n\nThe minister said the cost range was about $250 thousand each, to and fro.\n\nTilmann Gabriel, the transaction adviser to the government for the national carrier, said efforts were ongoing to ensure that the airlines were certified.\n\n\u201cA lot of work has been done and it did not start today, rather it started three years ago.

Many teenagers, even high school students, are said to be helplessly hooked on it. The effects are devastating, the addiction, horrific.\n\n\u201cIt ruins, demolishes, destroys and completely lays waste young promising lives, turning them into animals.\u201d\n\nUko warned that if nothing is done urgently to stop the epidemic, many lives would be ruined in the Southeast.\n\n\u201cIf nothing drastic is done to rein in this strange epidemic by dealing decisively with the manufacturers and dealers of this immoral product turning even our rural communities upside down, then we will be facing the biggest challenge of all time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt impacts negatively on productivity, affects academics, upsets the equilibrium of society, influences immorality, inspires crime, and degrades humanity, by turning the addicts into something else. If left unchecked, the mkpuru mmiri pandemic can destabilise a whole generation.\n\n\u201cThis raging fire that has caught on especially, amongst young people, has the capacity to ruin the future of our land.\n\n\u201cYouth organisations and town unions, are doing a good job resisting the surge of this wicked storm raging in our land. But that\u2019s not enough. Strategic and definite efforts must be initiated by State Governments, without further delay, to contain this scourge.\n\n\u201cState Governments must step in immediately, and quickly develop veritable strategy of containment, including but not limited to aggressive awareness campaign of the evil consequences of this terrible drug and hunting down distributors and dealers.\n\n\u201cLaws should be made to demolish the buildings where the drug is manufactured and stiff punishment meted to both dealers and addicts. This is a special appeal to our Governors.\n\n\u201cA stitch in time, saves nine.\u201d",

Sadly, she passed on, on their way to the hospital.\u201d\n\nIt added that the Nigeria Police Force has extensively carried out investigations and thoroughly reviewed the club\u2019s wide and lengthy CCTV footage.\n\n\u201cWe assure the public that we have employed several health and safety standards and we will continue to place safety over profit. We have also used this bitter lesson to upgrade our already decent safety procedures and we would do our utmost best to continue to serve as a leader in this sector.\n\n\u201cMay God bless the soul of the departed. Thank you. Management,\u201d the statement stated.\n\nMeanwhile, a CCTV footage in circulation has also shown how the female clubber slipped while leaving the club.",

          "text": "Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in Nigeria operating under the aegis of Civil Society Coalition for Economic Development (CED), on Thursday, said plans were afoot to organise a conference on \u2018Fuel subsidy removal\u2019 in Nigeria.\n\nThe coalition, which comprised 82 groups, disclosed this at a press conference in Abuja on Thursday, stressing that they were committed to pushing for subsidy removal as well as engaging other stakeholders in some sectors of the economy to see reasons with government on the need to lay fuel subsidy payment to rest.\n\nThe convener of the group, Comrade Yusuf Dan Maitama, further said that the proposed theme of the conference is \u201cSubsidy removal and the Future of Nigeria\u2019s Economy,\u201d adding that there was no better time for total removal of fuel subsidy than now given the economic challenges the nation is going through.\n\nAccording to the coalition, the conference which is slated for Tuesday and Wednesday next week, will take place in Abuja and Lagos, featuring world-class resource persons in oil and gas sector in order to refocus activities of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector and to secure the nation\u2019s resources for its critical mass rather than private pocket benefactors.\n\nThe coalition lamented that fuel subsidy regime which had been in place for the past 20 years, has enriched few individuals and denied citizens of what was supposed to be a collective wealth, adding that moves by the present administration to end the subsidy regime was the right step.\n\nCiting further reasons for the conference, the coalition posited that the Nigeria National Petroleum Company\u2019s commitment to implementing policy that ensures total removal of subsidy should be supported by all.\n\n\u201cThe fuel subsidy regime has in the last 20 years done more harm than good to the economy of the nation and it appears Nigeria is the only country in the world that has fuel subsidy regime in place.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe have slated a conference for Tuesday and Wednesday, 2022 and we are going to assemble top class oil experts to speak on reasons fuel subsidy regime should be put to rest,\u201d the group said.\n\nLEADERSHIP recall that the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs Zainab Ahmed, had few days ago disclosed to the Senate Committee on Finance that the Federal government would offer N5,000 transportation grant to poor Nigerians to cushion the effect of fuel subsidy removal in 2022.",

The two victims rescued by the Amotekun Corps are Musa Ibrahim and Amidu Ibrahim; they are siblings and they are herdsmen.\n\n\u201cThey were kidnapped in Supare Akoko and valuables were taken from them after the kidnap operation. They were tied and about to be slaughtered by fellow Fulani men before our men got wind of it. We penetrated the forest where they were hiding and we were able to apprehend one of the criminals.\n\n\u201cHe confessed to the crime and said the gang was a group of seven and that they migrated into the state from Benin and Kogi states. He said the last kidnap they did involved eight people. He said they all scattered when the Amotekun men came, in order not to be arrested.\n\n\u201cThe suspected kidnapper, Sidi Amodu, claimed he came from Kogi for the purpose of the kidnap and that they hired cows as a cover-up because they were not the real owners of the cows.\n\n\u201cHe said they operated in some bad portions of the roads in Ajowa Akoko, Akunnu, and Supare areas of the state.\u201d\n\nHowever, the suspect, Amodu, said the gang moved with hired cows from Okenne, Kogi State, to Ondo State to perpetrate crimes while disguised as herdsmen.\n\nHe also confessed that they robbed at some bad spots in Akunnu Akoko, Supare Akoko, and Ajowa Akoko, but the two brothers were kidnapped for the purpose of ransom.\n\nThe victims, however, noted that they were beaten and tortured by the hoodlums.\n\nMusa said, \u201cThey tortured us and told us to call our relatives to bring ransom to release us or they would kill us. They beat us and were about to kill us when the Amotekun men arrived in the forest.\u201d",

Yes, Abuja-Kaduna belt was discussed specifically, but we appreciated the fact that we are in the season of festivity.\n\n\u201cSo, all agencies committed to providing security for Nigeria and the maintenance of law and order, have been ordered to improve on their activities, intensify surveillance and minimize, if not eliminate totally any threat to law and order anywhere in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAsked if the military or the police will be taking the lead, he said: \u201cPolice, as I said, is the lead agency on internal security.\n\n\u201cSo whatever I\u2019ve said about maintenance of law and order will start with the police and then extend to all the other security agencies, certainly.\u201d\n\nAlso asked if the issue or bandits collecting ransom, taking over and administering some areas in the country was discussed, he said: \u201cSpecific orders have been given to all our security agencies.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ll see an improved response to all those challenging the sovereignty of Nigeria in whatever form and creating insecurity in whatever form anywhere.\n\n\u201cThe council, today, took firm decision on what to be done and I can assure Nigerians that with the charge from the President and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces today (Thursday), there will be an improved response to all forms of criminality in any part of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOn whether there were new strategies to that effect, especially as it was not the first time such charge would be given by President Buhari, the minister said: \u201cBut what I know is that for as long as there is life, we must not rest until our objective of making Nigeria safe for Nigerians is made possible.\n\n\u201cSo, I am convinced that with the renewed charge to our security agencies, from the military, to the police, intelligence organisations and all other security forces, certainly Nigerians will feel and live better going forward.\u201d\n\nRoll call\n\nPresent at the meeting were Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Chief of Staff to the President Professor Ibrahim Gambari; National Security Adviser (NSA) -ajor General Babagana Monguno (retd) and Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General LEO Irabor.\n\nAlso in attendance were Chief of Army Staff, Chief of Naval Staff and the Chief of Air Staff as well as the Inspector General of Police Usman Baba Alkali.\n\nBefore the commencement of the meeting, President Buhari, with the assistance of Vice President Osinbajo, had decorated his Aide De Camp (ADC) Lt.-Col Yusuf Mukhtar Dodo with his new red neck rank of Colonel.\n\nTroops kill 30 terrorists\n\nMeanwhile, the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) Thursday said troops of Operation HADIN KAI in the North-east have killed over 90 Boko Haram/ Islamic State in West Africa (ISWAP) terrorists and arrested 21 others.\n\nThe military also said a total of 996 terrorists and their families comprising 203 males, 302 females and 491 children surrendered to troops at different locations in Borno state.\n\nDirector Defence Media Operations (DMO) Brigadier-General Bernard Onyeuko stated this while briefing journalists on update of military operations across the country from 11 to 25.\n\nHe said troops also arrested a notorious terrorist named Mr Haladu Saleh, who had been on wanted list since 2018.\n\nHe said \u201cIn the course of these operations, no fewer than 90 terrorists were neutralized and 21 of them arrested.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, although a few setbacks were experienced in the course of these operations within the last 2 weeks, however, troops remained undaunted and determined in their quest to attain sustainable peace in the country through kinetic and non-kinetic operations.\n\nHe said: \u201cTroops of Operation HADIN KAI within the period under review carried out extensive land and air operations across the theatre.\n\n\u201cNotably, on 12 November, 2021, the Air Component of Operation HADIN KAI decimated BHT/ISWAP terrorist elements in offensive air strikes in a location within Baga near the Lake Chad.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, on 13 November, 2021, own troops in a coordinated ground and air attacks, repelled terrorists\u2019 attack on troops at Askira Uba in Borno state. During the counter-offensive operation, over 50 of the terrorists were neutralized and several of their combat equipment, including gun trucks and other weapons were destroyed.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, he said troops arrested Boko Haram logistics supplies and two drug peddlers named Mr Ezekiel Karson and Galadima Bako with large quantities of cannabis sativa.\n\nHe added that many kidnapped victims were freed and assorted weapons were seized from the terrorists.\n\n\u201cAlso, 98 assorted weapons, including AK-47 rifles and 2,589 rounds of ammunitions were recovered within the period. Additionally, seven kidnapped civilians were rescued.\n\n\u201cTheir fighting vehicles as well as large caches of arms and ammunition were recovered during the encounter. However, some of our gallant officers and soldiers paid the supreme prize,\u201d he said.",
          "summary": "For the umpteenth time, President Muhammadu Buhari has given marching orders to the security chiefs to go after insurgents, bandits and terrorists, saying they must not rest until all Nigerians are at rest.\nAregbesola said President Buhari appreciated the successes and gains recorded by all security chiefs, the security agencies and intelligence organisations on security situation nationwide after he received briefs from them at the meeting.\n\u201cThe President was particularly happy with the fact that a free and fair election was made possible by the INEC and our security agencies.\nThe police and other security agencies had been mobilised to intensify surveillance, patrol in pursuit of the criminals.\nDirector Defence Media Operations (DMO) Brigadier-General Bernard Onyeuko stated this while briefing journalists on update of military operations across the country from 11 to 25.",

          "text": "Minister of Aviation Hadi Sirika has said the country\u2019s national air carrier, Air Nigeria, is expected to take off April 2022.\n\nThe minister said this while briefing State House correspondents at the end of the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe said the national airliner would be run by a company in which the Nigerian government would hold a five percent stake, Nigerian entrepreneurs 46 percent and the remaining 49 percent for yet to be assigned strategic equity partners, including foreign investors.\n\nSitrika said, when it becomes operational, the national carrier would create about 70,000 jobs for Nigerians.\n\nThe minister said over 400,000 Nigerians participated in choosing the name unveiled 2018.\n\n\u201cToday in Council, civil aviation presented two memoranda. The first one is approval for the award of contract for the provision of Automated Civil Aviation Regulatory Equipment, including software support and training, which will be located in Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport.\n\n\u201cIn summary, this is a software that will allow all of the activities of civil aviation regulation to be done electronically on one platform, including payments, including follow-ups on personnel licensing, the medicals, the economic regulation of airlines, safety regulation of airlines and all other businesses within the envelope of civil aviation will be monitored by this single software.\n\n\u201cIt is called \u2018the truth machine\u2019 in Europe because all of the truth of regulation of civilization will appear on this platform. It\u2019s extremely important software that the world has now come to terms with.\n\n\u201cThe contract was given to Messrs. Arif Investment Nigeria Limited, who are representatives of Empik GmbH. This Empik is the creator of this software, one of its kind in the world, at the sum of N1, 492,520,325, which will be including 7.5% VAT and a completion period of six months. So that\u2019s the first memoranda,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe further said: \u201cThe next one also is approval of the outline business case for the establishment of the national carrier and this is the sixth time the memorandum appeared before Council. The sixth time, we got lucky to be passed by Council.\n\n\u201cThe structure of the proposed airline; the government will be owning not more than 5%. So, 5 per cent is the maximum equity that government will take, then 46% will be owned by Nigerian entrepreneurs. So, if you add that, it\u2019s 51%.\u201d\n\nSirika added that with a 51 per cent share, Nigerians will own the majority while 49% will be held by strategic equity partners that will be sourced during the procurement phase.\n\n\u201cThis airline, if started, and within the first few years, will generate about 70,000 jobs. These 70,000 jobs are higher than the total number of civil servants that we have in the country. Its importance had been well discussed so; I\u2019ll not go back to it. You had discussed it separately also on various fora as to the need for it.\n\n\u201cBut one important item is the AU agenda 2063, which speaks to the integration of Africa, which speaks to the cause and trade within Africa that is intra-Africa and to which also another flagship project of AU agenda 2063 called the Single African Air Transport Market.\n\n\u201cNow, the only way, the quickest way that you can integrate Africa is by air because if you want to interconnect all the 54 nations of Africa, via rail or road, or waterways, which is even impossible, the quantum of money that you need to do all of these, the time it will take to develop this infrastructure, as well as the maintenance cost, is almost prohibitive,\u201d Sirika explained.\n\nThe minister expressed the confidence that the target is \u201cdoable, it\u2019s time-taking, but with aviation, within a year, once the right policy is in place, like SAATM, you can connect Africa and then, of course, the needed integration will happen. Part of AU agenda 2063 so, these are the two memoranda that were submitted, and gladly they were passed by Council.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe name is Nigerian Air which of course, if you remember back in time, this was subject to the national debate and 400,000 people participated, choose the name, the colour, the logo, everything and it was produced that time. It was launched also in Farnborough as far back as 2018.\n\n\u201cSo, the business case is a public document. It will be on our website; you can download it and we can give you copies. This airline will pick up and start, by God\u2019s grace, on or before April 2022.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

          "title": "2022: Minister reveals full fuel deregulation plans as FG removes subsidy provision from budget",
          "text": "Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning Hajiya Zainab Ahmed has said the federal government cannot sustain the current N250 billion monthly petroleum subsidy.\n\nThe minister stated this while briefing State House correspondents Wednesday in Abuja at the end of the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nShe said the costly monthly subsidy was making the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC)\u2019s remittance almost zero to the federation.\n\nThe minister\u2019s position came 24 hours after the Group Managing Director Mele Kyari said legally the fuel subsidy regime would come to an end February next year.\n\nMinister speaks\n\nAnd speaking along same line Wednesday, Minister Ahmed said: \u201cThe Petroleum Industry Act has a provision that all petroleum products must be deregulated. And in the 2020 budget, we made a provision to assume that at the maximum by the end of June, we must exit subsidy. So this last FAAC, the subsidy cost to the Federation was N243 billion.\n\n\u201cIf we look at a cost of about 250 billion per month, and it has been increasing consistently. So we\u2019re expecting something around N120 billion per month from NNPC. And now we\u2019re getting to a point where NNPC is remitting near zero. And if we don\u2019t stop we will get to a point where they will tell you pay me this for managing the fuel provision in the country.\n\n\u201cSo if you take N250 billion times 12 months, that is about N3 trillion. If we don\u2019t remove that, that is what it is costing us. This is money that we can use to apply to health and to education.\n\n\u201cThe intervention we want to provide is for between 20 to 40 million people and there is still a lot of work going on. We have a committee that is chaired by His Excellency the Vice President, state governors and a few of us-ministers as members. So we have to have a landing as to the exact number between 20 to 40 million.\n\n\u201cWe already agreed it will be N5, 000 and we have also agreed that the remittances have to be done digitally. So the e-naira will help, but also are the various payment platforms that are currently available. What we will not do is paying people in cash.\n\n\u201cThe transfers that people will receive through one kind of electronic money or the other and it\u2019s meant to be for a period of six, nine or 12 months. So these are things that we are still in negotiation because it\u2019s still money that would have to come from the Federation account. So, everybody that is a member of FAAC will have to agree on the numbers. The maximum will be 12 months, the minimum will be six months,\u201d she said.\n\nGDP report\n\nShe said the third quarter GDP report for 2021 which was released Thursday last week by the National Bureau of Statistics shows an improvement from the contraction that was witnessed in 2020.\n\nAsked why the growth does not impact on Nigerians, she said: \u201cLet me say that, again, the Nigeria economy is growing. And right now, we witnessed four consecutive quarters of GDP growth. We also said that we aspire to continue to push this growth to the point where the growth supersedes the growth in our population, because that\u2019s the time that people will actually feel the benefits.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re pushing the bar at the third quarter of 2021. The average annual growth is now 3.3%. Our population growth is roughly about 3.2%. So, we still need to do a lot more for people to feel this. But the fact that the service sector is not in positive territory, it also means that people will actually begin to feel the difference, because it is the service sector that has the first direct impact on people.\n\n\u201cWe entered into a recession technically and then exited recession by the fourth quarter of 2020. This report shows that we now have four consistent quarters of growth from Q4 2020 to Q3 2021. The GDP third quarter report shows a growth of 4.03% in the third quarter 2021 compared to a contraction of minus 3.62% in the third quarter of last year.\n\n\u201cPart of the economic activities that were the major drivers of growth within this reporting period is services which grew by 8.41%. Growth in the service sector was largely driven by better performance in the rail transport sector, pipeline sector, air transport, financial institutions, road transport sector, water transport as well as crude.\n\n\u201cAgriculture also grew by 1.22%. This is a slight dip compared to the 1.3% in the second quarter of 2021. And the reason for the dip has to do with a slight slowdown in agricultural activities in some parts of the country due to security.\n\n\u201cThe growth in agriculture that is reported in this quarter is largely driven by crop production. The growth in industry has been consistent, but we have seen a slight slowdown compared to the last quarter 2021 and the contraction of the industry is driven by the poor performance of the crude oil and natural gas sectors, coal mining, quarrying, minerals as well as oil refinery.\n\n\u201cThe Q3 GDP report indicates that the oil sector\u2019s contribution to the GDP today stands at 7.49% while the non oil sector contribution to the GDP stands at 2.51%. This indicates that the Nigerian economy is truly very diversified with the oil sector contributing just 7.49%.\n\n\u201cSo, factors that are responsible for this growth include the commitment of the government to continued containment of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the implementation of fiscal and monetary measures to support businesses contained in the Economic Sustainability Plan.\n\n\u201cIt includes the improvement that we\u2019ve witnessed in the rail transport sector, pipelines, air transport, road transport, as well as water transport. It includes improvement in the transportation and the free movement of people as well as goods as the containment measures have been really improved.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen also improvement in the financial services sector with higher supplementary incomes compared to 2020. There\u2019s been improvement in electricity generation and distribution during this quarter as well as improvement in water supply, sewage and waste management and remediation activities.\n\n\u201cThere is also indication of higher trade activities which have significantly improved compared to 2020 because of the containment measures that slowed down trade significantly. Also reported is the inflation numbers for the month of October 2021 at 15.99%.\n\n\u201cThis is consistent with the decline that we have seen in inflation from April 2021 to date. We expect this decline to continue through the rest of the year and also throughout the year 2022. On the other hand, we have seen an adjustment that has been done in the inflation largely caused by the improvement in the food basket in the inflation mix. And this is largely due to the agricultural harvest which constitutes 50% of the basket and inflation,\u201d she said.\n\nProvision not in budget \u2013Senate\n\nBut, Chairman Senate Committee on Finance Olamilekan Adeola (APC Lagos West) has said no provision was made for N5, 000 monthly stipend for 40 million Nigerians as transportation allowance in the 2022 budget.\n\nPut together, he said this would amount to N2.4trillion.\n\nHowever, the lawmaker also disclosed that there was provision for subsidy in the Appropriation Bill.\n\nHe spoke to journalists Wednesday shortly after submitting the committee\u2019s report on the Bill.\n\nAdeola explained that before the Executive can embark on such intervention, the proposal must come to National Assembly because it is going to cost N2.4 trillion, even as he wondered what criteria would be used to determine the beneficiaries of the transportation allowance.\n\nThe proposal according to him, is still a rumour since the required documents on that is not before the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go into details, if there is something like that, a document needs to come to National Assembly. And how do they want to identify the identities of the beneficiaries? This is not provided for in 2022 budget proposal which is N2.4 trillion\n\n\u201cFor us, we still believe it is news because this budget we are considering contains subsidy and if we are passing a budget with subsidy in the fiscal document, we can\u2019t speak because that is the document that is currently before us.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Finance, budget and National Planning was quoted as saying that 40 million Nigerians will be paid N5000 as transportation allowance, in lieu of the fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go into details for now. I believe that if such proposal is to come to pass, a document to that effect must be sent to National Assembly for us to see how feasible it is and how do we identify the 40 million Nigerians that are going to benefit from this process.\n\n\u201cThere are still a lot of issues to be deliberated upon and looked into if eventually this will come to pass. And how do we raise this money to pay these 40 million Nigerians because I know that even the revenue being raised and monies that are coming in from this so-called oil and other sources of revenue to the Federal government cannot guarantee that?.\n\n\u201cSo, this is not provided for already in the 2022 budget. We don\u2019t have anywhere in the budget where 40 million Nigerians will collect N5000 monthly as transportation allowance totalling N2.4 trillion.\n\n\u201cI know that there must be a budgetary provision for this for us (National Assembly) to consider. That is why I said it is still a news out there until it formally comes to the National Assembly for either a virement to the budget or reordering of the budget. For now, I still want to take it as a rumour and as a news until, it is formally presented before the National Assembly,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "WTO DG Okonjo-Iweala Tasks Members on Reform, Improved Access to Vaccines",
          "text": "The Director General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, on Thursday urged members of the global trade body who would be gathering next week in Geneva for Ministerial Conference 12 (MC 12) to put in progress a process for the reforming of the WTO.\n\nOkonjo-Iweala said this Thursday, during a virtual media briefing organised by the WTO, where she advised the ministers to improve the availability of COVID-19 vaccines to low income countries and address the lingering issues around fisheries subsidies and agriculture.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe MC12 comes up in five days\u2019 time. But I will like to say that the outcome is uncertain and the coming week will tell us a great deal about what will happen as far as the WTO and its future is concerned; what we need to do and the process we need to put in place to modernise and reform the WTO.\n\n\u201cNothing on the ministerial conference (agenda) is really more important than the response of the ministers on the COVID-19 pandemic. It is a problem on global commerce and is one area which we need a multilateral approach.\n\n\u201cWe hope that ministers will come up with response to the pandemic including a middle ground that will help us to make impact on this area. We need a response that will ramp up more regionally diverse productions, which addresses the problem of inequity in vaccines.\n\n\u201cA situation in which 66 per cent of the persons in developed countries are vaccinated versus the three per cent in low income countries (that have received the vaccines) is not really acceptable. It is not good for the world and for those countries.\n\n\u201cThis inequity of access is a sour point and I think we need to figure out how to deal with. We have been working with manufacturers to persuade them to diversify their investments to emerging markets and developing countries where there are opportunities.\n\n\u201cWe can get more people vaccinated either by swapping contracts or encouraging the donations to go to places where they are really needed.\u201d\n\nThe WTO\u2019s director general identified three elements that made up credible response to the pandemic to include monitoring of the supply chains; export restrictions and prohibitions; working with manufacturers by diversifying production and transparency of production and contracts and the last part is on technology transfer with regard to intellectual property.\n\nShe said the, \u201cpoint we are trying to make to the ministers right now is that an all, or nothing, attitude will not get us to where we will want to go. It means that potentially we will all walk away with nothing. We will want to see everyone coming to a good middle ground which we think is possible. But it is for the members to make the efforts.\u201d\n\nOkonjo-Iweala also commented on the protracted negations on fisheries subsidies that has lasted for over 20 years and implored the ministers to achieve a closure on the matter.\n\n\u201cWe have seen some momentum on this in recent weeks. We have seen issues narrowed more than we have ever seen them before. But we are definitely not out of the woods yet. We are hoping that we can get a closure about these fisheries subsidies after two decades. But there still outstanding areas with respect to special and differential treatments that ministers will have to close when they come. We are keeping our fingers crossed that they will come to some good agreements.\n\n\u201cThe text (on fisheries negotiation) has gone out to the ministers with requisite brackets and we hope that they will be able to close those brackets,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also pointed out that it would be important to have a multilateral decision on carbon pricing than the current fragmented approach that is a little problematic for businesses.\n\n\u201cIt will be a good thing if we could get a global carbon price. We have to task the IMF, World Band, the OECD and the WTO to work together to develop a methodology and an approach to this. The IMF, WTO and the OECD are collaborating on this and have put a team together to try and begin thinking through this,\u201d the director general said.\n\nShe also said that the moratorium on electronic transmissions would be left to the ministerial conference to agree on whether they would continue with interim solutions or be able to come to an agreement. \u201cAgain, this is a difficult one that has been going. On the brighter side we have got the e-commerce negations that are going on with 86 members to decide on rules that will underpin digital trade,\u201d Okonjo-Iweala said.\n\nDike Onwuamaeze",

          "title": "Three Weeks after Eruption, Nigeria Says Nembe Oil Spill Now Under Control",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government on Thursday announced that the OML 29 oil spill in Nembe, Bayelsa State, had been brought under control, with necessary personnel and equipment deployed to begin recovery and remediation efforts.\n\nThis came more than three weeks after the eruption that affected several communities in the state.\n\nMinister of Environment, Sharon Ikeazor, who made disclosed the control of the spill at the weekly ministerial press briefing organised at the State House, Abuja.\n\nThe unfortunate incident was said to have been brought under control after the Aiteo Eastern Exploration Company (AEEPCO) succeeded in mobilising heavy equipment to the site of the Santa Barbara wellhead leak, in what it described as a \u201cwell kill\u201d operation.\n\nIkeazor likened the incident to the atomic bomb site in Hiroshima City in Japan, which was devastated when the Allied Forces dropped a bomb on it during the Second World War.\n\nShe explained, \u201cThe situation has been brought under control. I got a brief from the Director General, National Oil Spillage Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), who was out on the field. So, now, work has to start on the proper clean up.\n\n\u201cSo, is this something we must tackle head-on? We are beyond talking and having workshop. On the issue of penalties, I mentioned earlier the review of NOSDRA bill. You know most of the Acts we have passed years ago. You will see that they will give maybe N100 fine, anyone can pay that and go back and re-pollute.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Arise News Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY, yesterday, Minister of State for Petroleum, Chief Timipre Sylva, who spoke about his visit to the host community for on the spot assessment of the impacted area, had assured that he would produce a report, after the inspection, which would be submitted to President Muhammadu Buhari for immediate action.\n\nSylva, also disclosed that the federal government and Aiteo oil company had moved to contain the massive oil spill. He thanked the host community for their peaceful conduct.\n\nSylva stated, \u201cThe company, Aiteo, is making reasonable effort to contain the spill and ensure that the Christmas tree is repaired.\n\n\u201cWe will produce a report that will be submitted to Mr. President. We want to thank the community for being peaceful and not taking the laws into their hands.\u201d\n\nAiteo, in a telephone chat yesterday night, confirmed the leak had been contained, stating that the company has already embarked on measures to control the spillage, shutdown and kill the well.\n\nTHISDAY learnt yesterday that AEEPCO had as of last night fully mobilised to the site and had reinforced its efforts to put an end to the saga.\n\nVideos of the operation sighted by THISDAY indicated that while the, \u201cwell kill\u201d operation was going on, several barges carrying cranes and other equipment were on their way to the location to begin recovery of the hydrocarbons.\n\n\u201cThese are pumping and stimulation equipment loaded with calcium fluoride for the well kill operation. To minimise down time, what we are doing is to arrange all key lines. We have begun work already. By the time this barges get there, the leak must have been arrested.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s just for us to hook up the lines and the hoses into the well. We have cranes and at least three barges and with these, the spill will be contained in no time,\u201d a source said.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission, Mr. Gbenga Komolafe, assured that \u201cthe matter would be resolved in a way that will not negatively impact the area.\u201d\n\nIkeazor stressed the need to put an end to artisanal refineries, which she said had continued to cause pollution in the Niger Delta. She also disclosed plans to institute stiffer penalty for companies involved in oil spill in the country, adding that the operating company is blaming locals for the latest incident in OML29, Nembe.\n\nIkeazor said the ministry was engaging other relevant government agencies to come up with stiffer punishments for erring oil multinationals.\n\nShe said, \u201cI got briefings and what I saw in terms of the pollution either through oil refining or illegal oil refining and otherwise \u2013 the devastation of the Niger Delta is massive. As we are cleaning up, what we are cleaning up is minute compared to the devastation going on.\n\n\u201cSo, it is something that government needs to tackle head-on. I hope they would have put the picture on (slide show), it was like a Hiroshima site.\u201d\n\nThe minister said a bill was being worked out to amend the law establishing NOSDRA to build its capacity and give it \u201cthe needed teeth to bite.\u201d\n\nShe said the operating company of the OML29 in Nembe had blamed the most recent oil spillage in the country on sabotage by the locals.\n\nAccording to her, something must be done about the on-going gas flaring\n\nShe said the country could not be committed to zero net emission and be flaring gas at the same time.\n\nIkeazor said, \u201cOn the Santa Babara Aiteo oil spills, you remember the Ministry of Environment issued a statement stating what happened and the action being taken. It\u2019s a collective action between the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, the Ministry of Environment, and the oil company involved.\n\n\u201cIt goes beyond the oil companies giving out palliatives, they must put measures in place to prevent such accidents from happening.\n\n\u201cThey are also claiming that the spill was due to sabotage by the local communities. We are going to have a targeted approach to illegal bunkering, tampering with oil installation and artisanal mining in the Niger Delta to get alternative livelihood for the young people of the Niger Delta, so that they would desist from this because it is further polluting the environment.\n\n\u201cWe need to put stiffer penalties, build the capacity of NOSDRA, which is the regulatory agency in the oil sector, to be able to have the teeth to bite. Without enhancing their capacity and reaffirming the legal framework, getting it stronger, they cannot do much. These are areas we are looking in to, it has to stop.\n\n\u201cGovernment is working on alternative livelihood for the communities so that we can move them away from illegal activities and further polluting of the environment.\u201d\n\nThe minister also lamented the rate of deaths from smoke-induced illnesses, especially among women in the country, which is said to be the highest in the world. She said the federal government was hoping to reintroduce clean cookstove and the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cookstove initiative to ameliorate the problem and protect the nation\u2019s biodiversity.\n\nOn the Ogoni clean-up exercise, the minister noted that the work could not be completed in one or two years as she stressed the need to end artisanal refining of crude oil.\n\nShe stated, \u201cWe must accelerate also the Ogoni cleanup, to make sure that the remediation is completed in time for the good people of Ogoni. But at the same time, we must tackle the issue of artisanal refining because as we are cleaning, some are still polluting the environment and we ask that this must stop, for us to have a clean and decent environment.\u201d",

It is advisable they appear before us before the matter is escalated, following which we shall use powers available to us under the law, to compel their appearance.\n\n\u201cAs part of any Investigative hearing, we shall look into the antecedent and future interest of all the companies and where found capable, stop them in the future work. While we are happy to encourage foreign Investment in Nigeria, it must comply with our local laws.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Rivers State Government has given a fiat to Obla SAN, to prosecute Saipem SPA, among others over alleged conspiracy, fraud, obtaining credit by false pretence and cheating in respect of $119 million contract for the construction of the OCGT Power Plant in Port Harcourt.\n\nThe offences run contrary to sections 518 (6) and (7), 419 (A) (1) (b), section 421 of the Criminal Code Law of Rivers State, Cap 37 Vol. 2 Laws of Rivers State of Nigeria 1999.\n\nOther defendants in the charge marked PHC/3106/CR/2021, include; Kelechi Chinakwe, Giandomenico Zingali, Vitto Testaguzza and David Anelli.\n\nSpecifically, the defendants as contractors to Rivers State Government of Nigeria and officers of Saipem SPA and Saipem Contracting Nigeria Ltd, in respect of the contract for the construction of the OCGT power plant in Port Harcourt between 2011-2018, were alleged to have conspired to cheat and with intent to defraud, obtained credit by false pretence from the Rivers State Government being advance payment of the total contract sum of $130 Million USD, when they have not kept their obligation under the contract.\n\nThe defendants in the suit scheduled for hearing slated for November 26, were also alleged to have obtained credit of $20,467,942.00 by false pretences or other fraud contrary to Section 419A and punishable under Section 419 (A) (1) (b).\n\nThey were in addition accused of obtaining credit of N7 billion by false pretences or other fraud contrary to Section 419A and punishable under Section 419 (A) (1) (b).\n\n\u201cObtaining credit of N318,640,173.54 by false pretences or other fraud contrary to Section 419A and punishable under Section 419 (A) (1) (b).\n\n\u201cAttempt to cheat $97 million contrary to Section 508 and punishable under Section 509.\n\n\u201cAttempt to cheat $15 Million USD contrary to Section 508 and punishable under Section 509; Conspiracy to receive a credit of $97 Million by false pretence contrary to Section 518 (6) and punishable under Section 518; Cheating $11 Million USD contrary to Section 421 and punishable under Section 421, among other charges.\n\nFrom the Proof of Evidence attached to the Charge and the Statement made by one Mr. Temple Azunda, Head, Power Generation/Mechanical of the Rivers State Ministry of Power, the facts constituting the case in hand are as follows: \u201cSaipem SPA and Saipem Contracting Nigeria Limited and other officers of the duo, are Italian companies which services have been retained by the Rivers State Government in several projects, prominent amongst which is the AFAM Phase II Power Plant Project.\n\n\u201cBy an initial tripartite agreement made on the January 20, 2010, the RSG under the auspices of the Rivers State Ministry of Power entered a contract with Saipem Contracting Nigeria Limited, Saipem SPA for the construction of the OGCT power plant in Port Harcourt at a total cost of $119 million consequent upon which the Rivers State Government made advance payments, in instalments, to Saipem Contracting Nigeria Ltd and Saipem SPA amounting in total to a sum of $130 million in all which the defendants have acknowledged receipt of.\n\n\u201cThe defendants were to be given an initial mobilisation of 20 per cent of the total contract sum which the RSG paid. It was part of the initial agreement \u2013 and indeed a condition sine qua non \u2013 that, to access the second tranche of payment of 25 per cent from the Rivers State Government, the defendants would mandatorily have installed the Gas Turbine into the foundations.\n\n\u201cBy various pieces of correspondence misrepresenting facts to the RSG, the defendants have received by false pretences a total sum of $130 million which they have acknowledged in correspondence to the Rivers State Government Ministry of Power. This is $11 million in excess of the total contract sum while the contract is still at a preliminary stage only.\n\n\u201cTo worsen matters, the installation of the turbines in the foundation which is a mandatory precondition for the access the second tranche of payment of 25 per cent of the total contract sum has not been done.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the RSG is aware that the turbines which it had bought and the transport cost of which has already been paid to the defendants are lying in a seaport in the Netherlands and have accumulated demurrage of about $8 Million USD which the defendants insist must be defrayed by the RSG.\n\nDeji Elumoye and Alex Enumah in Abuja",

          "title": "Nigeria: CBN Governor Emefiele Inaugurates N500m Youth Entrepreneurs\u2019 Scheme",
          "text": "Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, on Thursday launched the apex bank\u2019s N500 million Tertiary Institutions Entrepreneurship Scheme (TIES).\n\nSpeaking at the launch of the scheme in Abuja, Emefiele said the intervention would create an enabling business environment that supports innovation. It would also enable the youth to unleash their entrepreneurial potential, by redirecting their focus from seeking white-collar jobs to embracing a culture of entrepreneurship, he said.\n\nThe initiative, which the CBN governor hinted at earlier this year, was expected to boost entrepreneurship in higher institutions of learning.\n\nEmefiele stressed the need for the environment to provide support in re-orientating, training, and providing a financing model apt to the peculiarities of the sector within which the businesses operate.\n\nHe urged government at all levels to evolve policy measures to support entrepreneurial development among the youth in the country. The CBN governor said this was particularly crucial given that about 600,000 students graduate yearly from Nigerian tertiary institutions without commensurate employment opportunities in both the public and private sectors.\n\nEmefiele said the essence of the intervention was to create a paradigm shift from the obsession for white-collar jobs among graduates and promote entrepreneurship. He said the CBN was particularly concerned about the current level of unemployment among the youth population.\n\nHe explained that the intervention consisted of three main components, including term loan, equity investment, and development grant.\n\nEmefiele said the scheme would make it easy for youths to access credit and create jobs for themselves and others. He warned that the finance to be provided was not a grant but a loan, which should be used for the intended purposes.\n\nHe said entrepreneurship remained an integral part of any economy, adding that entrepreneurs play a key role in driving growth and innovation, which in turn results in job creation.\n\nEmefiele said in line with its mandate of ensuring monetary and price stability, and its developmental mandate of ensuring inclusive growth in the economy, the central bank had introduced several programmes to create an ecosystem that allowed the flow of affordable credit to the real sector.\n\nHe added that these interventions were industry-led and designed to support the resilience of targeted priority sectors and segments for growth and job creation.\n\nHe explained, \u201cWith an estimated population of 213 million, out of which two-third are youth, aged under 35 years, the nation is faced with a historic opportunity, particularly as the demography continues to create clear evidence of their relevance to economic development, as accentuated by the global recognition of Nigerian tech start-ups and continued growth of businesses in the technology space owned by the youth.\n\n\u201cIn realisation of this, the CBN has introduced several innovative financing programmes designed to extend low-cost financing to youth entrepreneurs across the country.\n\n\u201cThese interventions have continued to receive resounding commendations, as they have proven effective in extending credit to youth entrepreneurs across the country.\u201d\n\nEssentially, he said TIES was conceived as part of measures to promote entrepreneurship development among the graduate and undergraduate youths of Nigerian polytechnics and universities, with the release of the implementation guidelines and the opening of a portal for submission of applications in October 2021.\n\nThe scheme aims at providing an innovative financing model that will support the development of innovative entrepreneurial ideas among graduates and undergraduates of tertiary institutions in the country, the CBN governor said.\n\nThe ceremony also witnessed the inauguration of the Body of Experts (BoE) by the CBN governor. The body, chaired by the Group Managing Director/Chief Executive, Sterling Bank Plc, Mr. Abubakar Suleiman, among other professionals, seeks to evaluate and rank entrepreneurial presentations made by the tertiary institutions under the development (grant) component.\n\nEmefiele said members of the body were professionals of impeccable standing, drawn from the academia, professional bodies, and industry. He said part of their job was to recommend projects with high potential and transformational impact for grant awards.\n\nOther members of the BoE include Chief Financial Officer, First Bank Plc, Mr. Patrick Iyamabo; Mr. Adamu Lawani (Zenith Bank Plc); Ms. Ngover Ihyembe-Nwankwo (Rand Merchant Bank); Mr. Ashafa Ladan (National Universities Commission); Mr. Abbati D.K. Muhammad (National Board for Technical Education); Dr. Friday Okpara of the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN); Mr. Tope Fasua (Global Analytics Consulting); Brigadier-General Folusho Oyinlola (National Defence College); and Ms. Bolanle Adekoya (PWC). Mrs. Temitope Akin-Fadeyi of the CBN is the body\u2019s secretary.\n\nEmefiele said the official launch of the TIES and subsequent inauguration of the BoE for the scheme\u2019s development component was a testimony to the important role the youth play in building new blocks for economic growth, particularly as national growth was highly dependent on strong and competitive businesses.\n\nHe said bridging their financing gaps and enhancing access to low-cost credit to drive development of business was a task that could only be addressed by an innovative financing model that correlates with the complexity and dynamics of these small businesses.\n\nEmefiele said the scheme was designed to address three verticals of the segment namely, term loan component, which provides direct credit opportunities to graduates of Nigerian polytechnics and universities of not more than seven years post-graduation.\n\nHe said an applicant, if successful, should be eligible for a maximum of N5 million for an individual, sole-proprietorship or small company; and a maximum of N25 million for a partnership or company.\n\nThe tenure of the facility is a maximum of five years, with a one-year moratorium, and at an interest of five per cent per annum, which shall revert to nine per cent from March 2022.\n\nThe pilot phase of the scheme is presently being implemented through the Bank of Industry (BOI) with the development of an application portal and processing of submitted applications.\n\nThe equity investment component is designed to support start-ups, existing businesses requiring expansion, and ailing businesses seeking resuscitation, and shall be implemented under the bank\u2019s AGSMEIS equity window.\n\nThe investment limit shall be subject to the limit prescribed by the AGSMEIS guidelines and the investment period not more than 10 years.\n\nEmefiele also noted that the development grant component was aimed at raising awareness and visibility of entrepreneurship among undergraduates of Nigerian tertiary institutions. He explained that here, polytechnics and universities in the country shall compete in a national biennial entrepreneurship competition where undergraduates are presented by the tertiary institutions to pitch innovative entrepreneurial or technological ideas with transformational potential.\n\nAccording to him, three top institutions at the regional levels shall proceed to the national level, where the top five shall be awarded grants ranging between N120 million and N250 million.\n\nHe insisted that the grant awards should be used by the tertiary institutions solely for the development of the award-willing ideas.\n\nFurther commenting on the genesis of the scheme, Emefiele said, \u201cAs you are all aware, at the occasion of the 51st convocation of the University of Lagos, in July 2021, I delivered the convocation lecture, titled, \u201cNational Development and Knowledge Economy in the Digital Age: Leapfrogging SMEs into the 21st Century.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt that event, I promised that the central bank would seek fresh collaboration with the nation\u2019s tertiary institutions to develop entrepreneurship programmes, and to support \u2013 through the provision of access to finance \u2013 graduates and undergraduates who have bankable ideas, to bring the ideas to fruition.\n\n\u201cEngagements have been on-going between the central bank and the leadership of some of our tertiary institutions regarding the framework for an innovative financing model that will support entrepreneurship development among our graduates and undergraduates.\n\n\u201cThis launch of the Tertiary Institutions Entrepreneurship Scheme today, is a culmination of the engagements and fulfilment of that promise.\u201d\n\nHighlights of the event included the presentation of commemorative cheques to five youth entrepreneurs whose proposals were found worthy of CBN\u2019s financing under the pilot scheme.\n\nSpeaking during the launch of the initiative, Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha, hailed the efforts of the central bank to ensure that the economy remained afloat despite the disruptions occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nRepresented by the Director, Public Affairs and Bilateral Relations, Office of the SGF, Mr. Olakunle Fashina, Mustapha said, not only would the TIES boost economic growth and reduce graduate unemployment but it would also provide well-grounded incentives for the ever-growing graduate population.\n\nHe urged the tertiary institutions to deploy merit in the selection of the proposed beneficiaries of the scheme as well as monitor key performance indicators as applications are submitted.\n\nSpeaking at the occasion also, Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, described the intervention as a laudable effort by Emefiele to promote entrepreneurial skills in the ivory towers. He said the CBN was playing a significant role in laying a solid foundation for technological development in the tertiary institutions.\n\nThe minister, who was represented by the ministry\u2019s Director, University Education, Mrs. Rakiya Iliyasu, he said no country could make appreciable growth in sound technological innovation and sustainable development without focusing on the base, which is the institutions responsible for training the students in the fields of agribusiness, information technology, creative industries among others.\n\nHe said it was on record that the scheme was designed to create a paradigm shift among graduates from the pursuit of white-collar jobs to entrepreneurship geared towards job creation and economic growth.\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja",
