          "text": "Efforts to woo members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities back to the negotiating table may have hit a brick wall as executive members of the striking union failed to take part in the inauguration of a seven-man committee set up by the Federal Government to renegotiate the existing agreements.\n\nOur correspondent, who was at the inauguration held at the Federal Ministry of Education, Abuja, on Monday, observed that no ASUU official was present.\n\nThe Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, inaugurated the committee in the presence of the Executive Secretary of the National Universities Commission, Prof Abubakar Rasheed, and members of the panel led by Emeritus Prof Nimi Briggs, who is the Pro-Chancellor, Alex Ekwueme Federal University, Ndufu-Alike Ikwo.\n\nAdamu gave the committee a three-month timeframe to renegotiate all the previous agreements the Federal Government entered into with ASUU, especially the 2009 pact.\n\nASUU had said it would not be part of any fresh negotiation of the agreements, especially when the previous ones had not been fulfilled.\n\nAlthough ASUU is still observing its month-long warning strike, some of the reasons for the strike are the disagreement on the implementation of the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System, and the non-release of the universities\u2019 revitalisation fund running into several billions of naira.\n\nAdamu, however, said, \u201cThere is no gain saying that the earnest desire of every stakeholder in the Nigerian university system and, indeed, the nation at large is to conclude this re-negotiation within the shortest possible period.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I wish to specially appeal to this reconstituted committee to double its effort towards concluding the assignment and producing a realistic and workable draft agreement that will holistically tackle the challenges confronting the Nigerian university system and reposition it to effectively play its very important role in national development.\n\n\u201cThe committee is expected to review the draft proposed FGN/ASUU agreement and has the following terms of reference: Liaise and consult with relevant stakeholders to finalise the position of the Federal Government on the issues in the draft proposed FGN/ASUU renegotiated agreement;\n\n\u201cRenegotiate in realistic and workable terms the 2009 agreements with other university-based unions; negotiate and recommend any other issue the committee deems relevant to reposition the NUS for global competitiveness; and submit proposed draft agreements within three months from the date of inauguration.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The National Assembly may suspend the ongoing amendment to the Electoral Act, 2022 based on the request by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), who asked the federal parliament to delete Section 84(14) of the new electoral law, The PUNCH learnt on Monday.\n\nIt was learnt that the leadership of the National Assembly would study the ruling of a Federal High Court, Abuja, stopping Buhari; the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN); and the parliament from tampering with the newly amended Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nBuhari had last week conveyed his reservation about the Electoral Act, 2022 to the National Assembly.\n\nWhile the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, last Tuesday read Buhari\u2019s cover letter on the Electoral Act, 2022 (Amendment) Bill dated February 28, 2022, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has yet to read the President\u2019s letter.\n\nBuhari, while assenting to the Electoral Act 2010 (Amendment) Bill at the Presidential Villa in Abuja on February 25, highlighted sections of the new law that would revolutionalise the electoral system in the country, but expressed reservations about Section 84 (12).\n\nThe section reads, \u2018No political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election\u2019.\n\nIn the letter, Buhari drew the attention of the chamber to the provisions of Section 84(12), which he noted constituted a \u201cdefect\u201d that was in conflict with extant constitutional provisions.\n\nHowever, Justice Inyang Ekwo, in a ruling on an ex parte application filed by the Peoples Democratic Party, agreed that the Electoral Act had become a valid law and could not be tampered with without following the due process.\n\nJustice Ekwo held that the proper place to challenge the validity of any existing law was in a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nThe PDP, through its counsel, James Onoja (SAN), sued the President along with the others challenging what it described as a bid to tinker with the newly amended Electoral Act.\n\nOther defendants in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/247/2022 are the President of the Senate, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Deputy President of the Senate, Deputy Speaker of the House, Clerk to the National Assembly, Leader of the House, Leader of the Senate, and the Independent National Electoral Commission.\n\nJustice Ekwo restrained the defendants in the suit from removing Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act or preventing it from being implemented for the purpose of the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe PDP had dragged Buhari before the court challenging a fresh move to tamper with the newly amended Electoral Act.\n\nThe main opposition party prayed the court for an order of interim injunction restraining Buhari and other defendants from refusing to implement the duly signed Electoral Act or in any manner withholding the law from being put to use, including Section 84 (12) of the Act pending the resolution of the suit.\n\nThe PDP also applied for an order stopping the National Assembly from giving effect to Buhari\u2019s request to remove Section 84 (12) from the Electoral Act or take any step that would make the provision inoperative pending the resolution of the motion on notice for interlocutory injunction.\n\nThe grouse of the PDP is that the President, having assented to the Bill on February 25, 2022, cannot give any directive to the National Assembly to take immediate steps to remove the contentious Section 84 (12) or any section of the Act on any ground whatsoever.\n\nJustice Ekwo granted the interim injunction request and adjourned further hearing in the matter till March 21.\n\nWhen contacted by The PUNCH to react to the court ruling, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Senator Ajibola Basiru, said, \u201cI believe the leadership will study the order and take appropriate legal advice on what is to be done.\u201d\n\nThe National Assembly had said penultimate Friday that it would seek legal advice on the request by the President, stating that it would review the clause and consult with relevant stakeholders, including lawmakers\u2019 constituents, before taking a decision on Buhari\u2019s reservations.\n\n\u201cHis (President\u2019s) request will be looked at as appropriate. We will look at it, get legal opinions and know the legislative action to take. He has assented the bill and it has become law. He should send an executive bill.\u201d Basiru had said\n\nThe Chairman of the House of Representatives\u2019 Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Benjamin Kalu, did not take his calls and he had yet to reply to a text message seeking his reaction as of press time on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe will always look at the important elements of any communication from Mr President and give it the required attention. That, we promise the Presidency and the people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,\u201d Kalu had earlier said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\nNigeria\u2019s former Ambassador to Malaysia and Brunei, Alhaji Nurudeen Muhammed has urged the world powers to do everything within their means to quickly restore peace in the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia, in other to avert a third world war.\n\nThe Septugeneran politician from Kwara North, who is also one of the Elders Committee of ruling All Progressives Congress(APC) set up to reconcile the warring factions of the party also picked holes in the decision of the opposition, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) being led by Dr Bukola Saraki, that zoned governorship to Kwara North, querying why the governorship was not so, zoned in the last 16 years.\n\nAmbassador Nurudeen Mohammed spoke in an interview with journalists in Ilorin on Sunday on the state of the nation.\n\nOn the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia, he said, \u201cthe conflict between the mother country and the part that has gotten independent, the world have to find a way of managing the situation so that there will be peace and it\u2019s the duty of everyone, all countries because people are losing their lives.\n\n\u201cMajor countries of the world are taking a position, the Western world, NATO and the rest of them, possibly because of their past and present relationship with Russia as a world power, all these countries, Russia, the USA, China are a world power, NATO is a world power, a group of countries in Europe and rest of them that formed treaty, but it\u2019s time for everybody to sit down and reflect, where will this lead us to? Are we going into a third world war?\n\nAlso Read:\n\nRussia Invasion: Nuclear fears, fiery Zelensky, TikTok, 5 things that happened in Ukraine today\n\n\u201cThe dropping of the atomic bomb here and there with huge consequences or do we need to pull back, sit down and think of how to resolve it. Because the countries that are taking positions are all nuclear power, most of the countries in NATO are nuclear power, Russia is a nuclear power, all of them must come down, may God not permit them to press the nuclear button for each other. They really need to agree to restore peace between the two countries quickly, otherwise, it can lead to a third world war.\u201d\n\nAmbassador Mohammed also said that the agitations of the people of the Kwara north senatorial district, particularly the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)to produce the next governor of the state might not be effective until 2027 after the completion of the second term of Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNow, in Kwara State, we have a completely new system, this system has just come in, and said okay, you be Governor, it\u2019s only fair to allow that system enjoy the two terms and after that, we will all sit down and decide where to move it to.\n\n\u201cAnd then, we may say Kwara North has never had it in recent time, let us move to Kwara North, after that, we sit down again and say Kwara South, this is a completely new system.\n\n\u201cInstead of terminating it after just one term, let us allow the system to run its two terms. That is my own opinion. I never belong to the former system, I don\u2019t know about their arrangement and they have produced Governors without thinking of Kwara North all that time, then, why are they shouting now, when we birthed another system and say let us start a new beginning\u201d.\n\nOn the PDP zoning of its guber ticket to Kwara North, the former Nigeria Ambassador to Malaysia said, \u201cYou see, it\u2019s a game of politics, of course, I have contested every election in the state, I have contested gubernatorial 1, 2 and 3rd terms, was I not from Kwara North?\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t they vote for me to emerge? what did I do wrong that made electorates not vote for me to win?\n\n\u201cBut, did I pack and leave the state? No, I stayed and continued because I know that a day will come, it\u2019s not necessary to be me from the zone to benefit, I know that a more younger person coming behind will become governor one day, based on the principle of equity, which will be brought to play at a given time.\n\n\u201cAll parties are free to pick candidates from anywhere they want, all political party have their reason for acting the way they are acting.\n\n\u201cSome of them act in reaction to some others. But at the end of the day, the larger picture is that you go for election and the voters/electorates determine who win.\n\n\u201cAs a member of All Progressive Congress (APC) we have a sitting Governor, in the person of Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, he is on his first term, and of course, everybody is entitled to two terms, isn\u2019t it? So he might want to go for the second term, and definitely, we will support him as a party.\n\n\u201cOther parties can decide who they want to pick as candidates, maybe from North, or South. It\u2019s voters that will take a final decision on who they want, whether they want us to remain or another party. They (PDP) think they have a strategy than us, in which I believe they don\u2019t\u201d.\n\nMuhammed who stated further that, the elder committee of the party set up to reconcile the warring factions of APC has been making positive progress in its assignment noted that the committee would achieve success at the end of the day.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "\u2026 Calls on Women-friendly VP to declare for Presidency\n\nThe Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Professor Yemi Osinbajo is 65-year-old today, on a day the world is celebrating women; the 2022 International Women\u2019s Day with the theme, #BreakTheBias.\n\nTo honour the \u2018God fearing man, on his day, a female support group, \u2018S.M.A.R.T WOMEN FOR PYO\u2019, has called on the V P to use the opportunity of the double celebration to declare his intention to run for the highest office in the land.\n\nWhile noting that Osinbajo has the qualities, the required experience and the credentials to step into the shoes of President Muhammadu Buhari, the group said Nigerian women across all divides are ready to roll out their machinery in support of the VP \u2019, because of his \u2018He for She\u2019 posture amongst other qualities.\n\nAccording to the co-conveners of the group, Bunmi Oke and Folake Aina, it is time for Osinbajo to speak out as the women are ready to roll out the drums in his support. Speaking via a statement jointly signed in Lagos, the duo expressed the desires of Nigerian women in ensuring that the VP makes an open declaration in order to put paid to speculations about his ambition.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cNot many people are surprised that the birthday of the quintessential Vice President of the most populous black nation in the world falls on International Women\u2019s Day, this is so, because any discerning mind knows that the coincidence is fate as decreed by the Most High God.\n\n\u201cThis is a clear indication that God reigns in the affairs of Yemi Osinbajo, whom many believe is divinely connected. Indeed the accomplished Professor of Law, who was Commissioner for Justice and Attorney General of Lagos State, is notable as one man, who is embodied by the fear of God.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, Osinbajo is one man who has stood for the interest of women in all ramifications and the 2023 election appears to be payback time for the man of the people\u201d, the group explained.\n\nOke and Aina further noted that the S.M.A.R.T WOMEN FOR PYO is a coalition of professional women in all areas of endeavours; socio-political, young and old, cutting across all religious divide while adding the group is made up of notable women across the Nation and in Diaspora.\n\nThe group also recalled how Osinbajo was saddled with the disbursement of Trader Moni and Market Moni projects of the Federal Government meant for the support of market woman across the nation, noting that the Vice President did not only go round the nooks and crannies of Nigeria distributing funds to market women, he also ensured that he assisted them in their trade and businesses on behalf of the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cOsinbajo did not only disburse the funds with unrivalled passion, he encouraged market women to see it as an opportunity for them to escape from poverty and move to the next level.\n\n\u201cThis group appreciates the role of Professor Yemi Osinbajo, we recall how he supported the wife of the President, Aisha Buhari, and his own wife, Dolapo, in taking up the issue of gender bills recently, at the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cNigerian women will give Osinbajo resolute backing because he is one of the few Nigerian political office holders that will not turn electoral victory into an opportunity for wealth accumulation.\n\n\u201cWe believe strongly in the candidature of Professor Yemi Osinbajo, he is people-focused, he is a leader with the right acumen, and he has the intellectual capacity and the experience that qualifies him to take Nigeria beyond the next level\u201d, the statement reads.",

          "text": "Exactly 51 oil and gas companies owe the Federal Government N1.32 trillion, the Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) stated in its 2020 report.\n\nIt said 26 of the 77 firms that owed N2.63 trillion have paid their debts.\n\nThe NEITI 2020 oil and gas industry report was unveiled in Abuja yesterday.\n\nThe report states: \u201cThe total outstanding company taxes payable to FIRS (Federal Inland Revenue Service) as of 30th September 2021 is US$79.20 million while the total amount of outstanding Federation revenue payable to the DPR (Department of Petroleum Resources) as of 31st December 2020 is US3.10billion.\u201d\n\nThe NEITI Executive Secretary, Dr. Orji Ogbonnaya Orji, said anti-graft agencies would help recover the debts.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have signed some MoUs to ensure that those who will want to take our report for granted will have consequences to face.\n\n\u201cThey (anti-graft agencies) are here because the idea is immediately this report is launched, they become a document for them to use for their necessary actions.\u201d\n\nThe report says the Federal Government spent N106 billion on petrol subsidy in 2020.\n\nThe organisation said the total subsidy claim was N133.7 billion with a balance of N26.74billion.\n\nOrji said: \u201cThe total amount of subsidy claim by NNPC in 2020 was N133.74 billion (US$375.22 million), out of which N106.99 billion (US300.19 million) was recovered from the Federation in 2020, leaving an outstanding balance of N26.74billion to be recovered from the federation in 2021, through budgetary provision. There is, however, no report of independent validation of these figures.\u201d\n\nNEITI recommended that the Federal Government should fully deregulate the downstream sector.\n\nIt said savings from the stoppage of the subsidy regime should be used to improve the life of citizens.\n\nThe report urged the NNPC to \u201ctransparently disclose the details of the subsidy and the beneficiaries of the payments, in addition to rendering accounts of the loan transactions. The transaction should be extensively reviewed/investigated.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, a \u201ctotal volume of 1.799mmbbls crude oil (valued at US$59.225 million) and US2.848 mmbbls crude oil (valued at US$116.980 million) was lifted from OML 119 (Okono fields) and sold for Pre-export financing and Project Eagle agreement.\n\n\u201cThese amounts to are for repayment of loans taken in the past to settle Marketers under the Petroleum subsidy scheme, which are being recovered from monthly federation revenue proceeds. The circumstances under which the subsidies were incurred and beneficiaries are not clear.\u201d\n\nNEITI said the total volume of crude losses by 22 companies was 52,056,772bbls values at about US2.21 billion, at the annual average selling price of federation equity crude oil reported in this report.\n\nIn the period under review, the report said the country lost $44.73million (N15.71billion) to crude oil and product theft.\n\nThe report noted that the Federal Government exported 107.746million barrels of crude oil valued at $6.7billion through Direct Sale Direct Purchase (DSDP).\n\nThe report noted that there was zero allocation of crude to refineries due to a lack of capacity to process crude oil.\n\nNEITI said operatorship of OML 116 was transferred to National Petroleum Company (NPDC) whereas the proceeds from production were treated as if the ownership of the license was reassigned to NPDC.\n\nThe report, however, added that there was no consideration paid to show that it was reassigned.\n\nIn the period under review, said the report, total cash call liabilities as of December 2020 was $1.6 billion.\n\nThe agency stressed that the total cash call paid to JV operators was $3.6 billion.\n\nIt noted that the oil and gas sector contributions to export were N9.44 trillion, representing 75 per cent of total government export of N12.52 trillion.\n\nNEITI also said oil and gas contribution to government revenue was N4.7 trillion while total revenue was N9.3 trillion.",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nKayode Tokede\n\nAfrica\u2019s global bank, the United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc has announced its audited results for the full year ended December 31, 2021, reporting impressive performance in key financial metrics.\n\n\n\nThe 2021 financial result filed by the bank at the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) at the weekend, showed that gross earnings rose significantly to N660.2 billion, representing an increase of seven per cent, compared to N616.8 billion recorded at the end of the 2020 financial year.\n\n\n\nThe bank\u2019s total assets grew by 11 per cent to an unprecedented N8.5 trillion in the year under review, up from N7.7 trillion in 2020, thus making the first time the bank\u2019s assets would cross the N8 trillion mark.\n\n\n\nDespite the huge challenging business and slow economic recovery in most of its countries of operations, UBA\u2019s profit before tax was impressive with a 20.3 per cent growth to N153.1 billion, compared to N127.3 billion at the end of the 2020 financial year; while profit after tax grew by 8.7 per cent to N118.7 billion in 2021, compared to N109.2 billion recorded the previous year. Similarly, its net loans grew by 7.7 per cent to N2.8 trillion, whilst customer deposits rose by 12.2 per cent to N6.4 trillion, compared to N5.7 trillion in the corresponding period of 2020. This was a reflection of increased customer confidence, enhanced customer experience, successes from the ongoing business transformation programme and the deepening of the bank\u2019s retail banking franchise\n\n\n\nIn the year under consideration, the bank\u2019s operating income rose by 10 per cent to N443 billion compared to N403 billion in the prior year, whereas operating expenses closed the period at N279 billion. In its usual tradition of rewarding shareholders, the bank proposed a final dividend of 80 kobo for every ordinary share of 50 kobo for the financial year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n\n\nThe final dividend which is subject to the affirmation of the shareholders at its Annual General Meeting will bring the total dividend for the year to N1 as the Bank had paid an interim dividend of 20kobo earlier in the year.\n\nCommenting on the result, the Group Managing Director/CEO, Kennedy Uzoka, said notwithstanding the tight and challenging operating environment, UBA continues to deliver significant performance,\n\n\n\nHe added: \u201cThe year 2021 can best be described as a year of global recovery; economies around the world began to witness early-stage recoveries, as supply chains recover from the devastating disruptions suffered in 2020.\u201d\n\nConsequently, UBA recorded remarkable seven per cent growth in top line to N660 billion ($1.56bn), and profit before tax (PBT) of N153.1 billion, up 20.3 per cent from the prior year.\n\n\n\n\u201cNet Loans and advances grew by 7.7 per cent to N2.8 trillion with exposure mostly to resilient economic sectors including oil & gas, agriculture and manufacturing. Deposit from customers grew 12.2 per cent, crossing the N6 trillion mark, to N6.4 trillion.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe GMD explained that the quality of UBA\u2019s portfolio as well as the strength of its credit risk management frameworks and policies remained the bedrock of the positive results that the bank has been recording over the years, adding that the current performance highlights UBA\u2019s relentless customer focus, and leverage on its key strategic levers \u2013 people, process and technology.\n\n\n\n\u201cLooking forward, I am particularly excited about our ongoing Enterprise Transformation Program which is designed to enhance the bank\u2019s process agility, service delivery and customer experience.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are also making sizeable investments in cutting-edge technology and cyber security, to keep our innovative digital banking offerings above the curve, as we tool and re-tool our human resources to compete and win in a rapidly changing and evolving landscape.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis will ensure the bank continues to achieve respectable top and bottom-line growth through the medium to long term,\u201d the GMD stated.\n\n\n\nUBA\u2019s Group Chief Financial Official, Ugo Nwaghodoh, who corroborated the GMD\u2019s comments, said, once again, the bank has shown resilience. It achieved sizeable growth and strengthened its balance sheet despite the slow pace of economic recovery that characterised the year 2021.\n\n\n\n\u201cThrough active and diligent assets and liabilities management, the bank was able to protect its net interest margin and achieved a downward moderation of Cost of funds (CoF) by 70 basis points to 2.2 per cent from 2.9 per cent in the prior year.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the group\u2019s capital adequacy ratio at 24.9 per cent was well above the required regulatory minimum and reflects a strong capacity for business growth.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Group\u2019s non-performing loan ratio improved further to 3.6 per cent from 4.7 per cent at the end of 2020. This testifies to the quality of UBA\u2019s loan portfolio even as the bank remains relentless in its resolve to drive down the Cost-to-Income ratio, which stood at 63 per cent at the end of the year.\u201d\n\n\n\nNwaghodoh added that the bank achieved further strides in growing its business and gaining market share across its pan-African operations, with the region accounting for 63.2 per cent of the Group\u2019s profitability, compared to 55.4 per cent in 2020; Loans and advances as well as deposit in the region were also up 14.5 per cent and 27.3 per cent respectively from a year earlier.\n\n\n\nIn his concluding remarks, the CFO stated: \u201cWe recognise the changing competitive landscape and are proactively positioning to consistently deliver on our strategic objectives and commitment to shareholders.\u201d\n\n\n\nUnited Bank for Africa Plc is Africa\u2019s global bank, offering banking services to more than twenty-five million customers, across over 1,000 business offices and customer touch points in 20 African countries.\n\n\n\nWith a presence in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and France and more recently the United Arab Emirates, UBA is connecting people and businesses across Africa through retail; commercial and corporate banking; innovative cross-border payments and remittances; trade finance and ancillary banking services.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*President says party has capacity to resolve challenges\n\n*Declares when I\u2019m away, Osinbajo is in charge\n\n*Sani Bello is new caretaker chair, holds maiden meeting today\n\n*Abdulrazaq-led committee to announce zoning formula\n\n\n\nDeji Elumoye and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nIn what appears a major step to containing the crisis plaguing the leadership of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), President Muhammadu Buhari, has allegedly approved the removal of the Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, as the Chairman, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party and in his stead, appointed his Niger State counterpart, Abubakar Sani Bello.\n\n\n\nA faction of the APC governors was alleged to have complained bitterly to the president that Buni was not inclined to holding the convention as rescheduled, because there were no preparations on the ground to indicate so.\n\nApparently miffed by the what he was told, the president was said to have immediately directed that Buni be removed and replaced.\n\n\n\nBuni is currently in Dubai for medical reasons and was not around to defend himself. But the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami; the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha and another top Villa player, were said to have intervened on behalf of Buni, when they got wind of the development, and advised the president to exercise caution against such action.\n\n\n\nThey were said to have reminded Buhari it was only the NEC of the Party that could convene and remove Buni, and after he must have been given seven days notice of removal. They, however, contended that anything outside the laid down processes, could be challenged in court, with the potential of disrupting the rescheduled March 26 Convention date.\n\n\n\nIt was not certain, however, whether the intervention changed the President\u2019s mind. But some insiders, who spoke to THISDAY on the development this morning, expressed displeasure that some governors went to ambush the president just before he left the country without their knowledge and created a totally false narrative that Buni did not want to hold the convention.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are creating unnecessary crisis in the party, because of their selfish interests. How can they claim there are no preparations to hold the convention, when various convention sub-committees have been announced; the zonal committee is announcing the zoning formula on Monday (today).\n\n\n\n\u201cCommittees will be inaugurated in a few days. These people are not sincere. Some governors have been scheming to take over the functions of CECPC to further their own interests.\n\nThe immediate way out of this is; if Buni voluntarily resigns, which he had two weeks ago threatened to during the APC governors meeting in Abuja,\u201d they claimed.\n\n\n\nThese, nonetheless, the president, yesterday, assured party members before departing the country for his two weeks medical trip, that he would do everything to ensure the convention holds as scheduled on March 26.\n\nHe also took time to clear the air of misgivings about the structure of his government, when he said, constitutionally, his deputy, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, was always in charge, whenever he was away.\n\n\n\nThis is as the APC zoning committee, headed by the Kwara State Governor, Abdulrahaman Abdulrazaq, is expected to announce the zoning formula for the party\u2019 National Working Committee (NWC) today ahead of the national convention.\n\n\n\nAlso, a former governor of Nasarawa State and frontline aspirant for the All Progressives Congress (APC) national chairmanship, Senator Tanko Al-Makura, has denied working against the president\u2019s choice of consensus candidate, describing a report to that effect as mischievous and unkind.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to journalists before departing Abuja for London, the president, who told his party members not to forget how a relatively new APC beat the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at the polls in 2015, reiterated that, \u201ceverything would be done to ensure that the party holds the national convention as scheduled.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd in further allaying existential concerns, Buhari stated: \u201cWell, they (APC members) should wait and see. How did we come as a party to take power from the ruling party, who had been there before us for so many years? So, we have the capacity; everything will be alright,\u201d the president said.\n\n\n\nResponding to a question on whether or not there would be a vacuum in government with his two-week trip to the United Kingdom, he said he was not the only person working, and that his deputy, Osinbajo, was constitutionally empowered to take charge whenever he was away.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cWell, I cannot claim to be doing the work alone. The government is fully represented; the Vice President is there, constitutionally when I\u2019m away he\u2019s in charge. And the Secretary to the Government and then the Chief of Staff too. So, we have no problem.\u201d\n\n\n\nBuhari had since departed Abuja for London, the United Kingdom Kingdom, for routine medical checks that might last two weeks.\n\nThe President\u2019s official plane, Nigeria Air Force 1, took off Sunday morning from the Presidential wing of Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.\n\n\n\nBuhari was seen off at the airport by his Chief of Staff, Professor Ibrahim Gambari; Minister of State for the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Hajiya Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu; and the Director-General of Department of State Security (DSS), Yusuf Magaji Bichi; and the Deputy Inspector-General of Police (DIG), Sanusi Lemu, among other top government officials.\n\n\n\nThe president, who returned from Nairobi, Kenya, on Friday, after attending a three-day international summit of the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), was expected to be away for maximum of two weeks.\n\nHis Media Adviser, Femi Adesina, had last week, hinted that the routine medical check-up of the President in London would not exceed two weeks.\n\n\n\nHowever, on the alleged Buni\u2019s removal, a source, who confirmed the development, told THISDAY last night that, the president did not formerly hint at the news, when leaving the country, because as a process person, he wanted the decision to be tidied up without creating any more grievances, hence, the meeting to be held today at the National Secretariat of the party.\n\n\n\nReiterating that Buni was already gone and the decision long taken, the source held that the relieved caretaker chairman knew of the development hence his forced trip on health grounds, adding that the party needed to move on and desperately too.\n\n\n\nTo this end, Bello has summoned a meeting of the Caretaker Committee for today.\n\nThe meeting, THISDAY gathered, would take place at the national secretariat of the party by 10am and would be chaired by him (Bello) with members of the caretaker committee expected to be in attendance.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY further gathered that some APC governors including Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa, Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi, Simon Lalong of Plateau, Dr. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti and Bello met at the Niger governor\u2019s lodge yesterday in Asokoro, Abuja.\n\n\n\nThe meeting, it was learnt, was a continuation of the one held on Saturday in Abuja by the governors.\n\nA source, who pleaded anonymity, told THISDAY that it appeared that the Secretary of the committee, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, had gotten wind of the plan and was already planning to shutdown the secretariat tomorrow, however, against the instruction of the president.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe resolution is that the members of the CECPC will meet at the party secretariat on Monday by 10a.m. The meeting will be chaired by the Niger State governor, because Buni is out of town. But the secretary is planning to shut down the secretariat tomorrow,\u201d the source said.\n\n\n\nThe party source also informed THISDAY that though Bello had called a meeting of Caretaker committee members, he however foresee confusion.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will be confusion tomorrow. They may not have access to the venue of the meeting. They may be locked out, because there is a problem on ground.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Niger governor had called a meeting, but he has also been double crossed, because he won\u2019t have access to the venue of the meeting. So, it is likely that the meeting will not,\u201d he said.\n\nBut a former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Yekini Nabena, has warned Bello to stay away from a venture he clearly lacked the powers to undertake.\n\n\n\nNabena insisted that Bello lacked the power to call a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting without the authorisation of the Caretaker Committee Chairman and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni.\n\nNabena, in a statement last night, said Bello was just an ordinary member of the Caretaker Committee and not the Chairman or Secretary.\n\n\n\nHis words: \u201cI am using this medium to call on our leaders across the states to caution Governor Sani Bello of Niger State. The presidency should also call him to order to immediately drop the plan to convey a NEC meeting without the knowledge of Governor Mai Mala Buni and the Secretary of the CECPC.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe likes of Governor Bello are the political vultures working against our party and to cause anarchy in the ruling APC,\u201d stressing that the plot by Bello to destabilise the ruling party, has been on for a while because of his vice presidential ambition in 2023, hence his plan to convey a NEC meeting.\n\n\n\n\u201cGovernor Sani Bello is neither the Chairman nor Secretary of the National Caretaker Committee. So, where did he get the power to convey such meeting? Governor Bello should not destroy the ruling APC, because of his personal political ambition of becoming Vice President or whatever in 2023,\u201d he added.\n\nAbdulrazaq-led Committee to Announce Zoning Formula Today\n\n\n\nA member of the APC zoning committee, who pleaded to remain anonymous, has said all was set for the committee, headed by the Kwara State Governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, to announce the outcome of its meeting today.\n\nThe source told THISDAY that the committee concluded its work at the weekend, even as he denied knowledge of zoning the presidency to the South-west as reported in a national newspaper.\n\n\n\nProviding an insight into the work that was done by the committee, the source revealed that they agreed to zone the National Chairman to the north-central; the Deputy National Chairman (north) to the north-east; the Secretary to the south-west and Deputy National Chairman (south) to the south-east.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur report is ready and would be announced tomorrow (Monday). Our scope of work was for party offices and the result would be announced tomorrow. All the various committees would be inaugurated Monday and they need the announcement by the zoning committee to kick off the process,\u201d the source added.\n\n\n\nSpecifically responding to a question on a report that the committee had zoned the presidency ahead of the 2023 elections to the South-west, the source said, \u201cthere is nothing like that. What we are dealing with here are party offices.\u201d\n\nA statement by APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), John James Akpanudoedehe, had revealed that the CECPC Chairman and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, had approved the composition of the zoning committee.\n\nOther members of the committee included Deputy President of the Senate, Ovie Omo-Agege, who served as deputy chairman; Etim Nyong, M. B. Shehu, Mustapha Salihu, Teslim Folarin, Sadeeq Sule-Iko Sami as members while Deputy Governor of Anambra State, Nkem Okeke, served as the committee secretary.\n\nBuhari, last week, met with governors of the ruling APC at State House, Abuja, where he had expressed his preference for former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, as consensus candidate for the office of APC national chairman.\n\nAl-Makura Denies Opposing President over Chairmanship\n\n\n\nIn another development, Senator Tanko Al-Makura, in a statement yesterday by the Director-General of Al-Makura Campaign Organisation (ACO), Mr. Dominic Alancha, insisted that he could not have been opposed to a purported consensus chairmanship choice of Buhari, when neither the president nor the party leadership had made any public statement on the matter.\n\nThe APC chieftain, therefore, bemoaned the sensational headlines and reports by some national dailies, which claimed he was bent on opposing Buhari.\n\n\u201cSenator Al-Makura, as a bona fide aspirant for the position of the National Chairman of the APC was in Ondo to consult with Governor Rotimi Akeredolu in continuation of consultations with APC governors, party leaders and stakeholders, which he commenced many months back.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, mischievous and unkind for anybody to claim that he was working against President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s choice of a consensus candidate for the position of the National Chairman of our great party,\u201d he stated.\n\nAl-Makura said the media report was a deliberate, albeit failed attempt, to paint him in bad light.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis is even more so when neither the president, whom Senator Al-Makura holds in very high esteem, nor the party leadership, has made any statement to the effect of any endorsed consensus candidate.\n\n\u201cThese prophets of doom have continued to render false prophecies and tales on the forthcoming APC national convention. They are, therefore, looking for media houses they could latch on to ignite fire, hate, and confusion in the party.\u201d\n\nAl-Makura, however, expressed confidence in the president and the leadership of the party to pilot the party through a turbulence-free convention to the disappointment of the enemies of the APC, troublemakers, and naysayers.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "James Emejo in Abuja\n\n*Hails strides in maize, cassava production\n\nGovernor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, says agriculture remains a strong pillar and saving grace for the Nigerian economy. Emefiele said this at the weekend while addressing journalists during an inspection tour of a palm plantation at Odighi Village in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State.\n\n\n\nThe CBN governor expressed satisfaction with the level of interest shown in agriculture and the tremendous impact the sector had had in the last six years. He wondered how the country could have coped with the rising prices of food and commodity items across the world without the foresight to revamp agriculture.\n\n\n\nEmefiele said the central bank had assumed a pivotal role in agriculture since 2015, when President Muhammadu Buhari directed that \u201cwe produce what we eat and eat what we produce\u201d. The apex bank had come up with several initiatives aimed towards repositioning the sector with a view to creating employment opportunities as well as growing the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), he said.\n\n\n\nShortly after the assessment of farm, Emefiele attested to the giant strides already being recorded in the production of maize and cassava and expressed optimism that in the next 12 months, palm produce harvests would have commenced. He acknowledged the significant role played by Edo State Government, under the leadership of Governor Godwin Obaseki, who he said had matched words with action by making sure that arable land was made available to those genuinely interested in agriculture.\n\n\n\nHe appealed to other state governors to emulate Edo State, which had so far made available about 70 per cent of the promised arable land.\n\n\n\nOn the socio-economic impact of the CBN interventions, Emefiele mentioned the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP), among other interventions schemes, which revolutionised agricultural practice whereby smallholder farmers, who hitherto could not approach commercial banks for loans. He said the farmers were now being granted credit facilities in the form of inputs, like seedlings, fertiliser, and herbicides.\n\n\n\nHe said the smallholder farmers could now cultivate and produce enough for their families and sell produce for loan repayment with ease.\n\n\n\nEmefiele also commended the efforts of the promoting company, Agri-Allied Resources and Processing Limited and its parent company, Tolaram Limited, for heeding the clarion by the CBN to source their critical raw materials locally. He pointed out that the company had painstakingly embraced backward integration principle by acquiring farmland, measuring about 18,000 hectares, for the cultivation of oil palm, cassava, and maize \u2013 the critical raw materials used by the group.\n\n\n\nEarlier, Managing Director of Agri-Allaied Resources, Mr. Madhukar Khetan, said the company had so far accessed a 10-year loan in the sum of N15 billion at single-digit interest rate with two-year moratorium, under the Commercial Agricultural Credit Scheme (CACS), for the project.\n\nThe farm currently has a workforce of about 1,000.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Philip Shaibu, deputy governor of Edo, has asked the national leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to \u201cintegrate\u201d supporters of Godwin Obaseki, governor of the state, into the party.\n\nIn 2020, Obaseki, Shaibu and their supporters left the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the PDP following the feud between the governor and his erstwhile \u201cgodfather\u201d, Adams Oshiomhole, who was then APC national chairman.\n\nAfter Obaseki defected to the PDP, he clinched the party\u2019s governorship ticket and won the election.\n\nOver the past few months, there have been speculations that Obaseki and Shaibu may leave the PDP over the crisis in the Edo chapter of the party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReacting to the speculation, the Edo governor, over the weekend, said he will not leave the PDP, and asked members who are uncomfortable with his leadership of the party to leave.\n\nSpeaking on the issues in Edo PDP in an interview on Channels Television on Monday, Shaibu said Obaseki\u2019s supporters who left the APC for the PDP do not feel like they have been accepted into the party.\n\n\u201cFor me, Philip Shaibu, I have no plans to leave. For Philip Shaibu, his followers, and the followers of Obaseki that left APC to PDP, they plan to leave PDP but to where? For now, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy? Because we felt we are not accepted in PDP and that is the reason we are actually thinking that it is time to just draw the curtains and leave.\n\n\u201cWe left APC because of the oppression by APC national chairman meted on the governor. And for some of us that hated oppression, we decided to jettison our relationship with the godfather then to follow the governor to the PDP.\n\n\u201cWe have not been accepted into PDP and for us, we are not telling the governor it is either now or we leave.\n\n\u201cWe are in PDP now and expected that we will be integrated. When I say \u2018we\u2019, not just Philip Shaibu, I\u2019m talking about Anselm Ojezua (former Edo APC chairman) and the state working committee, the ward chairmen and the executives, the leaders of APC then and all the well-wishers that left APC because of Obaseki.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have been meeting and we have said we need to be integrated. Anselm Ojezua resigned his membership of chairman of the state; the ward chairmen resigned; other executives resigned to join PDP.\n\n\u201cAs I speak, they have not been integrated and we are talking about harmonisation; they have refused to harmonise. For some of us, that means we are not welcome in PDP.\n\n\u201cWe are not saying dismantle, drive everybody and accept us. We are saying create room for Anselm Ojezua and create room for x. Just like we have done in the appointment in government \u2014 we\u2019ve created space for the old PDP that we met. They are commissioners.\u201d\n\nAsked to mention the people who refused to integrate Obaseki\u2019s supporters, the deputy governor said the problem is from the national leadership of the party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf I want to mention names I will say the national. At the state level, we have harmonised. We have a harmonised list as we speak at the state \u2014 old PDD and the new PDP,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThat list needs to be ratified by the national and the national has not ratified that list and elections are coming. We need the national to come and resolve these issues and they have been moving the goalpost from one end to another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe problem is from the national. I will not want to blame it on the national chairman but I will also blame him because the issues are before him. Since he took over leadership, he has not deemed it fit to call for a meeting to resolve the Edo crisis.\u201d",

          "text": "Philip Shaibu, deputy governor of Edo, has asked the national leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to \u201cintegrate\u201d supporters of Godwin Obaseki, governor of the state, into the party.\n\nIn 2020, Obaseki, Shaibu and their supporters left the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the PDP following the feud between the governor and his erstwhile \u201cgodfather\u201d, Adams Oshiomhole, who was then APC national chairman.\n\nAfter Obaseki defected to the PDP, he clinched the party\u2019s governorship ticket and won the election.\n\nOver the past few months, there have been speculations that Obaseki and Shaibu may leave the PDP over the crisis in the Edo chapter of the party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReacting to the speculation, the Edo governor, over the weekend, said he will not leave the PDP, and asked members who are uncomfortable with his leadership of the party to leave.\n\nSpeaking on the issues in Edo PDP in an interview on Channels Television on Monday, Shaibu said Obaseki\u2019s supporters who left the APC for the PDP do not feel like they have been accepted into the party.\n\n\u201cFor me, Philip Shaibu, I have no plans to leave. For Philip Shaibu, his followers, and the followers of Obaseki that left APC to PDP, they plan to leave PDP but to where? For now, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy? Because we felt we are not accepted in PDP and that is the reason we are actually thinking that it is time to just draw the curtains and leave.\n\n\u201cWe left APC because of the oppression by APC national chairman meted on the governor. And for some of us that hated oppression, we decided to jettison our relationship with the godfather then to follow the governor to the PDP.\n\n\u201cWe have not been accepted into PDP and for us, we are not telling the governor it is either now or we leave.\n\n\u201cWe are in PDP now and expected that we will be integrated. When I say \u2018we\u2019, not just Philip Shaibu, I\u2019m talking about Anselm Ojezua (former Edo APC chairman) and the state working committee, the ward chairmen and the executives, the leaders of APC then and all the well-wishers that left APC because of Obaseki.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have been meeting and we have said we need to be integrated. Anselm Ojezua resigned his membership of chairman of the state; the ward chairmen resigned; other executives resigned to join PDP.\n\n\u201cAs I speak, they have not been integrated and we are talking about harmonisation; they have refused to harmonise. For some of us, that means we are not welcome in PDP.\n\n\u201cWe are not saying dismantle, drive everybody and accept us. We are saying create room for Anselm Ojezua and create room for x. Just like we have done in the appointment in government \u2014 we\u2019ve created space for the old PDP that we met. They are commissioners.\u201d\n\nAsked to mention the people who refused to integrate Obaseki\u2019s supporters, the deputy governor said the problem is from the national leadership of the party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf I want to mention names I will say the national. At the state level, we have harmonised. We have a harmonised list as we speak at the state \u2014 old PDD and the new PDP,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThat list needs to be ratified by the national and the national has not ratified that list and elections are coming. We need the national to come and resolve these issues and they have been moving the goalpost from one end to another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe problem is from the national. I will not want to blame it on the national chairman but I will also blame him because the issues are before him. Since he took over leadership, he has not deemed it fit to call for a meeting to resolve the Edo crisis.\u201d",

          "text": "After the Osun All Progressives Congress (APC) held its governorship primary last month, the baton was handed over to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the major opposition, to unveil the candidate who would run against Gboyega Otetola, the incumbent governor and APC flagbearer.\n\nSince Olagunsoye Oyinlola\u2019s reelection was nullified in November 2010 by a court of appeal ruling, the PDP has been pulling all the stops to regain control of the state.\n\nThe party\u2019s desire to retake Osun was evident in how the 2018 election was closely contested \u2014 the PDP candidate polled 254,698 votes while the APC flagbearer had 254,345, leaving just a gap of 353 votes \u2014 but the exercise was declared inconclusive and a rerun held in some LGAs, with the PDP eventually losing.\n\nThe PDP now has another shot at fighting for the state, and this time, six governorship aspirants, including an ex-senator and a former secretary to the state government, have been cleared to contest the guber ticket on Tuesday, March 8.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the opposition party is not without its own internal troubles, there\u2019s never been a better time for it to take advantage of the crisis rocking Osun APC.\n\nHere are some of the major contenders for the primary.\n\nAdemola Adeleke\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdemola Adeleke became a household name in 2017 when he succeeded Isiaka, his late brother, as senator representing Osun West. He was nicknamed \u201cdancing senator\u201d as soon as videos featuring him showing off his dancing skills started going viral.\n\n\u201cI was having fun during the campaign and enjoying my dance because my brother had done 70 percent of the job with his historical goodwill right from when he became an executive governor in 1991,\u201d he had said upon winning the senatorial seat.\n\nAdeleke is not a newcomer to the game. In 2018, he was the party\u2019s flagbearer, and in fact, one of the most popular candidates in the election. Perhaps due to his popularity, there have been rumours that he may yet be adopted as a consensus candidate.\n\nNo doubt, Adeleke stands as one of the strongest contenders and over the past few months, he has been trying to get the support of the party\u2019s stakeholders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe has also called for peaceful resolution of internal disagreements, adding that his ambition is not a do or die affair.\n\n\u201cMy ambition to govern Osun state is people-driven. We are not afraid to face the delegates at the primary and the people of Osun state at the general election,\u201d he had said.\n\nAt the 2018 PDP primary, Adeleke won by a close margin, securing 1569 votes while Akin Ogunbiyi, his closest contender, had 1562.\n\nHow many votes will the 62 years old politician be able to pull this time?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBamidele Adeleke\n\nWhat could have turned someone who, in 2018, was your leading strategist, into your rival in 2022? Only Bamidele and Adeleke, his uncle, can provide answers to this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDele, as he\u2019s fondly called, was one of those leading the campaign for his uncle in the 2018 election, but in 2022, he desires the prize for himself.\n\n\u201cIt is time for a generation of shift. It is time for those who are fit and able to deliver,\u201d Dele said in a recent interview, adding that he would not step down for his uncle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs expected, Dele\u2019s ambition has now led to a family feud as seen in recent exchanges between the politician and Davido, the superstar singer who is his cousin.\n\nThe pair fell out after Dele declared his interest to run for the election on the platform of the PDP.\n\n\u201cDele, I will stress you! We go meet for field,\u201d Davido had threatened his cousin.\n\nBut Dele, responding in a softer tone, explained to his kinsman that they could have different interests and still be a happy family.\n\n\u201cI respect your decision and choice to support Uncle Demola and that is the beauty of democracy. It is possible we can all make our individual choices without rancour and bitterness. We can all follow different paths and still live as one big, happy family,\u201d he had said.\n\nIt\u2019s barely 24 hours to the primary election, and spectators are wondering if the former banker and his uncle would attempt a compromise.\n\nAkin Ogunbiyi\n\nAkin Ogunbiyi has been a major player in Osun PDP for some time, in fact, he placed a very close second in the 2018 primary election of the party.\n\nThe businessman is here again, competing with familiar opponents.\n\nLike in 2018, rumours have been flying about the possibility of Ogunbiyi stepping down for Adeleke, but he continues to deny this.\n\nOgunbiyi\u2019s campaign organisation had said the rumours being spread around \u201conly indicates that Dr Ogunbiyi is the credible aspirant to beat in the forthcoming primaries\u201d.\n\nOgunbiyi had also denied seeking any compensatory position or working with anyone to destroy the party.\n\nAlthough his campaign group admitted there was an agreement in 2018, it added that the accord was not honoured by Adeleke\u2019s camp.\n\n\u201cFor the umpteenth time, we hereby affirm that there is no negotiation between the Dr Akin Ogunbiyi campaign organisation or sharing of positions with Senator Ademola Adeleke group. It is a sheer ineptitude to claim that Ogunbiyi group told Adeleke that they will destroy a party upon whose platform the business tycoon hopes to contest the governorship election,\u201d Ogunbiyi\u2019s camp had said.\n\nCan Ogunbiyi capitalise on the Adeleke family feud to take the coveted prize?\n\nFatai Akinbade\n\nFatai Akinbade has been around since 2010 when he first aspired to be governor of the state. While he got support from some stakeholders at the time, the party leadership seemed to be in favour of Iyiola Omisore.\n\nIn 2018, Akinbade who defected from the PDP was the African Democratic Congress (ADC) governorship candidate.\n\nAt the time, ex-governor Oyinlola had described Akinbade as the best man with the required experience for the job.\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned, Fatai Akinbade is the best among those currently vying for the governorship seat that can navigate the state out of its present logjam. I challenge anybody that says otherwise to give me a better candidate,\u201d Oyinlola had said.\n\nThe 67-year-old politician and a former SSG is giving it another shot. Will he still get the support of Oyinlola who now heads a reconciliation panel for the party in the state?",

          "title": "Togolese inventor builds $12,000 mini tractors for the West African market",
          "text": "First, he received awards for inventing the \u201cFoufoumix\u201d, which brings relief from hours spent pounding foufou. Then, Minsob Logou invented a mini-tractor, tailor-made for local conditions. Now, he wants to sell it across the region.\n\nThis article was contributed to TechCabal by Blame Ekoue of bird story agency.\n\nSeeing imported agricultural machinery \u2013 often paid for by government or donors \u2013 lying discarded due to the unavailability of local servicing or parts was enough for Minsob Logou to invest his time, money, and energy into a local solution for farmers. The result: the Logoutrac mini-tractor. It\u2019s a step out of the kitchen and into the field for this award-winning Togolese inventor.\n\nBetter known in Togo and the region as the \u201cfather of Foufoumix\u201d Logou requires little introduction to those who keep an eye on the world of African invention. As early as 2002, Logou was honoured for his work by the World Intellectual Property Organisation and in 2014, he placed second at the African Innovation Awards. His desire to invent is deep-seated.\n\n\u201cThe story started from a passion that I had from an early age for all things related to technology. Since the benches of the school, I had this thing in me for all that is technological. I have to try to see how they were designed, how we arrive at what we design can respond to a given functionality. This is what gave me all this knowledge today, which far exceeds what I learned on the benches,\u201d Logou explained.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBorn into a large family, his position as an engineer at Togo Telecom, though coveted, was not enough to stop the inventor from resigning to devote himself to finding solutions full time. His first big win came with an invention that allows cooks at home and in restaurants to replace hours of strenuous work \u2013 the Foufoumix. The industrial-looking kitchen unit has been a hit in West Africa to such an extent that knock-offs are now produced in China. Logou tries to provide local solutions to local problems.\n\n\u201cThe basis of my research to be able to create a product is the observation of my community. When I see that they are in need of something, I can create machinery to make it easier for them to obtain a result in order to improve performance and make their lives better,\u201d he said.\n\nThat was the thinking behind his latest invention, launched recently at his small factory located on the outskirts of the Togolese capital, Lom\u00e9. Logou describes his mini-tractor \u2013 which sports the \u201cLogoutrac\u201d brand \u2013 as a \u2018made-in-Togo mini-tractor, a versatile, powerful, and resilient machine\u2019.\n\nThe prototype for the tractor, which retails for the local equivalent of $12,000, was built using salvaged parts, with the idea that doing so would help buyers easily access spare parts. But due to high initial demand, the young Togolese engineer quickly took the next step.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stay in recovery or recycling anymore and I am now manufacturing some of the spare parts of this machinery myself,\u201d he explained.\n\nLogou said that the initial idea for the mini-tractor came from his frustration at seeing the vast amounts of money that are used to purchase foreign agricultural machinery, only for it to be abandoned because spare parts are too difficult to too expensive to purchase locally.\n\n\u201cThe solutions that we import from elsewhere, most of the time, fail to meet our needs. So we end up with problems in agricultural mechanisation. Big tractors don\u2019t last long in the field before they break down. And when they stall, first, the expertise to detect the breakdown is a problem and the same spare part must be ordered from the parent company, which is quite complicated,\u201d he lamented.\n\nThe $12,000-mini tractors built by Minsob Logou. Image credit: bird story agency.\n\nSelling at 7 million FCFA (the equivalent of around $12,000), the mini-tractors are built for a regional market as well as a local one. That is why Lougou is looking carefully at the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) to which Togo is a signatory \u2013 and which should help him sell his inventions across Africa. Currently, there are trade barriers in place which prevent significant exports.\n\n\u201cPeople are showing interest but so far, there has been no international export. We should do it but the problem is free trade between African countries,\u201d fumed Logou.\n\nCurrently, Logoutrac equipment is sold by agricultural groups and the Togolese Ministry of Agriculture. A lower-cost option is already in the works.\n\n\u201cSince the cost is not within the reach of all farmers, we are working on a tiller for those who cannot afford it,\u201d Lougou explained.\n\nLogou\u2019s other pet project is finding solutions to a far wider problem: counterfeiting. While counterfeiting is estimated at 10% worldwide, it reaches 30 to 80% of products sold in Africa, depending on the sector. He has good reason to want to bring an end to counterfeits, especially of his Foufoumix product.\n\n\u201cThere are Chinese choppers that our compatriots import to sell and announce that it is foufoumix, but the latter is a registered trademark which has a patent\u2026 Having had trials in this direction, the conclusion that I have drawn is that our justices in West Africa are not strong enough in the field of intellectual property. There is still a lot to be done,\u201d he says, adding that he has brought counterfeiters to justice but nothing has come out of it.\n\nTo deal with this problem, he prefers to focus instead on the quality of his products.\n\n\u201cThe struggle is to have quality products,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Jimi Daodu has always been entrepreneurial. Back at Babcock University, he had established an entertainment business that organised parties in the school. After Daodu completed his master\u2019s programme in Advanced Computing at the University of Bristol, he wanted to stay back in the UK for a couple of years to work and earn back his master\u2019s fees. At the time, Daodu recalled, the British government allowed international students to apply for a post-work-study visa, which grants one a two-year stay in the UK. Daodu got the post-work-study visa, but things started to look grim when, for months, he couldn\u2019t get a job. Frustrated from his job search, Daodu contemplated booking a return ticket to Nigeria and returning to his shoe selling business.\n\nHe eventually got a job that sustained him until he got yet another which secured a visa for him and got him to stay. In the past decade, Daodu has worked in project management, hospitality, financial services, and the telecommunications industries all in the UK.\n\nDaodu was born in Lagos, Nigeria, and lived most of his years in the bustling city. He had studied Computer Science at Babcock University before going to the UK for a master\u2019s degree in Advanced Computing at the University of Bristol.\n\nIn 2017, Daodu got into the crypto space, Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin (BTC) were buzzy, so, he bought a couple. He then stumbled on virtual lands and saw them as an opportunity to diversify his digital assets and, as a Nigerian accustomed to the notion that land is the best investment, he bought some, even though he knew nothing about virtual lands. He got 8 plots of land in virtual spaces: 2 plots in Decentraland and 6 in Somnium Space for $200 each.\n\nThe idea for what would become a blockchain-based metaverse company, Vault Hill, started to form last February when he got an email stating that there was an offer on his land. He accepted the offer and sold a plot of land in Somnium Space for $10,000. He was stunned because he hadn\u2019t gotten such a high return from the stocks and shares he had purchased.\n\nHe realised that the only reason the buyer paid that much was because of the value associated with the virtual land, so, he realised that there was a market there. When he shared his idea with his friends, they said, \u201dJimi, you have come with your ideas again!\u201d But Daodu assured them: \u201cThis is the one.\u201d\n\nFounder and CEO of Vault Hill, Jimi Daodu\n\nIn May 2021, Daodu started bootstrapping Vault Hill by selling a few investments as well as plots of land in Somnium Space, for amounts ranging from $9,000 to $12,000. To differentiate itself from other virtual spaces and metaverse, Vault Hill City (Vault Hill\u2019s Metaverse) has four different islands and each island has 7 human-themed districts: Play, Romance, Curiosity, Community, Idealism, Vitality, and Imagination. \u201cEach district is human-themed to ensure the metaverse is open to everybody. This space is infinite; it is hard to choose a target audience, so we want to build an ecosystem where anyone can come in.\u201d Currently, the cost of a plot of land in a district in Vault Hill City range between $2,000 and $2,600.\n\nDaodu describing a metaverse, said, \u201cMetaverse is a shared virtual space. It\u2019s like Twitter, but in a gamified perspective\u2014the use of augmented reality and virtual reality. In a metaverse, you have to create a digital representation of yourself called an avatar, which allows you to navigate the digital world since you can\u2019t go into the digital world with your physical body.\u201d Daodu\u2019s definition of a metaverse involves a connection to the blockchain, decentralised finance, and freedom from control by the government, or even private individuals.\n\nIt is in respect to this vision that Vault Hill is building through 3 phases and at the end of the third phase, Vault Hill is handed over to a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO)\u2014the community of token and landowners\u2014which will be responsible for decision making on its metaverse.\n\nVault Hill is building a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace to allow NFT artists to list their art on the metaverse and display it to potential buyers through a gamified experience. Vault Hill is also encouraging companies to build edifices in their metaverse. The two plots of land Daodu bought on Decentraland were merged together to build Vault Hill\u2019s sales office.\n\nVault Hill is also partnering with Ready Player Me to build out avatars and incorporate digital wearables and limited-edition accessories. It is also partnering with Nigerian brands including Crivel Watches and Looks Like a Good Man for corporate and traditional wear. \u201cAdditionally, we are currently working to have interoperability of avatars. That is, using one avatar across multiple metaverses instead of having to create one for Vault Hill, and another for Decentraland,\u201d Vault Hill said. Vault Hill Part is also partnering with Lingua54 to use machine learning to translate the speeches of avatars across different languages in real time.\n\nAs funding was a constant headache for the team, Vault Hills started talking to traditional venture capitalists to raise funds, but a lot of them didn\u2019t understand what they were building. A senior colleague, at the time, had said \u201cIf you\u2019re talking to VCs, and they don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re building, you\u2019re doing something right.\u201d\n\nTo meet its funding needs, Vault Hill created a token called VHC token\u2014which is currently going for $0.003697 on Coin Market Cap, as of the time of writing. With it, Vault Hill raised $2.1 million in pre-pre-seed and private equity rounds, selling 25% of its total supply of tokens of 340 million. The majority of the fund will go into product development and hiring, Daodu said.\n\nMajority holders of the VHC token or majority landowners in the Vault Hill City will have voting power in the DAO. The VHC token will serve as a medium of a transaction within the metaverse, give majority token holders voting power in Vault Hill\u2019s proposed DAO and reward content creators when they get to sell or get traction for their artworks and content.\n\nDaodu speaks about the challenges of building a metaverse company: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a book on how to build a metaverse, so there isn\u2019t anything like what a good one looks like.\u201d But one challenge stands out: getting talent. \u201cYou need a host of developers\u2014extended reality developers, a mix of augmented and virtual reality developers, blockchain developers, full-stack developers, etc, but because it is an emerging technology and these skills are not taught in most traditional schools yet, they can be difficult to find.\u201d\n\nBut Daodu is optimistic, especially about the increase in VR adoption in recent years, which he said is both the cost and effect of the cost of the tech. \u201cAs adoption grows, the cost of technology always drops. The Oculus quest is retailing for $300, would that get to $50- $100 at some point in time? Absolutely. People are already spending $1,000 on an iPhone every year.\u201d\n\nDaodu noted that Vault Hill is not building an escapism platform, but intentionally thinking about how humans do things in the real world and then creating a way to augment it virtually\u2014with an ultimate aim of fostering human interaction. For example, in its Vitality district, it will collaborate with physiotherapists to help people with mental health challenges and create an augmented reality (AR) consultation service for London Bridge sports medicine, which will allow patients that can\u2019t come in physically for consultation in the hospital to get consultation services through augmented reality.\n\nThe first glance of Vault Hill City will be up by Q2 2022 and by the end of the year, it will be fully running. \u201cUsers will be able to design their own unique experiences, explore their fantasies, and also enjoy activities they do in the physical world such as interacting with other users, attending events, playing games, curating arts, exercising, host shows, visiting a library, build a music studio, and so much more,\u201d Vault Hill said. \u201cUsers will be able to access the metaverse using a virtual reality headset for a fully immersive experience. But they will also be able to explore the metaverse through laptops.\u201d\n\n\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Two years and 3 million rides later, can SafeBoda keep its lead in Nigeria?",
          "text": "On Wednesday, Ibadan-based Ugandan bike hailing startup SafeBoda clocked two years of operating in the Nigerian market.\n\nSafeBoda launched in Nigeria in December 2019 but started operations in January 2020. The startup had initially set to launch in May 2019 but months of deliberations\u2014including that of the best city market entry\u2014delayed its launch.\n\nThen, finally, in a surprising move which immediately created an outlier reputation for the company, SafeBoda skipped Lagos, the Nigerian commercial hub, to launch in Ibadan, a decision that continues to pay off\u2014especially considering that the Lagos government shutdown bike hailing businesses a month after it launched.\n\nSafeBoda\u2019s growth since its launch has been groundbreaking. In June 2020, about 6 months after its operation started, it reached a milestone of 100,000 rides. Also, in August 2020, it grew 150% and recorded 250,000 rides. And by the end of the year, while it was pausing its Kenyan operation, it celebrated half a million rides in Nigeria.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHowever, its defining growth started when in April 2021, the startup reached the 1 million rides milestone; that\u2019s a 150% growth in a month. Prior to that, it had done the same rate quarterly, and since then to date, it\u2019s been bumping up the numbers.\n\nAs anyone would expect, an increase in the number of rides must have been the result of an increase in other proportional metrics. By June 2021, 100,000 passengers had signed up on the platform, and 3 months after that, its 8,000th rider was onboarded. And in November it was doing 20,000 rides daily.\n\nFast forward to today, SafeBoda claims to have recorded over 3 million rides, more than 10,000 riders, over 100,000 users, and completed 50,000 deliveries.\n\nThe startup currently offers 3 services in Nigeria: rides, deliveries, and airtime purchase. The payment vertical which has already launched in Uganda, will launch in Nigeria soon.\n\nThe end and the beginning of an era\n\nSafeBoda is endearing to people for many reasons. One of them is its first Nigeria Country Director Babajide Duroshola, who led the startup from launching till June last year when he exited for another East African startup that had just expanded into Nigeria.\n\nSafeBoda Nigeria\u2019s new Country Director Olaoluwa Arokoyu\n\nChanging leadership always comes with challenges and SafeBoda faced its fair share. But it quickly made an internal replacement when it appointed its Head of Operation Olaoluwa Arokoyu as Country Director. Arokoyu had previously worked in operations with Opay and Jumia and joined SafeBoda 5 months prior to Duroshola\u2019s exit.\n\nEver since his appointment, the company said that Arokoyu has achieved some laudable milestones including taking the company from 1.5 million rides to over 3 million rides, optimising the app for address verification during the onboarding process to reduce fraudulent activities, and improving how riders are being paid to increase brand loyalty among riders.\n\nCreating a better experience for all\n\nSafeBoda says it\u2019s as compassionate with its riders the same way it is with passengers. It says in a statement that it\u2019s constantly looking for a better way to increase the earning power of its riders while giving passengers a good experience. \u201cAs a result of this increased earning power, SafeBoda riders and their families have access to a more quality lifestyle.\u201d\n\n\u201cSafeBoda\u2019s primary mission is to provide a better standard of living for drivers and customers. Everything we do is aligned with this goal,\u201d Arokoyu told TechCabal.\n\nSafeBoda\u2019s riders in Ibadan\n\nFor SafeBoda riders like Ghazali Saheed, who\u2019s the 5964th rider that joined the bike-hailing startup, the best thing about SafeBoda is the respect they [the riders] get from customers that other riders don\u2019t get. \u201cSafeBoda also makes it easy to set targets and reach them. It\u2019s easy for us to know where to get a lot of orders so that we can easily reach our targets,\u201d he said.\n\nLike many bike-hailing startups, SafeBoda is also destigmatising bike [okada] riding in Ibadan and Nigeria as a whole. The way it looks, it\u2019s like these bike-hailing companies are formalising a sector that\u2019s been informal for a long time.\n\n\u201cThe okada or boda business isn\u2019t categorised to be prestigious within African communities. But with a touch of orange, the story is different. SafeBoda riders are highly regarded and respected, not just because of the colour but because of their conduct,\u201d said Clement Obaro, Growth Manager at SafeBoda.\n\nCompetition is stronger than ever\n\nDue to SafeBoda\u2019s success in Ibadan, it has become apparent that the city is the new juicy spot for the bike-hailing market and, as a result of that, it has also become a battleground. Everybody wants a piece of the pie. Uber last month launched its bike-hailing arm in Ibadan and joined the host of others like MaxNG, ORide, and Gokada to snag more market share from SafeBoda.\n\n\u201cWe have been expecting this to happen and now that it has, we are not worried. Our focus is to keep giving the best experience to our customers and keeping our riders happy and willing to complete more rides daily,\u201d said Arokoyu. \u201cThe sky is wide enough for all birds to fly; healthy competition is always good for business.\u201d\n\nSafeBoda is one of the most active bike-hailing companies in sub-Saharan Africa as it holds more than 80% market share in Uganda and Nigeria. Uber and Bolt had first launched their bike-hailing product in Uganda but couldn\u2019t beat SafeBoda.\n\nIf combining the popularity and capital war chest of Uber and Bolt, the two most powerful mobility startups in the world, couldn\u2019t beat SafeBoda in Uganda, there\u2019s no saying that only Uber can pull it off in Nigeria. But it\u2019s a different market, however, with the level of loyalty SafeBoda has built among riders and customers, it won\u2019t be an easy call to dominate over it in Ibadan.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Facebook content moderators in Kenya will receive a 30-50% pay rise. This announcement comes two weeks after an investigation report by TIME revealed that content moderators in Nairobi were subject to poor pay and working conditions by Sama, a company responsible for Facebook\u2019s sub-Saharan Africa content moderation since 2019.\n\nEvery content moderator will receive an extra 20,000 Kenyan shillings ($176) per month, Sama told employees in a meeting on Tuesday, sources revealed to TIME.\n\n\u201cThe raise means that the lowest-paid Facebook content moderators at Sama will now take home around 50,000 Kenyan shillings ($439) each month after-tax, or around $2.20 per hour for a 9-hour working day. This is up from around $1.50 per hour previously.\u201d\n\nAll content moderators were also promised yearly bonuses worth one month of their salary, as an incentive to remain at the company, according to the sources.\n\nDespite the obvious correlation, Habel Kamau, a human resources director at Sama\u2019s Nairobi office, said that the salary increase wasn\u2019t a result of the release of the investigation by TIME. He claimed that the conversations about a salary increase had been ongoing for a while now, adding that the pay raise was made possible due to budget cuts from other places and not as a result of Sama receiving additional money from Facebook.\n\nAlthough the pay raise is welcomed by many of the content moderators, some still say it\u2019s not enough. Sama employees remain some of Facebook\u2019s lowest-paid workers anywhere in the world. While the lowest starting salary of a Facebook content moderator at Sama is $2.20 per hour, outsourced content moderators for Facebook in the U.S. are paid a typical starting salary of $18 per hour.\n\nSouth African Daniel Motaung, a former employee of Sama who was fired after trying to lead a union, noted that in 2019 employees had requested for their pay to be doubled. \u201cThis increase will make a difference but it won\u2019t change their lives,\u201d Motaung said in the statement. \u201cThey still won\u2019t be able to buy a house or feed their families in line with the \u2018lifting the poor out of poverty\u2019 narrative that Sama continuously boasts about.\u201d\n\nSama didn\u2019t comment on allegations that its managers suppressed a unionization effort in 2019, which led to Motaung losing his Job. Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company also declined to comment on the announcement of the pay raise.\n\nThe announcement of the pay raise is seen as a win for the content moderators and validation of the power in employees speaking up.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week was business as usual on the African tech funding scene, with Kenya-based fintech, M-KOPA announcing the largest raise of the week \u2013 $75 million. But it wasn\u2019t all a bed of roses; San Francisco-based digital bank for startups, Mercury, blocked the accounts of some African startups linked to it.\n\nElsewhere, the barrage of sanctions and restrictions \u2013 cough cough cancel culture \u2013 continued against Russia as the Ukraine-Russia tensions enter its third week on March 10, 2022. If you ask me, all of that changes nothing. But then, nobody asked me.\n\nMeanwhile, here\u2019s what we are discussing today:\n\nTech Hive Advisory\u2019s State of Tech Policy in Nigeria 2022 report, and\n\nThe clause you\u2019ve not been paying attention to in your employee contract\n\nA snail-paced legislature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve followed the Nigeria tech scene for long enough, you\u2019d have noticed one fact: policies and regulations are often received with varying reactions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSometimes, these reactions are pretty negative, as we saw when the Lagos State government banned Okadas or when the Central Bank of Nigeria ordered banks to close accounts of people trading in cryptocurrencies and stop facilitating such transactions.\n\nHowever, some of these policies have created some ripple effects like this and this.\n\nIn 2021, we also saw microblogging platform, Twitter banned, ushering in a VPN-filled period and speculation on whether the heavily criticised Social Media Bill would get reintroduced. Although the ban was eventually lifted, as a Twitter poll conducted by Techpoint Africa suggests, Nigerians consider a similar occurrence highly likely.\n\nSometimes, these policies receive flack where there might be no need, as we saw with CBN\u2019s new licensing requirements for Payment Service Providers in May 2021.\n\nOne thing is sure; there\u2019s quite a lot to unpack in the governance and policy aisle of the Nigeria tech scene.\n\nLast week, technology policy and advisory and research firm, Tech Hive Advisory, in partnership with Ikigai innovation Initiative, a tech policy-focused NGO, released the State of Tech Policy in Nigeria 2022.\n\nThe report covers events from the first quarter of 2020 to the fourth quarter of 2021, focusing on cybersecurity, data protection, consumer protection, among others, including predictions, recommendations, and stakeholder insights.\n\nInterestingly, the report reveals that about 54% of bills mentioned are yet to pass the First Reading before the legislature, a testament to the notoriously slow legislative process of the National Assembly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor context, the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation was released in 2019, and a Data Protection Bill was proposed in 2020. Nothing much has been heard since a stakeholder session held in September 2020.\n\nAlthough an argument could be made that good laws require meticulous attention to detail, the delay the process causes might not always be a good trade-off.\n\nDid you read your employee contract?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know that signing job contracts \u2013 or any agreement, really \u2013 where the dispute resolution clause only creates room for arbitration is a bad idea? Well, it is; you might want to look at the agreements you signed for your current job. This is not a drill!\n\nUnfortunately, if you\u2019ve already put pen to paper and signed on the dotted line \u2013 well, we all sign these days virtually \u2013 then there might not be so much hope for you. But don\u2019t take my word for it; please, consult a lawyer.\n\nThis and many more were some of the nuggets dropped during Techpoint\u2019s Twitter Spaces, titled, \u201cOptimising for employee safety in the era of remote work\u201d, held on Friday, March 4, 2022.\n\nWe had talent acquisition expert, Samuel Akinlotan; Founder, Vazi Legal, Modupe Odele; Cowrywise Lead, People and Culture, Emmanuel Faith; and Tech and Startup Lawyer, Zikora Okwor-Wewan, lead an insightful discussion on the different aspects of employee safety.\n\nIf you couldn\u2019t attend, we have recordings \u2013 thanks to Internet connectivity issues \u2013 of the discussion here and here.\n\nYou can also watch out for future Twitter Spaces in the coming weeks.

          "title": "ASUU Industrial Action and Public Education In Nigeria \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nStrike or Industrial Action, in whatever perspective it is defined, foretells the existence of a depressing relationship between and among employers, employees and the beneficiaries of whatever utility, goods or service designed to be provided or delivered.\n\nTherefore, Industrial action is basically an open display of dissatisfaction by employees against bad and discouraging inhuman working conditions that is capable of depriving workers of any form of motivation, encouragement and hope. It could also be as a result of slave-like labour that is oppressive in every nature.\n\nThis however, is one of the reasons while International Labour Organisation (ILO) recognises strikes as a major instrument that guarantees and advances the rights to collective bargaining across the globe.\n\nIn the case of the prevailing circumstances in Nigeria today, public Education and the health sector have become major casualties essentially difficult to remedy in the context of the above definition and progressive negotiation. This, no doubt is why brain drain, low productivity and incessant strikes have become very pervasive across major sectors of the country, ranging from education, health, petroleum sector, and many more.\n\nTo check these unwarranted anomalies in the area of massive brain drain for example, and the desire to produce universally competent graduates as well as effectively tackle the need for efficient and global standard workforce across Nigeria, ASUU and many other critical stakeholders have intermittently and consistently challenged the Nigerian government to continue to provide the necessary funds, prioritise infrastructure and competent policies, not just in the Education sector alone, but also in the health and all other aspect of national life.\n\nTo this very end, the economic well being of Nigeria, the plight and dissatisfaction of the human populace, particularly the students and family members shouldering the responsibility for payment of tuition and other financial commitments, have continued to suffer as long as the impasse has remained incessant. This has therefore left many to continue to crave for greener alternatives outside the shores of this country.\n\nIn the last few years for example, thousands of qualified Academic and Health personnel have transited our borders to better their economic needs and the potentials of their immediate family. And the number is still scaling up the graph.\n\nThe inconsistent infliction emanating in this regard and the regular industrial disagreement over the years, have continued to dispirit critical stakeholders and the hopes of service providers and the dynamic workforce, such as lecturers, doctors, nurses and other professionals. It has also greatly affected the trust and commitment by both genuine and potential investors in the Nigerian system.\n\nIt is imperative therefore, to emphasise that the prevailing strike situation in Nigeria today, will certainly not motivate any student or family for instance, so long as the system tends to ingeniously stagnates intellectual ambition, liquidate economic vibrancy and other critical and legitimate derivable objectives; due to regular disregard to resolutions, persistent disagreements and lack of provision of basic and adequate resources to enhance collective well being of the people and their global rating?\n\nTo reconcile these entanglements, ASUU has stoutly demanded the revitalisation of university education, discontinuance of Integrated Personnel Payroll Information System (IPPIS), as the payment system in the universities and the payment of promotion and salary arrears, particularly as it affects Education.\n\nThey have also consistently accused the FG of non-seriousness as well as insisting that the government is trivialising such an essential challenge as public education. ASUU has further blamed the Federal Government of levity in handing education, rather than entrenching policy system that can prioritise all critical sectors in the country. They implied that the major areas of disagreement, which is IPPIS, can appropriately be replaced with the University Transparency and Accountability System (UTAS), in addition to adequate funding of the sector.\n\nReiterating these demands, the Minister of Labour, Dr. Chris Ngige recounted that the 2020 December Agreement with ASUU is rightly on course in terms of implementation. He emphasised that the Federal Government had so far paid over N92 billion as Earned Allowances and revitalisation fees to federal-owned universities across the country.\n\nAccording to Ngige, N30 billion was also budgeted and paid for revitalization late last year. He added that N22.127 billion was agreed also in that December agreement, to be paid from the supplementary budget as Earned Allowances for 2021. In his words, the implementation of the agreement is on course.\n\nOn the controversial issue of introducing the University Transparency and Accountability Solution payment platform as preferred by ASUU instead of government\u2019s Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System, the minister held that the matter would be revisited and therefore presented a new proposal towards permanent resolution of the ASUU industrial impasse.\n\nLooking through the positions of both ASUU and the Federal Government, they appeared determined and positive towards the betterment of the Education system and resolving the present challenge in the country. Going by this positivism, the stakeholders must be mutually respectful and be strategically disposed not just because of win-win compromise, but for the sake of our students and the Nigerian society.\n\nGood Education system anywhere in the world is a knowledge fountain. It can help to engage the active youths and take many out of the idle predicament. Education can help to sequentially build society far more than anyone can imagine. The roads, bridges, technology, interpersonal relations, science researches and methods of achieving designed objectives are all derivable from a well co-ordinated knowledge driven education system. In the case of Nigeria we are always overwhelmed by lack of funds and lack of motivation as a result of rambling education and a pitiful policy system.\n\nOur education system now seems to be solely theorised, practically disjointed and academic calendars unjustly elongated with no deliberate strategic policy for training experts who can evolve the science, technology and manufacturing industry.\n\nIt is therefore pitiable that Nigeria with about 43 Federal and 48 States\u2019 universities, still struggle to survive with borrowed technologies. This is pathetic to the extent that we cannot even think of Engineering faculties and other related departments and their professors for example, providing home-grown serviceable energy in terms of solar power and accessories in their faculties, manufacture global standard machines or provide much needed water resources or technology to energise their departments. This is bad enough and it needs to change.\n\nWhile the Government on its part must start to lay broad policy guidelines that can consistently enhance education and improve industrial relations, it must also engage policy experts, supervisors and implementers to guarantee mutual trust, confidence and universal harmonious relationship. The unions on their part must exercise some understanding, just as they must effectively control the activities of the militant few who occasionally stampede members into industrial actions even when the employer is genuinely anxious to reach a collective advantage.\n\nThe government as a matter of importance, must learn to honour, implement and keep to the terms of agreements as collectively resolved. Government should always promptly review, negotiate and implement collective agreements in line with international consensus concerning improvements in general working conditions, rights to freedom and collective bargaining.\n\nOnly in this respect shall the reality of collective bargaining truly manifest as the viable and practical means of ensuring harmonious peace in the Country.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

I respectfully urge you, your royal majesty to take this on too as a major task because, just as it has been mentioned, our country depends a great deal on oil production,\u201d he pleaded.\n\nOsinbajo emphasized that, the nation\u2019s desire was to see that security challenges in Delta State were brought to an end in most of the oil-producing communities.\n\n\u201cWe recognize, especially with security that very few administrations had been confronted with this plethora of security challenges that we have been confronted with.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the share number and range of those security challenges, it\u2019s evident that it is necessary to have a leader such as Muhammadu Buhari to be able to take on those challenges, but the role of traditional rulership is critical, absolutely critical now,\u201d he added.\n\nAt the palace of the Ovie of Uvwie Kingdom, Osinbajo lauded the monarch for his role in sustaining the peace in Uvwie kingdom.\n\nHe reiterated that in view of the fact that traditional rulers were more in touch with the grassroots, there was the need for the National Assembly to incorporate and apportion them constitutional roles.\n\nHe prayed that with the level of politics gathering momentum, the National Assembly would be able to finish its constitutional duty and amend the constitution as expected.\n\nEarlier in a welcome address, the Ovie of Uvwie Kingdom had expressed surprise that despite their presentations to the National Assembly, the Committee on Constitutional Review paid no attention to the need for a constitutional role for traditional rulers.\n\nHe appealed to the executive to intervene and commended the Federal Government for the continuous support for the traditional institutions.\n\nAlso responding in his palace earlier, the Olu of Warri, Ogiame Atuwatse 111 commended the Federal Government for all its efforts in repositioning the country.\n\nHe pledged the support of the traditional institutions in supporting the government towards returning peace to the country.\n\nThe royal father particularly commended the Vice President for the supportive roles to the President adding \u201d thank you for the good works you have been doing, supporting Mr. President and putting Nigeria first.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Delta State governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, who was represented by his deputy, Otuaro, harped on the need for a constitutional role for traditional rulers.\n\nHe assured that the state administration would leave good legacies behind at the expiration of the tenure in 2023, just as he commended the Olu of Warri for his fatherly support to the administration in the state.\n\nThe Vice President was in Delta State for the Thanksgiving ceremony of late Chief Patrick Ideh, aged 95, a nationalist lawyer since 1961.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

I will not decamp from the PDP; we will always win any election. PDP won in the last election and we will continue to win all elections in the state and country; nothing will stop us as a party,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor noted that the forthcoming local government election in the state will set the template for next year\u2019s national and legislative elections, urging party members to reflect on the elections and work in unity to ensure victory in the polls.\n\nHe noted, \u201cThere is no division in Edo PDP. Let the party be open to accommodate others. PDP is democratic. The hallmark of democracy is ensuring that the majority has their way, as the minority can\u2019t dictate to the people.\n\n\u201cI heard that Chief Dan Orbih went around, saying there is no harmonization in Edo PDP. This is really irresponsible to say and an insult to members of the party, as the party has truly harmonised in the state.\n\n\u201cPDP in Edo State is harmonised because before we made any appointments in any ward, we made sure the party at that level was harmonised. We are gathered here now as election timetable is out; harmonisation has been done, appointments made and we are ready to win any election before us.\u201d\n\nObaseki disclosed that the PDP National Chairman Iyorchia Ayu will visit the state on Thursday 10th of March 2022, urging party leaders to bring along five percent of newly registered members to welcome the party chair.\n\n\u201cPolitics is not about fighting but dialogue and discussion. I urge us to collaborate and unite to move the party and state forward,\u201d he charged.\n\nNoting that over 539,000 members have been registered in the ongoing e-registration exercise, Obaseki said, \u201cThese numbers are not fabricated as we have the data, pictures, emails and phone numbers of members of the party we have registered so far. You have broken records as this is the bastion of PDP in Nigeria. We have changed the face of politics in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI didn\u2019t give leaders any resources to mobilize them but rather they challenged themselves and achieved the goal to register more members in the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people went around saying people should not join our party. No true party man will do that. Those that engaged in that are not true members of the party and don\u2019t belong to Edo PDP. If not, they will not push people away from the party.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur focus now is on how to engage our members, making them participate in the policy-making process of the party. We don\u2019t need to wait for an election before we act.\u201d\n\nCharging detractors sponsoring disunity in the state to stop forthwith, the governor stated, \u201cEdo is Edo, leave Edo State alone. They have tried us in battle, and have been made to know that we are battle-ready. We have been tested and trusted. We must always win elections; we must always win as a party.\n\nThe Chairman PDP Edo State, Anthony Aziegbemi, noted that \u201cEdo State is the only state in the nation that has surpassed the 500,000 thresholds for e-registration of the party.\u201d\n\nOthers at the meeting include the Deputy Governor of Edo State, Rt. Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu; Speaker of Edo State House of Assembly (EDHA), Hon. Marcus Onobun; Senator Matthew Urhoghide; Senator Clifford Odia; Chief Tom Ikimi; Hon.

          "title": "Hope rises for Naira as CBN moves to weaken parallel market",
          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nExpectations are high that the RT 200 Forex Programme of the Bankers Committee and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will achieve its aim of stabilising the nations foreign exchange market if deliberate efforts are made to follow it through.\n\nThe CBN had last week released implementation guidelines for its newly created RT200 Non-oil Export Proceeds Repatriation Rebate Scheme, highlighting its exporters responsibilities and benefits.\n\nAccording to the circular signed by the Director of Trade and Exchange Department, Dr. Ozoemena Nnaji, exporters of eligible non-oil commodities will receive N65 for every $1 repatriated and sold at the Investors and Exporters (I & E) Window through authorised dealer banks (ADBs) for third-party use.\n\nOthers who repatriate and sold through the window for self-use on eligible transactions will also receive a rebate of N35 per dollar, the document stated.\n\nIt would be recalled that the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, recently unveiled the scheme, which is aimed at raising $200 billion from processed and semi-processed non-oil exports in the next three to five years, saying the policy direction would ultimately lead to the self-sufficiency of the commercial banks in foreign exchange needs in the coming years.\n\nEmefiele had said, The RT200 FX Programme is a set of policies, plans and programmes for non-oil exports that will enable us attain our lofty yet attainable goal of US$200 billion in FX repatriation, exclusively from non-oil exports, over the next 3-5 years.\n\nThe apex bank had put Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) on notice that it would stop selling forex to them by the end of 2022, arguing that it was ripe for the banks to source for their forex by funding entrepreneurs with ideas, skills and support to make them responsive and attract foreign currencies to Nigeria.\n\nThe RT200 initiative is anchored on five key areas which are; value-adding export facility, non-oil commodity expansion facility, non-oil export rebate scheme, non-oil export terminal financing and bi-annual non-oil export summit.\n\nSimilar step was taken by the apex bank last year with the Naira-4Dollar Scheme, which lures recipients of diaspora remittances with reward of N5 for every dollar wired through the official window.\n\nThe CBN believes that the rebate would narrow the arbitrage between the official and parallel markets, a differential which is responsible for the low participation at the official window by exporters.\n\nData published on the FMDQ website where forex is officially traded showed that the naira closed at N416.67 to a dollar at the close of business Friday. This implies a N0.17 or 0.04 per cent devaluation from N416.50 it exchanged hands with the hard currency on Thursday.\n\nIn the past weeks, the currency has been trading within the range of N416.00 and above, with the N416.67 benchmark being the lowest rate the domestic unit has touched at the official market segment with this period.\n\nThe local currency experienced an intraday high of N410.00 and a low of N444.00 before closing at N416.67 at the close of business on Friday, with a total foreign exchange of $115.26 million supplied at the market segment.\n\nHowever, the currency has been considerably stable at parallel market since the opening of business this week. Exchangers at the Uyo street market said the naira was exchanged at N576.00 to a dollar and sold within the range of N581.00 and N582.00 to a dollar on Friday.\n\nThe same rate it has been trading since the beginning of the week. Similar scenario played out at the Abuja black market, where dealers traded the local unit with the hard currency at N575.00 and sold within the range of N577.00 to a dollar on Friday.\n\nHitting the target\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief Executive Officer, Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), an economic and business advocacy think tank, Dr Muda Yusuf, has lauded the RT 200 FX Programme.\n\nYusuf, in a statement, said though ambitious, the initiative is laudable as the management of the supply side of forex would greatly impact the economy.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that supply-side policies are even more critical and impactful than demand management interventions in the foreign exchange market. Over the last couple of years, the CBN has been fixated on managing the demand side of the foreign exchange market and the outcomes have been suboptimal,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CPPE CEO said for the initiative to succeed, given the peculiar operating environment of Nigeria, the CBN should consider such factors as fixing structural constraints impeding non-oil exports, reviewing the pricing regime in the I&E window, giving exporters access to export proceeds, expanding the scope of forex supply strategies and allowing forex-generating MDAs to sell at the I&E window.\n\nStructural issues are very vital for driving the growth and competitiveness of non-oil exports. Structural variables are not within the purview of the CBN or the Bankers Committee. The fiscal authorities have much bigger roles to play in fixing the structural constraints which have been impeding non-oil exports productivity and competitiveness for decades.\n\nTherefore, collaboration with fiscal authorities is a critical success factor for the realisation of the RT 200 outcomes.\n\nOn CBN\u2019s plan to stop the sale of foreign exchange to banks, Dr Yusuf called for caution and urged the apex bank to ensure a much deeper and stronger I&E window before enforcing the action to avoid disruptions to the Nigerian business environment and economy.\n\nCPPE would like to caution that the apex bank should rigorously think through this proposition before implementation because of the likely systemic shocks, business disruptions, macroeconomic dislocations and weakening of investors.\n\nSimilarly, the Director-General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, (LCCI), noted that the RT200 FX Programme would need additional policy improvement with export infrastructure, financing for exporters and others to achieve the desired result.\n\nAlmona, in a statement, added that the CBN also needs to educate the public, especially potential exporters on the benefit of the scheme so as to enhance the participation of the business community.\n\nPraising the scheme, Almona observed that a major challenge in Nigerias export chain is the unstructured procedures that cause delays, corruption, and rejection of exports and advised that it requires critical export infrastructure, international trade diplomacy, and adequate funding to succeed.\n\nThese facilities should be well directed to process targeted products in which Nigeria has some comparative advantage such as sesame, cashew, cocoa into finished goods, she said.\n\nThe reason for the low FX revenue from exports is due to the export of primary unprocessed commodities. Nigeria must take bold steps to establish a trading system that supports the seamless flow of trade. It must establish the necessary infrastructure, create needed awareness toward exploring the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nOn his part, a professor of Economics at the University of Benin, Hassan Oaikhenan, said for the programme to achieve its goals, the CBN must shore up the value of the Naira.\n\n\u201cThe rapidly depreciating Naira serves to encourage the phenomenon of currency substitution in which economic agents prefer to hold the more stable hard currency,\u201d Oaikhenan said.\n\n\u201cThe question that follows is will an exporter, in response to the incentives that are spelt out in the programme, be willing to repatriate the foreign exchange earned? It is doubtful.\n\n\u201cUntil deliberate policies are taken to broaden the sources of foreign exchange in the economy and to diversify it from borrowing and from crude oil, every effort in that regard, will have little potential to make the much needed big dent on the scarcity of foreign exchange in the economy.\n\n\u201cI had thought that the CBN should by now be appraising the successful nature or otherwise of the policy of giving N5 incentive for every dollar that is received from abroad by beneficiaries of remittances from abroad.\n\n\u201cThat, in my opinion, should serve as the basis for the CBN to proceed to embark on the RT200 Forex Programme.\u201d",

          "text": "By Adebayo Obajemu (with agency reports)\n\nGradually, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a sovereign state is following a dangerous, but familiar pattern, which has all the hallmark of Hitler\u2019s declaration of war against Poland that precipitated the Second World War.\n\nBy the early part of 1939 the German dictator Adolf Hitler had become determined to invade and occupy Poland. Poland, for its part, had guarantees of French and British military support should it be attacked by Germany.\n\nHitler intended to invade Poland anyway, but first he had to neutralize the possibility that the Soviet Union would resist the invasion of its western neighbour. As it is now the world is witnessing similar scenario of a near nuclear holocaust, but for the restraint and maturity of Western Powers led by the United States.\n\nBut the grim and horrifying spectre of war is still very much on the horizon, as the conflict could easily escalate into a direct confrontation between Russia and the West, officials say. So far, it is still Russias war against Ukraine. But World War III has never been closer.\n\nAs Russian forces pound Kyiv and other cities, Western Powers have with great diplomatic skills and sense of 20th century history, maneuvered carefully not to allow a direct conflict with President Vladimir Putin, the man who controls the worlds largest nuclear arsenal and has shown no qualms in boasting about it.\n\nOnly last week, Putin said he had asked his military commanders to put the nuclear missiles on high alert. The Russian dictator is watching with great interest and cynicism how Ukraines Western allies are supplying weapons and other materiel, but have ruled out the idea of imposing a no-fly zone.\n\nProfessor Adamu Abdullahi, an historian told BusinessHallmark that \u201d Putin is currently the most dangerous man on earth, and the greater danger is that he\u2019s a paranoid, and the more isolation he suffers the more paranoid he becomes. It is like a bull in China shop, the West must be careful with him.\u201d\n\nEU countries are providing air defense systems, but have balked at Ukraine\u2019s request for fighter jets. No country has offered to send troops.\n\nMany analysts spoken to by Business Hallmark agreed with Western government officials, diplomats and military analysts believe that there is now a grave danger that the United States and other NATO allies could be drawn into the war \u2014 at virtually any moment, as the result of any number of scenarios.\n\nOne is a mistake, said a Washington-based analyst whose work is partly financed by the U.S. government. The lob of a missile into Poland. That is not impossible and then it very quickly escalates. But we have to respond. We cant not respond.\n\nOr the outcry against the crimes against humanity is so strong that we feel compelled to take what we think is a limited and judicious action, the analyst said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.\n\nThe enforcement of a no-fly zone means killing Russians, the analyst said. Anything that we do that results in killing Russians puts us into World War III.\n\nThe shelling and a fire at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the early hours of Friday morning provided yet another frightening example of the type of emergency scenario that could ensnare a broader international coalition in Putin\u2019s war: to urgently prevent a global catastrophe.\n\nDr. Adesanya \u1eccj\u1ecd, an International relations scholar said \u201cPutin could decide to escalate the war by lobbing missiles on Poland or asking his proxy, Belarus\u2019 Luckashenko to do it. That means NATO will react.\u201d\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden has been adamant about American forces not getting involved in the fighting. In his State of the Union speech last week, Biden described the war as Ukraines fight and said Washington would do what it could to help.\n\nWell continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and help ease their suffering, he said. But let me be clear: Our forces are not engaged and will not engage in the conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight [in] Ukraine but to defend our NATO allies in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.\n\nOne European official privy to intelligence briefings provided to U.S. allies said analysts in Washington had reached a terrifying conclusion: Russia is ready to use a thermonuclear bomb in Ukraine, the official said.\n\nThe official said the war in Ukraine was far more dangerous than anything Europe has seen since the end of World War II, including the Balkan wars of the 1990s.\n\nAs horrible as that was, the official said, this is worse, with the potential of getting a real European war, or a world war very quickly. This is just getting deeper and deeper, every day.\n\nRecall that last Friday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg emphatically said the alliance would not be drawn into direct conflict with Putin, and its unwillingness to impose a no-fly zone.\n\nThe only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send NATO planes \u2014 fighter planes \u2014 into Ukrainian airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes, Stoltenberg said following a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels. If we did that, well end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war in Europe involving many more countries and causing much more human suffering.\n\nOn a visit to Chi\u015fin\u0103u, the Moldovan capital which has been swamped by Ukrainian refugees, the EUs foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said he recognized the whole world has a stake in whats happening in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cToday the problem is not only Donbas, the problem is not only Ukraine \u2014 what is at stake is the stability in Europe and the whole international order,\u201d he said.\n\nBut asked if he would back a no-fly zone enforced by NATO allies, 21 of whom are EU members, Borrell said that was not a decision for him or the EU to take.\n\nProxy war\n\nMany experts have since the conflict begun attributed it to a proxy war.\n\nProfessor Adeagbo Moritiwon, a political scientist said \u201cthe effort to portray the conflict as Ukraine\u2019s war misses the key point: Putin has attacked Ukraine precisely because it chose a path toward the EU and NATO. Fighting Ukraine, they say, is a proxy for fighting the West.\n\n\u201cSome believe the conflict can only be resolved if Putin\u2019s complaints about the U.S. and NATO are resolved. Until then, he will continue the war, seeking to conquer or destroy the country, and making the peace negotiations with Ukrainian officials of little significance.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the West will end up even more directly involved, politically and perhaps militarily, than it is already. The precise nature of that greater role is a matter of debate but many believe it is coming, one way or another \u2014 and some argue that the sooner it happens, the quicker the war will end. That calculation, of course, presumes Putin chooses self-preservation over nuclear Armageddon.\u201d\n\nBut all signs suggest the situation in Ukraine will get far worse in the coming days, a point French President Emmanuel Macron warned about on Thursday.\n\nAs Putin realizes that fury among the Ukrainian population means he will lose politically, no matter the military outcome, there is a heightened risk he will simply seek to destroy Ukraine, flattening its cities and towns just as Russian forces obliterated the Chechen capital of Grozny.\n\nAnd the devastating barrage of severe sanctions that are punishing the Russian economy will almost certainly remain in place, giving Putin little incentive to back away from his goal of conquering Ukraine and toppling its government. Putin chose war fully knowing there would be severe economic consequences \u2014 a calculation he made previously with the invasion and annexation of Crimea, which led to sanctions and steep absorption costs.\n\nA partial ceasefire was abruptly announced by the Russians on Saturday, presumably to allow residents of two Ukrainian cities that were surrounded by Russian forces, including the strategic port city of Mariupol, to evacuate, the first since the conflict broke out February 24.\n\nRussians Defence Ministry announced a ceasefire to allow civilians in the besieged port city of Mariupol and the town of Volnovakha to evacuate. Mariupols mayor Vadim Boychenko said evacuations would begin at 0900 GMT.\n\nThe strategic city of 450,000 people on the Azov Sea, which has suffered intense shelling, has been without electricity, food, water and heating for days in the depth of winter.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "title": "2023: Emefiele\u2019s alleged ambition rattles political parties",
          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nWhen it emerged early February that the \u2018who is who\u2019 in Nigeria\u2019s business community, including governors of both the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressive Congress (APC) were holding strategic meetings in Abuja and Lagos to push for the presidential candidacy of a South South technocrat in 2023, with Mr. Godwin Emefiele\u2019s name being mentioned as the said candidate, many people would have been amused.\n\nMr. Emefiele could not be an ideal presidential candidate in a contest featuring many time-tested politicians, even as the stakes are high on account of a number of factors. Indeed, only few individuals could have contemplated a possible power bid by the cool headed governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) who has practically no experience in party politics.\n\nBut the reality of the Agbor, Delta State born banker being potentially the favoured person to fly the presidential flag of Nigeria\u2019s ruling party in 2023, is dawning and the political environment has continued to buzz with debates for and against him dominating political discuss, even as groups have emerged to drum support for him.\n\nLast week, his campaign posters surfaced in Lagos, mostly around Surulere and recently, his supporters, mainly youths, spotted white T-Shirts with the inscription MEFFY 2023 at an occasion held in the state to promote his potential candidacy.\n\nThough not entirely clear at moment, and Emefiele has, for obvious reason of his still presiding over the country\u2019s apex bank, not come out to admit or deny the rumoured presidential ambition, preferring instead to put his fate in God\u2019s hands while noting that it is the prerogative of President Muhammadu Buhari to map out his succession plan, what is clear is that he will be the candidate to watch should he finally own up to the rumour; what at this stage seems to be only a matter of time.\n\nSeveral sources in the know have confirmed to our correspondents that Emefiele, known to have the ear of Buhari, is one of the president\u2019s preferred candidates to succeed him, with Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi and former president, Goodluck Jonathan also mentioned as potential candidates.\n\nJonathan, who remains officially a member of the PDP, has been mentioned severally, too, with the idea being that since he is only eligible for one term of four years, his presidency, which could be in breach of the eight tenure for power rotation, would be the quickest route for the North to reclaim power, potentially in 2027.\n\nEmefiele, on the other hand, fits the bill in the president\u2019s reckoning, sources said, on account of his loyalty and ethnic origin.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that he (Emefiele) as president is unlikely to distort the order Buhari has established in the polity,\u201d a source who preferred anonymity said. \u201cImportantly, he is also from the Igbo speaking part of Delta State, which means that he would also be addressing the issue of Igbo presidency.\u201d\n\nThe source continued: \u201cThe President knows how strongly the Igbo feel about producing president in 2023, but he is uncomfortable with the Southeast. He prefers someone from the South South and of course, the Igbo cannot argue against someone like Emefiele.\u201d\n\nLast week, the CBN governor created a twitter account and has been relatively active, with posts ranging from dismissing untrue reports about his person and praising Buhari for one project or the other. The development would have ordinarily seemed innocuous, but the timing of it, and given the role of the social media platform in the country\u2019s politics, many have tended to link it to a certain intention to join partisan politics.\n\nIndeed, what appears to be the strongest indication yet is that since the speculations began to emerge strongly in early February, Emefiele has yet to deny it, what he would have ordinarily wasted little time to do, especially given that he is still the governor of the Central Bank.\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday, February 15, when when a \u2018group of his friends,\u2019 that identified themselves as Friends of Godwin Emefiele, visited him to discuss the controversy over his rumoured presidential ambition in 2023, the CBN governor noted that his fate is in God\u2019s hands.\n\nOnly yesterday, as the speculation became widespread, a group of his friends under the aegis of FRIENDS OF GODWIN EMEFIELE met with him to clarify his position, a statement signed by the group after the visit said.\n\nThe group said the verbal attacks on Emefiele over the rumoured 2023 bid are uncalled for, since he has not confirmed to anyone he is running for President even as he is constitutionally qualified to do so.\u201d\n\nExplaining what Emefiele said during the meeting, the group had said, Here is what he told us: That he remains focused on his job and will continue supporting the Muhammadu Buhari-led federal governments economic recovery drive; that in his career trajectory, right from his days as a young banker, he never asked, nor lobbied for a job, he was invited by the Board of Directors to be the Chief Executive Officer/Group Managing Director of Zenith Bank as he was an integral part of the team, led by founder Jim Ovia, that transformed Zenith Bank from a start-up to one of Africas largest banks with subsidiaries in Ghana, Sierra Leone, Gambia, South Africa, Dubai, China and the United Kingdom\u2026.\n\nMr. Emefiele told us that he believes its the prerogative of President Muhammadu Buhari to plan his succession in line with global best practices for good governance for the continuing peace and progress of the federal republic of Nigeria, as such he will play his part to stabilise the economy for an orderly transition.\n\nAnd given that its God that anoints leaders, he will leave his fate firmly in the hands of God.\n\nGroups Drum Support\n\nMeanwhile, a number of groups have come out to demand that the CBN governor throws his hat in the ring. On Saturday, February 12, a coalition group, the Green Alliance, addressed a press conference in Lagos asking him to declare for president.\n\nAddressing the press conference in Lagos on Saturday, Wale Fapounda, convener of the group, said the country needs a technocrat that can handle the affairs of the country, adding that Emefiele understands global economic growth and that it would compel him to accede to its request to run for the presidency under the APC platform.\n\nThis forum has come together to plead and beg Dr. Godwin Emefiele to run as president of Nigeria in 2023, Fapounda said.\n\nSince he was appointed the governor of the CBN he has spent his energy in building a resilient financial system that can serve the growth and development needs of the Nigerian economy. A typical example of this was seen during his first term, he supervised an interventionist currency policy at the behest of the presidency, propping up the Nigerian Naira by pumping billions of dollars into the foreign exchange market.\u201d\n\nOn February 2022, another group PUSH Emefiele 2023 (Pe2023), urged Nigerians to join in urging him to contest for president, as according to it, he remained the best man for the job.\n\nThe group, in a statement signed by its National Coordinator, Mr. Presley Okojie, argued that Emefieles candidacy would ensure economic consolidation project to life one hundred million Nigerians out poverty in the next couple of years.\n\nPE2023 which claimed to have credible Nigerians, with solid grassroots connection across the six geopolitical zones within its ranks, had said, At this point in our history, we need a pan-Nigerian, with strong background in economics and versatile local and international connections/experience, to upscale our steady economic growth and ultimately tackle all forms of insecurity and separatists narratives.\u201d\n\nYet, last week, another group, the Kaduna chapter of the Pro-Godwin Ifeanyi Emefiele for President 2023, asked the CBN governor to join the race for the presidential election.\n\nChairman of the group, Mohammed Omale, who made the call at a meeting organised by his members in Kaduna, on Sunday, noted that Emefiele has devoted his time and energy towards building a strong financial system that would lead to the growth and development of the Nigerian economy.\n\nAccording to him, Emefiele, has demonstrated the capability and ability to lead this great country to the promise land. The group therefore, urged the CBN governor to run for the presidency in 2023, maintaining that his track records at the CBN, are indication that he would transform Nigeria for the better if elected president.\n\nAs patriotic citizens of the federal republic of Nigeria, strong believers in democracy and advocates for a greater Nigeria built on a solid economic foundation, we declare support for the current governor of the Central Bank Nigeria, Mr. Godwin Ifeanyi Emefiele for President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Omale said.\n\nHe promoted agricultural development through anchor borrowers schemes which has yielded great success in all parts of the country regardless of religion or tribe.\n\nHe has ensured stable economy in Nigeria by engaging the fiscal authority through various interventions.\n\nHe has worked tirelessly to see that Nigerian economy is among the 25th world best economy globally.\n\nPolitics remains the biggest industry in Nigeria, and support groups are never in short supply during election seasons. The emergence of various support groups, therefore, cannot be testament to Emefiele\u2019s presidential credentials, but as a top Lagos businessman noted in an interaction with our correspondent, the decision of the business community to back the CBN governor speaks volumes.\n\nI can assure you that it\u2019s not for nothing that top businesses owners like Dangote are part of the Emefiele presidential project,\u201d he said. \u201cThey won\u2019t just back anyone. They have businesses everywhere, are in the know and just know the people to look look out for during election seasons. This time, Emefiele is one of such people.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

We will finish it. But the main thing is that Ukraine ceases its military action. They should stop their military action and then no one will shoot,\u201d Peskov said in Russia\u2019s announcement of ceasefire conditions.\n\nRegarding Ukrainian military neutrality, Peskov said: \u201cThey should make amendments to the constitution according to which Ukraine would reject any aims to enter any bloc,\u201d adding: \u201cWe have also spoken about how they should recognise that Crimea is Russian territory and that they need to recognise that Donetsk and Lugansk are independent states.
