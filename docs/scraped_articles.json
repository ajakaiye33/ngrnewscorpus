It will, especially, serve as a sustainable source of providing start-up capital for the trained corps members to actualise their business plans and in turn employ more Nigerians.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I appeal to all and sundry to support the actualisation of the proposal. The NYSC scheme will be sustained. It has become an integral part of our national development and unity architecture; Nigerian youths continue to benefit from this scheme.\n\n\u201cAs a sign of the Federal Government\u2019s unflinching commitment to the NYSC, President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the automatic employment of 10 direct siblings of the deceased NYSC members, who lost their lives during the 2011 post-election violence in Bauchi State.

          "text": "To reduce, and feasibly eradicate violence against women and children in Lagos, and by extension Nigeria, the media must adopt basic principles of journalism of objectivity, honesty, accuracy and accountability.\n\nThis was the submission of participants at a four-day media dialogue and training to improve gender sensitivity in reportage and advocacy, to eliminate violence against women and girls in Lagos.\n\nOrganised by EU-UN Spotlight Initiative Nigeria, the dialogue, according to Khadijah Ibrahim Nuhu, focused on increasing media network participation, involving in solutions journalism, engaging in gender inequality discourse, and impacting changing positive norms.\n\n\n\nAlkasim Abdulkadir, one of the facilitators, while presenting his paper titled: \u201cEtiquette in Reporting Gender\u201d noted that Gender-based violence (GBV) or violence against women and girls (VAWG), is a global pandemic that affects 1 in 3 women in their lifetime.\n\nAccording to him, going by 2019 statistics, 35 per cent of women globally have experienced either physical or sexual violence from intimate partners or non-partners, seven per cent of women have been sexually assaulted by someone other than their partners while six per cent have experienced violence during pregnancy.\n\nWhile stressing the importance of using data when reporting GBV issues, as this will help in policy, Abdulkadir urged media practitioners not to fabricate data, as there are relevant agencies that can give this information, and also do away with sensationalism when reporting the subject matter.\n\nOn her part, Aisha Salaudeen, another facilitator, who spoke on \u201cGender and child-sensitive reporting,\u201d defined gender reporting simply as including all genders in our reporting.\n\nAccording to her: \u201cIt is the practice of creating, reporting or producing media-related content (TV, radio, digital etc.) in a manner that is sensitive to gender inequality and portrays women and men fairly.\u201d\n\nShe added that since the media plays a very significant role in shaping public perceptions about women and men, it is important that reporting avoids any form of gender stereotypes, which often limit and trivialise females and males, as well as presenting an inaccurate view of the world and its possibilities.\n\nWhile sourcing stories, she urged journalists to ask an equal number of women and men for their opinions on subject matters, cover issues that are important to women and their lives, and seek the expertise of women in reports.\n\nTo properly mirror society and be factual and accurate in representing the world, she charged journalists to include children in their reports.\n\nShe, however, noted that children are young, vulnerable, and quite impressionable. As a result, journalists must respect them and treat them with dignity in reporting them.\n\nEarlier, the coordinator of the Spotlight Initiative, UNICEF Lagos, Foluke Omoworare, who represented UNICEF Child Protection Specialist, Denise Onoise, noted that the perpetrators of child molestation are often times people who are known to the children and are sometimes close family members.\n\nQuoting statistics on the prevalence of GBV in Lagos, Omoworare revealed that one in four girls has experienced sexual violence and women and girls with disabilities fall into the category of those with higher likelihoods of being sexually molested.\n\n\u201cViolence is rarely an isolated incident and the majority of children surveyed experienced violence in their home. For children, perpetrators are people that are known to them, (parents, caregiver, teacher, neighbours),\u201d she said.\n\nSpeaking on factors that fuel Violence against women and girls, Omoworare identified some to include \u201csocial norms, early child marriage, weak enforcement of the law, and the reluctance of response services to getting involved in family affairs.\u201d\n\nShe, however, stated that to combat some of these factors, the Lagos State Ministry of Youth and Social Development works collaboratively and effectively with partners in a different capacity to ensure violence is reduced to the barest minimum in society.\n\n\n\nAllying with Omoworare\u2019s stand on factors that fuel the abuse of women and girls, Director, National Orientation Agency, Lagos, Waheed Ishola also identified reasons to include, \u201cpoverty, missing parental care, the quest for money, fame and political position by women and indecent dressing among adolescent girls.\u201d\n\nOthers include: \u201cNeglect of family values, the inability of men to manage their home, illicit drug/substance abuse, ritualistic purposes, and fear of stigmatisation.\u201d\n\nIshola noted that the NOA as one of the implementing partners of the Spotlight Initiative is doing extensive work aimed at eliminating violence against women, working with people in local communities, through the Community Dialogue Sessions.\n\nHe urged the media to assist in addressing the negative socio-cultural norms attached to reporting cases of violence.\n\nEarlier, Muhammad Okorie, Officer in Charge of UNICEF Lagos., noted that violence against women is a global issue, adding that, this trend is a threat to women achieving their full potential.\n\n\u201cBefore 25 years, a girl must have been violated either sexually or physically. If we do not end violence against women, we can reduce it to the nearest minimum.\n\n\u201cThe meeting is to ensure that we end VAWG. The media has a vantage position to reach a larger audience since they have more access through their report to speak to stakeholders,\u201d Okorie stated.\n\nOlasunmbo Daniel, an Assistant Director of Ministry of Youth and Social Development, said the ministry works collaboratively and effectively with partners in a different capacity to ensure violence is reduced to the barest minimum in society.\n\nIn implementing the Spotlight Initiative, Daniel said the progress report for Lagos State include; capacity building and strengthening of 156 Child Protection Stakeholders; Social Welfare Officers, Health Officers, Education Officers, Legal Officers, Police Officers, Civil Society Organisations, volunteers which have been carried out at different times, in the last two years.\n\nParticipants at the workshop, who were drawn from media organisations across Lagos State, expressed delight at the exposure which the training has accorded them, stating that they will, in turn, carry on the torch of eliminating violence against women, a trend which has hindered women from blossoming and attaining their full potential in all fields of endeavour.",

          "title": "I joined the Military 36 years ago - COAS",
          "text": "Newly appointed Chief of Army Staff, Major General Farouk Yahaya told the House of Representatives Committees on Defence and Army that he joined the Nigerian Army about 36 years ago, one year above the 35 years mandatory retirement period in public service.\n\nThis is coming as the House of Representatives insist on synergy among the security services in the country in other to win the war against insecurity.\n\nThe minimum age for enlisting into the Nigerian Armed Forces is put at 18 years old for voluntary service and are expected to retire from service at 55 years or after putting in 35 years of service according to the Federal Civil Service rules.\n\nThe new Army Chief is 55 years old this year and has put in 36 years into the service of the Nigerian Army.\n\nSpeaking when he appeared before the joint committee of the House for confirmation as the new Army Chief, Yahaya said he was coming on board as the head of the Army with 36 years of experience as well as a load of experience from his various service units.\n\nYahaya, a member of Course 37 at the Nigeria Defence Academy however assured that when confirmed, he will have a very close working relationship with other service chiefs whom he said he had worked with in the same mission in the past, with a special nickname they often called themselves.\n\nHe said; \u201cI joined the military 36 years ago. So I bring along with me, 36 years of military experience, having joined the Army in September 1985 as a member of course 37 at the NDA. I have had experience commensurate with my career. So, I\u2019m abreast with the security requirements of Abuja, and so on.\n\n\u201cI have been involved in several security operations. The challenges we are facing now, all are characterized by the areas I mentioned, where I have firsthand information and have commanded troops and I administered them in achieving what we\u2019ve done.\n\n\u201cI believe I have the requisite requirements by the grace of God to now provide my services in this office of the chief of Army Staff if confirmed. What I am bringing is wealth of experience and commitment. So I\u2019m committed and determined to provide my best having known what is required to achieve results.\n\n\u201cSecurity is everybody\u2019s business because the job cannot be done by one person. So we need all the support. And with the support of the people will win our fight against insecurity.\n\n\u201cFrom experience this job cannot be done by any single service or entity. Indeed in the Army, the Army itself is a group work not individual that\u2019s why we arranged in sections and companies and battalions and brigades.\n\n\u201cThis job is collective and as it was captured in the vision of the late Chief of Army Staff and in my own Mission too. There is also mentioned of joint environment in what we do, having realized that this job is not one service\u2019s job.\n\n\u201cNot only that, it also requires the collaboration of other agencies, services and stakeholders. We have always operated together. That is why you see the composition of a joint team made of the Army, Navy, Airforce and now including the Police, DSS, and Civil Defense.\n\n\u201cAs we know, internal security is intelligent driven operation. So we need others, including communities, including traditional rulers and all others who can provide information. We need to work together.\n\n\u201cAt the Defence headquarters level, all the Service Chiefs now we are all mates at the Academy. At one time or the other, all of us work together. So the synergy can\u2019t be anything better now that we\u2019re brought up together, we have trained together.\u201d\n\nIn his remark, Chairman of the House Committee on Defence, Rep. Babajimi Benson said the exercise was unique in view of the sad event that has necessitated its repeat, following the death of the immediate past Chief of Army Staff, Lt General Ibrahim Attahiru.\n\nHe said further that \u201cthis exercise comes at a very challenging time in the history of our dear country, Nigeria. Our nation has been besieged by several security issues across all the geo-political zones with banditry, militancy and self-secessionists stretching our military to the extreme.\n\n\u201cThe worst is the lingering insurgency in the North-East. This war has cost the country a lot both financially and in terms of human lives. This must stop. The Armed Forces of Nigeria needs to adopt innovative measures to curb the killings and wanton destruction of property as a result of these cases of insecurity.\n\n\u201cI therefore, hope that, if confirmed, the new Chief of Army Staff will do everything possible, working with other service chiefs, to bring this to an end. You will agree with me that Nigeria deserves a re-invigorated Armed Forces that is robust, well-trained, adequately equipped, efficient and fully motivated to protect Nigerians from the devastating effects of terrorism and other security challenges in the country.\n\n\u201cThis screening exercise comes at the heels of Nigeria\u2019s twenty two years of uninterrupted democratic experience. I must say that the relationship between the National Assembly and Armed Forces of Nigeria has progressively improved as the parliament continues to exercise the necessary democratic oversight of the defence sector.\n\n\u201cLet me reiterate the firm resolve of the 9th House of Representatives, ably led by the Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila and particularly, the Committees on Defence and that of Army\u2019s pledge to continually ensure a secure, peaceful and prosperous country for all Nigerians. We will therefore continue to work with the Armed Forces of Nigeria to achieve this.\n\n\u201cLet me assure you that the Joint Committees on Defence and Army will be thorough, transparent and sincere in the conduct of this screening. We owe this to Nigerians as their representatives. Consequently, we seek your cooperation as we embark on this constitutional legislative process.\n\n\u201cThe worsening security situation in the country has been blamed on lack of functional local government system arising from inefficiency and absence of fiscal federalism to enable them carry out their constitutional responsibilities.\u201d",

          "text": "By Samuel Oamen\n\nSome Yoruba Nollywood actors and actresses are not giving up on love after their first marriages crashed. These celebrities chose to give love another chance and have been having a loving time with their spouses.\n\nHere are eight Yoruba Nollywood actors/actresses who remarried:\n\n1. Toyin Abraham\n\nYou most likely would know her as Toyin Aimakhu. The producer and director got married to a Nollywood actor Adeniji Johnson in 2013. The union appeared sweet on social media as the duo never ceased to gush on each other.\n\nSurprisingly, in 2015, news went round that the celebrity couples were having it hot as they announced their separation.\n\nIt is however interesting to know that the duo has moved on with their lives as Toyin Abraham recently welcomed a baby boy with another actor Kolawole Ajeyemi.\n\n2. Bukky Wright\n\nBukky Wright had previously been married to Gboyega Amu, who is the father of her two sons. Shortly after separating from Amu, due to what she termed irreconcilable differences, she moved into the arms of fellow actor and one time NNPC top shot and current member of the House of Representatives, Rotimi Makinde, without officially divorcing Gboyega Amu.\n\nThe union lasted a few years before she moved on in the same fashion and found solace in the arms of society journalist and image-maker, Femi Davies. Bukky and Femi got married at the Akodo Registry in Lagos.\n\n3. Solomon Akiyesi\n\nSolomon Akiyesi has been married four times. He wedded his university love, Ezinne in 2003. He was alleged to still be married to Ezinne when he contracted another marriage with Lilian, who was said to be 8 months pregnant and living in Port Harcourt when Solomon attempted to marry another wife, Uloma Agwu in Lagos on April 13, 2013.\n\nAkiyesi and Agwu were almost pronounced as husband and wife when Lilian stormed the Overcomer\u2019s World Outreach church, Surulere Lagos where the wedding was going on. She stormed the place with some family members and policemen\n\n4. Clarion Chukwura\n\nClarion Chukwura Clarion tied the nuptial knot with her U.S. based fianc\u00e9, Anthony Boyd making it her third marriage. She once had a relationship with Afro-Juju legend, Sir Shina Peters and bore a son, Clarence Peters after she ended her first marriage to a certain Mr. Abiola in 2003.\n\nShe then remarried Femi Oduneye popularly known as Femi Egyptian in 2004. They, however, separated in 2006, after which they got back together before they finally got divorced. She, however, lost her first husband, Tunde Abiola, and her second spouse, Femi Oduneye in 2017.\n\n5. Femi Adebayo\n\nThe actor, filmmaker and director has three children with his first wife Khadijat. This was his first marriage and, just as many things in life, turned out to be a failure. Khadijat gave birth to the three adorable kids within the eight years of their marriage but in the end, they decided not to wait any longer and broke apart\n\nHe got married to Omotayo Adebayo after staying out of marriage for 8 years. They got married in October 2016.\n\n6. Mercy Aigbe\n\nMercy Aigbe, who is popular for her fashion sense on social media, was a wife to an Igbo man and had a beautiful daughter for him but the union couldn\u2019t stand the test of time as it crashed a few years later.\n\nMercy and Lanre officially tied the knot at the Ikoyi Registry in 2013 but the marriage also crashed in 2017.\n\n7. Foluke Daramola-Salako\n\nShe married Babatunde Sobowale in 2005 and the union ended in 2008 after two kids over allegations of wife-battering and infidelity. The actress has since remarried and is happy with her latest husband, Kayode Salako.\n\n8. Doris Simeon\n\nShe was once married to a movie producer and director Daniel Ademinokan. Doris and Daniel met on a movie set where love bound them. Together the couple bore a son, David Ademinokan but separated in May 2013 with a subsequent court divorce.\n\nHowever, Doris Simeon found love again, as she got married to Taiwo Oduala in 2019.",

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu Noah Ebije, Kaduna and Paul Osuyi, Asaba\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s pronouncement last week that his administration would reinstate cattle routes and grazing areas across the country to ensure herders have free access for their animals have continued to generate flaks\n\nIn apparent response to the ban on open cattle grazing by the 17 Southern governors, the president said when the governors gave the directive that open grazing would be banned, he referred them to the gazette that makes provisions for cattle routes and open grazing areas. He then said he has resolved to revive those routes and grazing areas in the country to resolve the issue.\n\n\u201cWhat I told the governors was to ask them to go and dig up the gazette. There are certain routes and grazing areas so that when cattle rearers were moving from the north to the west, they were allowed to go through there. But if you allow your cattle to stray into any farmer\u2019s farm, you are arrested and the farmer is invited to submit his claims. Those who encroach on these cattle routes and grazing areas would be dispossessed.\u201d\n\nHowever, in separate reactions, Arewa, Igbo and Yoruba groups roundly condemned the statement saying the move rather than resolve the issue would exacerbate it.\n\nAs far as the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) is concerned, reactivating open grazing routes may cause legal and security problems.\n\nSpokesman forf the group, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, in a telephone interview, reminded the president that the 1999 Constitution gives state governors powers cover land and to even revoke federal land.\n\n\u201cThe reactivation of open grazing routes in southern part or any other parts of the country is problematic both in legal terms and security. I would have said the best way to go is for us to seek legal interpretation beyond the Office of the Attorney General. The Federal Government can actually sue governors that ban open grazing and the court will rule whether they are right or wrong.\n\n\u201cI will reserve final judgment on the president\u2019s position. We caution that there is more to open grazing than availability of land and routes. It is not about opening the grazing routes, it is also about the security of the cattle and herders, and getting the support of communities that they will go through. Our open grazing requires political will. The Federal Government has already adopted the National Livestock Transformation programme to equip the Fulani. We, in the North, are in favour of ban of open grazing but we want it to be done in phases, in an orderly manner that does not harm the cattle and the Fulani. We also support the active intervention of the Federal Government, the northern governors and everybody to make sure that in the next one year or two, open grazing is abolished completely. I think this is the way to go.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Association of South East Town Unions (ASETU) in collaboration with other respected Igbo groups, including Nzuko Umunna, Aka Ikenga, Igbo World Assembly (IWA), World Igbo Congress (WIC), Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), Ekwe Nche, European Igbo Communities, Igbo Board of Deputies, Council of Igbo States in America, Nkata Ndi Inyom Igbo and South East Community Youth Leaders, rose from a one-day emergency security meeting with a vow to resist open grazing in the region.\n\nThe coalition warned that governors in the zone who fail to implement the ban would be treated as foes.\n\nNational President, ASETU, Chief Emeka Diwe who made their position known, said the meeting totally condemned the continued attacks by killer herdsmen in Igbo communities and urged governors to rise to the occasion and protect their people.\n\nStressing that the primary purpose of political governance was the security of lives and property, the Igbo groups charged governors who had not kick-started the processes of enacting anti-open grazing laws, to as a matter of urgency, send Executive Bills to their respective Houses of Assembly.\n\n\u201cOur position is very clear, which is the stand of Ndigbo; we say no to open grazing and are not making any pretences about that. We insist that any cattle in the South East must be ranched. So, we urge all nomadic herders to leave our land. We also urge our governors to do everything possible to implement the ban on open grazing. In fact, Ndigbo will treat any governor who fails to carry out this heartfelt desire and demand as an enemy. We equally urge each state to have forest guards with legal backing to ensure that our forests do not harbour terrorists and criminals,\u201d Diwe said.\n\nThe groups regretted that President Muhammadu Buhari who had never spoken strongly against the atrocities of Fulani herdsmen and bandits was threatening to visit another festival of blood on the Igbo.\n\nADF recalled that it had been in the forefront of the agitation for the banning of open grazing in Igboland since 2015, hence its insistence on the enactment of anti-open grazing laws as the most potent strategy to prevent armed Fulani herdsmen from overrunning the Southern states.\n\nIts spokesman, Abia Onyike, said the law to be passed in the State Houses of Assembly should be accompanied by clear modalities, instrumentalities and machineries for their enforcement. He added that the effectiveness of this move depended on the synergy between the governors, the legislators and the people, including the civil society organisations.\n\nSimilarly, the pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, said the president\u2019s pronouncements fell far short of what was expectation.\n\n\u201cWe have some questions for Mr. President and the Attorney General in this respect. One, who created the so-called grazing routes? At what time in our history did our founding fathers gather to designate specific routes from the north to the south as \u2018grazing routes\u2019? Two, assuming without conceding, that there were so-called grazing routes, what would now happen to structures that have been built in areas where the so-called routes are to be re-opened? Would such structures, including residences and factories be pulled down so that cows would have places to graze? Compared to what would be lost economically, socially, politically and in security terms if these structures are to be pulled down, is it not better to encourage the building of ranches? We can go on and on.\u201d\n\nAfenifere claimed President\u2019s pronouncement on open grazing and his confession on how he determines who occupy positions at the national level seems to indicate that Buhari\u2019s government is operating a constitution that is different from the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cFor instance, Section 2 of the Land Use Act, the law governing land matters in the country, vests the administration and control of lands in a given state in the hands of the governor of the state. It is such that even when the Federal Government wants to use a portion of land, it has to seek the consent of the governor of the state concerned. Since most governors in the country have outlawed open grazing in their respective states, on which land does the Federal Government want to \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018re-open\u2019 its vaunted grazing routes? Why talking of grazing routes in this age when ranching is the fad in all civilised climes?\u201d\n\nThe group claimed President Buhari seems to derive pleasure in shifting blames and responsibilities when pressed on what his government ought to do.\n\nUnknown persons threaten mayhem in Delta\n\nMeanwhile, unknown persons, yesterday, raised the tension in Delta State as they threatened to attack Asaba, the state capital, and Agbor, if Governor Ifeanyi Okowa does not withdraw his support for the ban on open grazing within 72 hours.\n\nAn unsigned letter containing the threat was pasted in strategic locations in Asaba including the fence of the Living Faith Church (Winners Chapel) at Infant Jesus Road.\n\nThe letter titled \u2018Fulani Jihadist Warning: An Open Message of 2 Paragraphs to Delta State\u2019 dated June 13, 2021 warned that \u201cfailure to adhere to this demand for been the host of the 17 governors, Delta State, most likely the city of Asaba and Agbor, shall encounter severe consequences than that of Bornu, Kebbi, Kastina, Kaduna, Enugu, Benue, Oyo and many more that will not respect the Fulani\u2019s heritage, as we take responsibility for the detonate explosive uncovered in the state capital secretariat, which should serve as warning to the Delta State Government for what is to come, should the governor fail to abide to our demand.\u201d",
          "summary": "As far as the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) is concerned, reactivating open grazing routes may cause legal and security problems.\n\u201cThe reactivation of open grazing routes in southern part or any other parts of the country is problematic both in legal terms and security.\nThe Federal Government can actually sue governors that ban open grazing and the court will rule whether they are right or wrong.\nAt what time in our history did our founding fathers gather to designate specific routes from the north to the south as \u2018grazing routes\u2019?\nSince most governors in the country have outlawed open grazing in their respective states, on which land does the Federal Government want to \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018re-open\u2019 its vaunted grazing routes?",

          "text": "From Agaju Madugba, Katsina\n\nKatsina Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has faulted President Muhammadu Buhari on reasons for worsening insecurity in the country.\n\nThe president had during a television interview last week attributed the menace to failure of states and local governments across the country to manage security issues in their respective domains.\n\nBut citing Constitutional provisions, Masari said it was wrong for anybody to blame states and local governments.\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of the Federal Government to ensure protection of lives and property of citizens in all nooks and cranny of the country. When you look at the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the issue of security is under the Exclusive List. So, it is the responsibility of the Federal Government and states can only complement and that\u2019s what we have always done and are still doing.\n\n\u201cFrom the local governments, we assist the police, the DSS, the NSDC. There may be states that do not complement efforts of the security agencies and perhaps those are the states that the president was referring to.\n\n\u201cBut sincerely speaking, based on provisions of the Constitution, the blame should go to the Federal Government for the general state of insecurity in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nMasari said he was 100 per cent in support of the clamour for restructuring and devolution of more powers to states which should also entail enhanced revenue to the tiers of government to enable them adequately perform their constitutional roles.\n\nAccording to him, the establishment of a state police would enhance general security as the personnel will be expected to perform their defined roles without infringing on duties of the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cThe issue of a state police is part of what we are talking about and I am for it. All we need to do is to formalise activities of the vigilance groups and community policing and give them clear definitions on their limits and those of the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cWe have the Nigerian police and the NSDC that we currently support their operations and nothing stops a state police from coexisting side by side with the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cThe issue of security is actually the responsibility of everybody as we all have roles to play. It\u2019s not about the president or the governor or local government chairman or a legislator or minister.\n\n\u201cThese bandits and their informants have addresses. They live within the communities and the people know them and security has no colorations in terms of political party affiliations or religion.\n\n\u201cI am also 100 per cent for restructuring and devolution of powers or whatever you call it. If you devolve, states and local governments will have more financial independence. We should earn resources according to the size and economy of our states.\n\n\u201cDuring the First Republic, Emir of Kano was the highest paid because of the state\u2019s revenue base. What we have today as Katsina State was a province made up of Katsina and Daura emirates. They ran their civil service and police and prisons and judiciary then were under the Native Authority and they did well.\n\n\u201cThey built and managed schools. If it was done successfully then, who says it cannot be done today? We ought to take another look at the Constitution. With the right leadership and proper arrangement, these things are still possible.\n\n\u201cThere are some federal ministries with so many parastatals under each one. How can one person as minister provide effective oversight for these parastatals?\n\n\u201cWe should devolve more power to the states but in such a way that we don\u2019t have to weaken the authority of the Federal Government in terms of performing its constitutional responsibilities.\u201d",

Lukman, in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nThe former Edo governor said the earlier the APC-led government addressed the escalating agitations, the better to diffuse the kind of stresses the nation is passing through.\n\n\u201cLet me refer to just one aspect of what Governor Atiku Bagudu said. That is the document on true federalism which the party put together that passed through all the organs of the party. The executive of the party, the NWC, the Caucus, the NEC which is the highest organ of the party.\n\n\u201cWhy did we do it at that time? We did it because like, it is happening today, there was this cacophony of voices. Two people in the party could not agree on what they meant by restructuring. So, the party needed to take control of the debate, define the issues, proffer solutions and went so far as to have some drafts legislation. It is not by any chance a perfect document.\n\n\u201cBut it reflects then the thinking and the desires of the Nigerian people. Everybody kept quiet after we brought that document out, publicised it, held press conferences over it and most Nigerians were very, very happy. But once again, we did not make the kind of progress that we could have made and it has become once more, the topical subject in the Nigerian polity.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it has gone beyond us, we now have one or two things that did not happen before, people now wanting to disengage from the federation, which did not happen before and that is a warning sign. If a child ask for garri today you don\u2019t give him, tomorrow he may decide it\u2019s cake he wants and we must not, as political party, we must not as the government of the federation, give the impression that only military governments can fundamentally tamper with the basic structure of this nation.\u201d",

          "title": "Clark Chastises President, Northern Elders for Silence over Jihadists\u2019 Threat to Delta",
          "text": "\u2022MEND warns Fulani group against planned attack\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba\n\nThe leader of Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) and Chairman of Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF), Chief Edwin Clark, yesterday expressed concern over the silence of President Muhammadu Buhari and Northern elders to threats by Fulani jihadists and Miyetti Allah to attack Delta State for supporting the ban on open grazing.\n\nHe told reporters in Abuja that given their promptness in reacting to similar threats to herdsmen, he had expected Buhari and the Northern elders to condemn the threats to Delta State.\n\nThe group, on Sunday, had given Delta State a 72-hour ultimatum to review its ban on open grazing or risk an attack.\n\nThe group stated that it was angered by the fact that the Delta State Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, hosted the May 11, 2021 meeting of the governors of the 17 Southern states in Asaba, where they resolved to ban open grazing in their domains.\n\nWhile claiming to be protecting the Uthman Dan Fodio heritage of free open grazing in Nigeria and the entire West Africa sub-region, the group asked Okowa to disown the position of the Southern governors on open grazing of cattle.\n\nThe group threatened to attack Asaba and Agbor unless Okowa withdrew his support to open grazing ban.\n\nIt also claimed responsibility for last week\u2019s fire at the Federal Secretariat in Asaba, which destroyed the second floor office of the NYSC completely.\n\nBut in a counter move, another group, which identified itself as the Movement for the Emancipation and the Defence of the Niger Delta cautioned the self-styled \u2018Fulani Jihadists\u2019 group against attacking the state.\n\nClark, while condemning the silence of the federal government and Northern elders said open grazing was buried for good in all the 17 Southern states.\n\nAccording to him, the Northern elders who are always quick to accuse Igbo leaders of not publicly condemning the Nnamdi Kanu-led Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) have not deemed it fit to call the jihadists to order.\n\nHe expressed concern that less than one week after leaders of thought, traditional rulers and others, including himself, met on the state of the nation, the Fulani jihadists issued a threat to attack Delta State.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have watched with restrained patience, the reckless and irresponsible utterances of the so-called Fulani jihadists and the Miyetti Allah, who believe that they own Nigeria from the North to the sea, and, therefore, have the impunity to warn state governments, particularly the Delta State government and governor, to withdraw, within 72 hours, his decision against open grazing, recently taken by the 17 governors of the South, in a meeting held in Asaba.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have decided to issue this advice and warning to the federal government and the Fulani jihadists that the people of the Niger Delta will resist in such a way that will make it definitely impossible for the federal government\u2019s security forces to cope with should this action escalate.\n\n\u201cWe are reacting because this is not the first time the Fulani and their collaborators have insulted our people. It will be remembered that sometime in 2009, a legislator from Kebbi State in the National Assembly asked the federal government to resettle the people of the Niger Delta in another territory to create a conducive and unhindered atmosphere for the oil companies to operate.\n\n\u201cThat we warn, the resulting consequences will be very unpleasant to them. The federal government has continuously condoned them and behaving as if the federal government is the one giving support to these Fulani Jihadists and the Miyetti Allah because what is happening today in Nigeria, which has resulted in unprecedented insecurity and bad governance in Nigeria will be worse if they are not called to order by the federal government within the shortest time possible.\n\n\u201cFor some Fulani Jihadists to issue such insulting and provocative 72 hours\u2019 notice to the governor of Delta State, without the federal government and the elders of Northern extraction ever calling them to order, is most disappointing, considering that the same Northern elders were quick to accuse Igbo leaders of not publicly condemning IPOB.\n\n\u201cSuch impudence of the Fulani Jihadists will no longer be tolerated. They even claimed responsibility for the burning/bombing of the secretariat in Asaba, which also houses the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) Office.\u201d\n\nHe said the decision on open grazing and other decisions are taken on national interest by the 17 Southern governors received the full support of the people of Southern Nigeria, particularly the leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo of the South-east, PANDEF of the South-south and the Afenifere of the South-west.\n\nHe stated: \u201cWe will no longer tolerate hate and divisive statements targeted at deriding and insulting others, from these Fulani who believe Nigeria is exclusively theirs and other Nigerians are their subjects, and not their fellow citizens.\n\n\u201cI repeat, on behalf of Southerners, that open grazing has been finally buried in Southern Nigeria. For Mr. President to insist that open grazing should continue whereby he asked the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, to dig out the gazette that approved open grazing in the First Republic is unbelievable, unpatriotic and unacceptable to our people.\u201d\n\nClark also explained how far critical stakeholders have gone in addressing the crisis rocking the country, saying that \u201cin order to maintain and promote a peaceful Nigeria, I was among other 50 prominent Nigerians, including former heads of state, traditional rulers, former chief justices, that met for nine hours, under the leadership of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, recently on Thursday, 11th June 2021, at the Conference Hall of the Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja, where valuable decisions were taken to maintain and sustain the unity of this country.\u201d\n\nClark told Buhari to regard himself as president of one Nigeria, and not as president of the Fulani or the Northerners, adding that Nigerians shall resist, at all cost, any attempt to subjugate them.\n\nHe cautioned the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, against what he described as his irresponsible and unprofessional language, which he said is misleading the president.\n\nHe said: \u201cI also use this opportunity to seriously advise the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, over his irresponsible and unprofessional language, which is misleading and misdirecting Mr. President. Because the rhetoric question Mr. President asked during his interview with ARISE Television, whether Nigerians want him (Mr. President) to contradict the Attorney-General of the Federation, was based on his understanding of the AG\u2019s advice to him.\n\n\u201cThe AG\u2019s position is provided for in the constitution and he is expected to be independent of parochial and unconstitutional government decisions. He behaves as if his position is that of a minister of justice alone.\n\n\u201cThis was the reason why at the 2014 National Conference it was recommended that the post of the Attorney-General recognised by the constitution should be separated from that of the minister of justice who owes his allegiance to the government in power that appointed him.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, Mr. President is not aware, or he has not been advised by the AG that the Land Use Act, which vested ownership of land on the state governor is entrenched in the constitution of the country. Therefore, any gazette or law passed by any State or National Assembly is and will be null and void because the 1999 Constitution supersedes all such laws or gazette notices.\n\n\u201cThe President has no power or authority to impose open grazing on state governments. Such illegal actions which are a breach of the 1999 Constitution will not be accepted and will be legally resisted at all costs.\n\n\u201cTherefore, any law banning open grazing by state governments is not only legal and binding but is unchallengeable and binding on any person or group of persons, including the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nClark, however, appealed to the president to call for national dialogue over insecurity and general violence, with Nigerians of various ethnic nationalities, adding that the various calls by groups for secession and breakup of the country are not healthy.\n\nHe said the Buhari needed to have a peaceful government until his exit from office in 2023, and canvassed the restructuring of the nation and return to a federal system of government as it was in 1963, before the military took over in 1966.\n\nMEND Warns \u2018Fulani Jihadist\u2019 Group against Attack on Delta\n\nMeanwhile, a group, which identified itself as the Movement for the Emancipation and the Defence of the Niger Delta has cautioned a self-styled Fulani jihadist group against attacking Delta State.\n\nThe group warned of dire consequences should the Fulani or Usman Dan Fodio heritage leadership group carry out their threat to Delta and the governor, after the three-day ultimatum.\n\nIn the statement titled, \u201cResponse to the Fulani Threat to Okowa on Open Grazing by Southern Governors\u201d and signed off as \u201cDragon War, MEND\u201d, the group said: \u201cWe are warning that if your threat is made to come to fulfilment, No Fulani will ever exist across the Niger Delta and all oil facilities linked to a Fulani will be brought down. If one soul is lost, 10 Fulani souls will pay for it. If one facility is destroyed, 10 Fulani facilities will be destroyed. We will respond proportionately ten times whatever you give, the corresponding response will not be limited to the Delta, it may be with your politicians or with your rulers.\n\n\u201cWe will launch three rocket launchers and ballistic missiles at any facility of our choice as a warning in seven days if you make bold your threats.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t make cheap our threats. We have shut down the country and we can at any time shut you down. We are the Niger Delta. We stand for the interest of the Niger Delta and we will not allow any coward to threaten us. We fight without running. Be warned!\u201d\n\nHowever, the Delta State Police Command, in a statement by its spokesman, Mr. Bright Edafe, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, waved off the reported threat by the faceless group, describing it as inconsequential and something to simply ignore.\n\nThe statement by the police advised the people in the state to go about their lawful activities without fear of intimidation or attacks from any quarter.\n\nThe police attributed the source of the leaflet reportedly posted at different conspicuous points at Agbor and Asaba, including on walls near the Government House, as the handiwork of miscreants who were intent on creating panic among law-abiding residents in the state and escalating insecurity in the country.\n\nThe statement said the police were unwavering in their commitment to the security of lives and property of the people of Delta State.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Urges Buhari not to bully secessionists, forget open grazing\n\nJames Emejo, Emmanuel Addeh, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Mary Nnah in Lagos\n\nA Nobel laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, yesterday stated that Nigeria cannot remain one country if it fails to decentralise as fast as possible, adding that analysts, retired generals and others have maintained the same position.\n\nSoyinka spoke to ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, urging President Muhammadu Buhari to be more sensitive to the agitations of secessionists rather than bully them.\n\n\u201cIf it (Nigeria) fails to decentralise, some people use the word reconstruction, some use whatever. But if Nigeria fails to decentralise as fast as possible, manifestly, not as rhetoric, then Nigeria cannot stay together,\u201d he warned, adding: \u201cAgain, it\u2019s not Wole Soyinka saying this. Everybody has said it; generals have said it; ex-heads of state have said it; politicians have said it; analysts have said it; economists have said it. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening to people in the streets. That\u2019s why they are moving; that\u2019s why they are demonstrating; that\u2019s why they are defying threats from the police and from the government that if you demonstrate, you are traitors or you do this, we\u2019ll deal with you.\u201d\n\nSoyinka explained that people are no longer intimidated by Buhari\u2019s threat that \u2018we will talk to you in the only way you understand.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t wash with anybody any longer because if a nation is on a suicidal slide, the people who feel that they do not deserve that kind of suicidal plunge have a right to say \u2018sorry, I am getting off before it nosedives,\u201d he said.\n\nOn how to make the system work again, he said: \u201cIt relates to what I was saying earlier. It is because he (Buhari) is not listening or he\u2019s listening and he\u2019s not understanding so that we do not have this extreme moment to say, wait a minute, there is nobody out there, we better look after our own security, we better look after our own very existence.\u201d\n\nHe accused governors and senators of not doing enough to confront the challenges facing the country.\n\nHe said while the Senate has not utilised its powers to force the government to act the way it should, the governors appeared to be too timid to act.\n\nSoyinka added that Buhari is not listening to the yearnings of Nigerians, and his administration did not really understand the applications, full responsibilities and commitments involved in a democratic regime.\n\nHe said he was alarmed at the understanding of democracy by the top hierarchy of government.\n\nHe stated that the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria aborted the various channels of self-expression open to any kind of polity and abrogated the essence of democracy.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe politicians are not doing enough, especially the Senate. If you study the constitution very carefully, you will find out that they have certain powers which they haven\u2019t touched. I have discussed this with constitutional lawyers. There are certain areas in which they can act, they can force this government, compel this government to act the way it should.\n\n\u201cAnd that also applies especially to governors. The governors themselves are too tentative; they are too timid. There are certain areas of the constitution, in which, as I go back to my favourite expression, they can push the envelope, completely, so that we get a sense of governance at all tiers, and have synergy going on. I think people are ready to stand behind the leaders.\u201d\n\nSoyinka said Twitter\u2019s suspension showed that democracy means different things to different people.\n\nHe also condemned the language used by Buhari in his interview recently and even in his statements from Aso Rock in relation to those who are clamouring for secession.\n\nAccording to him, when a group makes such agitations, any sensitive leadership must learn to understand this and respond to the reasons behind those agitations and not start threatening and bullying and trying to intimidate people because they are giving vent to deep-seated grievances.\n\nHe added: \u201cFor instance, there was a question I listened to President Buhari on this very channel (ARISE) about the position of the various governors on open grazing. At least 50 per cent of the nation has their representatives, saying that within the constitution, within the democratic dispensation that we say we are operating- we are saying on behalf of our people that we do not want open grazing anymore. And then somebody sits in Aso Rock and says to them that well, there is a cattle constitution, I am instructing my attorney-general to dig up some kind of law, colonial law which arbitrated between farmers and herders\u2026so that I can recover on behalf of a certain private business, the whole routes \u2013 which means that he is not listening to what people are saying, he\u2019s not listening to what the governors representing them are saying.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s saying I am going to restore the routes by referring to some colonial arrangements. Now, when I listen to a thing like that I really despair. I want to say this, it was a very instructive interview, and no doubt there was nothing new. One was just hoping that this government had transcended that kind of partisan thinking.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022FG committed to its loans repayment obligations, Says Amaechi\n\nJames Emejo, Kasim Sumaina in Abuja and Mary Nnah in Lagos\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, yesterday unfolded plans by the federal government to take more Chinese loans to expand rail services to more states.\n\nAmaechi, who featured on \u2018The Morning Show,\u2019 a programme on ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, said the federal government had already begun negotiations for the loans.\n\nIf granted, it will balloon Nigeria\u2019s public debt stock, which, according to data from the Debt Management Office (DMO), stood at $87.239 billion as of March 31, 2021.\n\nAlready, there has been an outcry against Nigeria\u2019s rising debt profile since 2015.\n\nLast Thursday, Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, had admitted that the federal government was exceeding its borrowing plan for 2021.\n\nAhmed, in an interview with France 24, monitored by THISDAY, had blamed the development on the COVID-19 pandemic and the fall in oil prices.\n\nHowever, Amaechi said Nigeria had been fulfilling its loan obligations as it had never defaulted in the repayment of loans, especially for the railway projects.\n\nHe stated that the federal government had so far repaid over $150 million out of the $500 million facility secured by the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan for the Abuja-Kaduna railway.\n\nThe minister added that monthly revenue from the Abuja-Kaduna railway operation has increased from N70 million to N350 million as of May.\n\nHe also refuted the suggestion that some obnoxious clauses in the Chinese loan agreements may lead to mortgaging Nigeria\u2019s assets in the case of default.\n\nThe minister clarified that he was not behind the recent suspension of the Managing Director of the Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA), Ms. Hadiza Bala-Usman.\n\nHe said Bala-Usman was not suspended but only asked to \u2018step aside\u2019 to enable an investigation into the management of the authority from 2016 to date.\n\nAmaechi said President Muhammadu Buhari would decide on the resumption of the embattled NPA boss after the conclusion of the probe.\n\nAmaechi said: \u201cWhen you take the loan, you are expected to pay back and as we are talking today we are paying back.\n\n\u201cUnder the regime of former President Goodluck Jonathan, the loan for Abuja \u2013 Kaduna was about $500 million. As of today, we have paid over $150 million on that loan.\n\n\u201cAnd Nigeria has never defaulted when it comes to loan repayment. And I don\u2019t also expect that we will default on any other loan we have taken.\n\n\u201cThe loan for Ibadan-Kano is about $1.5 billion. The rest of $500 million came from our budget. I expect that whatever loans we take we will be able to pay.\n\n\u201cI am not aware that there is any clause in the loan agreement that hands over any of our national assets to China.\n\n\u201cYes, in default they go to court and it depends on the outcome of the court case, but I am not aware that there is anything in all the clauses signed by this government or the previous government of Goodluck Jonathan that mortgaged any of our national assets.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the total reconstruction of the narrow gauge line of the Port Harcourt to Maiduguri railway as well as that of Kano -Maradi will commence in June.\n\nHe added that the Lagos-Kano narrow gauge is currently being negotiated with different interest groups willing to rehabilitate it.\n\nHe explained: \u201cWhat we are going to start this June is the total reconstruction of the narrow gauge line.\n\nWe are rehabilitating Port Harcourt -Maiduguri and at the same time the president has directed that contract be awarded for the standard gauge, which should be funded when the next government comes.\n\n\u201cBut the difference between the narrow gauge and the standard gauge is just the speed. The Lagos -Kano narrow gauge is the one we are negotiating with different interest groups who want to rehabilitate.\n\n\u201cThat one is for rehabilitation. And when they finish rehabilitation, they will then run it by themselves and make their money and pay themselves back. We\u2019ve not even commenced negotiation.\u201d\n\nAmaechi said more Chinese loans would be needed to extend the railway services to other states.\n\nHe said although the Lagos-Ibadan rail line had been completed, the services were still skeletal because it would take six months to test equipment to ensure they are in perfect condition.\n\nHe, however, stated that to extend the railway service from Ibadan to Osogbo and from Kano to Kaduna as well as other states in the country, the country would need to get more Chinese loans of which negotiations were already in progress.\n\n\u201cIt takes six months to know that that equipment is in perfect condition. We would continue to test the equipment so that we do not have any train accidents. So we are moving from just two services in a day to four. It will be a gradual progression and I believe that by the end of the year, we will be doing 16 trips in a day,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe also said the continuation of the rail line would only commence when the Chinese loan was obtained, adding that the ministry has already mobilised contractors with some funds pending when the implementation of the loan facility would be concluded.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we get the Chinese loan, we would commence the construction of Ibadan to Abuja, but before the end of this month, we should commence some of the Kano-Kaduna rail. We have already mobilised the contractors with some funds and we would fund it initially from our budget pending when the implementation of the loan facility would be concluded\u201d, Amaechi said.\n\nOn the security of the railway system against the backdrop of the activities of vandals and other economy saboteurs, Amaechi canvassed the amendment of the law to make perpetrators liable for manslaughter as well as serve as a deterrence to others.\n\nHe said terminal operators must contribute to the total reconstruction and reorganisation of the Apapa seaport.\n\nAccording to him, the Apapa seaport\u2019s only problem is efficiency, citing the drastic change in the port on the day the president visited to inaugurate the Deep Blue Project.\n\nHe said: \u201cI was in the train with the president on that day and noticed that everything had disappeared, even inside the port that looked like a marketplace was very well organised; no persons were found loitering about, no trucks.

          "text": "Says terminal operators to contribute to reconstruction of Apapa port\n\nSays deep blue project to solve maritime insecurity, boost revenue, reduce oil production cost\n\nBy Kasim Sumaina\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Mr. Chibuike Rotimi, has said the problem of Apapa seaport is efficiency, citing the drastic changes in the Port on the day the President visited to commission the Deep Blue Project.\n\nHe also said that terminal operators must contribute to the total reconstruction and reorganisation of the Apapa Seaport.\n\nThe Minister stated this Monday when he appeared as a guest on The Morning Show on Arise TV, THISDAY broadcast arm.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI was in the train with the President on that day and noticed that everything had disappeared, even inside the Port that looked like a market place was very well organised, no persons were found loitering about, no trucks. What it shows is that the problem of the Seaport is the problem of efficiency.\u201d\n\nHe observed that if they had the capacity in just one night, \u201cbecause I was there the previous evening, and when I came back in the morning, everything had disappeared; If that can happen in one night, it means that the problem is management, nothing else. Do we need to wait for the President to come before we can be efficient?\u201d Amaechi queried.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve done, was to have a meeting with the terminal operators, and I told them that they have to contribute to the reconstruction of the Apapa Seaport. We must rebuild the Apapa Seaport, taking into cognisance all the issues that we are seeing now that is frustrating the Seaport, like where do you park the trucks, how many trucks are coming into the Seaport at what point in time?\n\n\u201cHow can a person come into the seaport who has no business being there, what is he doing at the Seaport? The Seaport is a security area and it\u2019s not for everybody, even me, after my tenure as Minister, I\u2019m not entitled to go into the Seaport unless I have business in the seaport\u201d, he added.\n\nAmaechi noted that the Ministry of Transportation will partner with the Customs and the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) to solve the problem, adding thatt freighting of cargoes from the Seaport through the rail, when it begins, will also help in arresting the situation at the Port.\n\n\u201cWe are going to partner with customs because they are largely involved. Between them and the NPA, they are the operators (or regulators) of the Seaport, and see how to arrest this situation. I believe that when we begin to freight cargoes from the seaport through the rail, we\u2019ll reduce some of the challenges that we have at the seaport\u201d, he said.\n\nAmaechi also spoke on the recently launched Deep Blue Project being overseen by the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) in partnership with the Ministry of Defence, stating that the project will not only boost security in the country\u2019s waters, but will also improve trade in the Gulf of Guinea and reduce cost of production for the Oil industry, while improving revenue for Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\nHe stressed that, \u201cbefore we came, various contractors were contracted to provide security for oil companies in the water. There was a case between the government and OMSL in which the company provides about 3 or 4 boats to the Navy and they collect $2500 per vessel for the first day and $1500 for about 30 days. In a year, like in 2020 they made about $67m, and when you hand over the security of a country to individuals, it becomes very challenging and irresponsible.\n\n\u201cSo, the President kindly approved that the Police, Army, Air force and other security agencies should be involved in providing security with the equipment that we have provided.\n\n\u201cWe have about 3 helicopters, 2 fixed-wing planes, 17 interceptor boats, 2 vessels, drones, and more; what it does is that it gives you information about where the criminals are, those who go and destroy pipes just because they are looking for oil to bunker.\n\n\u201cIt provides you that information, then you deter them or arrest them. So, we are able to provide security in the coastal region, both on land and on the sea. Now, those who provide the coastal security on land will be the Nigerian Army and the Police, and we\u2019ve provided them with all the necessary tools they need.\n\n\u201cWe have ammunition, we have vehicles, like Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) and all that for patrol by the coast. All that, we believe will begin to yield fruits between now and next year.\u201d\n\nExplaining further, Amaechi said, \u201cWhat , we\u2019ve done with Deep Blue project is that we will reduce the cost of producing oil in Nigeria, because in producing oil, they also build-in the cost of security. By the time we provide this security in the water, the economy will be improved because there will be more money coming into the economy. That\u2019s the impact it will have when it comes to the Deep Blue project.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the Israelis who did the training said in six months to one year, if there is no improvement in the economy in terms of how much comes in, both to NIMASA, NPA and the oil industry, \u2018come back to us and we\u2019ll be willing to refund.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut you know it is simple mathematics; It is true that the moment you can take away the criminals from the water, and the contractors from the water, then the cost of security which is borne either by NNPC or the Oil Companies will be part of what will come back to us as income. Then on land, in all our rail and train coaches, you have enough armed policemen in any trip we are making to withstand any criminal attack.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "After a prolonged delay, President Muhammadu Buhari has finally flagged off construction work for the Nigeria Liquified Natural Gas (NLNG) Train 7 project in Bonny Island, Rivers state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Train 7 project is a joint venture consortium that seeks to boost Nigeria\u2019s Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) output, whose largest shareholder is the Nigerian National Petroleum Commission (NNPC) with 49 percent shares.\n\nThe other shareholders include Shell Gas B.V (SGBV) with 25.6 percent; Total Gaz Electricite Holdings France, 15 percent stake; and Eni International (N.A) N.V.S.a.r.l, with 10.4 percent stake.\n\nThe project has been long coming and is only starting to materialise years after it was reportedly meant to have taken off under the Jonathan administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his book, \u201cFrom Storeroom to Boardroom: How Integrity and Courage Shape Global Business\u201d, Babs Omotowa, former chief executive officer (CEO) of NLNG, narrated how the lack of political support from former President Goodluck Jonathan \u201cdeliberately stalled\u201d the NLNG Train 7 project.\n\n\u2018TRAIN 7 WOULD COMPETE WITH BRASS LNG\u2019\n\nOmotowa said that after Jonathan had appointed Dizeani Alison-Madueke \u2014 who is also from Bayelsa, just as the president \u2014 as minister of petroleum resources in 2010, the government became more interested in situating the Brass LNG project in the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said Jonathan and Dizeani saw the location of the NLNG Train 7 project in Bonny Island in Rivers as a competition to the proposed Brass LNG in Bayelsa.\n\n\u201cAs a result, Train 7 fell from favour and remained stuck due to the loss of government support, which is crucial for any LNG project. However, we had to move as the window of opportunity was closing. Shale gas was adding competition, and a price decline was looming,\u201d the former NLNG CEO said in the book.\n\n\u201cThe pursuit of Train 7 became pivotal during my tenure. Its economics were good, and it ranked high in the portfolio of shareholders, including NOC. The challenge was (re)gain political support, crucial for a project of this magnitude as the government plays a big role in LNG projects worldwide.\n\n\u201cWith my team, I developed the engagement strategy. One strand was to enrol leaders with influence to sway the president and minister to enable us to bring shareholders (including NOC) on board. The other was to raise public awareness and clear the myths that had been released into the public domain in the past. Such as the myth that there was inadequate gas for domestic and export use.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAMAECHI \u2018COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY JONATHAN WAS NOT IN SUPPORT\u2019 OF TRAIN 7\n\nOmotowa also said he had contacted Rotimi Amaechi, then-governor of River, who was also in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) with Jonathan.\n\n\u201cTo enrol national and state leaders, we started naturally with River state, as the host of NLNG. Amaechi was in the same party as the then President. They were friends, and he had the president\u2019s ear,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cI explained Train 7 and the value it would bring to his state (jobs, $10 billion investment). NLNG would raise the finance itself. He was stuck that there was no requirement for the government to provide funds for the projects despite their value.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe was enthused by the benefits to his state (jobs) and country (revenue) and could not understand why the president and minister were not supportive.\u201d\n\nWeeks later, Omotowa said Amaechi told him that the president and the minister \u201cadmitted that they were withholding support until Brass LNG\u2019s final investment decision (FID) was sanctioned.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmaechi was furious. Others described it as agitated confrontation,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe disagreement about Train 7 was one of the issues that led to a breakdown in the relationship between Amaechi and the president.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOmotowa noted that the myth that the Train 7 project was in competition with Brass LNG was \u201cmyopic\u201d as the competition was between Nigeria and other countries and not projects in Nigeria.\n\n\u2026ENTER BUHARI \u2014 AND TRAIN 7 TOOK OFF\n\nOmotoba added that the NLNG team continued in their efforts to get the government\u2019s support up to the election of Buhari as president in May 2015. That was when things changed for good.\n\nAccording to him, \u201calong with the board, we met the new president in 2015. He knew of NLNG, having been Commissioner (Minister) for Petroleum Resources in 1976 and Chairman of NNPC in 1977, all as part of General Obasanjo\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cHe had become aware of the delay in Train 7 from our campaign. He said the government had originally planned for 12 trains. He was happy with the progress to six trains but disappointed that the previous administration had not supported the seventh train and eighth trains. He signalled to the oil minister and NOCGMD that they should provide support. This was a major outcome.\u201d\n\nThereafter, the Train 7 project made quick progress, resulting in the signing of the FID by shareholders in December 2019 and engineering procurement and construction EPC contract in 2020.",

          "text": "After a prolonged delay, President Muhammadu Buhari has finally flagged off construction work for the Nigeria Liquified Natural Gas (NLNG) Train 7 project in Bonny Island, Rivers state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Train 7 project is a joint venture consortium that seeks to boost Nigeria\u2019s Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) output, whose largest shareholder is the Nigerian National Petroleum Commission (NNPC) with 49 percent shares.\n\nThe other shareholders include Shell Gas B.V (SGBV) with 25.6 percent; Total Gaz Electricite Holdings France, 15 percent stake; and Eni International (N.A) N.V.S.a.r.l, with 10.4 percent stake.\n\nThe project has been long coming and is only starting to materialise years after it was reportedly meant to have taken off under the Jonathan administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his book, \u201cFrom Storeroom to Boardroom: How Integrity and Courage Shape Global Business\u201d, Babs Omotowa, former chief executive officer (CEO) of NLNG, narrated how the lack of political support from former President Goodluck Jonathan \u201cdeliberately stalled\u201d the NLNG Train 7 project.\n\n\u2018TRAIN 7 WOULD COMPETE WITH BRASS LNG\u2019\n\nOmotowa said that after Jonathan had appointed Dizeani Alison-Madueke \u2014 who is also from Bayelsa, just as the president \u2014 as minister of petroleum resources in 2010, the government became more interested in situating the Brass LNG project in the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said Jonathan and Dizeani saw the location of the NLNG Train 7 project in Bonny Island in Rivers as a competition to the proposed Brass LNG in Bayelsa.\n\n\u201cAs a result, Train 7 fell from favour and remained stuck due to the loss of government support, which is crucial for any LNG project. However, we had to move as the window of opportunity was closing. Shale gas was adding competition, and a price decline was looming,\u201d the former NLNG CEO said in the book.\n\n\u201cThe pursuit of Train 7 became pivotal during my tenure. Its economics were good, and it ranked high in the portfolio of shareholders, including NOC. The challenge was (re)gain political support, crucial for a project of this magnitude as the government plays a big role in LNG projects worldwide.\n\n\u201cWith my team, I developed the engagement strategy. One strand was to enrol leaders with influence to sway the president and minister to enable us to bring shareholders (including NOC) on board. The other was to raise public awareness and clear the myths that had been released into the public domain in the past. Such as the myth that there was inadequate gas for domestic and export use.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAMAECHI \u2018COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY JONATHAN WAS NOT IN SUPPORT\u2019 OF TRAIN 7\n\nOmotowa also said he had contacted Rotimi Amaechi, then-governor of River, who was also in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) with Jonathan.\n\n\u201cTo enrol national and state leaders, we started naturally with River state, as the host of NLNG. Amaechi was in the same party as the then President. They were friends, and he had the president\u2019s ear,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cI explained Train 7 and the value it would bring to his state (jobs, $10 billion investment). NLNG would raise the finance itself. He was stuck that there was no requirement for the government to provide funds for the projects despite their value.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe was enthused by the benefits to his state (jobs) and country (revenue) and could not understand why the president and minister were not supportive.\u201d\n\nWeeks later, Omotowa said Amaechi told him that the president and the minister \u201cadmitted that they were withholding support until Brass LNG\u2019s final investment decision (FID) was sanctioned.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmaechi was furious. Others described it as agitated confrontation,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe disagreement about Train 7 was one of the issues that led to a breakdown in the relationship between Amaechi and the president.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOmotowa noted that the myth that the Train 7 project was in competition with Brass LNG was \u201cmyopic\u201d as the competition was between Nigeria and other countries and not projects in Nigeria.\n\n\u2026ENTER BUHARI \u2014 AND TRAIN 7 TOOK OFF\n\nOmotoba added that the NLNG team continued in their efforts to get the government\u2019s support up to the election of Buhari as president in May 2015. That was when things changed for good.\n\nAccording to him, \u201calong with the board, we met the new president in 2015. He knew of NLNG, having been Commissioner (Minister) for Petroleum Resources in 1976 and Chairman of NNPC in 1977, all as part of General Obasanjo\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cHe had become aware of the delay in Train 7 from our campaign. He said the government had originally planned for 12 trains. He was happy with the progress to six trains but disappointed that the previous administration had not supported the seventh train and eighth trains. He signalled to the oil minister and NOCGMD that they should provide support. This was a major outcome.\u201d\n\nThereafter, the Train 7 project made quick progress, resulting in the signing of the FID by shareholders in December 2019 and engineering procurement and construction EPC contract in 2020.",

          "text": "Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers state, says it is wrong for President Muhammadu Buhari to abandon his constitutional responsibility of securing Nigerians for governors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring an interview with Arise TV on Thursday, Buhari said he told two south-west governors, who came to meet him in Abuja, to return to their states and tackle the security challenges their people are facing.\n\n\u201cI told them you campaigned to be elected and you are elected. I told them (to)go back and sort out themselves,\u201d the president had said.\n\nBut while inaugurating a road project in Etche LGA of Rivers on Tuesday, Wike said Buhari cannot shift the responsibility of securing Nigerians to governors when he is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement issued by Kelvin Ebiri, his spokesman, the governor was also quoted as saying that the Buhari administration lacks the strategy to restore peace across the country.\n\n\u201cMr President, you\u2019re the Commander- in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. You appoint Inspector General of Police (IG), you appoint the Chief of Army Staff, Chief of Naval Staff, the Commissioner of Police (CP), Director of Department of State Service (DSS) and other heads of security. Which one do we appoint? How can people appointed by Mr. President be under me?\u201d Wike asked.\n\n\u201cIt is not only to borrow money for Nigeria that you\u2019re in charge. You must also be in charge in other things including security. Who signed order 10? Is it the governors? It is not when things are going bad concerning security, and you say you\u2019re not in charge, and it becomes governors\u2019 responsibility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMr President should have come out openly and said, my APC governors, stop worrying me. Go back to your states and do your work. On that, I support him.\n\n\u201cThank God, Mr President knows that I am not one of those that go to visit him over one problem or the other. I, as the governor of Rivers under PDP, you\u2019ll never find me there.\u201d\n\nWike further said the federal government should admit that it can no longer fulfil promises made to Nigerians, and strive to lead the country out of its present challenges.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s sole trade union in the telecommunications industry, the Private Telecommunications and Communications Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PTECSSAN), has threatened to go on a nationwide three-day warning strike over alleged violation of national labour laws by employers. This could result in a disruption to cellular and data services, and potentially affect the broader economy.\n\nIn a statement reported by local media, the association said it was embarking on the strike from June 16 to protest against \u201carbitrary sackings and casualisation\u201d as well as disregard for decent conditions of employment, among other allegations.\n\nAccording to reports, less than 5% of workers in the telecoms industry are hired on a permanent basis with most companies relying on subcontracting and outsourcing, a practice that shortchanges workers. Meanwhile, big telecom operators are reportedly laying off their managerial staff for reasons tied to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe association\u2019s president, Opeyemi Tomori, and General Secretary Okonu Abdullahi cited increasing precarious working conditions in the sector, such as disregard for occupational health and safety, lack of hazard allowance and poor remuneration, and the abuse of national laws and institutions by employers.\n\nPTECSSAN also alleged breaches of the freedom of association, the right of workers to organise, victimisation of union members, poor and discriminatory remuneration, abuse of the expatriate quota, intimidation, harassment and verbal assaults of employees, among other anti-labour practices.\n\nTelecom operators reportedly do not allow trade unionism and deny workers\u2019 rights to collective bargaining as spelled out in International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions.\n\nPTECSSAN demanded that HUAWEI Technologies Nigeria Limited, ATC, 9mobile, Globacom, Smile, IHS, Airtel, IPNX Nigeria, Spectranet, MAINONE, Ntel, Swift and other companies that have not allowed their employees to join labour unions should respect the right of the workers to freely associate with the association.\n\nLast year, the association clashed with MTN Nigeria over similar allegations, having accused the South African telco of discrimination against Nigerians and disregard of workers\u2019 rights. The Nigerian government had to step in to avert a strike action planned by the union.\n\nThe state might have to intervene in this case again due to the magnitude. If embarked on, the planned industrial action would be the first nationwide strike by workers in the telecoms industry. It is sure to disrupt services across the country, with potential huge losses for businesses and individuals.\n\nAffiliated with the National Labour Congress, PTECSSAN is one of the largest trade associations in Nigeria being the only union in the telecommunications sector. It has as members all the employees in the industry.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share in your whatsapp groups and telegram channels.",

The round was co-led by Sawari Ventures and Arzan Venture Capital with participation from Egypt Ventures, EFG-EV, Cairo Angels, and Khwarizmi Ventures.\n\nThe company was founded in late 2019 by Hossam Ali, Ahmed Anwar, and Abdallah Moheb El-Din, and had previously raised an undisclosed amount of money in a seed round in July.\n\nFatura sells inventory to grocery retailers using a network of manufacturers and wholesalers in different industries. It has been operating in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector since its launch.\n\nThe startup uses an asset-light approach, which means it doesn\u2019t own any inventory and, through its mobile app, simply shares orders with producers and distributors who fulfil them.\n\nThere are currently over 500 sellers on the marketplace who have served 25,000 retailers through Fatura\u2019s platform in 20 governorates across Egypt. More than 10,000 stock keeping units (SKUs) are exchanged on the business-to-business (B2B) platform, which has already crossed 1 billion Egyptian pounds (about $64 million) in yearly gross merchandise value (GMV).\n\n\u201cThere is a great opportunity in the B2B space in Egypt that is growing as the players are becoming digitally mature and ready. Collectively, the digital B2B players in the FMCG space capture less than five percent of the market and there is a long way to go,\u201d Hossam Ali said in an official press release announcing the latest funding.\n\nAfter recording significant success in the consumer goods sector, Fatura is now running a pilot in other industries.\n\nIt has already introduced a digital lending service with a focus on retail financing and aims to add more services in that area in the near future. Beyond e-commerce and lending, the startup expects the investment to help it extend its services with a view to optimising the exchange of goods, money and information in the B2B context while focusing on convenience and user experience.\n\nThe startup plans to use the new funds to introduce services that support the different players in its ecosystem, offer several digitisation initiatives with a focus on digital payments, and expand to other countries in the North African region.\n\nOn the company\u2019s future expansion plans, the CEO said Fatura\u2019s conviction is to \u201cstay asset-light, be inclusive to all the industry stakeholders and to attract the best on-ground acquisition force across the country.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share in your whatsapp groups and telegram channels.",

          "text": "Ethiopia has announced a tender process for the sale of a 40% stake in state-owned telecommunications company, Ethio Telecom. That means potential investors can now register their interest starting Tuesday. This is the first stage in a lengthy process that will lead to the selection of a successful bidder.\n\nThe proposed minority sale of Ethio Telecom \u2013 the sole mobile services provider in a country of over 100 million people \u2013 is part of a broader plan to liberalise the country\u2019s monopolistic telecoms sector. In addition, two foreign carriers are to be granted licenses to operate in the hugely untapped market.\n\n\u201cThe government wants state-owned enterprises to be competitive and productive, the authorities\u2019 motivation for selling a part of Ethio Telecom to private operators,\u201d Deputy Director of Public Enterprises, Holding and Administration Agency, Zinabu Yirga, said at a press conference in the capital Addis Ababa on Monday. \u201cAs part of the broader opening up of the sector, Ethiopia is also moving to license private operators to compete with Ethio Telecom.\u201d\n\nAnnounced in 2019 and driven by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, the liberalisation plan has been met with several delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic and an internal crisis in the Tigray region.\n\nHowever, the plan has gathered pace over the past six months. In May, the government awarded one of the two available private operating licences to break up Ethio Telecom\u2019s monopoly on the sector.\n\nThe Global Partnership for Ethiopia, a telco-consortium led by Kenya\u2019s Safaricom, was announced as the winner after a successful bid of around $850 million. Meanwhile, a second offer of around $600 million from South Africa\u2019s MTN Group was deemed too low by the regulator, which is now preparing to reauction the final licence.\n\nAccording to Brook Taye, a senior advisor at the finance ministry, the 40% in Ethio Telecom will be sold as a single stake to a single investor. It is however unclear how much the stake would be worth but the tender process is sure to attract significant interest from many telcos around the world.\n\nThis is due to the attractiveness of Ethiopia\u2019s untapped telecoms market. In a population of over 100 million people, only about 20% have access to the Internet, less than 40% have a mobile phone and only 5.8% of the people use social media, according to a report from DataReportal.\n\nFounded in November 2010, Ethio Telecom currently has around 53 million subscribers and has since December generated a revenue of around $600 million. According to reports, the government plans to retain a 55% stake in the operator while the remaining 5% will be offered to domestic investors through an initial public offering.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share in your whatsapp groups and telegram channels.",

          "text": "A new online conversation App, tribe naija has berthed in the Nigerian online space. The App is a community-based platform specifically developed for Nigerians to network and have conversations on issues of common interest.\n\nThe tribe naija App was launched in Abuja on June 12, 2021 during the Fireside Chat event held at the Sheu Musa Yar\u2019Adua Centre in commemoration of Democracy Day.\n\nThe App, which is currently available for download on the Google Apps store and IOS for iPhone users is a brainchild of the Advocacy for One Nigeria Initiative, The Advocacy for One Nigeria Initiative\n\nSpeaking during the launch of the App, the founder, Advocacy for One Nigeria Initiative, Chief Kola Abiola, son of Late Chief MKO Abiola, winner of the June 12, 1993 election described the platform as a \u2018child of necessity\u2019 that has come to give Nigerians the opportunity to bring their voice together especially as it relates to issues that affect them.\n\nAccording to him, the creation of the App was informed by the need to use technology to promote cohesion and inclusion among Nigerians using some of the knowledge or lessons gained from political leaders and thinkers such as Moshood Abiola and Shehu Yar\u2019Adua among others while they were alive.\n\nAbiola noted that the tribe naija App, developed and designed by Mewa international LLC, is expected to serve as a safe haven for Nigerians to talk and be heard. He stressed that the platform would offer Nigerians regardless of age a forum to discuss and chat about all the issues affecting their well being as citizens.\n\nHe disclosed that the app is meant to drive like-minded conversations geared towards the improvement of the country and create a platform for them to prepare for a better future.\n\n\u201cBy speaking, we would erase the divide and understand each other better. I think to a great degree we would see that we have a lot more than we think we have in common and that is why this app has been developed. We have been working on the development of the app for more than 2 years even though I have been nurturing this idea ten years ago. On this app, there is a voice note. You can leave messages through voice notes.

          "text": "Gbenga Okejimi, Country Manager for Nigeria and Ghana, WorldRemit\n\nNigeria remains the largest recipient of diaspora remittance in Sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 in 2019, it received nearly half of the remittances sent to the region at $23.8 billion. Money transfers sent from Nigerians living and working in the diaspora have always been an important source of income for families and the Nigerian economy. According to PWC report titled \u201cStrength from Abroad\u201d, remittances can have a strong impact on development because of the ripple effect on consumption, investment and economic growth.\n\nTechnological innovations continue to ease the process of sending and receiving money, thus facilitating growth. Digital money transfer methods have made cross border financial transactions, and now, a process that could otherwise take days has been reduced to just a few minutes. The uptake of digital financial services at home means that more Nigerians can send and receive money from across the world. The process has been supported by favourable regulations from the Central Bank of Nigeria to boost remittances inflow.\n\nAs online payments continue to get faster and more convenient, and as Nigerians pivot to digital channels for remittance transfer, service providers must deliver secure connections for these digital transactions and reduce the risk of cybercrime.\n\nAt WorldRemit, we take very seriously the privacy and security of our customers. Our website and apps are designed to prevent accounts from unauthorized login attempts; we have strict verification processes to ensure that we correctly identify all of our customers and have a team of dedicated analysts who monitor transactions for signs of unusual activity.\n\nWe have provided a secure platform and developed a robust verification model but as a company that goes the extra mile we want our customers to stay aware of the following tips to avoid wahala:\n\nBeware of fake brands and businesses. A common trick involves impersonation, a user behind a fake social media account may attempt to convince you that they\u2019re someone they\u2019re not to gain your trust. Look out for catchphrases like \u2018invest and reap 10x return\u2019, once you\u2019ve parted with your money you\u2019re unlikely to be able to contact the fake account again. Verify users, brands and businesses before transacting with them. Where possible contact the brand directly via their website and ask for recommendations from trusted parties before making transactions or investments.\n\nDownload apps only from reliable sources. Make sure that you only download apps from reliable sources, make use of verified links from the organizations\u2019 websites and official social media accounts. Use your app store on Apple devices, or the google play store on Android devices, etc. Take extra care before downloading an app, confirm that it provides a service that is recognized by local and international financial services authorities.\n\nNever share your passwords and token codes. Legitimate financial services providers will never ask you to share your passwords, token codes or any other private information. While your credit or debit card pin can be used to complete payments online, and your Bank verification Number (BVN) might need to be submitted within an app or website, to digital financial services providers, in the process of setting up your personal account, you must never share these details via message requests from supposed providers. Go the extra mile and make sure the money transfer service is committed to protecting your personal data. At WorldRemit, our payment partners in recipient countries will verify your identity, while ensuring your data is protected at all times. We also respect privacy policies in line with the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) requirements and will never share data with any third party.\n\nConfirm the recipient\u2019s identity and channel. Always confirm the identity of your recipient, this is anyone seeking financial assistance from you or offering unsolicited investment opportunities. If you suspect that your emails have been hacked, confirm the transaction directly, or through a regulatory authority before completing the process. For transactions via WorldRemit, confirm the recipient\u2019s identity and how they will receive the money, whether it is cash pickup, mobile money, or bank transfer. Make sure you are using the beneficiary\u2019s full legal name, as the bank in the receiving country will match their identification with the transfer information.\n\nSpeed is of the essence. Pick a service that ensures your money reaches its intended destination quickly and securely. 90% of transfers made with WorldRemit are authorized within minutes. Also, check if the platform has a 24-hour customer care service that is operational. At WorldRemit, our customer service is available 24/7.\n\nTrack your money transfer. The part of the operation where most safety is required is in the monitoring of the transaction. When sending money, WorldRemit enables users to monitor the status of their transactions, providing senders as well as recipients with status updates along the way for peace of mind. Last year, WorldRemit launched a Transfer Tracker App which allows recipients of money transfers to track their funds. The app is free to download through the Google app store in a number of countries including Nigeria.\n\nDisclaimer: WorldRemit and its affiliates do not provide financial advice. This article has been prepared for informational purposes only, and is not intended to provide, and should not be relied on for financial advice.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

Source:MENAbytes\n\nEgypt-based Business to Business (B2B) e-commerce platform, Fatura, announced a $3 million pre-series A round on Monday, June 14, 2021. Sawari Ventures and Arzan Venture Capital led the round.\n\nOther investors in the round include Egypt Ventures, The Cairo Angels, Saudi Arabia-based VC, Khwarizmi Ventures, and fintech-focused accelerator, EFG-EV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering, a pre-series A round is fundraising done by a startup in the interim between the seed round and the series A round. In July 2020, the startup raised an undisclosed seed round, and this is their second funding round since then.\n\nFatura is a platform that sells grocery inventories to Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) retailers via a mobile application. With a network that connects manufacturers with wholesalers, the startup can meet those inventory needs. On the app, sellers can manage their pricing lists, manage stocks, and receive orders.\n\nThis latest funding will be used to expand to more cities in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The startup also plans to go beyond meeting retailers\u2019 need for FMCGs and create additional services like a digital payment platform to foster ease-of-business for retailers.\n\nCo-founded by Hossam Ali, Ahmed Anwar, AbdAllah Mohebeldin, and Ahmed Al Bakary \u2014 who joined the team later \u2014 Fatura launched in Cairo, Egypt, in 2020. So far, the startup has 500 sellers, wholesalers, distributors, and manufacturers on the marketplace, having provided service to 25,000 retailers across Egypt.\n\nThings have been quite interesting, as the MENA region\u2019s e-commerce sector has experienced steady growth. According to a Bain & Company report, it was worth $8.3 billion as of 2017, with an average annual growth rate of 25%, most of which Egypt accounts for.\n\nWith such significant growth, we could witness the rise of more startups with product offerings geared towards boosting Egypt\u2019s e-commerce sector.\n\nEthiopian government to sell 40% stake of Ethio Telecom\n\nThe Ethiopian Communications Authority (ECA) has launched a tender to aid the partial privatisation of state-owned telecommunication operator, Ethio Telecom. With this in place, interested private investors can apply, and the chosen bidder will own a 40% stake in Ethio Telecom.\n\nProspective investors have to go through a few stages, the first being submitting a special form-like request called Expression of Interest (EOI). Other stages in the process will be revealed later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthiopia is one of the few countries globally to have a monopoly on telecom providers. However, this move is part of plans to open up the country\u2019s largest and most lucrative sector to private investors.\n\nIn February, we reported that Kenyan telecom giant, Safaricom, was one of the final six companies shortlisted for bids on two telecom licences in Ethiopia. And they got it in May, alongside Sumitomo Corporation and the CDC Group.\n\nThis move to sell off a 40% stake to private investors further shows the country\u2019s commitment to encouraging healthy competition in the region, as shielding the sector from competition might slow down innovation.\n\nHowever, we shouldn\u2019t be quick to forget Ethiopia\u2019s erratic approach to Internet censorship,\n\nYouTube to ban certain topics from its masthead ad banner\n\nGoogle-owned video-sharing platform, YouTube, has made some updates to its masthead ad placement policies.\n\nBeginning from Monday, June 21, 2021, YouTube will not allow ads about alcohol sale, gambling, prescription drugs, elections, and politics to run on its homepage \u2014 the platform\u2019s biggest ad unit.\n\nPer Axios, this move is a part of Google\u2019s commitment to \u201cminimize confusion, misinformation and manipulation, especially surrounding sensitive events.\u201d\n\nOne might wonder if YouTube isn\u2019t too late to the party, as giant social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have since placed bans on ads related to political topics. This story gives further context to how these bans took effect during Nigeria\u2019s general elections in 2019.\n\nYou might want to make some excuses for YouTube. Perhaps, the platform wasn\u2019t as strongly exploited as Facebook and Twitter, so the need for permanent restriction measures didn\u2019t arise. However, they placed a temporary ban on political ads following the January 6 Capitol Insurrection.\n\nBut then, the best-performing videos on YouTube are usually longer than 10 minutes, enough time to capture nuance and context that Twitter and Facebook inherently can\u2019t.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\n#WorldBloodDonorDay: 5 startups improving access to safe blood in Africa.

          "text": "You don\u2019t need to be a medical expert to know the value of blood to humans. At a basic level, most people understand that the absence of blood in a human is fatal, yet blood donation rates in most African countries are low.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), about 112.5 million blood donations are collected worldwide. Still, more than half of this number is gathered in high-income countries \u2014 home to only 19% of the world\u2019s population.\n\nWorryingly, the United Nations estimates that more than 536,000 women die during childbirth, with 99% of them living in developing countries. Postpartum haemorrhage is the leading cause of deaths, responsible for 40% of maternal deaths in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nBlood donation and supply remain major challenges in Africa as health officials battle logistical problems and cultural barriers. Consequently, family and friends donate most of the blood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not sustainable as family and friends of accident victims, for example, may not be readily available to donate blood. Worse still, they may not be matching blood donors.\n\nSolving Africa\u2019s blood donation problem requires more than calling for voluntary donors. In most places, officials have to contend with superstitions or cultural limitations that make people unwilling to donate.\n\nAlso, the infrastructure needed to transport the blood is often absent in most parts of the continent. With Africa\u2019s infrastructure challenges, it is difficult to say how many lives have been lost because they lacked access to blood.\n\nWHO advises that most of the blood donated come from voluntary donors, but that is not the case in all countries, especially in developing ones.\n\nIn Nigeria, the National Coordinator of the National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS), Dr Omale Amedu, revealed that only 5% of the blood collected in the country were from voluntary donors, with the remaining 95% commercially provided.\n\nMost African countries can\u2019t meet their annual blood requirements and increase millions of women, children, and accident victims\u2019 risk of mortality (ROM). In 2016, WHO estimated that Africa only covered 50% of its blood requirements.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Ministry of Health, for example, reports that the country needs 2 million units of blood annually but only collects 60,000 units. Cameroon, on the other hand, needs about 400,000 units of blood but collects only 90,000 units. The trend of supply failing to meet demand is common across Africa.\n\nThe startups below are using technology to solve the problems blood banks and hospitals face and close the gap between supply and demand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLifebank\n\nTemie Giwa-Tubosun founded Lifebank in 2016. After suffering complications during pregnancy and needing a blood transfusion in the United States, she began to think of the millions of women back in Nigeria who could have lost their lives if they had been in her shoes.\n\nIn a 2019 interview with CNN, the entrepreneur said, \u201cI realised after I had my son that the highest cause of maternal mortality is postpartum haemorrhage. The most important thing you can do when a mum is haemorrhaging is replacing the blood she has lost, even if you can\u2019t stop the bleeding.\u201d\n\nThis epiphany was all she needed to start Lifebank to connect blood banks with hospitals and their patients. Since its inception, the startup has reportedly served over 500 hospitals while maintaining a presence in Nigeria and Kenya.\n\nIt has also expanded its operations from moving only blood to other medical supplies like oxygen and blood products.\n\nThe startup has gained global recognition, with Facebook Founder, Mark Zuckerberg, commenting on the startup.\n\n\u201cThis is a thing [Lifebank] that needs to exist. If she can actually pull it off, she\u2019ll show a model that will impact not just Lagos, not just Nigeria, but countries all around the world.\u201d\n\nInfiuss\n\nWhile Cameroonian entrepreneur, Melissa Jane Bime, was in nursing school, a young girl at the hospital where she worked who had come down with malaria could not get a blood transfusion. She died as a result. Plasmodium falciparum is the most common malaria parasite in Africa accounting for 99.7% of estimated malaria cases in 2018. It multiplies very quickly, causing serious blood loss.\n\nBime would later ascertain that a hospital 20 minutes away had the right blood all along. That was all the motivation she needed.\n\nIn 2016, Bime started Infiuss, a blood bank management system that connects hospitals with blood banks with hospitals without a blood bank. The startup is the recipient of the 2018 Cartier Women\u2019s Initiative Award and was the grand prize winner of the 2018 Anzisha Prize.\n\nDamu-Sasa\n\nAfter Nairobi\u2019s Westgate terror attack in 2013, the government appealed for blood donations to save survivors. And thousands of Kenyans turned up, but there was a problem. Although many people around the country were willing to donate, logistical challenges meant that only those in Nairobi could.\n\nThis led Francis Kilemi and Aaron Ogunde to create a solution that leverages technology to solve the problems of sourcing and donating blood.\n\nWith help from Kenya\u2019s Information and Communication Technology Authority, the startup piloted the project in Kenyatta Hospital in 2017. Since then, their reach has spread to over 100 hospitals across Kenya.\n\nDamu-Sasa is a Kenyan healthtech startup that works across the blood ecosystem. It connects hospitals with blood banks or donors and assists in screening, tracking, storage, distribution, preparation of blood products, and inventory management.\n\nRedbank\n\nRedbank homepage\n\nFounded in 2014 by Francis Adereti, Toluwanimi Adeyanju, and Tunde Ojediran, Redbank functions quite similarly to Lifebank.\n\nHowever, in addition to a mobile app, blood requests can be made via SMS and voice calls. The startup matches received requests with the appropriate blood banks. And according to the company, people can expect responses within 30 seconds of making their requests.\n\nUnlike other startups in the space, Redbank does not handle deliveries. It only provides information on which blood banks have the blood that is needed.\n\nThe startup has increased its reach by striking partnerships with the Nigerian Red Cross Society and the Blood Bank Society of Nigeria.\n\nHaima Health Initiative\n\nHaima Health Initiative homepage\n\nBukola Bolarinwa is a lawyer and a recipient of the Queen\u2019s Young Leader Award. As a child, her parents often told her there were things she could not do. But it was not until she was older she learnt why \u2014 she had sickle cell disease.\n\nWhile in law school, she became friends with Nkechi Azinge, who would go on to found the Sickle Cell Aid Foundation (SCAF). During this time, Bolarinwa volunteered at hospitals and discovered that sickle cell patients frequently needed blood transfusions.\n\nHowever, the hospitals often lacked sufficient blood. This led her to start Haima Health Initiative, which has evolved into an online voluntary blood donor register. It organises blood drives and educates people on the benefits of blood donation.\n\nWhile these startups are doing their part in ensuring that blood and blood products are available to those who need them, the success of their efforts depends on regular voluntary donors. According to WHO, 90% of people eligible to donate blood aren\u2019t doing so.\n\nResearch shows that one donated unit of blood can save up to three lives. We can\u2019t all build startups that save lives, but we can donate blood regularly and save lives in our little way.\n\nHappy World Blood Donor Day.",

Lately corps members are being deployed to meet the needs of the health care system in the region, owing to the state government\u2019s failure to employ more doctors and nurses.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cHow do the NYSC authority want us to work and contribute our quota to the development of our mother\u2019s land in an areas that are not safe, where kidnappers on daily basis invade the areas, even with the presence of security operatives\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are appealing to the presidency and the National Assembly to intervene and reason along with us because It\u2019s just a sucide mission\u201d, he said.\n\nHe also noted that there were hardly any provisions made for the corps members in terms of accommodation and security.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe country\u2019s insecurity has affected various states in Nigeria, and it is becoming alarming. This is to the Director-General of NYSC; please allow all corps members to relocate or redeploy to their states of choice.\n\n\u201cWe expect that when posted to a camp, and after you manage to spend three weeks in camp, you should be able to relocate to your state of choice irrespective of your state of origin or course of study because the country is unstable right now.\n\n\u201cThe NYSC DG has made relocation difficult for doctors, nurses, medical laboratory scientists and pharmacists and people who studied some other courses.\n\n\u201cWe observe that some failed State governments are using these sets of people in place of doctors and nurses that ought to be in the system. The government has refused to employ workers, so corps members in the medical profession are used in hospitals as the major staff members instead of a support system.\n\n\u201cThey have refused to relocate us to where we want to go because it feels safe for us. At a time like this, we need to be around our family or relatives and not just in any state, so it is so wrong to disapprove our relocation requests.\n\n\u201cI believe we have just one life to live and our lives are more important than where we are posted to work. I am a medical doctor, posted to Jos, Plateau State, but due to the insecurity, we decided to redeploy from there and some of my colleagues used medical reports, which showed they were not OK. The criteria for leaving were medical reasons or insecurity, or marriage, so we submitted our relocation form. I left the orientation camp because I was not too fine; I wanted to go back to Delta.\n\n\u201cIn my camp, only about two persons were allowed to relocate out of about 33 doctors and those who got theirs were seriously connected. Should we go to the North and die because I am a government child?\n\n\u201cOf all my friends who are also medical practitioners, only about four were posted to Ekiti, Osun and other southern states; the rest were taken to Sokoto and Kaduna. One of us encountered bandits on his way to Sokoto; he escaped, though and we had to ask him to put on his WhatsApp location to know wherever he was going.\n\n\u201cThe accommodation they give corps members is not befitting. My friend in Borno told me they lost a corps member, a pharmacist, during the camp. She was 24 years old and she had started panting after they played volleyball. They rushed her to the clinic but in less than 10 minutes, she died. The clinic had no oxygen. It was after she died that the oxygen arrived. So the official there told them to lie that the lady died at the referral hospital. You can imagine this\u201d, the corper disclosed\n\n...",

          "text": "Adebayo Obajemu\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo has launched the Dash Me Store, an outfit of the Dash Me Foundation founded by the immediate past Minister of Finance, Mrs Kemi Adeosun.\n\nThe store is established to mobilise resources for onward distribution to vulnerable people in the society via grassroots charities.\n\nThe Vice President during the opening on Sunday said, \u201cI am excited to be here for several reasons, but most of all because of Mrs Adeosun\u2019s commitment to the notion that all service to man is actually service to God, and she took that very seriously.\n\n\u201cThis is why, as Minister, she prioritized the Social Investment Programmes, when for the first time, the country voted almost N500B of our annual budget to welfare programmes which are called the Social Investment Programmes, which involved engaging 500,000 young men and women and also giving microcredit to about 2 million traders and also a home-grown school feeding programme for 9.5 million children daily in public schools across the country.\n\n\u201cI am therefore really not surprised that she has decided to use some of her enormous talent and influence to establish an organization that raises funds and provides resources for indigenous grassroots charities working with orphaned and vulnerable children, disadvantaged youth, and victims of domestic violence,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on the establishment of Nigeria\u2019s first thrift-for-charity online store, Prof. Osinbajo said adding social enterprise to philanthropy with a structure that allows for resource mobilization for charity as well as creates the opportunity for people to earn a living in the process, should be the way to go.\n\n\u201cWhat I think is happening here is that philanthropy is not like it used to be when all you needed was a good and kind heart and you didn\u2019t need to plan or organize as you would a business for-profit\u201d.\n\nAccording to the Vice President, one of the factors responsible for the impactful implementation of the Social Investment Programmes of the Buhari administration over the years is the realization that \u201cyou can\u2019t reach Nigerians if you don\u2019t have a plan for the grassroots\u201d.\n\nHe said the realization has influenced the structure designed for the SIP and is largely responsible for the successes of the programme (which is now regarded as one of the biggest social welfare schemes in the continent).\n\n\u201cWhat Kemi and her team have done is to bring the new notion of social enterprise to this project. Philanthropy run with the discipline, attention to detail, and financial prudence of a successful business, and she can do all of that, and I am sure her team is imbibing that, given her background in finance in both the private and public sector.\n\n\u201cThe idea of this thrift-for-charity store is brilliant and the first of its kind in Nigeria. It is a unique model which does not just give to the needy in the conventional way of merely handing out donations.\n\n\u201cIt is an innovative and structured way of aggregating donations to earn income to transform the lives of the vulnerable and needy while creating jobs in the process.\n\n\u201cI must say that your focus on funding grassroots charities is so crucial and I know that, having campaigned with you on behalf of our party, the APC all around Ogun and in every part of Nigeria, it is clear that you can\u2019t reach Nigeria and Nigerians if you don\u2019t have a plan for the grassroots\u201d, Osinbajo added.\n\nIn her response, the former Finance Minister, Kemi Adeosun said the idea of the store is to aggregate donations of different kinds for charitable causes, noting that Nigerians from different fields of endeavour and from across the country would be enabled via the online store to contribute to supporting the needy in the society.\n\nShe said the organisation would work closely with charitable organisations in the grassroots to ensure that funds and other materials donated via the Dash Me Store get to actual beneficiaries",

          "text": "The apex Igbo sociocultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, has said not less than 513 Igbo people, mostly youth, have been killed by Nigerian Army and other security agents in the past 160 days, even as residents say young men are routinely arrested and killed.\n\nIn a statement signed on Tuesday by its Secretary-General, Okechukwu Isiguzoro, Ohanaeze condemned President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s dot-in-a circle comment targeted at Igbo people.\n\nLast Thursday, Buhari had threatened that his government would mobilise the military and the police to go after the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) accused of disturbing the peace in the South-East region, while suggesting that every Igbo person is IPOB.\n\nHe had said IPOB is \u201cjust like a dot in a circle and they have nowhere to turn to. They are spread everywhere and they have investments and properties everywhere and in other areas.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know what they are doing. How we will handle them is to mobilise the police and the military to go after them.\u201d\n\nOhanaeze described the President\u2019s comment as disastrous, noting that \u2018no damage control or image laundering will assuage this collective assault on Ndigbo\u2019.\n\nThe group stated that the silence of Northern leaders is proof that they are happy over the position of President Buhari on Southeastern Nigeria.\n\nIsiguzoro noted that Igbo people are emergency experts in all situations and will be a dot in the circle that will swallow nepotistic anarchists and anti-Igbo exponents.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide had charged the leadership of the North to speak out against discrimination against Igbos and divisiveness being created by disastrous declarations of President Muhammadu Buhari describing how the southeast is landlocked and no damage control or image laundering will assuage this collective assault on Ndigbo,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cIt appears that there are chains of crafted skirmish programmed to either aggravate the traumas of Ndigbo or remind them of the sordid past a few years ago, and with \u2018a dot in a circle\u2019 slogan that was used to pulverize Igbos during the Biafra war that left 3 million people dead, especially women and children. Right now in 160 days, 513 Igbos had been killed, 2,436 arrested and 854 missing in the ongoing \u2018imported\u2019 insecurity challenges in the southeast.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018dot in the circle\u2019 is a new signal to point out that Ndigbo are surrounded or should be taught in the language they should understand, but the fact remains that, the silence of Northern leaders shows that they are happy over the position of President Buhari on Southeastern Nigeria. We have seen the direction of events and Igbos are not noisy anymore, we are emergency experts in all situations, \u2018a dot in a circle\u2019 remains the Bermuda triangular point that will swallow nepotistic anarchists and anti-Igbo exponents.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some residents of Umuahia, Abia State and Owerri, Imo State, have told our correspondents that Nigerian soldiers now routinely arrest people, brand them members of IPOB, kill them and take their corpse away.\n\nAn Umuahia resident who did not want his name in print, narrated how soldiers intercepted a bus load of traders travelling from the Abia State capital last week, and killed all occupants of the vehicle.\n\n\u201cLast week, the Army stopped a bus carrying traders from Umuahia. They arrested all the occupants of the vehicle and wasted them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey arrest people, mostly young men everywhere and kill them. If they see a group of young men talking, they will arrest all of them.\u201d\n\nIn Owerri, Imo State capital, the story in the same.

The whole place is scary.\u201d",

          "text": "The minister of Women Affairs, Dame Pauline Tallen, on Tuesday, said the federal and state governments of Nigeria, have pledged their support to end all forms of violence against women and girls in the country.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nTallen disclosed this at a workshop organised by the federal ministry of women affairs, in partnership with the Foundation for Resilient Empowerment and Development (FRED), supported by the EU-UN Spotlight Initiative, under United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Implementation in Lagos.\n\nThe minister said President Muhammadu Buhari and the 36 state governors have zero tolerance for issues of Gender Based Violence (GBV) in Nigeria, while adding that government was doing everything possible to ensure women and girls are protected.\n\nGiving an instance of what government was doing, she said, \u201cA lot is being done in Borno state. The state government is trying to resettle women and girls out of the Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps, by constructing a massive house for them. We are encouraging all states to follow that footstep by having a safe home for survivors where they are well cared for and attended to.\u201d\n\nTallen said the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 set the country back many years as it eroded all its gains revealed in the unprecedented number of gender-based violence across communities and the states.\n\nHowever, through the ministry\u2019s concerted efforts and supports by development partners, Tallen said the country has witnessed remarkable progress in the collection, collation and availability of GBV data across the states through deployment of innovative data management and visualisation platforms.\n\nSpeaking on the workshop, the minister said the GBV data indicator harmonisation workshop was very critical because without data the country cannot win the war against GBV.\n\n\u201cWith this workshop, we will be able to have data, fact that will support our efforts to end violence against women and girls in Nigeria,\u201d she added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn what the ministry has done in ensuring justice for victims, the minister said, \u201cThe ministry has reached out to the police and the judicial system to ensure that no case is swept under the carpet. I encourage survivors to speak out. I also urge all stakeholders to be involve in advocacy, and to ensure that the survivors are supported.\u201d\n\nOn issues of insecurity in Nigeria, Tallen urged Nigerian women to say no to all those who are clamouring for violence and secession.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe past few days have been very tense with rumours of conflicts and calls for breakup of our great country by aggrieved persons and others whose avenues for looting have been closed.\n\n\u201cI must say that what binds us together as a country in our 60 years of existence as an independent state is greater than what people imagine and Nigerian women say no to all those who are clamouring as we seek them to resort to dialogue towards finding a lasting solution to the insecurity across states in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, the Lagos State commissioner for women affairs, Mrs Cecilia Dada, said few years ago, a lot of our women in Lagos State found it difficult to report when they were being abused.\n\nDada said the state was able to change the narrative with a lot of advocacy, sensitisation programme and stakeholders who are actively involved in the fight against all forms of violence against women and girls.",

          "title": "Nigeria to receive 3.92m doses of AstraZeneca vaccines end of July \u2013 FG",
          "text": "Doosuur Iwambe, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government disclosed on Tuesday that it has received confirmation that about 3.92 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines will arrive Nigeria by the end of July or early August.\n\nSpeaking while addressing journalists in Abuja, the Executive Director, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) Faisal Shuaib, noted that the vaccines will be delivered through the COVAX facility.\n\nGiving a detailed update on the COVID-19 vaccine exercise, Shuaib said, \u201cWe now have information that Nigeria will get 3.92m doses of Oxford/Astrazeneca by the end of July or early August.\n\n\u201cAs we receive additional information on the exact dates in August, we will provide an update regarding timelines and details of this.\n\n\u201cThe last time I spoke we were not certain about when the next batch of vaccines will be coming, but we have received official communication that Nigeria will get 3.92m doses of Oxford/AstraZeneca by the end of July or early August.\n\n\u2018\u2019COVAX will only communicate when the vaccines are secured and our partners have validated that the vaccines have been secured\u2019\u2019.\n\nShuaib also disclosed that recent research from Public Health England (PHE) shows that the Indian (Delta) variant B.1.617.2 is 92% susceptible to Oxford/AstraZeneca.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore comforting to know that the vaccine used in Nigeria can protect against this variant that causes high morbidity and mortality in India. However, it underscores the need for us to ramp up our vaccination to more Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAs you all are aware, hesitancy towards the second dose is very tied to the continued misinformation and disinformation about COVID-19 and the vaccination program globally and locally.\n\n\u201cThis is especially prevalent on social media. While I commend the patriotism of a multitude of our social media influencers, I must say that I profoundly appreciate the contributions our professional media community has been making towards the progress of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, the challenge is upon us to go beyond straight news and do more in educating Nigerians through interpretative stories, promotional exclusives, features and special broadcast programs on the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n\u201cIt is important to emphasise the need to be fully protected with the second dose, and the socio-economic and health risks of refusing to be vaccinated.\u201d\n\nShuaib further reiterated on the recent concluded G7 summit as the World leaders addressed the issue of vaccine inequities supply particularly for developing countries to get the vaccine.\n\n\u201cWhile we are working with our international partners to confirm the next shipment of vaccines to Nigeria, I wish to speak about the G7 summit that occurred over the weekend.\n\n\u201cThe topic of global inequities in the vaccine supply was a significant focus of the G7 meeting.\n\n\u201cRightfully so. Leaders of major, rich countries are becoming increasingly aligned with the thinking that the inequities cannot continue, not only because it is a moral failure but because it is strategically unwise for their own efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cOn the final day of the summit, leaders committed to delivering at least 1 billion coronavirus vaccine doses to the world over the next year.\n\n\u201cWhile this will not close the enormous gap that exists today, it is a positive step and we welcome the new focus.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, President Biden announced on the eve of the summit that the US will purchase 500 million doses of the Pfizer-bioNTech vaccine and donate them to low- and middle-income countries through the next year.\n\n\u201cThis pledge is by far the largest yet by one country. These doses will be distributed via Covax. We welcome this announcement and encourage other nations with the means to follow the US\u2019 example so that we, as a global community, can move forward from COVID-19 swiftly\u2019\u2019.",

          "text": "By Abankula, with agency reports\n\nPoverty, accentuated by the pandemic, is increasing in Nigeria, with 11 million more people joining the rank of the poor, the World Bank said on Tuesday.\n\nPresenting its six-monthly update on development in Nigeria, the organisation noted that although Nigerian economic growth has resumed after the COVID shock, it is lagging behind the rest of sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe report underscored food inflation, heightened insecurity and stalled reforms as the drivers of the increasing poverty,\n\nThe bank estimated a GDP growth forecast for Nigeria of 1.9% in 2021 and 2.1% in 2022, compared with 3.4% this year and 4.0% next year for sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nLead economist for Nigeria Marco Hernandez said inflation, especially in food prices, was exacerbating poverty and food insecurity.\n\nFood accounted for almost 70% of Nigeria\u2019s total increase in inflation over the past year.\n\nHe said the COVID-induced crisis was expected to push over 11 million Nigerians into poverty by 2022, taking the total number of people classified as poor in the country to over 100 million.\n\nThe total population is estimated at 200 million.\n\nHe said it was expected that between 2020 and 2022 there would be a decrease of about 13 per cent in per capita income in comparison with what would have been a situation without COVID-19.\n\nThe World Bank expects the Nigerian inflation rate in 2021 to be 16.5%. The forecast for sub-Saharan Africa, excluding Nigeria, is 5.9%.\n\nThe World Bank expects the Nigerian inflation rate in 2021 to be 16.5%. The forecast for sub-Saharan Africa, excluding Nigeria, is 5.9%.\n\nHernandez said increased insecurity across the nation \u2014 ranging from mass abductions at schools, kidnappings for ransom, armed conflict between herdsmen and farmers, armed robberies and various insurgencies \u2014 was a drag on growth and job creation.\n\nHe said it was critical for the government to maintain reform momentum, but that some important reforms had stalled.\n\nHe cited petrol subsidies, which have recently returned after the government had established a market-based pricing mechanism, and electricity tariff reform, an area where planned adjustments to bring prices in line with costs have been paused.\n\nHernandez said Nigeria had the largest number of people without access to electricity in the world, and that electricity subsidies benefited mainly richer households.\n\nOnly 22% of the poorest households have access to electricity, while 82% of the richest are able to access power.\n\nShubham Chaudhuri, World Bank Country Director for Nigeria said\n\nsustaining reform momentum in Nigeria is critical to ensuring robust economic recovery beyond 2021.\n\nChaudhuri said though Nigeria was at a critical juncture, it had so much potential which had not been realised.\n\nHe added that with the COVID-19 crisis and the pressures on the economy, the pressures on society had been heightened.\n\nHe also said that Nigeria faced interlinked challenges in relation to inflation, limited job opportunities and insecurity.\n\n\u201cWhile the government has made efforts to reduce the effect of these by advancing long-delayed policy reforms, it is clear that these reforms will have to be sustained and deepened for Nigeria to realise its development potential.\u201d\n\nHe said the over N100 billion a month that goes into petrol subsidy mostly benefits the rich.\n\nHe, however, said that a fraction could be used as cash transfers to support the poor at a time of rising prices or be geared towards primary health care or basic education.\n\n\u201cSo that is part of the restructuring or policy reforms in a number of areas.\n\n\u201cWhat should the Federal Government be doing, what should the sub-national governments be doing and most importantly, what government should not be doing,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that inflation reduced the purchasing power of Nigerians and had been increasing not only constantly and at a very fast pace, but since August 2019 when the borders were closed.\n\nHernandez, however, said that as the crisis has had a profound effect on Nigerians, it also had been a wake-up call.\n\n\u201cWe want to commend the government for events in a series of very bold and inaudible reforms that have been stalling for many years.\n\n\u201cThat includes the doctrine of economic sustainability plan that plans a series of reforms over the coming years, greater transparency in old revenues and improved budgeting practices.\u201d\n\nHe said that given the urgency to reduce inflation amidst the pandemic, a policy consensus and expedite reform implementation on certain areas should be considered.\n\nHe added that exchange-rate management, monetary policy, trade policy, fiscal policy and social protection would help save lives, protect livelihoods and ensure faster and sustained recovery.\n\nAt the panel discussion, Mr Clem Agba, Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, gave reasons why some of the reforms like the removal of petroleum subsidy were suspended.\n\nAccording to him, it is because the government is looking for alternatives to ensure that when the programmes continue, Nigerians do not suffer.\n\n\u201cTo follow up with these reforms, we are working on the strategic revenue initiatives and we are beginning to see some improvements in revenue.\n\n\u201d I dare say that the country is no longer so much of a mono dependent economy because of the reforms that are ongoing.\n\n\u201cIn the past, oil used to be the main driver of the economy in terms of revenues, oils was giving us about 70 per cent of revenue and about 90 per cent of foreign exchange.\n\n\u201cToday oil is only contributing about 45 per cent while non-oil sector is contributing about 55 per cent.\u201d\n\nHe appealed to Nigerians to understand that the reforms were necessary to achieve the desired growth.",

          "text": "Industrialization, the development of industries on a broad scale, is one policy vigorously pursued and strategically implemented by the Deacon Udom Emmanuel led administration in Akwa Ibom State that has left many astonished. In just six years, the advantage of the policy has not only changed the status of the state from a core civil service state but a bubbling industrial hub within the South South region.\n\nUnarguably, industrialization plays a vital role in the economic development of underdeveloped countries through job creation, poverty eradication and mass production of goods and services. Industries no doubt plays a complex role in economic development, but these are some of its most important effects as we have witnessed in Akwa Ibom.\n\nEven though not on a massive large scale yet, it has increased the revenue base of the state. Yes, we are not there just yet but the journey is on course. The standard of living of many Akwa Ibom households have increased due to the multiplier effect of the industrial revolution ongoing, while economic stability is more sustainable with increased employment opportunity for the many unemployed youths.\n\nThe Industrialization policy has promoted the advent of specialized labor as division of work increases the marginal value product of labor, thus enhancing the profitability of the average Akwa Ibom worker. One area of interest is that the Industrial revolution has no doubt brought about a rise and growth in the agricultural sector with increased savings and investments for wealth creation.\n\nThe Governor\u2019s industrialization drive, has increased workers\u2019 income, enhances their capacity to save and invest. Akwa Ibom today presents an industrialization success story. From the 2015 to 2021 alone, the basic foundation that will propel greater economic prosperity has been laid with it\u2019s attendant consequences of urbanization and population growth. Uyo is fast growing and expanding due to influx of people and companies.\n\nThe Governor brought his visionary mindset to bare in policy formulation and project conceptualization which birthed the 21-Storey \u201cDakkada Tower\u201d which stands as a testament to Akwa Ibom\u2019s increasing profile as a fast industrializing State. As the Governor himself noted recently, the central focus of government\u2019s initial Five Point Agenda which have now condensed into the 8 Point Agenda, was to rapidly industrialize the State and change the narrative as a purely civil service orientated State to an industrializing one with robust manufacturing base.\n\nThe fruits have been massive. From the Syringe factory, to the Metering company, to the Flour Mill company, to the Coconut Virgin Oil Refinery to the plywood manufacturing company to the signing of the MoU for the commencement of the Liberty Oil and Gas Free Zone, to the Ground breaking ceremony for the construction of Sterling petrochemicals and Fertilizer production factory, to the several industrial clusters which produce such items as pencils and toothpicks, plastics, tissue papers etc, to the rice mills in Ini Local Government Area, and several cassava processing mills, the narrative is indeed changing in Akwa Ibom.\n\nThe $1.4 billion Ammonia and Fertilizer plant alone is one investment that will fetch the state revenue apart from Oil while the St Gabriel Coconut Factory alone will generate over 1300 direct job and 3000 indirectly employment opportunity by September 2021. The Coconut factory has a capacity of processing 300,000 coconuts per shift which will produce 66 tons in a day from three shift of production, while employing 300 people to work in a shift.\n\nAlso, the much anticipated Liberty Oil and Gas Free Trade Zone in Ikot Abasi Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State, has taken off with the signing of a memorandum of understanding, MOU, between the Akwa Ibom State Government, AKSG and Oil and Gas Free Zone Authority, OGFZA. The commencement of operations follows the receipt of the first cargo components, establishment of an Immigration office and setting up of a dedicated Customs command, in the free trade zone. This will be another stimulant for Industrial revolution, while the Aluminium Smelter Company of Nigeria, ALSCON located in Ikot Abasi, is on the verge of being resuscitated following a partnership between the Akwa Ibom State Government will partner with the federal government.\n\nThe Governor Udom Emmanuel industrialization drive is aimed at ensuring a process by which the state economy is transformed from a primarily agricultural/Civil service one to one based on the manufacturing of goods and services with individual manual labour replaced by mechanized mass production. This will trigger an industrial revolution with more efficient division of labor, the use of technological innovation to solve problems and inspire creative ingenuity.\n\nAlready, in just six years, Akwa Ibom is witnessing an Industrialization policy whereby a transformation is taking the state away from an agricultural- or resource-based economy, toward an economy based on mass manufacturing with increases in total income and living standards of the people, and a diversified economy. The policy is all embracing, with land, air and sea components which is why the Ibom Deep Seaport, the Ibom Air and the massive infrastructural expansion are geared towards boosting the pillars needed for it\u2019s viability and sustainability.\n\nIbom Air for instance is today a success story that continues to astonish many. It started like an abstract vision, with a hypothesis that was yet to be ever tested by any state government in the West African region. Critics called it a scam, friends were doubtful about it\u2019s viability, and fans were skeptical about it\u2019s possibility of becoming a reality.\n\nEven when no one else saw the vision, Governor Udom Emmanuel saw ahead and realised that a viable aviation sector anywhere promotes an improved quality of life and helps to improve living standards. By facilitating tourism, he believed air transport also helps generate economic growth and alleviate poverty \u2013 providing employment opportunities, increasing revenues from taxes and fostering the conservation of protected areas.\n\nTo the Governor, commercial aviation has a direct impact on our nation\u2019s economy, creating both direct and indirect jobs as air transport is an important enabler to achieving economic growth and development because air transport facilitates integration into the global economy and provides vital connectivity on a national, regional, and international scale while also helping generate trade, promote tourism, and create employment opportunities.\n\nNo doubt air transport generates wider catalytic benefits, with ability to serve larger markets, impact positively on business operations, influence investment, impact on the labour market, boast tourism and contributes to world trade.\n\nExperts are quick to agree that an efficient air transport system allows people to have adventures in new countries, to relax on tropical beaches, to build business relationships and to visit friends and family. As global economy grows ever more linked, aviation is the factor that brings people together. Aviation brings together a world of facts and figures to give policymakers and the industry the important global view of how air travel creates jobs and drives economic growth.\n\nIt impacts on the labour market helps improves the labour market by making it easier for companies to attract high quality employees from around the globe. This is important for senior staff and professionals for whom\n\naccess to good international links\n\ninfluences their decision on where to\n\nlive and work.\n\nSimilarly, high quality employees may find it easier to commute by air on a weekly basis or to be based in two locations; the headquarters and regional office. It improved access to a wider pool of appropriately skilled labour will improve productivity leading ultimately to higher employment in the local economy.\n\nGovernor Udom Emmanuel saw when others were doubting that air transport\u2019s influence on investment is key as good air transport links influence where companies choose to invest. Many companies consider international transport links to be an essential factor for locating businesses. This makes Air transport one of the world\u2019s most important industries. Its development and its technical and service achievements make it one of the greatest contributors to the advancement of modern society.\n\nAn effective air transport system improves quality of life by broadening people\u2019s leisure and cultural experiences. It provides a wide choice of holiday destinations around the world and an affordable means to visit distant\n\nfriends and relatives and may provide the only transportation means in remote areas, thus promoting social inclusion.\n\nBy facilitating tourism and trade, it generates economic growth, provides jobs, increases revenues from taxes, and fosters the conservation of protected areas and it\u2019s network facilitates the delivery of emergency and humanitarian aid relief anywhere on earth, and ensures the swift delivery of medical supplies and organs for transplantation.\n\nOn February 20, 2019, Akwa Ibom witnessed the inaugural landing of IbomAir when Flight IA200219 torched down at Victor Attah International Airport, an event that marked the genesis of a remarkable adventure that has stood of Akwa Ibom State as an entity with creative ingenuity that continues to baffle the rest of the country.\n\nOn May 24, 2019, IbomAir left Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja back to Akwa Ibom International Airport, Uyo after a successful round of test flights while on June 7, 2019, history was made again when Ibom Air inaugural flight Z4102, took off from Uyo enroute to Lagos, a journey that opened the floodgate of several other flights that has revolutionalize air travel in Nigeria.\n\nOn Tuesday 10th September 2019, exactly three months and a day since the company began commercial flight operations, Ibom Air carried her 50,000th passenger during the boarding of flight Z4100 from Uyo to Lagos. The spice of this feat is that passenger number 50,000 turned out to be first time Ibom Air traveler, Ms Ruth Nsaka.\n\nOn March 26 2020, Ibom Air was forced to suspend operations due to the Covid19 pandemic that ravaged the world. Recognizing the serious implications of the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus around the country, the Management of Ibom Air announced the suspension of all scheduled flight services as of midnight on Friday 27 March, 2020, as her own way of identifying with the Akwa Ibom State Government and the Federal Government of Nigeria\u2019s efforts to bring this pandemic under effective control.\n\nTuesday May 19, 2020, saw Ibom Air\u2019s 4th aircraft, 5N-BXP joining its \u2018senior\u2019 colleagues in Uyo after completing all regulatory requirements with the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority in Lagos. 5N-BXP was warmly welcomed by her sister aircraft, 5N-BWK, 5N-BWL and 5N-BWM. It\u2019s was a beauty to behold as they stood all together in front of the hangar at Victor Attah International Airport, Uyo, bonding with each other.\n\nOn July 20th, 2020, the company\u2019s expansion policy to link many cities in Nigeria continued as Ibom Air received a warm welcome at Margaret Ekpo International Airport, Calabar, a new route it added to her area of operation. The growth and expansion has never compromised it\u2019s signature of schedule reliability, on-time departures and superior service that has become the envy of other airlines. Ibom Air score card includes over 96% schedule reliability & 94% on-time performance, unparalleled in Nigeria\u2019s Aviation history.\n\nOn August 1, 2020, after delays occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic, Ibom Air finally receive it\u2019s fifth Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, the second of the two additional aircraft purchased in December 2019. The aircraft, with registration number 5N-BXO, arrived Lagos from Calgary, Canada at 00:05 am local time, Saturday morning, (1st August, 2020).\n\nWith the arrival of this aircraft, its modern and efficient fleet grew to five aircraft as the airline continues to operate the youngest fleet amongst Nigeria\u2019s airlines in line with it\u2019s vision to be a world-class African regional airline.\n\nA key benefit of Ibom Air\u2019s very modern fleet of Bombardier CRJ 900 aircraft is that they all come factory-fitted with High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters. HEPA filters are high-intensity filters that do not just filter dust, but effectively capture greater than 99.97% of the airborne microbes in cabin air, including microscopic particles such as bacteria and viruses. Cabin air in HEPA equipped aircraft generally pass through the filters every 2-3 minutes, removing contaminants and greatly enhancing the quality of air in the cabin.\n\nOn September 2, 2020, the company had a new addition to the fleet, when it took procession of her 5N-BXO, which touched down at Victor Attah International Airport for the very first time. Despite the minor setback the aviation industry had as a result of Covid19, Ibom Air came back on it\u2019s wings on Wednesday, October 28, 2020, after months of inactivity.\n\nOn September 14, 2020, Ibom Air touched down for the first time at Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu with direct daily flights from Lagos and Abuja in it\u2019s effort at extending it\u2019s service to the Southeast geopolitical area.\n\nJust when other airlines are complaining of how difficult it is for them to launch back after months of Covid19 induced inactivity, Governor Udom Emmanuel just announced that Ibom Air is set to boost it fleet with two additional aircrafts in June 2021.\n\n\u201cTwo new A220 300 series ought to have arrived before now but assured that the aircrafts would be in Uyo in the next two months\u201d, the Governor announced during the recent 2021 Easter retreat in Uyo.\n\nFor effective service delivery and conscious of the need to offer quality service to its teaming customers, the company launched a new City Travel Centre located in the foyer of the Akwa Ibom State Secretariat Annex on Udo Udoma Avenue, Uyo, to ease the burden of flights bookings and a bus service to convey Ibom Air passengers to and from Victor Attah International Airport.\n\nOn Monday, March 1, 2021, Ibom Air carried its 500,000th passenger since commencement of operations on the 7th of June 2019, a key milestone the airline would have clocked earlier but for the three and a half months Covid-19 lockdown of 2020 but still, an indication of steady customer uptake, and validation of the airlines services.\n\nGiving his scorecard in the aviation sector while addressing the state to mark his sixth anniversary, an elated Governor Udom Emmanuel said, early in the life of his administration, he gathered some stakeholders in the aviation industry and revealed to them his plans to establish a thriving airline.\n\n\u201cWe went to work quietly and once I made our plans public, the usual naysayers said the project couldn\u2019t be done; that if countries in Africa couldn\u2019t set up an airline, how then could we, a State achieve such a feat. We ignored their pessimism and went to work. Today, Ibom Air has become a national sensation. The colours of Akwa Ibom State now dominate the Nigerian aviation space. We were recently named the Best Airline in the Nation\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe started with three CRJ 900 series, later added two more CRJs bringing the total aircrafts in its fleet to five. In the next few days, we will commission two newly acquired brand new Airbuses (A220-300 series) bringing the total fleet of aircrafts to seven. We are not just concentrating only on Ibom Air, ours is a total dedication to aviation development. Our international terminal once completed, would be the best in the nation and you can quote me on this. It would also be the smartest. Our MRO is on-going; the pace of work only got slowed down, due to the restrictions placed on international travels due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Our taxiway, the new Category 2 runaway, these are huge investments that prime our State as an emerging industrial hub. Fellow Akwaibomites, this huge achievement in aviation should gladden the hearts of everyone, irrespective of one\u2019s political affiliations. Ibom Air carries the collective pride of Akwa Ibom people and we should all celebrate it. God is indeed doing great things here!\u201d, he noted.\n\nIf all these benefits could be derived from the Industrialization policy in just six years, one can only imagine what Akwa Ibom will look like when the Ibom Deep Seaport comes on board, when the Liberty Free Trade Zone begins to flourish, when the multiplier effect of the numerous companies and factories begins to flourish. Indeed, as Vice President Yemi Osinbajo once confessed, under the Udom Emmanuel led administration in the state, Akwa Ibom remains Nigeria\u2019s best kept secret.",
          "summary": "Industrialization, the development of industries on a broad scale, is one policy vigorously pursued and strategically implemented by the Deacon Udom Emmanuel led administration in Akwa Ibom State that has left many astonished.\nGovernor Udom Emmanuel saw when others were doubting that air transport\u2019s influence on investment is key as good air transport links influence where companies choose to invest.\nOn March 26 2020, Ibom Air was forced to suspend operations due to the Covid19 pandemic that ravaged the world.\nIbom Air carries the collective pride of Akwa Ibom people and we should all celebrate it.\nIndeed, as Vice President Yemi Osinbajo once confessed, under the Udom Emmanuel led administration in the state, Akwa Ibom remains Nigeria\u2019s best kept secret.",

          "text": "Nyesom Wike, the governor of Rivers State, believes it is unlawful for President Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) to delegate his constitutional powers of protecting Nigerians\u2019 lives and property to state governors.\n\nIn a statement released by his media aide, Kelvin Ebiri, the governor stated that the President is the Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces and that governors cannot declare themselves in command of security in their respective states.\n\nWike, who spoke at the commissioning of the 21-kilometer Odufor-Akpoku-Umuoye Road in Etche Local Government Area of the State on Tuesday, said that such a position indicates that the APC-led federal government has lost control of its strategy for dealing with the country\u2019s troubling security issues and making it safe for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cMr. President, you are the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. You appoint Inspector-General of Police, you appoint the Chief of Army Staff, Chief of Naval Staff, the Commissioner of Police, Director of Department of State Service, and other heads of security.\n\n\u201cWhich one do we appoint? How can people appointed by Mr. President be under me?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not only to borrow money for Nigeria that you\u2019re in charge. You must, also, be in charge of other things including security. Who signed order 10? Is it the governors?\u201d he asked.\n\nGovernor Wike admonished the APC-led federal government to own up that it can no longer fulfill promises made to Nigerians and also lead the country out of its present predicament, saying when there is a failure, what makes leadership respectable is that such leader is able to accept its weakness publicly.\n\nThe governor pointed out that it was time Nigerians begin to compare the performances of PDP and APC governors in office.\n\nHe said, \u201cMr. President was short of calling names of those governors who run to Aso Rock when they are supposed to stay in their states to see the needs of their states and people.\n\n\u201cMr. President should have come out openly and said, my APC governors, stop worrying me. Go back to your states and do your work. On that, I support him.\n\n\u201cThank God, Mr. President knows that I am not one of those that go to visit him over one problem or the other. I, as the governor of Rivers under PDP, you\u2019ll never find me there,\u201d Wike said.\n\nFormer Senate President, Senator David Mark, who performed the commissioning of the 21 kilometres Odufor-Akpoku-Umuoye Road, noted the excitement expressed on the faces of the locals who are directly impacted by the project.\n\nHe noted that even those in opposition in the state have become so weak to have anything more to say against Governor Wike who is not only performing but has remained a strong pillar of the PDP.\n\n\u201cI told him I\u2019ll be here because he loves his people. Politics and democracy are not about enriching one or two persons within a community. The Odufor-Akpoku-Umuoye Road is a project that will outlive everybody in this place. The legacy you\u2019re leaving behind, Rivers people will not forget you. They will defend you, they\u2019ll protect you and they will stand by you always.\n\n\u201cThat is why you can walk tall. That is why you can jump into your car and go anywhere because you\u2019ve shown them love. You\u2019ve brought democracy to the people. PDP as a party is happy to have you. You\u2019re one of the pillars of our great party,\u201d Mark said.\n\nProviding the description of the project, Rivers State Commissioner for Works, Elloka Tasie-Amadi said Odufor-Akpoku-Umuoye Road connects part of Etcheland to Omerelu, Apani and Omademe communities in neighbouring Ikwerre Local Government Area, and onwards to Imo State.",

captivity.\n\n\u201cThey said I should bring money so that they can bring the children and I asked them, \u2018where will they find the children\u2019,\u201d the governor said.\n\nThe governor also decried media reportage which bandits got to know classified information about government actions, saying \u201cyou may think that the bandits are illiterates but they are very intelligent in processing information.\u201d\n\nDonating 10 operational vehicles and 20 motorcycles to the Special Vigilantes Corps, Governor Sani-Bello implored them to clear the miscreants that had disturbed residents of Minna for months.\n\nHe said unlike their counterparts in bandits-affected areas, the corps was not trained to engage in exchange of fire. \u201cThey are for now restricted to Minna by working with the police to identify and arrest the boys causing crisis in our streets, destroying property and injuring passers-by,\u201d the governor said.\n\nPresenting the special vigilantes, the state Commissioner of Police, Adamu Usman explained that the creation of the corps became necessary in order to keep peace in Minna while conventional security agencies fight bandits in other parts of the state.\n\nHe said the vigilantes had undergone two-week training and ready to work with police in curbing activities of street urchins in Minna.\n\nThe police boss assured that the vehicles and motorcycles donated by government would be judiciously used.\n\nGodogodo community cries out\n\nIn a related development, the people of Godogodo community in Jema\u2019a local government area of Kaduna state have expressed concern over the increasing security challenges bedevilling the area, and leading to loss of several lives and property.\n\nThey alleged that suspected herdsmen have killed many innocent people, including the head of vigilante group, Frank Zakiri, in Godogodo village.\n\nZakiri was known for leading other vigilantes in protecting his community and environs against invaders that killed and destroyed properties.\n\nThe increasing spate of killings in the area has caused fear among the people who could not sleep with their two eyes closed for fear of the unknown.\n\nA source who craved anonymity explained that the Chief of Godogodo, Iliya Ajiya, received the killing of the head of the vigilante with great shock, assuring the villagers would continue to fight against invaders for the protection of their community.\n\nHe said as a community, they had resolved, irrespective of any differences, to continue to protect one another against what he called \u201cenemies of progress especially during the rainy season when majority of the people who are peasant farmers will go out every day to farm for their survival.\u201d\n\nThe chief called on government at all levels to ensure proactive measures were taken to checkmate the activities of criminal elements in the society in order to allow people go about their lawful activities for a peaceful and harmonious society.\n\nResident want additional troops\n\nMeanwhile, a resident of Gwashi village in Bukkuyum local government area of Zamfara state, Yusha\u2019u Mohammed Gwashi, has appealed to the federal government to urgently deploy additional 200 troops to their area to fight the bandits terrorising their area.\n\nGwashi made the plea Tuesday in a telephone interview with Blueprint in Gusau, the state capital.\n\nHe said the bandits, in their large numbers, besieged their area between Sunday and Monday with sophisticated weapons on their way to Birnin Gwari Forest, and killed three locals while many others scampered for their safety.\n\nHe expressed worry that the bandits could warn them not to their farms as they threatened to kill anyone who acted contrary to the order.\n\n\u201cThe troops attached to our area are not up to one unit and the bandits use to come in their hundreds with heavy fire arms more than that of the troops, so we need more additional reinforcement of the troops to forestall insecurity challenges we are facing to bandits attacks on daily basis,\u201d Gwashi further pleaded.\n\nGwashi further hinted that as a result of Banditry in their area, many women and their childrens have left the area in fear of the Bandits attack, calling on federal and Zamfara state governments to take urgent steps in tackling the trend.\n\nGovernor Bello Mohammed Matawalle had last week, directed communities across the state to go on self-defence whenever bandits strike.\n\nFurther to this and other measures taken to halt banditry, the governor also suspended the Emir of Dansadau Alhaji Hussaini Umar and District Head of Nasarawa Mailayi Alhaji Bello Wakkala and the Emir of Zurmi,Alhaji Abubakar Atiku Muhammad for allegedly aiding and abetting the criminals in their jurisdictions.\n\nLawmaker pledges grazing field\n\nIn a related development, a lawmaker representing Zamfara North, Senator Sahabi Ya\u2019u, has promised to construct grazing grounds for herders in his constituency to complement government efforts at tackling insecurity in the state.\n\nSenator Ya\u2019u, who made this known while speaking to journalists in Gusau Tuesday, said the project would be established on grazing routes in the state.\n\nThe senator blamed alleged injustice meted out to the herders for the security challenges in the state, which he noted began with cattle rustling before degenerating to banditry.\n\n\u201cI think this (project) is in line with what Governor Bello Matawalle is doing to provide `RUGA\u2019 settlement for the herders.\n\n\u201cThis year (2021), part of my constituency projects, I intend to provide grazing grounds for herders so that they can be contained in one place.\n\n\u201cAfter identifying the location, securing it, we are going to plant the grass that will be harvested into belts for use every season of the year,\u201d he said.\n\nSenator Ya\u2019u said tackling insecurity is a collective responsibility, adding \u201cat the National Assembly level, we are doing our best to address the insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cThe insecurity we are facing is very disturbing. We have realised that we are in danger; it requires collaborative effort to address it. Everyone\u2019s support and contribution is needed not only state or federal government.\u201d",

International Day of the African Child commemorates children killed protesting in Soweto in 1976. The day was first celebrated by the Organisation of the African Unity (now African Union, AU) in 1991. On 16 June 1976 in Soweto, South Africa, thousands of black school children took to the streets to protest about the inferior quality of their education and to demand their right to be taught in their own language.\n\n\u201cHundreds of them were killed and in the spaces of two weeks of protest, more than a hundred people were killed and a thousand more injured. To honour their courage and in memory of those killed, in 1991 the Organisation of African Unity (now the African Union) established the Day of the African Child to draw attention to the plights of the African child today. The international day of the African Child also aims at creating awareness on the plights of the African children, with a call for an urgent need for improved and equal education space as well as encourages the culture of sharing something special with a child in Africa\u201d.\n\nHe further explained that in Nigeria, the Child Rights Act is the policy framework that exists to provide and protect the rights of a Nigerian child; and other related matters.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the domestication of this act in various states of the country, the wellbeing of children is not adequately protected as there are gaps in the implementation of the act. Current situation of out-of-school children in Nigeria, the Ministry of Education said the number of out-of-school children stands at 10.1 million. It is an increase of more than 3 million from last year, implying that out of school children figure in Nigeria as of June 2021 stands at 13.3million,\u201d he added.\n\nProgram Officer Education and Girl-Child Literacy Youthhub Africa, Mr Agboola Afees said that in 2003, the Child Rights Act was passed into law adding that presently only 25 states or so had domesticated it.\n\nAfees said the child right act in Nigerian was designed to address the triple issues of child labour, child abuse as well as out-of-school challenge.\n\nHe lamented that the remaining states yet to domesticate it were mainly from the north and the impediments included political issues and the fact that the Act was religious and culturally sensitive.\n\nSenior Programme Coordinator, Christian Aid, Mr Victor Arokoyo, said that not having the Act in place has adverse effects on children.\n\nArokoyo said that most public schools were bedevilled by dilapidated buildings with children in tattered clothes.\n\nHe added that the economic situation had forced many children into becoming providers, hawking to cater for families, adding that out of school children were poor kids who could not cope with education conditions.\n\nOn his part, a development activist, Mr. Emmanuel Tagwai said that in Kaduna State, NGOs gave technical support on the domestication of the Child Rights Act and carried children along in the journey of domestication.\n\nTagwai said that there was need for continued sensitisation and frequent mention of the Act and the need for the law to be fully domesticated and implemented.",

          "text": "Europeans champions Portugal kicked off their Euro 2020 title defence with a 3-0 win over Hungary on Tuesday as captain Cristiano Ronaldo made history at the Puskas Arena.\n\nRonaldo became the first man to play in five European Championship tournaments, and his two goals in the victory took him to 11 \u2014 the most scored in the tournament\u2019s history.\n\nBorussia Dortmund\u2019s Raphael Guerreiro broke the deadlock after 84 minutes with a shot from the centre of the box, while Ronaldo scored from a penalty three minutes later.\n\nThe Portugal forward then superbly added a second in injury time, dancing through a string of challenges to slot home his second of the match.\n\nAmid a backdrop of around 60,000 fans at the Puskas Arena, Hungary held firm in a low-key first half that had little incident.\n\nRonaldo, who overtook Michel Platini as the Euros\u2019 leading scorer of all-time, was relieved to see the offside flag raised as he missed early on. The Juventus striker grew increasingly frustrated towards the end of the first half when his effort from close range sailed over the bar when he really should have scored.\n\nBoosted by vociferous support at the Puskas Arena, Hungary threatened sporadically, with Adam Szalai causing Portugal the most problems.\n\nPortugal\u2019s frustration grew in the second half, as Manchester United\u2019s Bruno Fernandes went close with an effort from outside the box, but Hungary goalkeeper Peter Gulasci did well to tip it round the post. But just as it looked as if Ronaldo would have to settle for one record and a disappointing draw, Portugal turned on the style late on.\n\nFirst Guerreiro broke the deadlock with a deflected finish, before Ronaldo took centre stage. After dispatching a clinical penalty, sending Gulasci the wrong way, he added a superb second with a fine finish.\n\nHungary\u2019s next game is against France on June 19, in Budapest, while Portugal face Germany in Munich on the same day in Group F.",
