          "title": "Road construction cause of Ikeja gas leakage \u2014 Eyewitnesses",
          "text": "Some eyewitnesses at the Ikeja gas leakage have revealed that the cause of the incident is due to the ongoing road rehabilitation in the area.\n\nWhen The PUNCH visited the scene of the gas leak which is under Ikeja bridge, some houses and shops along the road had been partially demolished. It was gathered that the government plans to expand the road, hence the gas leakage this morning.\n\nMoreso, there was the presence of the Nigerian Police Force, Nigerian Army, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, Lagos State Fire Service, Manufacturing Association of Nigeria Fire Department, among others on the ground.\n\nAn eyewitness Adekunle Raji, whose mother sells her ware at the spot where the gas leakage occurred affirmed to The PUNCH that the ongoing road project caused the gas leakage.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am a trader here and to my own knowledge, this is the first time something like this would happen. They said they wanted to widen the road so they demolished some structures. While they were doing that, I think they made a mistake and hit a pipeline and it was not repaired. They are still doing the road rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cPeople always trade here and nothing like this has ever happened. This is the first time this kind of thing will happen. This particular place that it happened is where my mother sells her wares and I also assist her. The leakage has affected our business immensely.\u201d\n\nAnother eyewitness who simply identified himself as Jeremiah Kuffrey, stated, \u201cThe leakage was due to the ongoing road project. They ought to have informed the gas company about the road rehabilitation for them to stop gas from running through these pipes. The partial demolition of the buildings is because they want to expand the road. When the incident happened, the gas was gushing out but the right authorities were informed and they came here hurriedly. That is why you can see them all on the ground. It started since in the morning.\u201d\n\nFurther speaking with The PUNCH Emmanuel Oladotun Ismail, the Manufacturing Association of Nigeria Chief Fire Officer further explained, \u201cThere is a road expansion project happening here and the gas leakage is definitely due to the ongoing project. It was after the demolition of the buildings that people realised that there is gas leakage. They began to perceive the odour of gas and it has really spread, which means that covered this whole environment. Gaslink who runs the gas through the pipes has shut it so we are waiting for the remaining gas to be exhausted by the consumers. When it has been exhausted, we will know what to do.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the efforts made by the Lagos State Fire Service, an Assistant Chief Fire Officer, Lagos State Fire and Rescue Services, who refused to reveal his name stated that the matter was under control.\n\n\u201cAs you can see, it is a gas leakage, we received the call past 7 am this morning. They informed us that there was a gas leakage under the bridge in Ikeja so we quickly activated our men and when we got to the scene, we discovered the area where the gas is coming out from. We quickly evacuated the people and cordon the environment so that there would not be any obstruction. The white substance on the ground is called Chemical Foam Compound. It is what we use to blanket the surface, this will neutralise the leakage so that there would not be an occurrence of fire outbreak.\n\n\u201cI have our men moving around to educate the people in the environment so that they can suspend anything that has to do with naked fire so that it does not jeopardise our efforts. MAN fire service is here to complement our effort so that is what we have done here for now. We have called the people in charge of the gas line and we have been assured that it has been shut so that there is no passage of gas through the line. However, there is no way we will not perceive it due to the one left in the pipeline. We are on top of the situation,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "By Johnbosco Agbakwuru, ABUJA\n\nPRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari has told international partners to finance projects using transition fuels such as gas in Nigeria.\n\nBuhari, who stated this yesterday in Glasgow, Scotland, while delivering his national statement at COP26 Leaders\u2019 Summit, pledged that Nigeria would cut its emissions to net zero by 2060.\n\nThe President said attaining national and global climate change goals would require adequate and sustained technical and financial support to developing countries.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nHe said greater effort should be channelled towards assisting developing nations to meet their \u201cNationally Determined Contributions, NDCs commitments through the pledges made by the developed countries to provide at least $100 billion yearly.\u201d\n\nBuhari noted that easier access to climate finance had become imperative, in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, which really battered the economies of developing countries.\n\nThe President in a statement issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, said: \u201cI do not think anyone in Nigeria needs persuading of the need for urgent action on the environment.\n\n\u201cDesertification in the North, floods in the centre, pollution and erosion on the coast are enough evidence.\n\n\u201cFor Nigeria, climate change is not about the perils of tomorrow but what is happening today. Nigeria is committed to net zero by 2060.\u201d\n\nMaking a case for gas-based energy transition in Nigeria, President Buhari requested international partners to finance projects using transition fuels such as gas in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cParties to the Paris Agreement are expected to transit from fossil fuel to clean energy and reach a Net Zero ambition for greenhouse gases emission. Nigeria is actually more of a gas than an oil producing country.\n\n\u201cConsequently, I am requesting for financing of projects using transition fuels, such as gas.\n\n\u201cNigeria has energy challenges for which, we believe, gas can be used to balance a renewable energy-based system, be it wind or sun.\n\n\u201cThis would enable us launch the long-term renewable energy infrastructure procurement and investments needed to have a sustainable energy supply,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAcknowledging that net zero ambition could lead to economic transformation across all sectors, President Buhari said it would require critical infrastructure to be put in place.\n\nHe also told the COP26 Leaders\u2019 Summit that Nigeria had developed a detailed energy transition plan and roadmap based on data and evidence.\n\nExplaining that the plan had highlighted some key facts that force the difficult conversations, Buhari said: \u201cOur transition plan also highlights the key role that gas will play in transitioning our economy across sectors, and the data and evidence shows that Nigeria can continue to use gas until 2040 without detracting from the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\n\u201cGas will be key for addressing the clean cooking challenge, which is also a challenge of deforestation, and for giving our electric grid the stability and flexibility to integrate renewables at scale.\n\n\u201cNigeria will need to integrate an unprecedented 7GW additional renewable capacity each year to achieve net-zero.\u201d\n\nOn energy access, Buhari declared that Nigeria\u2019s commitment to a just transition is reflected in \u201cour ambitious Energy Compact, which includes the Government\u2019s flagship project to electrify 5 million households and 25 million people using decentralized solar energy solutions.\u201d\n\nHe described the project as a major first step towards closing energy access deficit in the country by 2030.\n\nOn green projects in the county, the President declared that Federal Government agencies had been directed to ensure the inclusion of projects with climate change credentials in the budget.\n\n\u201cI am happy to state that the 2022 budget, which I recently submitted to our National Assembly, is the first cross-sectoral, gender and climate-responsive budget ever prepared in the annals of our history,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe announced that the National Assembly had also passed the Climate Change Bill, which provides a framework for achieving low greenhouse gas emissions, inclusive green growth and sustainable economic development.\n\n\u201cThe outcome of this Conference must result in quick resolution of all outstanding issues pertaining to the finalization of the Paris Agreement Rulebook, Adaptation, Mitigation, Finance, Article 6 and Loss and Damage,\u2019\u2019 President Buhari stated further.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Once Marufh got to know that I was the editor of Nigerian Tribune, he told me that he was interested in becoming a journalist,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI was impressed by his intense character and excellent writing ability. That was how he crossed over to Tribune. He kept in touch even after I had left Tribune.\n\n\u201cHe actually was one of the people that insisted that I should go into partisan politics. He believed I could help society more that way. Unfortunately, we have not been in touch very much lately. It\u2019s therefore rather shocking to be reading about his demise. May his soul rest in peace\u201d.\n\nEfforts made by DAILY POST to get a reaction from the spokesman of the Oyo State Police Command, Adewale Osifeso, proved to be abortive as several calls put through to his phone were not answered.\n\nSimilarly, a message sent to the spokesman, asking for his reaction has not been replied as at the time of filing this report on Wednesday.",

Joseph Hayab, confirmed the number of abductees.\n\nAlso, the Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, confirmed the kidnap but was silent on the number of victims. He only said a worshipper was shot dead, while others sustained injuries.\n\nHowever, Alamageni, 46, who spoke to DAILYPOST who was on a fact-finding visit to the church, said he narrowly escaped being kidnapped, as he went to change his money to lower denomination for church offerings when the kidnappers arrived.\n\nHe said the church was filled to capacity and members were singing praises and worshipping God when suddenly, they heard gunshots.\n\n\u201cIt was 9.30am in the morning. While members were singing praises to Almighty God, all of a sudden, we heard gunshots that rented the air.\n\n\u201cEverywhere was quiet as members\u2019 praises to God came to an abrupt end. Although I was not too far from where I went to look for the lower denomination of money I had, I stood faraway and was seeing everybody.\n\n\u201cThe gunmen first went to the teenage church, but later changed their minds and moved towards the adult church when a sound of a gun rented the air.\u201d\n\nHe said it was the sound of guns that made worshipers abandon their Bibles, bags, and other valuables and scamper for their lives.\n\n\u201cThe pastor of the church hid under the church table, as that wasn\u2019t enough, he jumped through the window and ran into the bush.\n\n\u201cMany who could not run because of fear, were captured by the bandits and were given their matching order to the bush. Although, the kidnappers succeeded in killing one of our members who was running to a safe bush,\u201d he added.\n\nHayab and some church elders told DAILY POST that the kidnappers are yet to make contact with them.",

          "text": "By Job Osazuwa, Luman Olabiyi and Okwe Obi, Abuja\n\nThe death toll in the 21-storey building at Gerard Road, Ikoyi, Lagos which collapsed on Monday has hit 20 while no fewer than nine persons had been rescued after being trapped for almost 24 hours under the debris as rescue and search efforts entered day two, yesterday.\n\nCoordinator of Lagos Territorial Office of National Emergency Management Agency, Mr. Ibrahim Farinloye, said rescue operation was still ongoing as at press time.\n\nDeputy Governor, Obafemi Hamzat, who was at the scene said government was hopeful that more people would be found alive.\n\nThe building construction had been ongoing in the last two years with tens of people working on the site day and night. It was gathered that some persons were using the ground floor for a meeting as at the time the structure went down. q\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\nqHamzat said the number of those inside the building cannot be ascertained as two rescued victims gave conflicting figures of 24 and 28.\n\n\u201cWe are not sure of the number of people inside there. It is not a residential building yet; it is not that we have tenants or a list of people.\u201d\n\nHe said the construction site had earlier been sealed in July till November to allow for structural adjustment by the developer, stating that there are always procedures to be followed in demolishing a property for non-compliance.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, if you are aware, this location was sealed for about four months sometimes ago. It was sealed because our agency came in to do structural tests and saw some anomalies. So, they shut it down for those things to be corrected. The second building will also be audited in terms of integrity test, and of course, if we find anything, then the appropriate action will be taken.\u201d\n\nHamzat also clarified that the collapsed building got approval for 21 storeys and not 15 as earlier said by Gbolahan Oki, general manager, LASBCA.\n\nAs part of investigation of the remote and immediate causes of the incident, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has ordered indefinite suspension of Mr. Oki.\n\nA statement by Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Gbenga Omotoso, said the state government was setting up an independent panel to probe the incident.\n\n\u201cMembers of the panel will be drawn from the Nigeria Institute of Architects (NIA), Nigerian Institute of Town Planners (NITP), Nigeria Society of Engineers (NSE) and other professional bodies. It will independently investigate the remote and immediate causes of the incident and make recommendations on how to prevent future occurrence. The investigation is not part of the internal probe already being conducted by the government.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu assured that government would find out what went wrong and punish those indicted. Handlers of the project and regulatory agencies are being accused of not adhering to standard and proper quality control in its execution.\n\nThe Lagos State Bricklayer Association of Nigeria has called for inclusion of its members in the independent panel set up by the state government to probe the collapsed building.\n\nSpeaking to journalists at the scene of the incident, president of the association, Oyebamiji Dauda, said they were ready to assist government to unravel the misery behind the incident.\n\n\u2022Tinubu reacts\n\nFormer Lagos State governor and All Progressives Congress National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has backed Governor Sanwo-olu on the probe.\n\nHe said government must get to the bottom of the ghastly occurrence, while adding that he sought not to prejudge anything or anyone.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious and plain to us all that something went terribly wrong. If indeed intentional or reckless wrongdoing has been committed, severe and appropriate sanctions should find those who have been found to have shirked their fundamental responsibilities. The departed, their grieving families and the people of Lagos deserve no less and should perhaps demand even more.\u201d\n\nAsiwaju\u2019s commiseration with the dead, sympathy for other victims of the incident and condemnation of the collapse is contained in a statement by his Media Office in Abuja, yesterday.\n\n\u201cSome tragedies are unavoidable, but most are not. We need to understand what happened here so that we can work harder to prevent a reoccurrence. I endorse Governor Babajide Sanwo-olu\u2019s order for an investigation into this tragedy. There are many questions to ask, and all those questions deserve full and public answers.\n\n\u201cWe must get to the bottom of this ghastly occurrence. I seek not to prejudge anything or anyone, but it is obvious and plain to us all that something went terribly wrong. If indeed intentional or reckless wrongdoing has been committed, severe and appropriate sanctions should find those who have been found to have shirked their fundamental responsibilities. The departed, their grieving families and the people of Lagos deserve no less and should perhaps demand even more.\n\n\u201cAs much as we are in collective pain and grief, we must also be clear and focused. Let us use this tragedy to serve as a strong warning and deterrent to end any malpractices and misconduct that might in any way contribute to such an incident.\n\n\u201cWe must never become numb to the tragedies that befall others; we must work and strive to put an end to these frightening events and the brutal but avoidable deaths that go with them. Lagos is and must forever be a place of light and life where the best of human endeavour is our currency and our calling card,\u201d the former governor said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Government has, through the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Farouq, has expressed shock at the incident.\n\nThe minister in a statement by her Special Adviser on Media, Nneka Ike Anibeze, sympathised with the people and government of Lagos State and directed the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to assist with rescue operations at the site.\n\n\u201cWe have mobilised immediate rescue operations through the NEMA Team from the Lagos Territorial Office to team up with the state SEMA. NEMA has also facilitated mobilisation of response involving heavy duty equipment for rescue operations and security for crowd control. We pray that through the rescue operatives still on ground at the site, many of those trapped will be rescued,\u201d she said.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja, Abuja and Christopher Oji\n\nThe Supreme Court has described the raid on the Abuja residence of Justice Mary Odili by security operatives as an impunity taken too far.\n\nThis came as the Body of Senior Advocates of Nigeria (BOSAN) met with the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) where they called for an immediate probe of last Friday\u2019s siege.\n\nMembers of the group including Adegboyega Awomolo, Prof. Yemi Akinseye-George and Jibrin Okutepa had during the meeting warned that the development threatens judicial independence and the nation\u2019s democracy.\n\nSpeaking with journalists after the meeting, Awomolo said the group also plans to meet with the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) on the issues.\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\nDr. Umar Gwandu, media aide to the AGF, said Malami denied involvement of his office in the incident and had written relevant security agencies to investigate the development.\n\nIn a statement, yesterday, the apex court warned that judiciary should not be misconstrued by any individual or institution of government as the whipping child among the three arms of government.\n\nThe statement by its Director of Press and Information, Dr Akande Festus, said the attack was uncivilised and shameful show of primitive force on innocent judicial officer.\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cWe are alarmed with the news of the unwarranted and despicable raid on the official residence of one of our senior justices in the Supreme Court, Hon. Justice Mary Peter Odili on Friday 29\u201d October, 2021 in a Gestapo manner.\n\n\u201cThe attack unfortunately depicted a gory picture of war by some armed persons suspected to be security operatives representing different agencies of government who seemed to have come to kill and maim their target under the guise of undertaking a search whose warrant was questionable and baseless.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened and taken aback by this uncivilised and shameful show of primitive force on an innocent judicial officer that has so far spent several years of her productive life serving the country she calls her own.\n\n\u201cThis incident brought back, rather painfully, the ugly memory of the October 2016 midnight invasion of the homes of our respected justices with no satisfactory explanations as to the true motive behind such brazen assault on our collective sensibility.\n\n\u201cWe wish to make it abundantly clear that the Nigerian Judiciary is the third arm of the government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and should be respected and treated as such.\n\n\u201cWe have had a full dosage of this fusillade of unwarranted and unprovoked attacks on our judicial officers and even facilities across the country and we say it loudly now that enough is enough.\n\n\u201cThe judiciary should never be misconstrued by any individual or institution of government as the weeping child among the three arms of government that must always be chastised and ridiculed to silence because of our conservative disposition.\n\n\u201cThough there have emerged discordant tunes from the various security agencies that allegedly participated in the dastardly act, we are not lying low on this dehumanizing treatment meted out to one of our own.\n\nWe have commenced a full-scale independent investigation to unravel the true masquerades behind the mystery as well as the real motives behind the whole imbroglio.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, we call on the Inspector General of Police of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to rise up to the occasion by carrying out a discreet investigation and make his findings known to the Nigerian public with a view to bringing the perpetrators to justice as quickly as possible.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Judiciary cannot only bark, but can also bite. We can no longer be treated with disdain and levity. The rule of law and constitutionality must govern our conduct so that we can tag along with the comity of nations and be taken seriously too.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mr. Usman Akali Baba, yesterday, said perpetrators of the act have been arrested, while the case was investigated to know their motives.\n\n\u201cI had taken my time not to speak quickly, because I want to appreciate the situation so if I speak I should be able to give Nigerians the real thing that happened. For now, and to the best of my knowledge, we have been able to arrest the perpetrators and we are investigating,\u201d he said at a workshop in Lagos, yesterday.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "\u2022How insecurity, IPOB\u2019s threat may undercut chances of parties, candidates\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nWith voter apathy likely in Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Anambra State, a situation occasioned by the palpable insecurity in the state and accentuated by the fear of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), victory amongst the three big contender parties \u2013 the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) \u2013 might be dependent on the fallout of the recent governorship debate organised by Arise News Channel.\n\nThe difference between victory and defeat will ultimately come down to who amongst the three front runners is better able to mobilise his party\u2019s supporters to go out and vote even as the threat from IPOB looms over the election.\n\nWhat this means is that the performance of each of the candidates of the three major parties: Chukwuma Soludo of APGA, Andy Uba of APC and Valentine Ozigbo of the PDP, at the debate might ultimately ride on the back of their ability to mobilise their campaign organisations, in spite of the fear of IPOB in the state.\n\nTherefore, beyond the popularity of the candidates and their parties as well as their avowed war chest, their established presence in the local politics of the state would come to play big time as the major driver of any effective mobilisation by the parties at this time of sweeping insecurity.\n\nSoludo, a former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), was believed to have put up a good showing and expectedly big on data, given his background.\n\nFor a man, who also understood what the issues were, Soludo carefully addressed the threat constituted by IPOB and like others, declined to either take side or condemn the group long proscribed by the federal government, after it was designated a terrorist group.\n\nThe former CBN governor, who identified himself as a pan-Nigerian Igbo man, insisted that the reasons for the agitation by the group needed to be discussed, rather than the use of force.\n\nPutting it on the record one more time that he once visited Nnamdi Kanu in Kuje prison, to dialogue with him and also asked for his release the last time, he believed that everything should be put on the table in a democracy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a consensus that we need to have a dialogue on IPOB,\u201d he said, insisting that what Anambra needed at the moment was a transformational leader, who has had a blameless record of public service.\n\nUnfortunately, for Soludo, who is expected to ride on the record of the incumbent governor of the state, Chief Willie Obiano, the alleged failure of the current administration in different respects and Obiano\u2019s inability to manage the ruling party in the state, APGA, as one political family, might have become an albatross for him in the election.\n\nBesides, as a governorship hopeful, many had also condemned Soludo\u2019s disposition and mannerism at the debate, describing him as both conceited and small-minded, albeit not taking away his brilliance, intelligence and accomplishments.\n\nHis closest rival, Uba of the APC, leveraged his experience as a politician, who had played kitchen cabinet politics and also one who has had a whiff at the governorship seat for a few months, save for the court ruling that sacked him and reinstated former governor Peter Obi.\n\nAt the debate, therefore, Uba was of the opinion that the agitation for secession had only become pronounced because of growing unemployment.\n\nIn breaking down his plan, the federal lawmaker, who seemed to have an insight to some of the possibilities this weekend, stressed that voter apathy had always been an issue in the state, but posited that the situation was compounded by Governor Obiano, who had refused to engage people and consult widely on the security situation in the state.\n\n\u201cThe governor is the chief security officer of the state. Let me tell you, in this case, the governor has not done what he\u2019s supposed to do,\u201d he said, even though he too expressed belief in dialogue, adding that, if he eventually won, he would set up a security response team and have a public phone number that people could call to report cases of insecurity instantly.\n\nWhile a majority of the people believed that Uba and his party, the APC, stood to benefit more from the IPOB sit-at-home order, the governorship candidate explained that instead of condemning or supporting IPOB, Nigeria needed to sit with the agitators to know what they wanted.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t support or condemn IPOB,\u201d he reiterated for the record.\n\nYet, many people believed the debate had inadvertently exposed Uba\u2019s poor intellectual capacity as his answers were said to have shown lack of substance, in addition to his seeming bland personae. Aside poor articulation, he was adjudged to have mostly ended his positions on issues on rather weak notes, coming off a somewhat guileless and impractical candidate.\n\nOzigbo, candidate of the PDP and chartered accountant, largely sold himself as young and untainted, often riding on the clause that he had never been in government before.\n\nLike the other candidates, Ozigbo too held the belief that the popularity of IPOB was clearly due to leadership failure and argued that what Anambra required was a young vibrant, trendy person, who was passionate about the state, and had served in the private sector as well as grown businesses all over the world.\n\nSpecifically, on security, he held the view that what the agencies needed more was intelligence to tackle the situation in the state, contending that the situation has only festered, because nobody has been brought to book for committing crimes.\n\n\u201cAbove security, there\u2019s a lot we can do. There is indeed a lot we can do. Just even go back to when Peter Obi left it. Just providing money monthly to these vigilantes, paying them, providing vehicles and making sure that they are well empowered, because there\u2019s no community that doesn\u2019t know the criminals around them,\u201d he argued.\n\nAccording to him, both the APC and the APGA, had failed the state, but promised to provide resources for vigilante groups, create employment and engage with agitators.\n\nHe however, stated that the reasons for agitations by IPOB were not unfounded and went on to demand the release of Nnamdi Kanu, the IPOB leader, as well as canvassed the de-proscription of the group.\n\nThe former Transcorp president, who promised to cut waste, run a people\u2019s government, curb touting, make Nnewi an industrial hub and Awka a true capital city, said the state under him would attract help from multilaterals to curb erosion, embark on recycling and ensure process improvement.\n\nThese nonetheless, many people believed Ozigbo was not quick-witted in the debate, because he failed to understand that it was an entirely different platform from informal conversations, a situation believed to have prevented him from seizing some of the crucial momentums during the engagement.\n\nThat aside, there are those, who argue that some of his ideas were rather too simplistic, skin-deep and impracticable to fit the concept of ideal government and address real governance issues, especially, that he devoted most of his time doing character debate, as evident in his obsession with Soludo, a co-debator, than selling his own programmes.\n\nAbove all, some also believed Ozigbo was not street smart, at least from his demeanor and answers. The argument supporting this assumption is that, for a candidate, whose party was not in power at the state that is currently up for grab, or at the center, where federal might could be mustered, his devotion to fighting dirty was considered a miscalculation, particularly, when making Peter Obi, who left the state some eight years ago, his campaign issue.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022As body of senior advocates call for thorough investigation\n\n\u2022Incident part of APC\u2019s plot to hijack 2023 elections, PDP alleges\n\nChuks Okocha and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe Supreme Court yesterday said the raid on the Abuja residence of Justice Mary Peter-Odili, a justice of the apex court and next in line to the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), was \u201cimpunity taken too far.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court, in a statement by its Director of Information, Dr. Festus Akande, warned that the judiciary should not be misconstrued by anyone or institution of government as the weeping child among the arms of government.\n\nIt was the first reaction of the Supreme Court to the incident, which occurred on Friday.\n\nOver 50 security operatives, comprising personnel of the Nigeria Police and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), had invaded Odili\u2019s house situated at 7 Imo River Street, Maitama, Abuja.\n\nWhile the action of the security agencies came under heavy criticism, the Nigeria Police, EFCC, and Attorney General of the Federation denied involvement in the incident.\n\nEven the Magistrate, who issued the search warrant upon which the said security operatives under the AGF acted, claimed he was misled and subsequently revoked the search order.\n\nThe apex court described the action of the security operatives as uncivilised and a shameful show of primitive force on an innocent judicial officer.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cWe are alarmed with the news of the unwarranted and despicable raid on the official residence of one of our senior justices in the Supreme Court, Hon. Justice Mary Peter Odili on Friday October 29, 2021 in a Gestapo manner.\n\n\u201cThe attack unfortunately depicted a gory picture of war by some armed persons suspected to be security operatives representing different agencies of government who seemed to have come to kill and maim their target under the guise of undertaking a search whose warrant was questionable and baseless.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened and taken aback by this uncivilised and shameful show of primitive force on an innocent judicial officer that has so far spent several years of her productive life serving the country she calls her own.\n\n\u201cThis incident brought back, rather painfully, the ugly memory of the October 2016 midnight invasion of the homes of our respected justices with no satisfactory explanations as to the true motive behind such brazen assault on our collective sensibility.\n\n\u201cWe wish to make it abundantly clear that the Nigerian Judiciary is the third arm of the government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and should be respected and treated as such.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cWe have had a full dosage of this fusillade of unwarranted and unprovoked attacks on our judicial officers and even facilities across the country and we say it loudly now that enough is enough.\n\n\u201cThe judiciary should never be misconstrued by any individual or institution of government as the weeping child among the three arms of government that must always be chastised and ridiculed to silence because of our conservative disposition.\n\n\u201cThough there have emerged discordant tunes from the various security agencies that allegedly participated in the dastardly act, we are not lying low on this dehumanising treatment meted out to one of our own.\u201d\n\nThe statement disclosed that the apex court had commenced a full-scale independent investigation to unravel those behind the attack as well as their real motives.\n\nIt called on the Inspector General of Police to rise up to the occasion by carrying out a discreet investigation and make his findings known to the public with a view to bringing the perpetrators to justice as quickly as possible.\n\nThe statement added, \u201cThe Nigerian judiciary cannot only bark, but can also bite. We can no longer be treated with disdain and levity. The rule of law and constitutionality must govern our conduct so that we can tag along with the comity of nations and be taken seriously, too.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile the Body of Senior Advocate s of Nigeria (BOSAN), yesterday met with the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, and demanded for a thorough investigation into the siege on the house of the justice. The group, led by a foremost senior lawyer, Chief Adegboyega Awomolo, condemned the act, warning that the development is a threat to the independence of the judiciary and the nation\u2019s democracy.\n\nThey insisted that government must uncover those behind the act.\n\nThe senior advocates said, \u201cWe have come to see the AGF concerning the unfortunate and ugly invasion of the residence of Justice Mary Odili of the Supreme Court last Friday by yet to be identified security operatives.\n\n\u201cWhen judges\u2019 lives, careers, security and safety, when their independence is threatened, then democracy is also threatened.\n\n\u201cThe AGF has said he did not have knowledge of the incident and he had written a letter of complaint to the Inspector General of Police for a thorough investigation as demonstration of his sincerity.\n\n\u201cHe said he is open to be investigated if there is any information that connects him to the incident.\n\n\u201cWe are going to meet with the Chief Justice of Nigeria and let him know that the Body of SANs is very concerned about the lives, security and safety of our judicial officers anywhere and everywhere.\n\n\u201cThis incident appears to be in isolation but we cannot let it be swept under the carpet. The incident must be investigated and investigated thoroughly. Nigerians are interested in this matter. It should not be politicised; it\u2019s a matter of grave, political and constitutional importance.\n\n\u201cThere are three arms of government: the executive, the legislature and judiciary. One is not supposed to be in ambush or overriding the other or threaten the other\u2019s existence, otherwise democracy is at risk.\u201d\n\nReacting, the AGF exonerated himself, saying he is open to investigation.\n\n\u201cNeither the federal government nor the office of the AGF is involved in the invasion of the Abuja home of Justice Mary Odili,\u201d the AGF said.\n\nIn a related development, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) alleged that the invasion was part of a renewed plot by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to hijack the 2023 election. The party described the attack on Odili as horrendous, rascally, irresponsible, and unjustified, insisting that it should not be swept under the carpet on the guise of misleading whistleblower operation.\n\nIn a statement by the outgoing National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party stated, \u201cThis is more so as the paw prints of the APC are visible in the incident, in its desperation to cow the judiciary and subvert the cause of justice ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the attack on Justice Odili is part of a renewed script by the APC. Nigerians will recall how, ahead of the 2019 election, former Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen, was clandestinely yanked off from his hallowed chamber, preparatory to the massive rigging that characterised the 2019 presidential election.\u201d\n\nThe PDP said Nigerians could equally recall how respected judges were assaulted by the APC administration through obnoxious sting operations in a bid to arm-twist the judiciary and set the stage for the endorsement of a culture of impunity that characterized the 2019 elections.\n\nPDP cautioned the APC and the presidency \u201cto know that times have changed as Nigerians are not ready to stomach a repeat of APC\u2019s coordinated assault on the institutions of democracy, but will firmly resist them with every means available within the ambit of the law.\u201d\n\nThe party also urged, \u201cThe judiciary to remain firm and not be deterred by the suppressive proclivities of the fizzling APC, that has since been rejected by Nigerians.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

He had earlier ordered the indefinite suspension of General Manager of the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA), Mr. Gbolahan Oki.\n\nSanwo-Olu, furious at the building tragedy arrived the site around 1.am this morning and encouraged all federal and state agencies involved in rescue operations.\n\nEarlier yesterday, the governor said an internal panel of enquiry had been set up to look into the role of government officials in charge of ensuring adherence to standards with respect to the collapsed property.\n\nThe death toll from the building collapse rose to 19 on Tuesday, though nine persons were pulled out alive from the rubble.\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mr. Usman Baba, visited the scene of the building collapse on Tuesday.\n\nMinister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar-Farouq, was also at the site on Tuesday. Umar-Farouq directed the immediate mobilisation of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) team from the Lagos Territorial Office to assist in the rescue operation at the site, as she condoled with the state government.\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, also expressed his sympathies to the government and families of victims of the building collapse.\n\nBut barely 24 hours after the collapse of the 21-storey building in Ikoyi, another building under construction collapsed in the neighbouring Lekki area yesterday. At the time of filing this report, it could not be ascertained if there were casualties. But first responders were mobilised to the site of building located at Osapa London, a highbrow area of the state.\n\nThe nine persons rescued from the debris of the Ikoyi building collapse on Tuesday \u2013 all men \u2013 were taken to the hospital for treatment.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, 17 others were brought out dead, as at 2 pm,\u201d the state government said in a statement. The government said more equipment and personnel had been deployed at the site to try to save more lives.\n\nThe statement signed by the Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotoso, disclosed that the government had set up an independent panel to probe the collapse of the high-rise building. It said members of the panel were drawn from the Nigerian Institute of Architects (NIA), Nigerian Institute of Town Planners (NITP), Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE), and other relevant professional bodies.\n\n\u201cIt will independently investigate the remote and immediate causes of the incident and make recommendations on how to prevent future occurrence,\u201d the statement added.\n\nHowever, the statement said the investigation was not part of the internal probe already being conducted by the government.\n\nSanwo-Olu promised that the government would surely find out what went wrong and punish those indicted.\n\nThe governor thanked all first responders and those who joined the rescue efforts, including construction giants Julius Berger, Chinese Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), and NEMA.\n\nOmotoso said a help desk would be set up at the site for people seeking information about their relations who might have been involved in the incident. But he told the media that the government would be releasing information whenever the need arose to avoid sensational reporting of the unfortunate incident.\n\nThe deputy governor, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, was at the site of the collapsed building yesterday to encourage rescuers and comfort relations of those trapped in the rubble. Hamzat also visited the Lagos Island General Hospital to see the survivors.\n\nThe state government said it would embark on further foundation and borehole acidic level tests to ascertain the effect of the collapsed building.\n\nThe government said, \u201cThese tests, particularly the borehole acidic level, is important for the entire Gerrard Road and adjoining areas.\n\n\u201cWe wish to state that there will be no cover-up in the search for the truth in this incident. If anybody is found to have been indicted, he or she will face the law.\n\n\u201cIt is important to restate that all developers and property owners are required to adhere strictly to all Building Codes and Planning Regulations to ensure the safety of lives and property. Those who ignore such regulations, breaking seals and defying enforcement, will surely be prosecuted.\u201d\n\nMinister of the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, who visited the scene of the Ikoyi building collapse on Tuesday, condoled with the state government.\n\nUmar-Farouq said, \u201cThis is tragic. I sympathise with the Lagos State government and families of people still trapped inside the rubble.\n\n\u201cWe have mobilised immediate rescue operations through the NEMA team from the Lagos Territorial Office to team up with the state SEMA. NEMA has also facilitated the mobilisation of response involving heavy-duty equipment for rescue operations and security for crowd control.\n\n\u201cWe pray that through the rescue operatives still on the ground at the site, many of those trapped will be rescued.\u201d\n\nThe IGP came to the compound with an entourage of police cars and heavy security.\n\nGbajabiamila, in a statement yesterday, consoled with families of the victims, saying he shares in their grief. He also sympathised with the government and people of Lagos State over the unfortunate incident.\n\nThe Speaker called for adequate measures to forestall future occurrence, while urging the relevant authorities to double their efforts at rescuing those trapped in the multi-storey building. He added that it was unfortunate the building collapse happened at a time the Lagos State government was doing everything possible to make the lives of Lagosians safer.\n\nThe Nigerian Red Cross Society called on emergency rescue response agencies to speed up efforts to rescue more persons who may still be alive. Chairman of Nigerian Red Cross, Lagos State branch, Adebola Kolawole, said yesterday that the rescue teams should act quickly to recover people from the rubble.\n\nKolawole said, \u201cThey should do something fast; as fast as they can, because time is limited. If they don\u2019t bring them out, they will be suffocated and they will eventually die. We don\u2019t pray for that. We pray that God will bring them out and our own.\n\n\u201cWe should be able to do something fast. I just think time is of the essence so that we can do something fast.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading (NBET) says the country sells electricity to neighbouring countries for strategic reasons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNnaemeka Ewelukwa, managing director, NBET, spoke on Tuesday when he appeared before the house of representatives committee on finance.\n\nEwelukwa was responding to questions of why Nigeria sells electricity to other nations when the country does not have enough for its populace.\n\n\u201cNigeria sells electricity to Niger Republic and Benin Republic. Those transactions of recent have been more driven by specific generation companies like NDPHC,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAt the heart of the transactions is the issue of the damming of the river. We have dammed the river and if we don\u2019t provide electricity to countries that are upstream on the river, they can also build their dams which will create a major crisis for the country.\n\n\u201cSo there is a strategic reason. If they are able to dam the river upstream, we are in trouble.\u201d\n\nEwelukwa said about six percent of the electricity generated in the country is sold to neighbouring countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the federal government is working on structures that will enhance power distribution in the country.\n\n\u201cMost of the power generation companies are located within the south-south and south-west largely because of gas with one in the south-east, of course, we have the hydros in Niger state,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe issue of evacuation is something that is at the heart of the priority of the government. At the moment, the contracted capacity is about 14,000 megawatts; out of that 14,000 megawatts, what is available in terms of what the generation companies are capable of producing is around 7,600 megawatts.\n\n\u201cBecause of the different constraints within the system at either transmission or distribution level, that 7,600 is not fully available. What you have available on a given day is about 4,000 to 5,000 megawatts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTo address this gap between what is available and what the system can currently carry; there are a number of intervention projects that the government is currently pursuing, that include the presidential power initiatives in partnership with Siemens.\n\n\u201cThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is currently supporting the funding of interface projects between transmission and distribution companies.\n\n\u201cTo increase power generation, what we need is to increase the corridor for the power to move. There are a number of interface issues between the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) and distribution companies that are critical to enhancing power distribution and CBN are currently providing funding to address those interface bottleneck.\n\n\u201cNDPHC is also dealing with transmission and distribution projects. As these interface projects are addressed, there will be enhanced space for the megawatt to move. The government is keen to expedite the time within which this is made available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe sector regulator, Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), has also concluded performance improvement plans for each of the distribution companies. This plan basically lays out the different infrastructure upgrade the distribution companies are supposed to implement in other to be able to provide more electricity to the citizens.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we have the available capacity that is currently not being made fully available to the citizens is something that troubles us. But we are also confident that the different actions being performed by government agencies \u2014 NDPHC, TCN, MBET, the central bank in the mix \u2014 we are confident that we are heading in the right direction.\u201d\n\nEwelukwa said the structure towards achieving a constant power distribution in the country will be achieved within the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.",

          "text": "When Chipper Cash, an African cross-border payment company, raised $100 million Series C funding in May this year, the CEO, Ham Serunjogi, without declaring the startup\u2019s current valuation said the company is the most valuable startup in Africa. That sparked a lot of mixed reactions in the ecosystem.\n\nFive months later, it looks like Serunjogi\u2019s claim might not have been far from the truth as today, Chipper Cash announced the extension of its series C and raised $150 million at a valuation little over $2 billion. The investment was led by FTX, the most valuable crypto derivatives exchange company owned by the youngest billionaire in the world, Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nWith a valuation of over $2 billion, Chipper Cash has now attained a unicorn status. It joins the ranks of Nigeria\u2019s Interswitch, Flutterwave and Opay, Egypt\u2019s Fawry, Pan-African Andela, and Senegal\u2019s Wave, as the seventh African unicorn.\n\nFounded by Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled in 2018 to offer free cross-border payment service in Africa via a mobile app, Chipper Cash operates in seven African countries \u2014 Ghana, Uganda, Nigeria, Tanzania, Rwanda, South Africa and Kenya. In May, after the initial $100 million series C round, the company expanded into the UK to power UK to Africa peer-to-peer remittance.\n\nLast month, the startup also entered the competitive U.S market and it\u2019s reported to have started the U.S to Africa remittance in Nigeria and Uganda, with more countries to be added soon. The company also plans to start Africa to U.S remittance in South Africa, Uganda and Ghana next year.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarlier this year, Chipper Cash forayed into social payments by partnering with Twitter to offer payment for the social media platform\u2019s Tip Jar feature for African users. The Tip Jar feature was launched early this year to allow Twitter users receive money \u201ctip\u201d directly on the platform.\n\nChipper Cash is FTX\u2019s first investment in Africa. A move that hints that FTX is impressed by how Chipper Cash has been able to scale in the space of three years and its interest in the crypto space. Chipper Cash boasts of having over 4 million users across the world.\n\nThe investment will see FTX partner with Chipper Cash to make money transfer as simple as a text message and accelerate the adoption of crypto within Africa and beyond.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent growth in Africa, moving money across the continent is still slow and expensive. Unsurprisingly it is the fastest growing market with grassroots crypto adoption,\u201d Bankman-Fried, FTX CEO, told TechCrunch.\n\nAs a result of this partnership, FTX will increase its footprint in Africa and Chipper Cash will be integrated into the FTX product so that African users can fund their crypto wallet through Chipper Cash.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a compelling use case for both of our companies as we keep scaling and as FTX keeps scaling their geographical coverage. They do some of the most innovative work in the crypto space, so working with them is going to be quite exciting,\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "Facebook on Thursday, October 28 announced that it has changed its company name to Meta. This change of name was announced by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook\u2019s annual Connect augmented and virtual reality conference.\n\nThe company said it chose the name \u201cMeta\u201d to serve as a reminder that there is always more to build. The rebrand is part of the company\u2019s efforts to shift gears away from being known as just a social media company and focus on building the metaverse \u2014 a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users.\n\n\u201cRight now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can\u2019t possibly represent everything that we\u2019re doing today, let alone in the future,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cOver time, I hope that we are seen as a metaverse company, and I want to anchor our work and identity on what we\u2019re building toward.\u201d\n\nPer The Verge, \u201cZuckerberg owns the Twitter handle @meta and meta.com, which now redirects to a welcome page on Facebook outlining the changes. The site previously redirected to meta.org, a biomedical research discovery tool that was a project of the Chan Zuckerberg Science Initiative. That\u2019s part of the philanthropic arm Zuckerberg co-founded with his physician wife, Priscilla Chan, in 2015. In a Medium post on Thursday, the group says it\u2019s sunsetting Meta.org on March 31st, 2022.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s going to change?\n\nAs expected, the new name implies that some things about the way Facebook operates would change. Facebook said its corporate structure is not changing, however, how the company reports its financials will. Starting with results for the fourth quarter of 2021, Facebook plans to report on two operating segments: Family of Apps and Reality Labs. The company also said that it will change its stock ticker from FB to MVRS, effective December 1. In addition, Facebook assured users that the announcement does not affect how the company uses or shares data.\n\nAt the Connect conference, Facebook also announced new tools to help people build for the metaverse, including Presence Platform, which will enable new mixed reality experiences on Quest 2, and a $150-million investment in immersive learning to train the next generation of creators.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that within the next decade, the metaverse will reach a billion people, host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce, and support jobs for millions of creators and developers,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in a letter on Thursday.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service).

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s okay to think non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are overhyped. It seems almost everyone on Twitter has added the suffix \u201c.eth\u201d to their username.\n\nBut when you observe the amount of money exchanging hands in the NFT market, you might understand why everyone wants to get in on the action.\n\nData from NonFungible shows that in Q1 2021, more than $2 billion was traded in NFTs. Recent data by DappRader reveals that number surged to $10.7 billion in Q3, representing a 38,060% increase year-over-year.\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating; billions have traded hands in exchange for virtual kittens and images of anthropomorphised apes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile art is popular with NFTs, it can take several other forms, one of which is music.\n\nNFT untapped\n\nThe rarity of musical NFTs in Africa is one of the reasons that led Henry Coco-Bassey \u2014 popularly known as Hector \u2014 musician turned label owner, to enter the NFT space, where he\u2019s making not only money but some pretty exciting discoveries.\n\nRecounting when he discovered NFTs, he said, \u201cI started seeing NFTs in the news, a way you could take your creativity and turn it into a digital asset and earn in crypto. It was interesting, and I was like, \u2018I need to know more about this.'\u201d\n\nHector the rapper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Coco-Bassey aka Hector\n\nHector\u2019s love for music is huge, and while this might come off as an NFT story, it is more of a music story.\n\nAs a child, he sang everywhere \u2014 school, church, and especially in the shower.\n\nWhile he loved music generally, he was captivated by rap.\n\n\u201cI started falling in love with rap music when I was young because my dad used to play Tupac all the time.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Tupac Shakur\u2019s politically charged music, his love for rap was also deepened by the satiric and controversial American animated series, The Boondocks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt made sense for Hector to join the church choir \u2014 a place to create or at least participate in creating what he loved. He tried to infuse rap into church music, but that didn\u2019t fly with the church folk. From what he told me, the idea of rapping in the church was equivalent to or worse than lighting a cigarette at the altar.\n\nBut, he didn\u2019t give up on rap. He released his first song before getting into the university and kept making music till he graduated, but he wasn\u2019t satisfied with the earnings he made from music.\n\n\u201cWhen I finished school, I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t be doing music anymore.\u2019 I didn\u2019t like the fact that I put out music and I didn\u2019t earn. I recorded my last song with another rapper from Colorado, US. It was the first song I had on TuneCore and other platforms, so I made some money from it after a couple of months.\u201d\n\nHector\u2019s decision to stop making music didn\u2019t mean he was done with it; as I said, he loved it. So, the proceeds from his final record went into learning about the music business.\n\nAfter much thought, he told himself, \u201cI could be a music agent, helping other artistes that don\u2019t really know how to put out their music. So I started learning and exploring.\u201d\n\nHector spent a long time on the Internet trying to figure out the music business. \u201cI was on YouTube every night,\u201d he laughingly told me.\n\nThe YouTube vigils paid off; he took on his first client, and it was a success.\n\n\u201cI worked with artistes from the US and UK to help them put out their music.\u201d\n\nHaving gained some experience, Hector decided to launch his record label, Unique Sirius. But it was unlike any label on the continent; it connected artistes and fans in the NFT metaverse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHector and some artistes\n\nCall to NFT\n\nWhile running his label, Hector still sought ways to get additional income. He met a friend who was into forex and crypto trading. He found it interesting and started following crypto news and trends, and he caught wind of the NFT craze circling among crypto enthusiasts.\n\nNFT is incredible, and he has seen an avenue where his artistes could earn more for their music. But tokenised music has not caught on in Africa.\n\nPer NonFungible, artworks and collectibles are still the most popular in the NFT market. But music NFTs are gaining some wind too.\n\nIn August 2021, Tory Lanez, an American singer, sold a million copies of his NFT album in 57 seconds.\n\nHector saw the potential in NFTs. An opportunity for artistes to connect with fans better and make lots of money in a very short time\n\nHe reached out to influential artistes in the Nigerian music industry because he knew a big artiste could get the NFT ball rolling in Africa. But no one took him up on his offer.\n\nLuckily, he met Challex D Boss, a Nigerian artiste with a strong following in Cross River, Akwa Ibom, and Ebonyi States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallex D Boss performing on stage\n\nAlthough Challex didn\u2019t have the kind of global influence Hector wanted, he was still an excellent pick for launching what he calls \u201cthe first NFT music in Africa.\u201d\n\nThe first song to be minted as an NFT in Africa was My Fans. It was perfect, not only because Hector loved the sound, but it also preached the NFT message \u2014 a way to connect with fans while they also got rewarded. It was a win-win situation.\n\nThe song was minted on Rocki, an NFT music platform on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Bjorn Niclas, Rocki CEO, was also thrilled at the idea of launching Africa\u2019s first musical NFT on the platform and paid the gas fees.\n\nWithin two weeks, almost 10,000 units of the 100,000 units of My Fans had been sold. Hector was excited. The numbers were good, but more importantly, history had just been made \u2014 the first tokenised afrobeat music.\n\nHector said, \u201cNothing felt like it. I\u2019d just done what I needed to do. I want artistes to eat off their music too. I\u2019ve tested the market, and it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nThe artistes weren\u2019t the only ones eating from the market. Fans who bought the NFT gained their share, receiving 20% of the royalties from every secondary sale.\n\nNFTs are transforming the music business\n\nHector believes NFTs are going to be a big part of the music business in a few years. It will take power from big corporations and give it to artistes and listeners.\n\n\u201cIt will be great for independent artistes,\u201d he says, explaining how hard it is for them to make money with their creativity. When they finally do, a large percentage goes to the platforms that list the music.\n\nFor context, an artiste makes $0.0084 per stream on Spotify, a music streaming platform. If the song gets streamed one million times, the artiste makes $8,400. This means if Tory Lanez were to put his song on Spotify rather than minting them as NFT, he\u2019d make $8,400 after a million streams instead of $1 million after a million purchases.\n\nBut, what\u2019s in it for the fans? Why buy music NFTs? The fans can easily resell for a higher price. For example, Tory Lanez minted a million copies of his song for a dollar each. This means a fan can sell for $5, making $4 in profit.\n\nThe only drawback is, Tory Lanez was able to pull that off because he was already famous, a feat impossible for an upcoming artiste.\n\nHector believes it\u2019s possible due to the win-win nature of the transaction. He believes if an upcoming artiste makes good music and can gather a small number of followers, his fans will buy his NFT and promote him so they can increase the value of what they\u2019ve bought.\n\nIt seems like a lot to take in, but Hector believes strongly in the future of NFTs as the disruptor of the music business as we know it. He\u2019s currently creating a crypto token and, at the same time, building a blockchain metaverse where crypto and NFTs reign supreme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

And no, lack of money was not the reason. Seeing this, Chris Folayan, MallforAfrica\u2019s CEO and Founder started the company to bridge the gap between African shoppers and these eCommerce platforms.\n\nAided by an influx of Africans to the Internet, the startup grew steadily, gaining attention and support from investors and media houses like CNN.\n\nHere are some things to know before you read the article. First, the company has shut down its operations with plans for a rebranding in place. According to Folayan, this is due to the devaluation of the naira and some CBN policies.\n\nAlso, while orders are no longer being accepted on the platform, those placed before the shutdown would still be delivered. However, Folayan reveals that owing to a reduction in the number of staff, this could take longer than usual.\n\nRevved up yet? You might want to get a cup of tea as you read this: Nigerian eCommerce platform, MallforAfrica, has shut down operations, possible rebranding could be imminent\n\nAffiong Williams and the ReelFruit story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiong Williams\n\nIn this age of eight-figure pre-seed rounds by African startups, stories of entrepreneurs who have slowly but steadily built their businesses are rare.\n\nFor Affiong Williams, Founder and CEO of agritech startup, ReelFruit, starting a fruit processing business in Nigeria with no template to draw from was a bold move.\n\nFor her first degree, Williams studied Physiology and Psychology. Like a lot of Nigerians, the goal was to become a medical doctor. However, those plans flew out the window while in school so to increase her options, she did a post-graduate diploma in Business Administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing this, she started at Endeavour South Africa, where she worked closely with entrepreneurs, supporting them in running their businesses. This was where her interest in entrepreneurship was born. Contrary to the expectations of her immediate family, she left her job and, with her savings, returned to Nigeria to set up ReelFruit.\n\nWhat you may not know is that she hoped to win a UN grant for her business, but just three days after she returned, she got the rejection letter.\n\nIn this episode of Founder\u2019s Table, Williams shares from her over eight years of experience running ReelFruit, while revealing the company\u2019s plans for global expansion. There are also some fundraising tips for those struggling to get buy-in from investors.\n\nRead more: Nigeria to the world: Why it took Affiong Williams 9 years to raise $3m for ReelFruit\n\nChipper Cash raises $150 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive months after raising a $100 million Series C round, African fintech startup, Chipper Cash has raised $150 million in a Series C extension round at a valuation of over $2 billion.\n\nThe extension round was led by crypto exchange platform, FTX with SVB Capital, Deciens Capital, Ribbit Capital, Bezos Expeditions, One Way Ventures, and Tribe Capital participating.\n\nCurrently serving seven African countries, Chipper Cash was founded in 2018 by Sam Serunjogi and Maijid Moujaled to facilitate cross border payment in Africa. This year, it initiated international expansion plans, starting with the UK and the US.\n\nThe cost of sending money to and within sub-Saharan Africa is the highest in the world. This is where Chipper Cash has found a sweet spot. Serunjogi reveals that Chipper Cash offers remittances at \u201cconsiderably cheaper\u201d prices than other competitors. These competitors include long time players like Western Union and World Remit.\n\nViolence against journalists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was the Austrian-American journalist, Henry Grunwald, who said, \u201cJournalism can never be silent: that is its greatest virtue and its greatest fault. It must speak, and speak immediately, while the echoes of wonder, the claims of triumph and the signs of horror are still in the air.\u201d Yet, for so many African journalists, speaking could result in their death.\n\nSince 1992, 265 journalists have reportedly been killed in 51 African countries. Somalia and Algeria account for the majority of these murders with 70 and 60 respectively.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica-focused eCommerce platform, MallforAfrica seems to have suspended operations in Nigeria. From our latest inquiries, the company might be shutting down, and a total rebranding could be on the horizon.\n\nAccording to some public sources, Nigerian-born brothers and experienced entrepreneurs, Chris and Tope Folayan, founded MallforAfrica in 2011 to help people shop online for groceries, electronics, and other items.\n\nIt received backing from notable investors, partnered with reputable US and UK stores, and in a few years, became one of Africa\u2019s most popular eCommerce platforms. In 2015, Fortune actually described its presence, alongside Jumia and Konga, as heralding an eCommerce boom in Africa.\n\nHowever, while Africa\u2019s online activity increased, Jumia and Konga had their fair share of struggles. But both companies, and MallforAfrica, continued to grow.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2018, Chris told TechCrunch that the company was shipping to 17 African countries. With a DHL partnership, that number could have reached 34 countries. At a time when eCommerce companies were shutting down, MallforAfrica was striking partnerships to speed up growth.\n\nIn our chat with Chris in 2020, he revealed expansion plans to the Middle East and Latin America.\n\nHowever, MallforAfrica seems to have followed the likes of Dealdey and Gloo in shutting down its eCommerce operations. Even though it claims it\u2019s temporary, some signs suggest a rebranding and a relaunch could be on the way.\n\nThe facts as we know them\n\nFirst off, its app is no longer on the Google Play Store or Apple Store. Customers can no longer log in, and the company has stopped taking orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMallforAfrica is missing on the Android store\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMallforAfrica is also absent on the Apple store\n\n\u201cI used them about five times in 2019. I didn\u2019t use them again until this month when I tried to order, but I found out that I could not check out,\u201d says Kelechi*, one of the customers we spoke to.\n\nThere have also been complaints from customers unable to withdraw their funds and have gotten no response from MallforAfrica. None of the aggrieved customers agreed to comment on the issue as of the time of publishing this article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nA cursory glance at major social media platforms reveals that despite customer complaints as recent as two weeks ago, MallforAfrica has not posted on social media since September 30, 2021.\n\nIn Nigeria (@mallforafricanigeria), MallforAfrica stopped responding to people on Instagram on Wednesday, September 29, 2021. Though this shot below shows a customer complaining about losing $122, comments have been disabled for the post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nCustomers made similar comments on Facebook, but it stopped responding there on Tuesday, September 28, 2021. Its last tweet was on Tuesday, June 3, 2021, but it\u2019s plausible that it stopped posting on Twitter because of Nigeria\u2019s Twitter ban, which took effect on Wednesday, June 4, 2021.\n\nThis, however, doesn\u2019t explain the silence on Facebook and Instagram since September.\n\nPosing as a customer, we tried reaching out to MallforAfrica Nigeria via email to understand why we couldn\u2019t log in. Here\u2019s the response we got:\n\n\u201cWe would like to inform you that we are temporarily not accepting orders at this time. This is as a result of the unstable forex rate in Nigeria and some CBN policies.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, Nigeria\u2019s currency has been fluctuating, and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has come up with some unpredictable policies. But, the company\u2019s issues do not seem limited to Nigeria.\n\nMallforAfrica East Africa last made an Instagram post on Thursday, September 30, 2021, and there\u2019s been total silence across all its major platforms since. Interestingly, there are still complaints about poor services from its East African users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFortunately, it appears that a customer in the region still received an order, even though he hasn\u2019t been able to place a new one since.\n\n\u201cI made two orders on Monday, September 13, 2021, and they were delivered on Friday, October 29, 2021. On their website, it says 14 days,\u201d says Neza.*\n\nNeza revealed that they brought only one item on September 29, but when they tried to contact customer service via email and WhatsApp, they did nothing to resolve the issue. Even though Neza eventually received the item, they swear they\u2019ll not be using the platform again.\n\nCiting similar reasons to those listed in the mail we received from the customer agent, a source close to the issue at MallforAfrica reveals that the company will most likely shut down completely.\n\n\u201cThe issue with forex and CBN policies affected the company, and investors pulled out. The site is currently down, and it is most likely that the MallforAfrica brand will shut down completely and come back with as a new brand,\u201d the source claims.\n\nOur source, however, maintains that all orders made before the website went down are being fulfilled, and customers could still get their items from pickup centres. But no new orders will be placed before the rebranding.\n\nDespite the complaints about losses, our source is optimistic that people will be able to place orders soon.\n\nWe reached out to Chris Folayan (CEO), Helios Investment Partners (MallforAfrica\u2019s major investor), and DHL (Its most recent publicly announced investor), for official statements to verify this claim, but only Chris and DHL have responded as of press time.\n\n\u201cMallforAfrica is temporarily closed, that is true, but we pray and trust in God to have it back up and running in the very near future, better than ever. No date as of yet to announce. But we will keep everyone posted,\u201d Chris confirms.\n\nAs for lost customer funds, Chris reveals that the company is working on refunding them, but it is taking longer than usual due to reduced staff size.\n\n\u201cMany (the customers) have been with us for 10 years, and we are not in the business of letting our customers down. Never have and never will. We would never turn our backs on our customers, and you don\u2019t build such a loyal customer base by letting them down.\u201d\n\nHowever, Chris firmly denies any claim that investors have pulled out, and he maintains that the company still has a great relationship with investors.\n\nA spokesperson for DHL declined to comment on Link Commerce\u2019s activities and told us to contact Folayan instead. They also didn\u2019t address the claim that DHL has pulled out.\n\nIt is important to note that, on Tuesday, October 26, 2021, DHL announced that Africa eShop, an online platform developed using MallforAfrica\u2019s technology, would be shutting down by the month\u2019s end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: DHL\n\nThat announcement was definitely a sign that something was wrong after our preliminary investigations.\n\nNonetheless, based on our independent findings, which you would see in due course, we\u2019ll lean towards Chris\u2019 assertion regarding investors.\n\nThough Chris and our source seem to provide both gloom and hope, we couldn\u2019t help but wonder where it went wrong for one of the shining gems of eCommerce in Africa.\n\nThe growth of an eCommerce giant\n\nSeveral Google searches from the previous years revealed many interesting and, sometimes confusing facts. Here we go.\n\nWhen was MallforAfrica founded?\n\nFirstly, the exact year MallforAfrica was founded is not clear. Most media houses like TechCrunch and the New York Times go with 2011, but LinkedIn claims it\u2019s 2010, a year earlier. Crunchbase, however, claims it\u2019s 2012, the date we used last year in our interview.\n\nThe earliest online record of incorporation we could find shows that MallforAfrica was registered on July 16, 2013, with the Corporate and Business Registration Department of Mauritius. The website lists Akinmade Ayodeji Ibrahim, Boyjonauth Vishma Dharshini, Folayan Oluwarotimi Christopher, and Folayan Temitope Ibiyemi-Olakunle as company directors.\n\nIt also names Intercontinental Trust Limited, a Mauritius-registered financial services provider, as the management company and secretary.\n\nPoole Simon Hilliard and Joomun Mohammad Ali, the other people mentioned, joined MallforAfrica as directors in 2016 and 2017, respectively. So far, we\u2019ve only introduced Christopher Folayan and Tope Folayan as co-founders, but the others are important to the story as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource; Corporate and Business Registration Department Mauritius\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the founders launched the company, it didn\u2019t seem to gain much traction. The earliest online record we could find was MallforAfrica\u2019s first tweet in June 2012, announcing a website called mallforafricaplus.com (disabled).\n\nThe series of Tweets it made received little engagement, but that all changed in 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Twitter\n\nPrivate equity firm, Helios Investment Partners reveals on its website that it provided growth capital for MallforAfrica in July 2013. This coincides with MallforAfrica\u2019s earliest online record of incorporation \u2014 July 16, 2013.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that Boyjonauth Vishma Dharshini is a non-executive Director at Helios Towers and a Director at Intercontinental Trust Limited. Simon Poole also held a similar title at Helios Towers and was an operating partner at Helios.\n\nFun fact: Helios Towers is a telecommunications company and is one of Helios\u2019 portfolio companies. Intercontinental Trust Limited has Helios as one of its clients.\n\nFrom then on, the company began to gain traction as it received coverage from the likes of CNN in 2014 (the earliest available record we found), the New York Times (2015), and Fortune in 2015.\n\nThe promise was simple. Build trust and connect African shoppers to some of the world\u2019s biggest online retail platforms. As a result of fraud, most of these platforms banned Africans, but MallforAfrica came as the middleman, taking on the risks of fraud on one end and handling shipping on the other.\n\nMallforAfrica\u2019s apparent boom\n\nFrom then on, MallforAfrica struck several partnerships with stores like BestBuy, eBay, Macy\u2019s, Barney\u2019s, and Bloomingdales. Fortune reports that the company racked up $17 million in sales in 2014.\n\nIn 2017, the company announced a partnership with logistics giant, DHL, to further cross-border deliveries, and in 2018, they partnered to launch marketplace.com, a fashion shopping platform that is now offline.\n\nIn 2019, DHL launched Africa eShop (now defunct) using MallforAfrica\u2019s technology. We\u2019re going to stop here because it gets a bit confusing going forward.\n\nYou see, as MallforAfrica\u2019s business began to blossom, it decided to add a new vertical to its operations, and that birthed a company now called Link Commerce.\n\nHow Link Commerce was formed\n\nDuring last years\u2019 interview, Chris explained the relationship between Link Commerce, MallforAfrica, and DHL\u2019s Africa eShop.\n\n\u201cLast year, DHL wanted to replicate MallforAfrica, brand it as theirs, and take it across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). So, what we did was to develop Africa eShop for them. And now, DHL is doing basically what MallforAfrica does, but the difference is that eShop is in 37 countries in SSA while MallforAfrica is in only 4 countries \u2014 Ghana, Kenya, Ivory Coast, and Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nConflicting info? \u2014 In 2018, TechCrunch quoted Folayan as saying that MallforAfrica shipped to 17 countries. We are not sure exactly why this happened, but Chris has confirmed to us once more that it\u2019s actually four.\n\nA look at Link Commerce\u2019s registration documents in the UK actually paints a clearer picture.\n\nOn September 30, 2016, Simon Poole, one of MallforAfrica\u2019s Directors, filed to register a company called Mall for the World LTD in the UK, in partnership with MallforAfrica Mauritius.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource; Companies House, UK\n\nBoth parties had significant control over the company, with MallforAfrica Mauritius owning 75% of the company\u2019s shares. There was no mention of the brothers at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFast-forward 10 months later to July 10, 2017, and the founder brothers, Chris and Tope Folayan were appointed as directors in the company. And on the same day, the company announced the termination of Poole\u2019s directorship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September 2018, the UK companies registrar sent a warning that Mall for the World would be dissolved. While the exact reason was not stated, the warning (a compulsory strike-off) is usually given due to non-compliance or failure to file accounts on time.\n\nA month later, the company published a notice that Simon Poole was no longer a person of significant control in Mall for the World. Two days later, the UK Company Registrar suspended the strike-off notice. Also, shortly after this, Mall for the World filed its accounts.\n\nOn March 8, 2019, the company announced that it was terminating Temitope Folayan\u2019s (co-founding brother) appointment as director. On the 22nd of the same month, the registrar announced that MallforAfrica Mauritius ceased to be an entity with significant control of the UK-based company \u2014 Mall for the World. Apparently, this actually happened on September 30, 2016. The day the Mall for the World was incorporated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn April 11, 2019, TechCrunch announced that DHL had launched Africa eShop, using MallforAfrica\u2019s white-label service, Link Commerce.\n\nA day later, Mall for the World filed for a change of name to Link Commerce with the UK registry.\n\nTo be clear, the board of directors at MallforAfrica Mauritius joined to form Mall for the World in the UK. Shortly after it announced the termination of one of the co-founder\u2019s appointments as director, it changed its name to Link Commerce.\n\nFrom then on, MallforAfrica positioned Link Commerce as a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution, which it used to build eCommerce platforms for other businesses as it did with DHL.\n\n\u201cThink of MallforAfrica and Africa eShop but branded with some other name in different parts of the world. That\u2019s how we\u2019re expanding, and that\u2019s what eCommerce is about,\u201d Chris said last year.\n\nNote: The Africa eShop platform and MallforAfrica shared many similarities.}\n\nWeird fact: Link Commerce (Formerly Mall for the World) seems to change its official address every year. It has done so from 2016 to date. If you have any idea why a company might decide to do this, then we\u2019d love to chat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMallforAfrica\u2019s Nigerian addresses are mostly pickup locations. Google shows something different, its website shows a different address, and Crunchbase says the company\u2019s HQ is in Kano, Nigeria.\n\nOn February 13, 2020, the company announced Temitope Lawani, a Managing Partner at Helios Investment as a director. It welcomed Simon Poole back into the fold, and Hennie Heymans, Chief Executive of DHL Express Sub Saharan Africa, joined the company as a director.\n\nA month later, DHL publicly announced that it had acquired a stake in Link Commerce. Chris also hinted that this was part of the plan. Based on DHL\u2019s records, 255 shares gave it a 9% stake in the company.\n\nWhere did it go wrong?\n\nIt is not clear what actually happened at Link Commerce or MallforAfrica. While the latter seems to be having issues, DHL\u2019s eShop shutdown could indicate that there are problems at the top with Link Commerce.\n\nChris, however, completely denies this assertion.\n\n\u201cFalse 100%. Nothing more to add because there is no truth to that statement,\u201d he declares.\n\nWhile one would think this might be related to Healthplus story, Chris maintains that the investors have been amazing, and are not unhappy at all.\n\n\u201cWe have seen great growth year on year. But we all realized that the Nigerian economy has had an impact on expected growth and projections. So what do you do when that happens? You pause, regroup, rethink strategy, then hit the market with a revolutionary way to improve e-commerce for all despite economic challenges,\u201d he states with full optimism.\n\nThe company\u2019s exact financial situation is currently unclear. Between 2018 and 2019, its liabilities far outweighed its assets, and its financials were reading negatives. This was a poor showing compared to the positive numbers from previous years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the arrival of the global pandemic in 2020 and the disruptions to supply chains across the globe, there\u2019s no telling what the numbers would look like when (or if it ever) releases its 2020 financials.\n\nNote: Small companies are not required to declare profit and loss in the UK, so we have to make educated guesses with their asset and liability statements.\n\nWhile our source claimed that investors pulled out, up until this point (March 2021), it seems like Helios has simply taken even more control of the company, and DHL acquired more shares in Link Commerce.\n\nAccording to Link Commerce\u2019s shareholder filing, Helios now has 1,640 ordinary shares, the highest in the company. Its Class A1 shares also mean it has the most voting rights. By comparison, Chris Folayan has 374 Class A2 shares.\n\nFun note: Ayomide Akinmade Ibrahim, one of the first directors at MallforAfrica Mauritius and a shareholder at Link Commerce, does not seem to have much of an online presence. We simply haven\u2019t found anyone that fits his profile exactly, but the closest we got is linked to Hickam Ventures. Still not sure this is our person.\n\nInterestingly, Link Commerce announced Lawani\u2019s termination of appointment as a director in May 2021.\n\nFor now, what is really going on at Link Commerce is anyone\u2019s guess, but Chris promises a full-scale rebound in due time.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t count us out of the ring yet customers and all our amazing well-wishers. This is an intermission to something great that is coming soon. We have a great relationship with our investors, and we truly admire and appreciate them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe apologize for the pause but sometimes these things are needed to set a new higher bar for the future. We revolutionized how eCommerce was done in Nigeria 10 years ago. Watch what we do next.\u201d\n\nHowever, there are other details that need to add up, and we need to make sense of the information we just received. Chris has promised to fill in the blanks this week. Keep your eyes peeled.\n\nThis is a developing story. Shocking right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Senior Reporter at Techpoint Africa | Website Writer and Narrator. Tech, business and policy analysis is my daily bread. Looking to chat?

          "title": "Dangote Cement, MTN, Airtel set to beat 2021 revenue target",
          "text": "Dangote Cement, MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa, three of Nigeria\u2019s largest companies by market value, are on course to surpass their internal earnings forecast in 2021, thanks to a stronger-than-expected performance in the first nine months of the year.\n\nDangote Cement surpassed the N1 trillion revenue mark in the first nine months of 2021, the shortest period it has ever done so, and is now a short crawl away from equalling the total revenues made in 2020.\n\nThanks to higher demand for cement, Nigeria\u2019s largest producer of building material recorded N1.02 trillion in revenue in the first nine months of 2021.\n\nIt means Dangote Cement needs to make sales worth only N100 million in the three months through December to match its total revenue of N1.03 trillion in the whole of 2020. That is less than 0.5 percent of the N340 billion average quarterly revenue the company has reported this year.\n\n\u201cLooking at the data, Dangote Cement and MTN Nigeria look nailed on to post record revenues in 2021 and beat their earnings forecast,\u201d Tajudeen Ibrahim, head of research at Lagos-based investment bank, Chapel Hill Denham, says in a response to questions.\n\nRead Also: Dangote Cement to issue N150bn commercial paper amid low-interest rate environment\n\nDangote Cement\u2019s revenue in the nine-month period was 34.2 percent higher compared with last year\u2019s N761 billion. The cement maker\u2019s profit jumped 33.6 percent to N278 billion in the said period from N208 billion last year.\n\nMTN Nigeria is also on course to beat last year\u2019s performance and eclipse its target for 2021 with revenue of N1.206 trillion in the first nine months, which is only N144 billion away from last year\u2019s total revenues of N1.35 trillion.\n\nThe N144 billion MTN Nigeria needs in the fourth quarter to equal 2020\u2019s total revenue is less than half of its quarterly average revenue this year of N340 billion.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, MTN Nigeria reported revenues of N370 billion, which is higher than last year\u2019s average, as revenue for telcos tends to be higher in the fourth quarter due to the festivities. Any improvement on the revenue made in 2020 will be enough to see the telecom giant surpass its target for 2021.\n\n\u201cIn the first nine months of 2021, we continued to enhance the resilience of the business, improve our performance and make good progress towards our Ambition 2025 strategy,\u201d Karl Toriola, MTN\u2019s CEO says.\n\n\u201cIn the remainder of the year, we will build on the momentum from Q3 to deliver on our service revenue growth target,\u201d Toriola states further.\n\nMTN\u2019s revenue in the nine-month period represents a 23.6 percent increase compared with the N975 billion recorded in 2020, while profit after tax jumped by 52 percent to N220 billion from N144 billion.\n\nActive data users increased by 2.5 million to 33.2 million while service revenue was up by 23.7 percent to N1.204 trillion. Voice revenue was the biggest revenue driver in the period, climbing 10 percent to N722 billion.\n\nData was the second biggest driver of revenue with N366 billion, a 51.5 percent increase from last year. Fintech revenue grew 55 percent from last year to contribute N50.2 billion to the total revenue pool while Digital revenue was up 56 percent to N12 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, other service revenue rose 38 percent to N53 billion, the third largest revenue source. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 27.4 percent to N634.5 billion.\n\nAirtel Africa is also ahead of its 2021 target. The telco saw its profit jump the most of the three firms analysed by BusinessDay, with a 131.6 percent increase to $335 million in the half year ended September 2021, from $145 million in the same period of 2020.\n\nRevenue grew by 27.6 percent to $2.27 billion compared with $1.8 billion the previous year.\n\n\u201cOur first half financial performance has been strong,\u201d Segun Ogunsanya, Airtel Africa\u2019s chief executive officer, states.\n\n\u201cThe first half of last year, and especially Q1, was impacted by the start of COVID, but even after adjusting for these effects, our revenue growth rates for the half year for the Group and all our service segments are ahead of our FY\u201921 revenue growth trends, and in reported terms these are all in strong double digits,\u201d Ogunsanya says.\n\nThere was double-digit growth across all the regions Airtel Africa operates in the first half of 2021 ended September (Airtel has a unique calendar).\n\nAirterl Nigeria reported revenues of $896 million, a 32.4 percent increase compared with last year. East Africa revenue was up 25.8 percent and Francophone Africa up 22.1 percent. Double-digit growth also applied for all key services, with Voice up 19.7 percent, Data up 36.9 percent and Mobile Money up 42.0 percent, according to the company\u2019s financial statement.\n\nNigerian companies are enjoying a strong rebound from the pandemic-ravaged 2020, when revenues slumped to record lows.\n\nFor the three companies (Airtel, MTN and Dangote Cement) however, the impact of the pandemic was not as pronounced as in other sectors, so they are not coming from as low a base as several other companies.\n\nThis highlights the resilience of the three businesses amid trying times.",

          "title": "Why some retirees can\u2019t access pension",
          "text": "Access to pensions at the point of retirement is a key objective of Nigeria\u2019s Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS), but unfortunately some retirees still have difficulty achieving this when they leave employment.\n\nAccording to the Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) and managers of the fund, some retirees have inconsistent personal information and duplication of data, making it difficult to ascertain correctly that they are the true owners of the funds.\n\nFor instance, some of the account holders are discovered to have registered with more than one PFA, meaning they have more than one Retirement Savings Account (RSA) PIN Number. In this case, this fellow may have seen his or her pensions remitted into more than one account while in employment, notes Paddy Ezeala, a pension and environmental consultant.\n\nEzeala says other reasons could be inconsistent data, particularly date of birth, residential address or bank account numbers, which according to him, would be a problem at the point of accessing the money, except the intending retiree moves ahead to clear those doubts.\n\nI remember an RSA holder telling me he had a PIN number in his former place of work, and when he changed job his new employer insisted he belong to the same PFA with other staff in the company for ease of remittance, and ignorantly he went to open an account with a new PFA, Jumoke Adeolu, a staff of one of the PFAs, narrates.\n\nIn order to ensure that these challenges are not experienced by participants in the scheme, the National Pension Commission (PenCom) in 2018 directed all RSA holders and retirees to update their bio-data, particularly the National Identification Number (NIM) and Bank Verification Numbers with their respective PFAs.\n\nRead Also: Contributory Pension Scheme: Retirees now access monthly pay with ease\n\nPenCom in an advertorial said, \u201cThe Federal Government of Nigeria has made it mandatory that every Nigerian must have a National Identification Number (NIN). To achieve this, all data generating organisations have been directed to harmonise their database with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), whose mandate is to implement the National Identity System in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nTo enable the pension industry to comply, PenCom therefore directed all PFAs to update the records of their clients. Consequently, all RSA holders, both active and retired, were advised to approach their PFAs to provide their NINs and BVN as well as their other mandatory bio-data information.\n\nPeter Aghahowa, head, corporate communications at PenCom, said, \u201cWe are aware of these issues and that is why we are appealing to contributors to provide their NIN and their BVN numbers with their PFAs so that we can reconcile the information we have.\u201d\n\nAgain in 2019, PenCom issued a revised guideline on data recapturing and it read: \u201cIn line with Section 5.3 of the Revised Guidelines on Registration of Retirement Savings Account (RSA) holders (2019) issued by the National Pension Commission (the Commission), Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) are mandated to undertake a Data Recapture Exercise until the last RSA holder existing on the Contributor Registration System (CRS) is recaptured.\u201d\n\nThe guideline required all PFAs to obtain complete and accurate data of their Retirement Savings Account (RSA) customers (both active and retired) in line with Section 23(e) of the Pension Reform Act (PRA).\n\nThe data recapture exercise was to be conducted via the newly deployed Enhanced Contributor Registration System (ECRS), which replaced the CRS. The ECRS is an electronic platform designed by the Commission for PFAs to carry out bio-data updates and edits of their clients\u2019 information on the National Databank maintained by the National Pension Commission.\n\nThe data recapture exercise is a mandatory exercise for all RSA holders who joined the contributory pension scheme (CPS) prior to July 1, 2019, to update their information with their respective PFAs.\n\nThis therefore means that members of the CPS who joined the scheme from July 1, 2019, are not affected as they would have been duly registered through the ECRS.\n\nTangerine Pensions, providing awareness on data recapture in its website, said the objective of the exercise was to eliminate duplicate accounts, improve data integrity and capture up-to-date information.\n\n\u201cWe are required to link your NIN to your RSA account to eliminate duplicates and ensure compliance with the National minimum bio-data requirements. By identifying and eliminating multiple registrations from the RSA Registration database, we can improve the overall integrity of your data,\u201d Tangerine stated.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nLAGOS \u2013 A group of Journalists have called on the government to urgently re- examine the system of care given to vulnerable children by reviewing the Childs right law in the states.\n\nThis appeal was made during a two-day media engagement and capacity building workshop organized by the SOS Children\u2019s Villages in Lagos recently.\n\nAccording to the Journalists drawn from the print and electronic media from across the country, the government should ensure the best and suitable environment is created for the Nigerian child by reviewing the Childs right law in the states.\n\nWhile noting that it was not encouraging that In Nigeria ten out of the thirty six states have not domesticated the child rights act, the Journalists maintained that the conversation in Nigeria now should be around how alternative care services are being provided and how critical stakeholders are supported to provide these services to improve the way it is been provided.\n\n\u201cWhat is the plan for the Nigerian Child who is without parental care, what is the plan for that child who stops you on the road asking you for alms? If the child had a better option, he would never be on the road, what is the plan for the family that is about to get disintegrated because they do not have the capacity to stay together and provide care for their children, how do we create the enabling environment for families to thrive, for families to stay together because where families stay together that is where we are able to bring up the Nigerian child,\u201d were some of the issues raised during the workshop\n\nIn his opening remarks, the National Director, SOS Children\u2019s Villages, Mr. Eghosa Erhumwunse who was represented by the Regional Manager, South Mr. Ayodeji Adelopo disclosed that every help vulnerable children can get will be very important.\n\nAlso while delivering his lecture, \u201c Who we are\u201d Chuba Ezeigwe said that the objective of the media engagement was to foster a better working relationship with the media as critical stakeholders and more importantly to generate conversations that will lead to the improvement of the conditions of children without parental care and children at the verge of losing parental care.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe SOS Children\u2019s Villages have been active since 1973 and offers a number of services, alternative care for children, family strengthening and partnership for quality care. As part of the alternative care we offer direct care to children without parental care, using our family care option and we do this in Lagos, Ogun state, FCT and in Plateau state.\n\n\u201cBut away from offering alternative care services to children, we also strengthen families in as many as eight locations across the country and currently we have over sixteen thousand families that have been elevated from our family strengthening programme.\n\n\u201cOur strengthening programme support families on the verge of disintegration. We support these families to stay together so that their children can benefit from the care from their parents or wards. Usually, one of the reasons why families break away, it could be conflict, it could be poverty, it could be socio-economic issues, there are numbers of reasons.\n\n\u201cWe identify the reason peculiar to each family and support them to surmount their challenges to become reliant and to become able to take care of their children. That actually means that our priority is to strengthen families because it is best for a child to have a family around the world, including Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe need to understand that every child has his or her unique needs and we need to design systems that allow us attend to these unique needs. Already, we are supporting the federal government of Nigeria to develop a National guideline on alternative care for children.\n\n\u201cWe are doing this as members of National Committee on alternative care which was inaugurated by the Minister for women affairs domiciled at the women affairs ministry in Abuja. The core mandate of this subcommittee is to develop National guideline on alternative care as one of the procedures that will help in the implementation of the child acts right.\n\n\u201cWe are also doing this in a number of states where we work. In Lagos state, the alternative care guideline has been developed and validated by the state government through the support of SOS children\u2019s Villages and other partners. The document is due for unveiling in a couple of weeks after which it will be pushed in for the approval of the state executive council and it will be put to use.\n\nThe two day workshop also featured panel discussions, lectures by the brand and Communications coordinator, Abasiama Ifeoma and tour of SOS Children\u2019s Village, Lagos.\n\n...",

We have started the process and are going to make it a culture.\n\n\u201cYou can only come into the service on merit basis. We must position the civil service to be the best employer of labour. For us to be able to deliver services in Edo, we must change our mindsets; we have to change the way we do things.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to organize ourselves; we have to change our outlook to our work, and then ensure that everybody employed into the civil and public service is trained and given the tools to work. There will be no shortcut to capacity building; it has to be continuous training,\u201d he added.\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cIn Edo today, the average age is 35 years and the average age of our civil service is 48 years, so you can see that there is no correlation between the service and the people you are to serve; we have to bring that alignment to place. Civil service cannot just be only for old people; it should also be attractive to young people.\n\n\u201cRest assured that we will position ourselves for tomorrow; it therefore means that we are not going to be bound by any federal government circular; Edo is Edo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only as long as those federal government structures can help us achieve what we want to achieve, that we will adopt them. It\u2019s not in the constitution that we must adopt federal government structures.

          "text": "Reno Omokri, a former presidential aide, has petitioned the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to release billionaire businessman Obi Cubana and arrest APC national leader Bola Tinubu.\n\nRecall that anti-graft officials apprehended the Anambara born club owner on Monday for alleged money laundering and tax fraud. Cubana is still in the agency\u2019s custody, according to reports.\n\nReacting, the socio-political activist, Reno, claimed that there is an evidence that Bola Tinubu was involved in election fraud which according to him, is \u201ccontrary to Laundering Act\u201d.\n\nReno questioned why the agency was yet to arrest the former Head of the Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT), DCP Abba Kyari despite evidence from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\nIn a post on his verified Facebook page on Wednesday, Reno accused the EFCC of being selective in their operations.\n\nThe post reads, \u201cWhy are EFCC after Obi Cubana and not Bola Tinubu? We provided evidence of Tinubu\u2019s corruption to the EFCC, including photos of bullion vans going into his home on Election Day, contrary to the Money Laundering Act.\n\n\u201cWhere is the evidence against Obi Cubana? Even with the damning evidence the FBI provided against Abba Kyari, he has not been invited to the EFCC, nor is he under arrest.\n\n\u201cSo, again, why is Obi with EFCC and not Tinubu or Kyari? Is it because Obi is Igbo and they are not? This is obviously double standards! I would counsel Cubana to join and donate to APC, like FFK, and not only would his \u2019sins\u2019 (if any) be forgiven, he can even take a photo with Buhari at Aso Rock. Yeye baff una\u201d!",

People who\u2019ve opted in will no longer be automatically recognised in photos and videos, and we will delete more than a billion people\u2019s individual facial recognition templates,\u201d Meta said in a blog post.\n\nFacebook had introduced facial recognition in 2010, enabling photographs uploaded by users to be automatically tagged with names. The feature was initially user enabled when it kicked off, but in 2019, Facebook made the tagging system opt-in.\n\nThe social media company owned by Mark Zuckerberg has faced political, legal, and regulatory scrutiny over its use of the software and privacy concerns and the use of its data.\n\nIn 2012, a Facebook application to introduce facial recognition in the European Union was withdrawn because there was no provision to gain user consent. In March, Facebook paid $650 million as a settlement in a U.S. class-action lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit was initiated by users who accused the company of creating and storing scans of their faces without permission. Several complaints were also filed with the U.S. competition regulator over possible violations of the Biometric Information Privacy Act.\n\nIn October, the company changed its parent company\u2019s name from Facebook to Meta, pushing forward the concept of a metaverse, where users can represent themselves virtually via avatars.",

Isaac David, have commended a 25-year northern youth Hon Mohammed Kadade Suleiman that emerged as national youth leader of the People Democratic Party PDP.\n\nThe Coordinator who made this commendation during an interaction with journalists on Monday in Abuja said, the emergence of Suleiman as a party youths leader has become a plus to all the Arewa youth and also a motivating factor to the youths of this country, \u201cthat there\u2019s still hope that a day will come when a youth will take over the affairs of the nation at the highest level\u201d,.\n\nAmb. David also called on other political parties and institutions to emulate the PDP in terms of trusting the youth with sensitive positions capable of changing the narrative of the country.\n\n\u201cIt a clear fact that the energy and brightness of the minds of youths act as torchbearer for national development. The countries which utilize their youth in a positive direction are more developed. The youth of the nation is the trustees of posterity. Good education prepares one to impact positively on self and society.\n\n\u201cYouths in the Nigeria Constitution refer to persons between ages 18 and 35. So, how come the youth leader of the most political party in Africa is above 50 years? This question and many more are part of the problems facing the youth that has incapacitated him to fully partake in issues of nation-building. But now that the case has started changing starting from the PDP\u2019s decision we be believe that others will follow suit\u201d,.\n\n\u201cWe also hope that one day a youth will become the president of this country and while we equally advice the youth that have been given an opportunity as a leader, not to disappoint the the Northern youths and the Nigeria youths at large.\n\n\u201cRemember that youth are refers to people who have energy, vigour and enthusiasm to get things done. It is a state of mind not a function of Age, a quality of imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity and an insatiable appetite for progressive reasoning.\n\n\u201cThe youths are agents of change and the change we desire in others must start from us. We must use all of our talent to serve country and fatherland\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Frontline Islamic human rights organization, the Muslim Rights Concern, MURIC , has urged the Kwara State government to waste no time in implementing the recommendations of an 11-man committee set up to investigate the corporal punishment meted to some Arabic students in Ganmo, Irepodun local government area of the state.\n\nThe committee had in its report recommended the regulation of Arabic and Islamic schools and also advised the government to immediately reconstitute the Arabic Education Board in the state.\n\nReacting to the development, MURIC, in a statement signed and released yesterday by its founder and director, Professor Ishaq Akintola, also commended the committee for doing a clinical job.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe Kwara State Government has received the report of the 11-man committee set up to investigate the corporal punishment meted to some Arabic students in Ganmo, Irepodun local government area of the state on 9th October 2021. The Justice Haroon-led committee recommended the regulation of Arabic and Islamic schools in the state and the reconstitution of the Arabic Education Board\n\n\u201cMURIC commends the committee for treating the matter with military dispatch and for addressing the core issues involved. Inaugurated on the 15th day of October, 2021, the committee commenced sitting immediately up till the 24th day of October, 2021 and submitted its report the next day. This is record time.\n\n\u201cWe implore the state government to speedily and steadily implement the committee\u2019s recommendations. The state government should also note that the success of its implementation depends on its sincerity and commitment to the cause of Arabic education.\n\n\u201cIt is equally important to point out the immense benefits which the state government stands to reap from paying adequate attention to Arabic and Islamic education. In the kitty are a steady fall in crime rate, reduction of corrupt practices in both public and private sectors and stability in family affairs as a result of the infusion of moral guidelines in young Muslims in the Arabic schools.\n\n\u201cArabic and Islamic studies as a twin discipline is the bedrock of morality in any society and any government that undermines any of the two does so at the risk of moral degeneration, unbridled chaos and criminality ad infinitum.\n\n\u201cWe invite the Kwara State government to ponder over the cassu belli for the preponderance of high moral value in scholars of Islam and other Muslims who passed through Arabic schools.\n\n\u201cWe glow with pride that President Muhammadu Buhari who sits on Nigeria\u2019s humongous wealth but who refuses to steal one kobo is a product of the Arabic school and he is Qur\u2019an-literate. The secret behind the uncommon, unequalled and jet-age performance of the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Professor Isa Ali Pantami, can be traced to the fact that he is a Shaykh and a cerebral Islamic scholar.\n\n\u201cThere is also no gainsaying the fact that Professor Ishaq Oloyede, a professor of Islamic studies who is making waves at the Joint Admissions Matriculation Board, JAMB, has proved beyond reasonable doubt the stuff Islamic scholars are made of as ambassadors of integrity, credibility, probity and accountability.\n\n\u201cIndeed, in those three Muslim public officials alone the Kwara State Government stands a good chance of setting up stainless models for young Muslims in Kwara State.\u201d",

Nigeria is committed to net zero by 2060.\u2019\u2019\n\nMaking a case for gas-based energy transition in Nigeria, President Buhari requested international partners to finance projects using transition fuels such as gas in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018Parties to the Paris Agreement are expected to transit from fossil fuel to clean energy and reach a Net Zero ambition for greenhouse gases emission.\n\n\u2018\u2018Nigeria is actually more of a gas than an oil producing country.\n\n\u2018\u2018Consequently, I am requesting for financing of projects using transition fuels, such as gas.\n\n\u2018\u2018Nigeria has energy challenges for which, we believe, gas can be used to balance a renewable energy-based system, be it wind or sun.\n\n\u2018\u2018This would enable us launch the long-term renewable energy infrastructure procurements and investments needed to have a sustainable energy supply.\u2019\u2019\n\nAcknowledging that net zero ambition can lead to economic transformation across all sectors, the Nigerian leader said it would require critical infrastructure to be in place.\n\nPresident Buhari also told the COP26 Leaders\u2019 Summit that Nigeria has developed a detailed energy transition plan and roadmap based on data and evidence.\n\nHe explained that the plan has highlighted some key facts that forces the difficult conversations.\n\n\u2018\u2018Our transition plan also highlights the key role that gas will play in transitioning our economy across sectors, and the data and evidence show that Nigeria can continue to use gas until 2040 without detracting from the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\n\u2018\u2018Gas will be key for addressing the clean cooking challenge, which is also a challenge of deforestation, and for giving our electric grid the stability and flexibility to integrate renewables at scale. Nigeria will need to integrate an unprecedented 7GW additional renewable capacity each year to achieve net-zero,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOn energy access, President Buhari declared that Nigeria\u2019s commitment to a just transition is reflected in \u2018\u2018our ambitious Energy Compact, which includes the Government\u2019s flagship project to electrify 5million households and 25 million people using decentralized solar energy solutions.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe described the project as a major first step towards closing energy access deficit in the country by 2030.\n\nOn green projects in the county, the President declared that Federal Government agencies have been directed to ensure the inclusion of projects with Climate Change credentials in the budget.\n\n\u2018\u2018I am happy to state that the 2022 budget, which I recently submitted to our National Assembly, is the first cross-sectoral, gender and climate-responsive budget ever prepared in the annals of our history.\u201d\n\nThe President announced that the National Assembly has also passed the Climate Change Bill, which provides a framework for achieving low greenhouse gas emissions, inclusive green growth and sustainable economic development.\n\nPresident Buhari concluded his address with a note of caution, saying:\n\n\u2018\u2018The outcome of this Conference must result in quick resolution of all outstanding issues pertaining to the finalization of the Paris Agreement Rulebook, Adaptation, Mitigation, Finance, Article 6 and Loss and Damage.\u2019\u2019",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday said 1.5 trillion dollars is the cumulative estimated amount needed by Nigeria over a ten-year period, to achieve an appreciable level of the National Infrastructure Stock.President Buhari gave the figure on Tuesday in Glasgow at a COP 26 high-level side event on improving global infrastructure hosted by President Joe Biden of the United States, EU Commission President, Von Der Leyen and the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson.\n\n\u2018\u2018Nigeria is ready for your investments in infrastructural development in the country.\n\n\u2018\u2018My administration has established a clear legal and regulatory framework for private financing of infrastructure to establish a standard process, especially on the monitoring and evaluation process.\n\n\u2018\u2018We look forward to working with you in this regard,\u2019\u2019 he told world leaders at the high level meeting on the margins of the climate change conference.\n\nPresident Buhari also declared that his administration had taken infrastructure expansion in Nigeria seriously, conscious of the fact that new investments in critical sectors of the economy would aid lifting 100 million Nigerians from poverty by 2030.\n\n\u2018\u2018There is a nexus between infrastructural development and the overall economic development of a nation.\n\n\u2018\u2018My administration identified this early enough as a major enabler of sustainable economic development and the realization of other continental and global development aspirations particularly the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n\u2018\u2018On my assumption of office in 2015, Nigeria faced a huge infrastructure deficit and the total National Infrastructure Stock was estimated at 35% of our Gross Domestic Product.\n\n\u2018\u2018In solving these problems, we embarked on a massive infrastructure expansion programme in the areas of Health care, Education, Transportation, Manufacturing, Energy, Housing, Agriculture, and Water Resources.\n\n\u2018\u2018We provided more financial resources for these policies, charted new international partnerships and pursued liberalization policies to allow private sector participation.\n\n\u2018\u2018We introduced the revised National Integrated Infrastructure Master Plan \u2013 a policy document that ensures our infrastructure expansion projects is cross-sectorally integrated and environmentally friendly, \u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President welcomed the G7 countries for its ground-breaking plan to mobilize hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure investment for low \u2013 and middle-income countries.\n\nHe noted that the \u201cBuild Back Better World\u201d plan, an initiative of the G7 countries, is expected to be a values-driven, high-standard, and transparent infrastructure partnership.\n\n\u2018\u2018It is our fervent hope and expectations that this plan will be pursued to its logical conclusion in order to bridge the infrastructural gap between the North and South,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President also used the occasion to outline the principles, values and standards Nigeria would like to see from infrastructure initiatives and the challenges the country has faced in partnering with donors on infrastructure development.\n\n\u2018\u2018The aim of pursuing quality infrastructure investment is to maximize the positive economic, environmental, social, and development impact of infrastructure and create a virtuous circle of economic activities, while ensuring sound public finances.\n\n\u2018\u2018This virtuous circle can take various forms in stimulating the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Nigerian leader noted that infrastructure investment should, therefore, take into account economic, environmental and social, and governance aspects, guided by a sense of shared, long-term responsibility for the planet, consistent with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nThe President added that the positive and negative impacts of infrastructure projects on ecosystems, biodiversity, climate, weather and the use of resources should be internalized by incorporating these environmental considerations over the entire process of infrastructure investment.\n\n\u2018\u2018Domestic resource mobilization is critical to addressing the infrastructure financing gap. Assistance for capacity building, including for project preparation, should be provided to developing countries with the participation of international organizations.\n\n\u2018\u2018Quality infrastructure investment also needs to be tailored to individual country conditions and consistent with local laws and regulations.\n\n\u2018\u2018Furthermore, Infrastructure projects should align with national strategies and nationally determined contributions for those countries determined to implement them, and with transitioning to long-term low emissions strategies, while being mindful of country circumstances,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President also called for the environmental impact of infrastructure investment to be made transparent to all stakeholders, noting that this will enhance the appreciation of sustainable infrastructure projects and increase awareness of related risks.",

We must all accept it as the will of God and take solace in the memories of the time shared together. Your husband lived a good life, contributed to national development and humanity. He also left behind worthy children, including our own Stella Din, the Director of News of TVC.\n\n\u201cCaptain Din was an elder statesman, prominent leader and excellent human being who related well with everyone who came in contact with him. He served Nigeria diligently and selflessly in the army and in other spheres of life.

          "text": "Republicans won the Virginia governor\u2019s election and were within striking distance in New Jersey on Wednesday, a warning that President Joe Biden\u2019s Democrats are in trouble heading into next year\u2019s congressional elections.\n\nGlenn Youngkin, a former private equity executive who surged in the polls in the Virginia campaign\u2019s final weeks, beat Democratic former Governor Terry McAuliffe, CNN and NBC projected. Youngkin declared victory in a speech before ebullient supporters, while McAuliffe did not publicly concede.\n\nHaving never held elected office, Youngkin sold himself as a political outsider while seeking to rally suburban voters around hot-button issues such as how to handle the discussion of racism in schools and COVID-19 mask mandates.\n\nIn New Jersey\u2019s closer-than-expected governor race, Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli and incumbent Democrat Phil Murphy were locked in a virtual draw, even though registered Democratic voters outnumber Republicans by more than 1 million. Democrats clung to hope because more votes were due to be counted in their strongholds.\n\nThe results in two states that Biden won easily last year over Donald Trump represent a dire sign for Democrats heading into the 2022 midterms, which will decide control of the U.S. Congress \u2013 and with it, the future of Biden\u2019s policy agenda.\n\nPolls leading up to Election Day showed that Youngkin closed the gap with McAuliffe by appealing to independent voters \u2013 a group alienated in 2020 by Trump\u2019s style of politics but more drawn to Youngkin\u2019s congenial manner \u2013 despite McAuliffe\u2019s attempts to link Youngkin to the former president.\n\n\u201cComparing him to President Trump really didn\u2019t resonate with me,\u201d Jacob McMinn, a program manager at a defense contractor, said after casting his vote for the Republican in Fairfax, just outside Washington.\n\nWhite women voters, who favored Biden over Trump by one point in 2020, preferred Youngkin by 57% to 43% over McAuliffe, according to NBC\u2019s exit polls.\n\nTrump sought to claim credit for Youngkin\u2019s victory.\n\n\u201cI would like to thank my BASE for coming out in force and voting for Glenn Youngkin. Without you, he would not have been close to winning,\u201d he said in one of three statements about the race on Tuesday.\n\nYoungkin, speaking in Chantilly, Virginia, early on Wednesday, called his victory \u201ca defining moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cTogether, we will change the trajectory of this commonwealth,\u201d he told the cheering crowd. \u201cAnd friends, we are going to start that transformation on Day 1.\u201d\n\nYoungkin will succeed Governor Ralph Northam, a Democrat. Under Virginia state law, governors cannot serve consecutive terms. McAuliffe, 64, served as governor from 2014 to 2018.\n\nThe Republican candidates for lieutenant governor and state attorney general were also leading their races in Virginia, while Democrats were in a tough fight to keep control of the state House of Delegates after several Republican wins. The state Senate, which Democrats control, did not have a vote.\n\nMINNEAPOLIS POLICE\n\nMurphy, 64, was seeking to become the first Democratic governor to win re-election in New Jersey in four decades.\n\nHe has overseen a shift to the left, including new taxes on millionaires, stricter rules on guns, a higher minimum wage and paid sick leave. He has also defended his robust approach to the coronavirus pandemic, including mandating masks in schools.\n\nCiattarelli, 59, a former state lawmaker, focused much of his campaign on the state\u2019s high taxes, while accusing Murphy, a wealthy former Goldman Sachs executive, of being out of touch.\n\nElsewhere, Brooklyn Borough President and former police Captain Eric Adams, a Democrat, ensured he will become New York City\u2019s second Black mayor after easily beating Republican Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels civilian street patrol. read more\n\nA year and a half after George Floyd, a Black man, who was murdered by a white policeman, Minneapolis voters rejected a ballot measure that would have replaced the police department with a new public safety agency.\n\nVirginia\u2019s race offered a preview of what may be in store in next year\u2019s elections. Culture wars dominated the campaign, with Youngkin promising to give parents more control over how public schools handle race, gender and COVID-19 protocols, and McAuliffe vowing to protect abortion access and voting rights.\n\nYoungkin struck a careful balance when it came to Trump, accepting the former president\u2019s endorsement but avoiding frequent mention of him on the campaign trail. The strategy could offer a road map for Republicans trying to woo suburban moderates next year. read more\n\nYoungkin leaned into the Republican Party\u2019s expressions of outrage over the discussion of systemic racism in schools. He vowed to ban the teaching of \u201ccritical race theory,\u201d a legal framework that examines how racism shapes U.S. laws and policies, while ignoring the fact that Virginia school officials say the subject is not taught in classrooms.\n\nHe drew sharp criticism from Democrats when he initially hesitated to denounce Trump\u2019s insistence that the 2020 election was \u201cstolen\u201d from him, false claims that have continued to rile Trump\u2019s supporters and led to a mob of them attacking the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nYoungkin said later that Biden had won legitimately, but then called for an audit of Virginia\u2019s voting machines, prompting Democrats to accuse him of validating Trump\u2019s election conspiracy theories.",

          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condemned Tuesday\u2019s attack on the University of Abuja by bandits, who abducted four members of staff and some children in the institution, saying the fact that such a development could happen under President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s security precincts was shocking.\n\nThe party, however, described the attack as cowardly and demanded an unconditional release of the victims to reunite with their families members.\n\nMinister of the Federal Capital Territory, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, while frowning at the abduction during a pre-dawn raid on the University staff quarters at Giri, Gwagwalada Area Council, however, assured the people that rescue would come soon.\n\nAlso, the Vice Chancellor of the university, Professor Abdulrasheed Na\u2019Allah, who has asked members of the public to pray for God\u2019s intervention, declared that the nation was definitely bleeding and that the invasion on the university community was too close home.\n\nOn his part, Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, has lamented that criminals operating in the country were modernised unlike the nation\u2019s security agencies, whom he said much changed their archaic mode of operations and modernise too.\n\nThe PDP, in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, described the raid, which occurred within the precincts of the president\u2019s immediate security purview, just 16 kilometers from the Aso Presidential Villa, as shocking and further showed the helplessness and failures of his administration.\n\n\u201cWith this act of banditry in Abuja, Nigerians expect President Buhari, in line with his promise to lead from the fronts, to straightaway give himself a \u2018marching order\u2019 to rescue the victims, just as gives to others whenever there are cases of security failures in commands outside of his security precincts,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nCharging the security agencies not to relent in the face of the failures of the Buhari administration but rise up to the occasion, track down the bandits and rescue the victims, the party lamented the persistent insecurity in the nation and urged all the citizens to be at alert and assist security agencies in their genuine efforts to secure the country under an incompetent administration.\n\nThe PDP enjoined Nigerians to continue to pray for the safety and freedom of all compatriots languishing in their abductors\u2019 den, while tasking governments at all levels to rise up to the occasion and devise more efficient strategies of securing the nation.\n\nThe FCT minister, while commenting on the development, also urged security agencies to ensure that the six people, including a senior lecturer of the university, Prof. Bassey Ubom, his son and daughter, abducted by the hoodlums from the university\u2019s staff quarters were rescued from their abductors.\n\nA statement by the minister\u2019s spokesman, Anthony Ogunleye, claimed that, patrol teams of security personnel made up of the military, police, local vigilante and the university\u2019s security officials, were currently on the trail of the hoodlums, adding that concerted efforts were being made to provide adequate security for all institutions of learning in the Territory.\n\nHe assured members of the university community that the government would do all that was necessary to ensure the safe return of the abductees, even as he called on members of the public to always support and cooperate with the security agencies, whenever the need arose.\n\nOther abducted persons were Prof Joseph Obanza, Malam Sambo Mohammed and Dr Tobit.\n\nBut the Vice Chancellor of the university, Professor Abdulrasheed Na\u2019Allah, has asked members of the public to pray hard for God\u2019s intervention.\n\nIn a statement, Na\u2019Allah said the school authority would continue to mobilise everything within its means to guarantee the protection of staff and students and ensure the infraction never happens again.\n\n\u201cThey brought their devastation to our Giri Quarters and we are pursuing them with all it takes to recover our dearest ones they kidnapped. Our nation is definitely bleeding and this is too close home for us!\n\n\u201cPlease pray hard for God\u2019s intervention. One thing is certain, we shall continue to mobilise everything available to us to protect staff and students and ensure this never happens again.\n\n\u201cThe safety unit has my instruction to turn anyone back who cannot explain their mission on our campus, Quarters or any UniAbuja branches even if they claim to be staff or students.Only University ID card worn on them is a guarantee for entry. We shall overcome!\u201d Na\u2019Allah said.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking at the opening of a 3-day anti-money laundering and combating terrorism capacity building for the Ministry of Interior and its agencies in Abuja, said, \u201cWe must upgrade our strategies\u201d, because the criminals are in the 22nd century in evolvement of crimes while the nation\u2019s security agencies are in the 18th century of crime fighting.\n\nHe said time has come for the government to build the capacities of the law enforcement agencies in the country to be able to continually combat the threats of criminal elements and secure the nation.\n\nHe lamented that the rise in terrorism and banditry in the country could be traced to the availability of illicit fund gotten from money laundering, which meant that to put a nail to these, battle should be waged and won against money laundering,\n\n\u201cIt is in the light of this, that the ministry and its agencies, in conjunction with the Nigeria Financial Intelligence Unit, is conducting this workshop, as part of a series of measures to build capacity and effective communication networks among policy, regulatory and law enforcement agencies, in order to strengthen the anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism regime in the country.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, the Ministry, Nigeria Immigration Service, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps and indeed the Nigerian Correctional Service all have key roles to play in efforts to combat money laundering and terrorism financing and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Our target is to ensure that relevant services in the ministry develop a cadre of professionals in AML/CFT.\u201d\n\n\u201cExperience has shown that these funds are also used to undermine economic, social and political stability through funding of terrorism and terrorist related activities. As terrorism, banditry and other serious cross border crimes continue to proliferate, law enforcement agencies and regulators must work together to prevent, identify, punish and deter financial crimes.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, necessary to continue to take appropriate measures to enhance the capacities of our law enforcement agencies for high profile investigation and diligent prosecution, in order to meet global standards for protecting the integrity of our financial system and prevent it from being used as a safe haven for the movement of illicit funds,\u201d he said.\n\nChuks Okocha, Michael Olugbode and Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja",
          "summary": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condemned Tuesday\u2019s attack on the University of Abuja by bandits, who abducted four members of staff and some children in the institution, saying the fact that such a development could happen under President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s security precincts was shocking.\nThe party, however, described the attack as cowardly and demanded an unconditional release of the victims to reunite with their families members.\nMinister of the Federal Capital Territory, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, while frowning at the abduction during a pre-dawn raid on the University staff quarters at Giri, Gwagwalada Area Council, however, assured the people that rescue would come soon.\nOn his part, Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, has lamented that criminals operating in the country were modernised unlike the nation\u2019s security agencies, whom he said much changed their archaic mode of operations and modernise too.\nCharging the security agencies not to relent in the face of the failures of the Buhari administration but rise up to the occasion, track down the bandits and rescue the victims, the party lamented the persistent insecurity in the nation and urged all the citizens to be at alert and assist security agencies in their genuine efforts to secure the country under an incompetent administration.",

          "text": "Several filling stations in Abuja had long queues to deal with on Tuesday, just as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has dispelled fear of scarcity of petroleum products, particularly petrol.\n\nIn Abuja, young men were seen selling petrol to motorists in jerrycans, amid complaints by retailers that they now buy at a higher price of N153 per litres, up by N5, from the N148 recommended price.\n\nOando filling station, opposite the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) headquarters in Abuja had several motorists jostling to be served at about 1.30pm when THISDAY visited the area.\n\nThe same situation was observed at the NNPC mega station on Olusegun Obasanjo Way, in zone 3, just like the fuel queues swelled in Asokoro, Maitama and other high brow areas of the capital territory, with a 10-litre container selling for about N2000.\n\nMeanwhile, NNPC has declared that there\u2019s no need to buy fuel in panic, stating that it has enough products to serve Nigeria beyond the Christmas and New Year celebrations.\n\nThe Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, said the corporation has over 1.7 billion litres of petrol in the country for distribution, adding that another 2.3 billion litres would be coming into the country within the month.\n\nKyari stated this on Tuesday in his keynote address at the 2021 edition of the Association of Energy Correspondents of Nigeria (NAEC)\u2019s Strategic International Conference, held in Lagos.\n\nThe theme of the conference was \u201cPetroleum Industry Act: Energy Transition and the Future of Nigeria\u2019s Oil and Gas.\u201d\n\nKyari, who spoke virtually from Glasgow, Scotland, where he is currently participating at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), said NNPC\u2019s main objective was to provide energy security for Nigeria and ensure availability of petroleum products in the country.\n\nHe added that though, there were issues around pricing at some depots, but that government has no plan to migrate to any new pricing structure.\n\nKyari said: \u201cAs we speak now, there is speculation of fuel scarcity within the media but we have over 1.7 billion litres of Premium Motor Spirit in the country.\n\n\u201cWe have another 2.3 billion litres coming in so there is no shortage in supply as being speculated.\n\n\u201cOf course, there are issues around pricing at some depots but government has no plan to migrate to any new pricing structure.\u201d\n\nHe, however, said the ongoing COP26 once more highlighted challenges faced by Nigeria and other African countries in the global energy transition.\n\nHe said President Muhammadu Buhari, in his speech before the world leaders, had demanded for energy justice for the continent and the need to exploit the available resources as a pathway to attain the net-zero carbon objective by 2050.\n\nThe NNPC boss noted that though Africa accounted for only about three per cent of the global carbon emission, the continent still had the responsibility to join the world in combating climate change.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria has identified its abundant gas resources as its fuel for energy transition, which informed the declaration of the year 2021 to year 2030 as the Decade of Gas by the government.\n\nKyari said: \u201cWe are making good progress in terms of the implementation of the PIA which is clearly creating the path for transition.\n\n\u201cThere is no way we can achieve this feat without adequate infrastructure to transport the resources to where it will be used and that is why we are investing in massive gas infrastructure.\u201d\n\nHe listed the projects as the Obiafu-Obrikon-Oben (OB3) and the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) pipelines, which he noted, would deepen gas utilisation in the country.\n\nAlso, the Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Mr Simbi Wabote, said the passage of the PIA has opened a vista of opportunities for the Nigerian oil and gas industry.\n\nWabote, who was represented at the event by the Director, Monitoring and Evaluation, NCDMB, Mr. Akintunde Adelana, said the implementation of PIA would impact positively on local content development and host communities.\n\nHe added that the Act would also stimulate the much-needed investment to the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe Chairman of the NAEC Conference and member of Nigerian Association of Petroleum Explorationists (NAPE), Mr Biodun Adesanya, lauded the setting aside of 30 per cent of the profit of the NNPC for exploration activities in the frontier basins, in the PIA.\n\nAdesanya said the discovery of oil and gas resources in other areas apart from the Niger Delta was a welcomed development which should be pursued with vigour by the country.\n\nHe, however called for the appointment of competent personnel to manage the sector, noting that this was the only way Nigerians could benefit from the country\u2019s abundant oil and gas resources.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos",
