          "text": "Amarachi Okeh\n\nA health expert, Dr. Toluwani Binutu, says women should not be worried about the bleached spot that appears on their underwear, noting that stained underwear is a sign of a healthy vagina.\n\nAccording to Binutu, the bleaching stain on underwear is an indicator of the health of the vagina.\n\nSpeaking via his Instagram handle, @tolubinutu, the UK-based health expert said it is normal that a woman\u2019s vaginal discharge bleaches her underwear.\n\nHe said, \u201cSometimes women get worried when they notice their underwear has bleached spots on them.\n\n\u201cSome may even think that it means they have an infection down there. It is not true.\n\n\u201cMost times your normal vaginal discharge leaks to your undies and because vaginal discharge is acidic in nature, it interacts with the dye in your underwear and causes those \u2018bleached\u2019 areas.\n\n\u201cBasically, the bleached areas are proof that your vagina has a normal healthy pH level.\n\n\u201cThe acidic nature of your vaginal discharge creates those bleached areas. It is a sign that you are healthy down there,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to a recent article published by Health Shot, an online platform providing health and wellness information on women, a bleached patch in underwear is an indication that the vagina is healthy.\n\nThe Health Shot article explained that \u201ca healthy vagina has a natural pH value between 3.8 and 4.5, which means it is largely acidic. No wonder, it leaves an orange patch behind when you send it over for laundry or put it in the washing machine.\u201d\n\nExplaining why a healthy vagina bleaches the underwear, the health information site stated that because a healthy vagina is acidic, it can produce large amounts of discharge.\n\n\u201cSometimes, the pH levels can fluctuate because of a range of factors, including your hormones, sex life as well as periods.\n\n\u201cThe vagina has good bacteria called lactobacilli which keep your vagina healthy by maintaining optimum acidity levels and preventing bad bacteria from causing infection.\n\n\u201cThis discharge generally increases when you ovulate, as well as during pregnancy. When this discharge is exposed to air, it can cause a yellow or orange colour stain on your underwear due to oxidation,\u201d the Health Shot article stated.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

You can take me out of Nigeria but you can\u2019t take Nigeria out of me. The issue of Nigeria keeps me awake at night. I will give others (PDP and APC) a run for their money.\n\n\u201d If I am so honoured to be the President of this country, I have five points agenda.\u201d\n\nProf. Egbo said one of her cardinal agendas would be economic growth, recovery, and development. She also promised to tackle the issue of unemployment which said is presently at an alarming rate in the country.\n\nThe presidential aspirant noted with regret that \u201cNigerians run their businesses with generators and Nigeria is now a generator economy, relying on generators.\u201d\n\nShe said if elected as president, she would address the issue of poverty and introduce robust welfare package for the citizenry.\n\n\u201cI will reconstitute the labour sector. I will look into the problem of wages. Why should a worker work so long and be given N30, 000?, she queried.\n\nShe also promised to strengthen the rule of law and security of the country and to leverage on the strength of the armed forces for security and also deploy technology.\u201d\n\nSoeaking earlier, the Deputy National Chairman of NRM, Surveyor Jikamshi described Nigeria as a sinking ship that required rescue, adding that Prof. Egbo has all it takes to restore the nation\u2019s past glories.",

          "text": "\u2014Says nothing concrete to warrant suspension of strike\n\nBy Johnnosco Agbakwuru\n\nTHE tripartite plus meeting convened by the Federal Government with the striking university based unions last night ended without any concrete agreement for the workers to go back to work.\n\nIn fact, the four university based unions that are on strike rebuffed all the government plea for them to suspend the strike while efforts are made to address the contentious issues..\n\nAt the meeting between the federal government team, the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, theSenior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities, SSANU, the Non-Acasemic Staff Union of Educational Institutions, NASU and the National Association of Academic Technologists, NAAT, as well as identified interest groups and Civil society organizations, over the on-going industrial actions in the Universities was held at the Banquet Hall of the Presidential Villa in Abuja,\n\nIt was meant to prevail on the striking workers to accept a deal of calling off their strike while efforts are being made to resolve the dispute.\n\nHowever, the unions refused to back down from continuing the strike saying that there was nothing on ground from the government side to warrant that.\n\nAlthough ASUU President refused to speak to journalists on the outcome of the meeting, one of the union members said that there was nothing new except that the government team wanted them to call off the strike which they rejected.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThere was nothing on ground for us to consider. We are not stopping the strike untill something concrete is done.\u201d\n\nThe Minister of Labour and Employment Senator Chris Ngige who spoke to journalists after the meeting said: \u201cWe have reached some agreements and we hope that by next week, those agreements will be maturing and the different unions will have something to tell their members, so that they can call off the strike.\n\n\u201cWe have put some timelines for some aspects like renegotiation of 2009 agreement in terms of condition of service and wage review. So, we are hopeful that by next weekend, the unions will see a conclusion of that area\u201d.\n\nEarlier, while addressing the leadership of the unions and stakeholders at the opening of the talks, Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari appealed to the striking university workers to sheathe their sword and agree to return to work while discussions over their demands go on.\n\nHe said that something needs to be done urgently to reopen the institutions and to prevent students from protesting on the streets.\n\nAccording to him, allowing the strike to prolong further will not be in the interest of anyone, adding that President Muhammadu Buhari has mandated the team to try and end the strike so that students, lecturers and other workers can go back to work.\n\nOn their part, the two Co-chair of the Nigeria Interreligious Council (NIREC), Sultan of Sokoto, Sa\u2019ad Abubakar II and the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) Rev Samson Ayokunle urged ASUU and the non-teaching staff unions to accept the President\u2019s plea and suspend their strike while efforts are made to address the issues in dispute.\n\nAyokunle specifically urged the lecturers to go back to work and allow a grace period within which concrete action will be taken to Implement aspects of the agreement.\n\nHowever ASUU president, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke said that before the current strike, the union had given enough period of grace to enable the government and its agencies to meet with them and to address their demands but to no avail.\n\nHe said that government has withheld the salaries of the lecturers as a strategy to force them resume work.\n\nHe said that most of the contents of the 2020 Memoradum of Action were based on the federal government sponsored NEEDS assessment on all federal universities in 2013.\n\nAs a result of the assessment, Osodake said that federal government agreed that a total sum of N1.3 trillion is needed to fund the revitalization of the universities.\n\nAccording to him, the release of the money was to be stretched over a six year period.\n\nHe said that the Jonathan-led administration commenced the Implementation with release of the first tranche of N200 billion in 2014.",

          "text": "By Vincent Ujumadu\n\nTHE Anambra State Police command and the widow of a late tricycle operator in Awka, Mr. Dubem Okonkwo are trading blames following the death of Okonkwo shortly after he was paraded as one of the suspects that allegedly killed two policemen in the state.\n\nWhile Okonkwo\u2019s widow, Ebere, alleged that the police killed her husband in detention, the police command, although not admitting that Okonkwo was killed, linked the death of the two policemen to a gang he belonged to.\n\nSobbing uncontrollably yesterday, Ebere said her husband was paraded a week ago by the state police command and detained, only to die shortly after.\n\nREAD ALSO: Taraba: How six soldiers, one Mopol were killed in ambush \u2013 Police\n\nShe said,: \u201cMy husband , Dubem was a member of the Tricycle Owners Association of Nigeria (TOAN) Awka branch in Anambra State. The police arrested him on March 15 this year without explanation.\n\n\u201cHe was paraded alongside other suspects by the Commissioner of Police, Echeng Echeng at the Command Headquarters in Awka. My husband went missing after the parade.\n\n\u201cThe police picked up my husband at Unizik Junction Park and the CP has refused to tell the family or my husband\u2019s tricycle association his offence.\n\n\u201cWhy did the police kill my husband in cold blood? I am suspecting that someone paid the police to kill my husband. Assuming that he committed any crime, is it right to kill him in the cell without being taken to court ?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy husband was killed extra-judicially without trial. He must not die in vain. We visited the Anambra State Commissioner of Police Mr. Echeng Echeng; and police formations across the state and no one was able to say the offence that my 48-year-old husband committed.\n\n\u201cNow that they have assassinated him in the cell, the police will now look for a crime to hang on his neck. But even if he committed any crime, was it right to kill him without taking him to the court?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need justice. Every Nigerian should stand with me in this fight for justice. I demand an explanation for the death of my husband. Why was he murdered?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am crying to the President, Muhammadu Buhari, Inspector-General of Police, Women Affairs Minister, and well -meaning Nigerians to prevail on CP Echeng to bring the policemen and those who paid them to murder my husband to book.\u201d\n\nShe pleaded with the President and the IGP to prevail on the Anambra Commissioner of Police to allow the family take her husband\u2019s corpse and give him a befitting burial.\n\nAlthough the CP could not pick his calls yesterday or respond to a text message sent to his telephone line in connection with the matter, a statement he made on the day Okonkwo and others were paraded fingered the killers as suspected cultists.\n\nPart of the statement he read while parading them said: \u201cYou are aware of the menace of cultism in the state, particularly in Awka and environs. You will recall that on 14th December, 2021, cultists attacked the chairman of Tricycle Owners Association in broad day light near Unizik junction. Two Police officers who were in the vicinity were killed and their weapons, two AK 47 rifles, carted away.\n\n\u201cAgain on 26th February, 2022 the same cult gang attacked a funeral party at Ebenebe in Awka North LGA killing several mourners.\n\n\u201cThese serious incidents motivated the Command to go the extra mile in intelligence gathering and discreet investigation.\n\n\u201cIn the past two weeks, several members of the gang were arrested by police operatives working in synergy with important stakeholders in the security sector.\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday 15th March, 2022 information was received that the same cult group had launched an attack on Unizik vigilante group at miracle junction, Ifite, Awka.\n\n\u201cPolice operatives were mobilized to lay ambush for the gang as they fled from the scene. The effort paid off as the police succeeded in demobilizing the gang and recovering a cache of weapons which included the two AK-47 rifles earlier stolen from the two policemen murdered on 14th December, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe leader of the gang, one Uchenna Nwobu a.k.a Anali was killed, while the other gang member was arrested\u201d.\n\nThe CP explained that investigation into the matter was ongoing, even as he assured that the police would track down other members of the gang.",

          "text": "By Eric Ikhilae, Bolaji Ogundele and Gbenga Omokhunu, Abuja\n\nCBN governor: I\u2019m having fun\n\nAppointees sue APC, INEC\n\nTwenty-four hours after President Muhammadu Buhari ordered top government employees seeking political offices to resign, Central Bank of Nigerian (CBN) Governor Godwin Emefiele, visited him at Aso Villa yesterday.\n\nDetails of the meeting were unavailable, but Emefiele told reporters to expect \u201cnews\u201d, adding that he was \u201chaving fun\u201d with speculations around his purported bid for the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential ticket.\n\n\u201cThere is no news now, but there will be news. You heard me, I said there is no news, but there will be news,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen reminded that given the office he holds, his ambition is creating anxiety among Nigerians and the international community, Emefiele quipped that he was having fun with the situation.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet them have a heart attack. It\u2019s good to have a heart attack. I am having a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nPosters and vehicles branded with his face are in town.\n\nA group also purchased the APC nomination and expression of interest forms on his behalf.\n\nEmefiele has, however, disowned the group, claiming it was done without his consent.\n\nBut, he went to court for constitutional interpretation of his continuous stay in office while bidding for the ticket.\n\nWednesday\u2019s presidential directive has put paid to any doubt on whether appointees eyeing political offices should exit.\n\nSecretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Boss Mustapha, clarified the resignation directive by the President in a circular dated May 11.\n\nThe circular explained that the Presidential order is not limited to the members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) but all ministries, departments and agencies.\n\nForeign Services and Extra-ministerial offices are also affected.\n\nThe circular reads in part: \u201cMr. President has observed and noted the expression of interest and intention by some members of the Federal Executive Council, heads of extra-ministerial departments, agencies, parastatals of government, ambassadors and other political office holders to contest the upcoming presidential, gubernatorial, national and state assemblies elections.\n\n\u201cConsequently, Mr. President has directed that the affected office holders aspiring to run for various offices in the 2023 General Elections, should tender their resignation on or before Monday, the 16th of May, 2022.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, this directive affects all ministers, heads and members of extra-ministerial departments, agencies and parastatals of government, ambassadors as well as other political appointees who desire to contest for elective offices.\n\n\u201cFor smooth running of the machinery of government and our foreign missions, affected ministers are to hand over to Ministers of State where they exist or to the Permanent Secretary, where there is no Minister of State.\n\n\u201cAmbassadors shall hand over to their Deputy Heads of Mission or the most Senior Foreign Service Officer in line with established practices.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, Heads of Extra-Ministerial Departments, Agencies and Parastatals are to hand over to the most senior Director/Officer as may be peculiar to the organisation, in line with the service wide Circular No. SGF.50/S. Il/C.2/268 of 4th December 2017.\n\n\u201cThe contents of this circular and the incidental directives take effect immediately.\u201d\n\nEmefiele was copied with the circular.\n\nAlso yesterday, three federal appointees with political ambitions filed a suit at the Federal High Court in Abuja to challenge Section 84(11) & (12) of the Electoral Act 2022 which requires them to resign.\n\nThey sued the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe plaintiffs are Sodique Baba Abubakar, Sodique Lawal Abubakar and Bindir Umar Buba.\n\nBaba said he is Nigeria\u2019s Ambassador to the Republic of Chad and intends to contest for Bauchi Governor.\n\nLawal said he is a Special Assistant in the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) and intends to contest for the House of Representatives.\n\nBuba, who is also eyeing a seat in the House of Representatives, said he is the National Coordinator, Social Investment Programme in the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nIn the suit numbered FHC/ABJ/CS/641/2022, filed by their lawyer, Adeniyi Akintola (SAN), the plaintiffs are praying for an order declaring the APC\u2019s directive that political appointees should resign based on Section 84 (11) and (12) of the Electoral Act 2022 is unconditional and therefore null and void.\n\nThe APC members are contending that the section is discriminatory and unconstitutional and therefore should not be a basis to disqualify them.\n\nThey stated, in a supporting affidavit, that they had obtained expression of interest forms to contest in the APC primaries.\n\nThe plaintiffs stated that pursuant to the signing of the Electoral Act into law, there had been threats that political appointees would be disqualified from contesting APC primaries because of Section 84 (11) and (12).\n\nThey added that sections 65, 66, 107, 131, 137, 177 and 182 of the 1999 Constitution cover the qualification requirements of political aspirants.\n\nThe plaintiffs claim that Article 2 of the APC Constitution affirms the supremacy of the Constitution but the party breached it with its May 7 directive that all political appointees must resign 30 days before the primaries.\n\nThey stated that the section is at the moment standing in their way to achieving their political ambitions.\n\nAccording to the plaintiffs, unless the defendants are restrained, APC and INEC will prevent them from participating in the primaries.\n\nThe plaintiffs want the court to declare as unconstitutional, illegal and unlawful the APC\u2019s directive that political appointees must resign from their positions before they can participate as voting delegates or be voted for in the convention or primaries.\n\nThey also want an injunction restraining the APC and INEC, either by themselves or agents from preventing, hindering or stopping them from attending or participating in the party\u2019s congress, convention or primaries for the purpose of voting or being voted for as candidates.\n\nCNPP, ZLP hail Buhari on resignation directive\n\nThe Conference of Nigeria Political Parties (CNPP) and the National Chairman of Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) Chief Dan Nwanyanwu praised President Buhari for issuing the resignation directive.\n\nCNPP, in a statement signed by its Secretary General, Chief Willy Ezugwu, said the directive was \u201cvery timely\u201d as the appointees \u201cwill not be able to concentrate on the job of governance\u201d.\n\nChief Nwanyanwu said: \u201cThis decision is supported by morality and conscience.\u201d",

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nElder statesman, Chief Edwin Clark had accused Kalu of betraying the Igbo cause by dropping his presidential ambition and supporting Senate President, Ahmed Lawan. Clark said although Kalu was one of the oldest vocal frontline politicians in the South-East, he doubted his sincerity and transparency. He added that it was surprising that Kalu did not only drop his ambition to contest the 2023 presidential election, but also declared his support for the presidential ambition of Lawan who hails from North-East.\n\nKalu, however, dismissed the accusation and said that rather he is doing his best to reintegrate the South-East into mainstream politics.He tackled Clark and wondered why the elderstatesman didn\u2019t call his kinsmen from the South South, plotting to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari to order.\n\nHe said though he respects Clark as an elderstatesman, he would not, however, allow his unsubstantiated claims to go unchallenged.\n\nKalu said: \u201cI have great respect for Chief Edwin Clark. He is an elderstatesman and a patriotic Nigerian. I want to sincerely commend him for openly supporting the South East geopolitical zone to produce the next President of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that I remind him that I didn\u2019t betray my people.

The truth is, Chief Edwin Clark knows the South East cannot get the ticket of any party in an open contest as it is today without a gentleman agreement to concede it to them.\u201d\n\nContinuing, he said: \u201cIf all the aspirants from the South West and South South cannot support their brothers from the South East, it is only politically correct to support the North East geo political zone, which to me is the shortest route for the South East geopolitical zone to produce the president after their eight years instead of waiting for another 16 years.\n\n\u201cIt is rather surprising to me that Chief Edwin Clark didn\u2019t call the majority of other Southerners including governors working against the South East to order or the names he called me.\n\n\u201cWhat did you say or do when all the aspirants from South South and South West were buying forms to run against South Easterners who have always supported them.\n\n\u201cI know some people want us to keep quiet and then allow other Southerners take turn of South East. If you meant well for the South East , you could have discouraged other aspirants against running for President.\n\n\u201cNothing stops the South supporting only presidential aspirants from the South East .

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

          "text": "Interswitch has received $110 million in joint investment from LeapFrog investments and Tiana Africa Capital, according to a statement released by the two private investment companies on Wednesday. The digital payment company is Africa\u2019s second unicorn, and its latest investment will help it to scale digital payment services across the continent.\n\nFounded in 2002, Interswitch disrupted Nigeria\u2019s cash-driven economy by introducing electronic payments and switching services. When Interswitch entered Nigeria\u2019s financial scene, it was estimated that there were less than 200,000 Nigerians with internet access, with many still adjusting to their newly acquired mobile phones. Despite the existence of other e-payment services that had received operating licenses 6 years before Interswitch was established, Interswitch became Nigeria\u2019s first e-payment service to be connected to all banks. Today, it provides payment rails for Nigeria\u2019s online banking system and is known for its consumer-facing products: Quickteller, an online consumer services platform for bill payments and airtime purchases, and Verve, its pan-African debit card scheme, which is available in 185 countries via its partnership with Discover.\n\nInterswitch\u2019s last funding round was in 2019 when VISA acquired a 20% stake, valued at $200 million, and helped it become Africa\u2019s second unicorn. Even then, its products: Verve and Quickteller, were already selling in 23 African countries and had a physical presence in Gambia, Uganda and Kenya. Today, at a $1 billion valuation, Interswitch is touted as one of Africa\u2019s biggest electronic payments and infrastructure companies.\n\nAmidst conversations about the proliferation of fintech companies in Nigeria and Africa, Interswitch is strengthening its pan-African expansion strategy which includes acquiring new customers and expanding financial inclusion on the continent. At last count, Africa had 350 million unbanked adults and recent data from the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA) shows that 70% of the world\u2019s $1 trillion mobile money market is in Africa. It is no longer news that the future of banking is in Africa; Interswitch, a pioneer in the African mobile money space, doesn\u2019t want to be left behind.\n\n\u201cThe evolution of fintech in Nigeria and the broader sub-Saharan region has been driven by the need to solve challenges and barriers that exist within the traditional financial system,\u201d Interswitch Group CEO Mitchell Elegbe said in a statement. \u201cInterswitch was born from the need to develop solutions that match the unique needs of local customers and merchants.\u201d\n\nReiterating Interswitch\u2019s plans to replicate its financial disruption in other African countries, LeapFrog Investments\u2019 partner and head of Africa financial services, Karima Ola, said that company \u201chas been disrupting the cash economy, driving digital payments and promoting equitable financial inclusion in Nigeria for two decades. This investment by LeapFrog affirms the formidable talent at Interswitch, and how well-placed it is to seize the significant opportunity in Africa\u2019s evolving digital payments landscape.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "CAF is tackling Africa's $4bn cybersecurity threat",
          "text": "As African businesses grow in number and reach, the importance of cybersecurity in Africa must be reiterated. More Africans are coming online, increasing the continent\u2019s contribution to the global economy, and everyone from businesses to governments and individuals must learn to protect their data and digital sovereignty.\n\nGlobally, businesses lose about $1 trillion per annum to cybercrime. From ransomware attacks and phishing scams, to cryptojacking and malware, cybersecurity threats are on the rise as the world moves to become a \u201cglobal village\u201d.\n\nAfrican countries are often erroneously tagged as the countries where most cybercrimes originate from, but this has consistently been proven false. China, Russia, Brazil, India, and the United States have repeatedly topped the charts, and only 1 African country\u2014Nigeria\u2014has frequently made some of these lists.\n\nAlthough many African countries might not have the largest cybersecurity threats, they are still at risk of cyberattacks. Interpol\u2019s Africa Cyberthreat Assessment Report states that over 90% of businesses on the continent are operating without the necessary cyber security protocols in place. In 2021, cybercrime reduced GDPs across Africa by 10%, resulting in a $4 billion loss. The top 5 cyber threats are online scams, digital extortion, business email compromise or BECs, ransomware, and botnets, and most were distributed through emails. Over 679 million cybercrime-related emails were detected last year alone\u2014with 219 million of this emanating from South Africa.\n\nAs these threats grow, so do the development of cybersecurity organisations like Ciberobs, an Ivorian cybersecurity firm providing analysis, information, and tools for governments and businesses. Ciberobs also hosts an annual cybersecurity conference\u2014Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\u2014where decision-makers across sectors gather to highlight the cyber threats facing Africa, and how to address them.\n\nIn preparation for the second edition of CAF scheduled to hold in Abidjan on May 9 and 10, TechCabal held a conversation with founder and Managing Partner Franck Ki\u00e9 to underline the importance of events like CAF.\n\nFranck Kie, Managing Partner of Ciberobs\n\nTimi Odueso: How did Ciberobs start?\n\nFranck Ki\u00e9: Well, I had my Masters\u2019 in cybersecurity. I remember I was doing a research paper and project on cybercrime in Cote d\u2019Ivoire and I couldn\u2019t find the data I needed. So I put up keyword alerts on the internet and found an old article with all the data. That journey\u2014searching for and finding the data\u2014is what really brought about Ciberobs. On a more personal level, I\u2019ve always really been interested in bringing my contribution to make Africa safer. As a kid, I grew up seeing political unrest all around C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and I always wanted to make Africa safer, one way or the other. When I had the chance to switch careers from business to cybersecurity, I took that chance, and I haven\u2019t looked back since.\n\nTO: Since Ciberobs founding in 2019, have you found any trends across regions? Are there some countries taking cyber security more seriously?\n\nFK: I wouldn\u2019t say that some regions are doing better than others, but we could say that for countries, some of which are doing better than others. Kenya, and East Africa in general, is making a lot of advancement, partly due to the growth of the mobile money industry. There are also other countries that are more advanced because they need the economic advantage; there\u2019s danger and risk at stake, and they need to tackle it. Countries like Morocco, Mauritius, Kenya, Togo, South Africa, and even C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire are definitely putting cybersecurity at the top of their lists. And C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for example, is taking it quite seriously because we\u2019ve been on the receiving end of global financial restrictions brought on by growing cybercrime in the country. Up until a few years ago, it was forbidden to send money, through Western Union, to Canada from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nTO: Hmm. Interesting. What advancements have been made since then to help curb these restrictions?\n\nFK: Awareness is the biggest advancement we\u2019re making now. People need to know about these cybersecurity risks. At Ciberobs, a lot of our work focuses on awareness and sensitisation. We write news, articles, and host webinars on cybersecurity. We\u2019re also planning to go to schools and universities to carry out these awareness programmes. Our biggest activity, however, is the Cyber Africa Forum event which we launched last year. In that first edition, we had over 700 attendees representing 60 countries, and we held roughly 150 meetings during the whole run.\n\nFirst edition of Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\n\nTO: Wow, was there a resolution made in the first edition?\n\nFK: No, there wasn\u2019t. Last year was really about promotion and awareness. We wanted governments to know the importance of taking more measures in order to improve cybersecurity. Last year was more like a sub-regional event. This year, we\u2019re going bigger. We\u2019re having delegations from ministries from Kinshasa, and Brazzaville; and top cybersecurity leaders from companies like Huawei, Ecobank, Deloitte, Orange Bank, Kaspersky, and PwC. What we\u2019re really looking forward to doing this year is facilitating discussions that will highlight information and solutions to cybersecurity issues for decision-makers across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to be a part of the conversation at CAF register for free here. The programme will take place in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, on May 9 and 10, 2022.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

          "title": "Does Nigeria have too many fintech startups? What the numbers say",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are at least 150 fintech startups in Nigeria, depending on who you ask. Statista reports that there were 144 fintech startups as of 2021 and a 2020 McKinsey report puts the number of standalone fintech startups at over 200. Ongoing research by our data arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, reveals there are at least 270 active startups in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the McKinsey report, most of these startups are focused on payments and lending. Consequently, it is not unusual to hear comments on the proliferation of fintech startups in the country, which begs the question, are there too many fintech startups in Nigeria?\n\nWhy is every Nigerian startup entrepreneur trying to create a fin-tech startup. Why do I need a 1000 different ways to pay for my plantain? \u2014 Aniekan (@ObiHabbibi) May 10, 2022\n\nA common criticism in the fintech conversation is that too many startups are solving the same problem and barely moving the needle. The value proposition for many startups revolves around banking the unbanked and providing better (read faster) financial services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, even with all this, one could argue that financial services have only marginally improved, with most fintech services unable to offer superior services to traditional financial institutions.\n\nFor example, lending apps in Nigeria offer loans in minutes without requiring collateral for users. As impressive as this is, startups still have to contend with debt recovery. While a few startups report repayment rates in the 90th percentile, there are widespread reports of lending startups resorting to desperate measures to get their loans back.\n\nCustomer service is another aspect that fintech startups do not seem to have completely figured out. In a test conducted by the Techpoint Africa team, we discovered that traditional financial institutions did not fare badly in customer service compared to fintech startups. In fact, in some metrics, they fared better than fintech startups.\n\nThe mission to bank the unbanked, which is frequently bandied about, is also moving slowly, and only 54.6 million Nigerians have a BVN, a vital requirement for opening a bank account in Nigeria.\n\nAdmittedly, people can only register for their BVN at banks. Therefore, there is only so much fintech startups can do in this regard. Still, one must wonder if most startups have not opted to build replicas of existing solutions rather than going after new frontiers.\n\nToo many fintech startups?\n\nLooking at the numbers alone will suggest that there are too many fintech startups, so let\u2019s look at how Nigeria compares to other countries.\n\nWith 1.4 billion people, India is only second to China in population. It is also home to 6,636 fintech startups. The largest country in South America, Brazil, has 1,446 fintech startups for its 215 million inhabitants.\n\nIn the United States and the United Kingdom, we have two world\u2019s largest economies. While the United States has 8,775 fintech startups for its 334.6 million people, the United Kingdom has 1,600 fintech startups serving 68.5 million people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBelow is the ratio of fintech startups to the population of each country:\n\nIndia \u2013 1 fintech for 210,970 people\n\nBrazil \u2013 1 fintech for 148,686 people\n\nUnited States \u2013 1 fintech for 38,131 people\n\nUnited Kingdom \u2013 1 fintech for 27,200 people\n\nNigeria \u20131 fintech for 740,740 people\n\nOn this evidence, there aren\u2019t too many startups in Nigeria. Looking at the numbers, one could say that we need at least 1,000 more fintech startups in the country.\n\nWhile the focus is often on how well they have improved financial services in the country \u2014 a fair metric for assessment \u2014 perhaps we should look at other metrics like how many jobs they have created and the industries or services they power.\n\nTo bring financial services closer to the last mile, fintech startups have used an agency banking model that indirectly provides jobs for these agents. OPay, TeamApt, Paga, and CrowdForce are some of the startups with the most agents; between them, they have at least 434,000 agents.\n\nWhen you add the 770,000 and 120,000 agents from MoMo and First Mobile, respectively, it is clear that fintech startups are creating value.\n\nFintech startups also power other industries. A familiar example is PiggyVest, launched in 2016 to help users digitise their savings. A crucial part of their success was launching after Paystack did. If they had launched earlier, users would have had limited options to deposit money, which may have shut the business down.\n\neCommerce startups also benefit from fintech startups with a wide range of payment options provided for merchants, which would have been impossible just a few years ago.\n\nTo the moon\n\nRegardless of the progress made by fintech startups, one thing is sure; much more can be done. While the population of Nigerians with a bank account has steadily grown, a 2021 EFInA report reveals that only 45% of Nigerians are banked.\n\nSimilarly, it states that less than 30% of adult Nigerians have or use financial services from non-banking institutions. With most active fintech startups focused on payments and lending, there is still room for innovation in insurance, where 97% of Nigerians do not have health insurance, investments/wealth management, and cross border payments.\n\nWith a growing population, more players are needed to do the hard work of providing financial services to rural dwellers or improving the services currently available to urban dwellers. Either way, as a wise man once said, \u201cit is day one.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Instead, it connects African tech startups with African diaspora investors, mentors, and consultants. Isn\u2019t it completely different?\n\nWhen I saw the word \u201cBantaba\u201d for the first time yesterday, my first thought was, \u201cWhat is Bantaba again?\u201d \ud83d\ude02\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, Ogheneruemu details the startup\u2019s journey and provides a brief history of the word \u201cBantaba\u201d. If you\u2019re Gambian, you should be familiar with it.\n\nA history class is in order, though: Bantaba is an ancient Manding word for a large tree in the village square where elders gathered to talk about issues that affected everyone in the village.\n\nTo grasp how the word\u2019s origin relates to the startup, Lamin Darboe (CEO) describes Bantaba as the digital version of the square-like convergence at the foot of the big village tree. But this time, it\u2019s to help diaspora and tech startups \u201caddress the challenges back home.\u201d\n\nAlso, Ogheneruemu discusses how the company operates and what it is, and it\u2019s not.

Initially, Identitypass was developing a platform that required customers to make payments with biometrics \u2014 face, fingerprints, or voice \u2014 and cards. However, while developing the platform, they ran into problems with verification checks.\n\nConsequently, they transitioned into a company that makes it simple for African digital businesses to validate that their customers are who they claim to be.\n\nSince its launch in January 2021 by co-founders, Lanre Ogungbe, Niyi Adegboye, and David Obi, Identitypass claims it has verified over one million unique government-issued IDs.\n\nExamples of these are national IDs, driver\u2019s licenses, international passports, bank verification numbers (BVN), phone numbers, vehicle plate numbers, debit cards, security watchlists and tax history.\n\nFurther, the company recently launched a SaaS platform. According to Ogungbe, Identitypass\u2019s new offering \u2014 software rather than a plug-and-play solution \u2014 gives it a competitive advantage.\n\nThe company intends to collaborate with numerous regulatory agencies to create a world-class data security framework for Africa. Plus, they will work with multiple alliances to form more formidable and strategic partnerships across Africa.\n\nAlso, it plans to use the seed funding, to expand its existing infrastructure, launch new verticals focused on compliance, security, and data collection, and expand into new African countries.\n\nMARA\u2019s $23m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMARA, a pan-African crypto exchange platform, has completed a $23 million equity and token seed raise.\n\nCrypto and web3 investors included Coinbase Ventures, Alameda Research (FTX), and Distributed Global. Also, TQ Ventures, DIGITAL, Nexo, Huobi Ventures, Day One Ventures, Infinite Capital, and DAO Jones, with about 100 other crypto investors, participated in the round.\n\nFounded by Chi Nnadi (CEO) in 2021, the company plans to \u201cincrease the number of Africans who can participate in the crypto economy.\u201d\n\nIt claims to be developing a suite of products to address various crypto-finance needs for the African market. Its flagship product is a crypto-brokerage app for consumers to buy, send, sell, and withdraw fiat and crypto assets.\n\nFurther, MARA intends to enter Kenya and Nigeria in July 2022. The company then plans to launch a pro-exchange in Q1 2023 for sophisticated traders who use technical analysis and prefer a complete set of trading options to the traditional exchange options on MARA\u2019s retail app.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nMeet the 6 teams competing for the $2,500 cash prize in the TABS Web3 Hackathon\n\nOpportunities\n\nPolygon is sponsoring 50 free tickets to Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS) holding on May 21, 2022.

Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBacked by Coinbase Ventures, Alameda Research (FTX), Distributed Global, and more, the company also announces a partnership with the Central African Republic to become its official crypto partner and advisor to the President\n\nMARA, a Pan-African crypto exchange, launched today and announced $23 million in funding from Coinbase Ventures, Alameda Research (FTX), Distributed Global, TQ Ventures, DIGITAL, Nexo, Huobi Ventures, Day One Ventures, Infinite Capital, DAO Jones (investment DAO backed by Mike Shinoda, Steve Aoki and Disclosure), and nearly 100 other crypto investors, and angels including Amit Bhatia and Hamad Alhoimaizi.\n\nIn addition, MARA has also announced a partnership with the Central African Republic, which just passed a bill legalizing Bitcoin as legal tender. As part of this partnership, MARA will become the official crypto partner of the Central African Republic and an advisor to the President on crypto strategy and planning.\n\nMARA\u2019s launch comes at a critical inflection point in Sub-Saharan Africa. Political and economic instability has led to devaluation of currencies across the region, while the current centralized financial system continues to present ongoing obstacles to the development of both local economies and individuals. As a result, food prices have doubled to tripled in some areas and created record-breaking interest rates. These tired systems have prompted a dire need for a decentralized alternative.\n\nMARA\u2019s mission is to become the portal to the crypto economy for the African population. While cutting-edge technologies such as cryptocurrency have shown incredible promise among Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s predominantly young and technologically-native population, there are considerable hurdles to using them. Many existing global exchanges cannot operate in the region due to regulatory challenges as well as difficulty reaching the African consumer in an authentic way. These barriers to access significantly restrict both the number of people who can participate in the crypto economy and the potential uses for digital currency in the region.\n\nThe MARA suite of products addresses a variety of essential crypto-finance needs while complying with local regulations and being built authentically for the African audience. MARA\u2019s products include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMARA Wallet \u2013 a brokerage app offering the crypto-curious user a friendly, distilled experience through which they can buy, send, sell and withdraw both fiat and crypto assets instantly and without any prior crypto knowledge.\n\n\u2013 a brokerage app offering the crypto-curious user a friendly, distilled experience through which they can buy, send, sell and withdraw both fiat and crypto assets instantly and without any prior crypto knowledge. Pro-Exchange \u2013 a full-feature cryptocurrency platform focused on experienced users that offers a comprehensive suite of trading options and technical analysis tools.\n\nMARA Chain \u2013 a layer-1 blockchain, powered by the native MARA token, that gives savvy developers a place to build decentralized applications that will help shape the future of the African crypto economy.\n\nThe MARA executive team is led by Chi Nnadi, Lucas Llin\u00e1s M\u00fanera, Dearg OBartuin, and Kate Kallot, and is joined by board advisors Kojo Annan and Tatiana Koffman.\n\n\u201cMARA\u2019s mission is to facilitate a more equitable distribution of capital by providing a decentralized alternative that spans across tribes, class, cultures, and countries,\u201d says Chi Nnadi, co-founder and CEO of MARA. \u201cOur goal is to close the gap in opportunities for Sub-Saharan individuals and establish a financial infrastructure that they can build their lives upon.\u201d\n\nUnlike its competitors from North America and Europe, MARA\u2019s onboarding, support, and ecosystem reflects the needs of Africans. KYC/AML is compliant to global standards, and is compatible with international financial regulations. Customer support is easily accessed and will be available in both local and international languages.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to partner with MARA as it embarks on building a digital financial system for Sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d says Schuster Tanger, Co-Founder of TQ Ventures. \u201cWith the right resources, this region has potential for mass adoption of cryptocurrency. To that end, the local knowledge and specialized skills of the MARA team is quite promising.\u201d\n\nMARA will initially launch in Kenya, Nigeria, and surrounding regions. The MARA Wallet app will be available in the App Store and Google Play stores. Pre-registered users will join a queue to enable early access on a first-come, first-served basis. Users can jump up the queue by referring others, and earn crypto rewards by doing so, while increasing their odds of winning additional prizes and rewards in the process. Once onboarded, the MARA Wallet will enable users to invest in crypto and send money to their family members in real time, without processing times or delays.\n\nAbout MARA\n\nMARA is building Africa\u2019s portal to the crypto economy through a Pan-African suite of products that addresses a variety of crypto-finance needs while complying with local regulations and being built authentically for the African audience. MARA will initially launch in Kenya and Nigeria, with a simplified user-friendly consumer app through which users can easily buy, sell, send, and withdraw cryptocurrencies. MARA will also launch a pro-exchange for experienced users who prefer a full set of trading options and technical analysis tools.

I am having a lot of fun\u201d, the governor of Nigeria\u2019s apex bank said.\n\n\u201cThere is no news now, but there will be news\u201d.\n\nProbed further on his unannounced visit to the Presidential Villa, the CBN boss repeated: \u201cYou heard me, I said there is no news but there will be news\u201d.\n\nAlthough there has been no official statement on his visit to the Presidential, it was not immediately clear if the visit is part of the regular visit he makes to the presidential villa.\n\nThe visit may also not be unconnected with his recent involvement in politicking which saw his name being mentioned among the Presidential aspirants in the forthcoming All Progressives Congress (APC) primary election.\n\nIt was also not clear if he has sent in his resignation letter in compliance with the President Buhari\u2019s directives to all government appointees running for political offices to resign and pursue their ambitions.\n\nBuhari has since asked cabinet ministers who have Presidential ambitions to quit their positions while a circular from the Federal Government has told civil servants including Emefiele who have political ambitions to resign from their posts.\n\nIn a related development, a new twist emerged at the Federal High Court in Abuja on Thursday, as the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) and two others applied to be joined in the suit by the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Godwin Emefiele, seeking to enforce his right to participate in the 2023 presidential election without re-signing.\n\nThe court had on Monday adjourned to Thursday to enable the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) appear before it to show why the court should not restrain them from preventing the CBN Governor from realizing his political ambition by participating in all the processes leading to the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe summoning of INEC and AGF was sequel to a motion ex-parte argued by Emefiele\u2019s lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, to restrain the two defendants from taking any step that would jeopardize the interest of his client.\n\nRuling in the exparte, Justice Mohammed had ordered the CBN Governor to serve all court processes in relation to the suit he filed against INEC and the AGF who are 1st and 2nd defendants respectively.\n\nAt the hearing of the matter on Thursday, both INEC and AGF were in court in line with the court\u2019s order.\n\nBefore proceeding with the case of the CBN Governor, two lawyers stood up to announce appearances for their clients.\n\nRead also: Emefiele\u2019s presidential ambition posses ethical dilemma\n\nFirst was a Senior advocate of Nigeria, Sebastiane Hon, who informed the court of the intention of his client, the PDP to join as an interested party, which was immediately followed by one John Martins and Olukunle Ebun, who also announced appearances, suing for themselves and on behalf of the \u201cSave Nigeria our Fatherland\u201d\n\nResponding, Emefiele\u2019s lawyer, who did not oppose the applicants joining the suit, undertook to serve the applicants with all processes within 24 hours.\n\nWhile IINEC through its lawyer, Ibrahim Inuwa, did not also oppose the application for joinder, that of the AGF, Dipo Okpeseyi, did and urged the court to ensure that only proper parties should be allowed to join in the matter.\n\nIn a short ruling, the court joined the PDP, John Martins and Olukunle Ebun as 3rd, 4th and 5th defendants respectively.\n\nJustice Mohammed in addition ordered accelerated hearing in the matter, adding that while the 1st and 2nd defendants were directed to respond to the plaintiff\u2019s suit within Monday and Tuesday, the 3rd to 5th defendants have up till Wednesday next week to respond and the plaintiff, 24 hours to reply on point of law.\n\nJustice Mohammed subsequently adjourned to May 23 for parties to adopt their final written addresses.\n\nJustice Mohammed, while warning that the court will not entertain any request for extension of time since all parties have pledged to the accelerated hearing of the matter, also warned parties not to take any step that would undermine the proceedings.\n\nEmefiele had, amongst others, approached the Federal High Court for an Order restraining the defendants from preventing or hindering his participation in the process of the presidential election slated for February next year.\n\nHe expressed the fear that any political party he chooses to affiliate with in realizing his political ambition may disqualify him based on the provisions of Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022, which had barred political appointees from participating in the congresses and conventions of political parties unless the resigned 30 days to such conventions and congresses.\n\nSpecifically, he argued that by virtue of being a public servant he cannot be barred from participating in the political primaries of political parties by Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nHe submitted that Constitutional provisions stipulated that he can only resign his appointment as Governor of CBN 30 days to the presidential election which he is interested in contesting.\n\nAmongst the court processes he filed before the court was an application for maintenance of status, which he predicated on the fact that he would be prejudiced against or hurt if the court does not restrain the defendants from taking any step that would jeopardize his desire to contest the presidential election.",

This will be compounded by the increased spending associated with electioneering in Nigeria. The CBN, being the only institution vested with the responsibility to maintain price stability, must address this inflationary tendency,\u201d Adenikinju said.\n\nTemiloluwa Bamgbose",

          "text": "Continuous Voters Registration to end soon- INEC \u2026as CSOs charge INEC to do more to improve on the conduct of Ekiti election\n\nShare Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nChairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu has said the on-going continous voters registration exercise nationwide will be ending soon. He made this known during the quarterly meeting with civil society organizations (CSOs) at the Commission\u2019s office in Abuja.\n\nAccording to the chairman, the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise will be ending on the 30th June 2022.\n\nHe said, \u201d both the online pre-registration as well as the physical registration at designated centres are taking place simultaneously. However, online pre-registrants would require time to schedule appointments to complete their registration physically at designated centers.\n\nFor this reason, the Commission has decided to suspend the online registration in the next three weeks to enable the online registrants to complete their registration physically at the designated centres before the exercise is suspended on 30th June 2022.\n\nThis according to him, will enable the Commission to clean up the registration data, print the Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs)and compile the register ahead of the 2023 General Election.\n\nOn the cleaning up of the registration data,the chairman said that, the Commission addressed a Press Conference four weeks ago to present a report on the CVR exercise covering the period from June to December 2021.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, the Commission deployed the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS) which is a comprehensive and robust system involving not just the fingerprint identification but also the facial biometric recognition. The report of the ABIS is included among the documents in your folders for this meeting. There will also be a presentation on the exercise by our ICT Department\u201d.\n\nHe also said that, the Commission has reviewed the functionality of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) following the complaints received after the recent Area Council elections in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) held on 12th February 2022; noting that the Commission has just finished the configuration of the BVAS for the Ekiti State Governorship election.\n\nProf. Yakubu also said that, \u201cbeyond the conduct of primaries by political parties, the Commission is required to make Regulations and Guidelines for the implementation of the provisions of the Electoral Act. These Regulations and Guidelines, together with the Constitution and the Electoral Act, constitute the electoral legal framework that govern the conduct of elections. I am glad to report that the Commission will finalise the Regulations and Guidelines next week to guide the conduct of future elections, including the forthcoming Ekiti and Osun Governorship elections as well as the 2023 General Election\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere are many progressive provisions of the Electoral Act 2022 which require clear understanding to guide implementation. One of such provisions is the electronic transmission of election results. At this meeting, we will discuss the implementation of the provisions of Sections 60, 62 and 64 of the Electoral Act 2022 regarding the management of election results. We have prepared a document for discussion which is included in your folders for this meeting\u201d.\n\n\u201cSection 54(2) of the Electoral Act makes provision for assistive materials for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs).\n\nThis is another progressive provision of the new Electoral Act. Over the years, we have worked with the disability community in designing some of the assistive materials such as the Braille Ballot Guide and the provision of magnifying glasses for visually challenged voters and posters for the deaf. We are also working together to collect disaggregated data for PWDs to assist the Commission in optimally deploying the assistive materials. To deepen our collaboration, a meeting will be convened as early as next week with the disability community to discuss the implementation of the provisions of the new Electoral Act on inclusivity\u201d, he added.\n\nWhile commending the Commission for a job Welldone, Mrs Ene Obi, Country Director ActionAid & Convener Civil Society Situation Room who spoke on behalf of the CSOs said the Commission needs to do more to encourage citizens to register and come out to vote saying that that is one of the greatest challenges facing the electoral system.\n\n\u201cEven with the PVCs, a lot of people don\u2019t come out to vote and this is not helping the system. We want the Commission through its department for voters education to create more enlightenment,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Civil society organizations also urged the commission to do all within its powers to ensure there is serious improvement on the upcoming Ekiti state election and others.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "From PETER OKORE, Umuahia\n\nAhead of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) party primaries in Abia State, traditional rulers from Isuikwuato and Umunnaochi local government areas of tge state, have waded into the party\u2019s controversial guber zoning arrangement, with a demand that power should move to the old Isuikwuato district in line with the existing rotational arrangement, being championed by it.\n\nThe royal fathers made their position known in a statement titled: \u201cThe position and demand of Isuikwuato District in the Abia equation, come 2023\u201d.\n\nThey lamented that the marginalization of the Isuikwuato district ( comprising Isuikwuato and Umunneochi local governments), represented by the letter \u2018I\u2019 in the acronym from which Abia is coined, remains an aberration in Abia politics.\n\nIn the statement, signed by the chairman of Isuikwuato/Umunneochi Traditional Rulers Council, Eze Godson Ezekwesiri and Secretary, Eze Uwadiegwu Ogbonnaya, the royal fathers insisted that the time had come to end the age- long exclusion of Isuikwuato from the power equation in Abia.\n\nThe royal fathers, therefore, called on all political parties in Abia to give their governorship tickets to candidates from Isuikwuato district in the spirit of equity, fair play and \u2018be your brother\u2019s keeper\u2019 ethos of Igbo cosmology.\n\nTo make way for the resolution of the power equation, the traditional rulers demanded that \u201call political parties should zone their gubernatorial positions to the Isuikwuato District of Abia North Senatorial zone in the 2023 governorship election\u201d.\n\nTheir statement read in part:\u201dWe call on our brother traditional rulers, opinion leaders, stakeholders all over Abia State to abide by the Anagha Ezeikpe declaration(which stated that Isuikwuato is in line to produce the next governor in 2023)\u201d.\n\nThe Royal fathers delved into the historical records of the agitations for the creation of Abia and the power sharing arrangement put in place by the founding fathers and concluded that the rest of Abia have not been fair to Isuikwuato district.\n\nThey lamented that since the creation of Abia in 1991, no person from Isuikwuato has occupied the position of Governor, Deputy Governor, Speaker of House of Assembly, Chief Judge, Head of Service, Chief of Staff, Deputy Chief of Staff, among other top positions in the state.\n\nAccording to the traditional rulers, the erroneous narrative of lumping Isuikwuato into old Bende has been deliberately used to deny the district its rightful place in the scheme of things, thereby deviating from the Abia Charter of Equity, which is the basis for power sharing in the state.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore of great concern and worry that since 2019, Abians have been deceived and made to believe that what remains of ABIA state to-day (with the exit of old Afikpo Division in 1996 to Ebonyi state) is made up of the old Bende and Aba Divisions,\u201d the Royal fathers said.\n\nThey challenged those \u201cdeceiving\u201d the people with the old Aba and old Bende narrative to explain to the people why the Isuikwuato District with the letter \u201cI\u201d in the acronym has been completely forgotten in the scheme of things in what is supposedly God\u2019s Own State\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is most unfair and a deviation from the dreams, of the founding fathers of the state, with few still alive\u201d.\n\nTo further solidify their demand for micro-zoning of governorship tickets to Isuikwuato, the traditional rulers appealed to other aspirants from Abia North to respect the Abia Charter of Equity, adding that aspirants from Isuikwuayo should remain resolute in their pursuits.\n\n\u201cTo our sons in the gubernatorial race, they should go ahead and not succumb to any other position below the position of Governor dangled before them. This is our time and chance to produce the Governor of God\u2019s Own State 2023,\u201d the royal fathers stated",

Justice Akinwale Oladimeji.\n\nThe presentation of the cheques to the victims was a fulfilment of the financial component of the recommendations of the panel.\n\nThe panel had in its report recommended the sum of N53,290,000 as compensation for the 13 of the 21 cases heard.\n\nPresenting the cheques to the victims in his office at the state government secretariat, Abere, Osogbo, Governor Oyetola said the initiative had further confirmed that his administration was conscious of the fact that no society can truly progress where the reign of injustice, inequality and lawlessness is encouraged to thrive.\n\nHe reiterated his administration\u2019s commitment to continuously maintain peace, guarantee the security of lives and property of the citizens and advance the course of the security agencies through the provision of state-of-the-art security architectures.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s occasion should therefore be regarded as a deliberate quest to redress the wrongs of yesterday and set our society on the path of true healing,\u201d Oyetola said.\n\n\u201cOur decision to pay compensation, which ordinarily is not the responsibility of the state, since the police is not directly under our control, is a further testament to the commitment of our administration to peace, and the rule of law.\n\n\u201cLet me however, reiterate here that the list of all those that have secured judgement debts have been passed on to the federal government for necessary action, in line with the recommendation of the panel.\n\n\u201cAs an administration, we understand that no society can truly progress where the reign of injustice, inequality and lawlessness is encouraged to thrive.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the government and our people, I passionately appeal to all those who are justifiably aggrieved for the wrongs meted to them in one way or the other to forgive and allow the next chapter of true and sustainable healing to open up for the good of all.\n\n\u201cI assure you that we are committed to supporting the Nigeria Police Force in fully implementing relevant reforms that would enable it play its role of maintaining law and order.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s event is a further testament to the commitment of our Administration to peace, and the rule of law. As citizens and officers of the State, let us reciprocate this gesture by continuing to relate with each other with highest mutual civility, respect and understanding in the interest of sustainable peace and development.\n\n\u201cI salute the leadership of the Civil Society Organisations and youths for their understanding and tolerance over the years. I assure you that we will never let you down as a government in ensuring that we secure your future.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the Government and People of Osun, I express immense gratitude to the Hon. Justice Oladimeji-led Judicial Panel of Inquiry against Police Brutality, Human Rights Violations and Related Extra Judicial Killings for their impeccable services to the State\u201d, he said.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Chairman of the Panel, Justice Akin David Oladimeji extolled Governor Oyetola for deeming it fit to compensate the victims inspite the lean purse of the State.\n\nOladimeji who described the gesture as a right step in the right direction, noted that the decision would further register confidence in the minds of the people.\n\nSpeaking after they received their cheques, some of the victims who narrated their ordeals in the hands of police expressed their profound gratitude to the Governor for the kind gesture saying he has indeed demonstrated that he is people\u2019s Governor.",

I will be the bridge between the North and the South. because I am the Nigerian for all Nigerians,\u201d he added.\n\nAlthough he acknowledged the great efforts of all past leaders over the years, he, however, said as long as there is a child in Nigeria that cannot read or write, then the job is not done.\n\n\u201cAnd it is for this one child that I want to run for President because I will ensure that the law on compulsory basic education is enforced and quality of teaching improves in all public schools,\u201d he said.\n\nHe acknowledged that the nation has experienced setbacks in the last couple of years that no one could have imagined possible only less than a decade ago, he said 2023, therefore, presents a great moment of decision for Nigerians.\n\n\u201c2023 presents the moment to choose hope over hopelessness; the moment to choose peace and security over fear and terror; the moment to choose unity and inclusion over division and exclusion; the moment that we draw a bold line in the sands of history and say, \u2018no more\u2019 and then move ahead as one people, as one nation, towards our God-assigned destiny as the greatest black nation on the face of the earth,\u201d he added.\n\nOn his part, the chairman, Saraki Campaign Council, Prof. Iyorwuese Hagher, described the immediate-past Senate President as \u201ca real change maker\u201d, saying if elected as President in 2023, he will restore stability in Nigeria.\n\nHagher said Saraki will \u201cgive Nigerians, not the change from the top to the bottom, but the real change we wanted in 2015 to live in peace, pursue life, liberty, and happiness and be guaranteed security, prosperity and good health.\u201d\n\nHe further noted that Saraki is loaded with political capital as a man who has integrity, courage, and the love of Nigeria.\n\nHagher said his integrity was a reason why coalitions of party men and women were supporting him.\n\nHe explained that the Bukola Saraki Campaign for the Presidency symbolises the age and social movement when Nigerians have been gravely disappointed with politicians who were elected because of where they were born, the language they spoke, and the way and what they worshiped.\n\nSpeaking further, he said: \u201cIn Bukola you are witnessing a social movement in Nigeria when, (I paraphrase Dr. Luther King Jr.) \u2018Nigerians are ready to elect their President, Judged by the content of his/her political achievements and vision and not by his tribal origin, what language he speaks, and his faiths.'\u201d\n\nHe further noted that in the past three months Saraki has been in 36 States of Nigeria either in person or through his Campaign Council to declare his intention to contest for the elective position of President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHis declaration in all the 36 States of Nigeria was well received and the PDP Members and the Nigerian citizens are already in a frenzy to see him win the Primaries to become the flag-bearer of his party the PDP,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "The Government of Osun on Thursday presented cheques of N53,290,000.00 as compensation to victims of police brutality in the State.\n\nThe State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, affirmed that the motive was a deliberate quest to redress the wrongs of yesterday and set the State on the path of true healing.\n\nHe said the gesture was a further testament to the commitment of the State Government to peace, fairness, unity, justice, equality, and indeed, the rule of law.\n\nGovernor Oyetola, in compliance with the directive of the Federal Government, constituted the Judicial Panel of Inquiry against Police Brutality, Human Rights Violations and Related Extra Judicial Killings.\n\nThe Panel, which was headed by the retired Judge of the High Court, Hon. Justice Akinwale Oladimeji, was charged to look critically and painstakingly into cases of assault, illegal arrest, killings, brutality and other forms of rights abuse by the officers and men of the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) of the Nigerian Police.\n\nOyetola further said the presentation of the cheques to the victims was a fulfilment of the financial component of the recommendations of the Panel and that the state had also, in adherence to directive to States, submitted the report of the Panel to the Federal Government.\n\nThe Panel had in its report recommended the sum of N53,290,000 as compensation.\n\nPresenting the cheques to the victims as recommended by the Panel and approved by the State government, Governor Oyetola reiterated the Administration\u2019s commitment to continuously maintain peace, guarantee the security of lives and property of the citizens and advance the course of the security agencies through the provision of state-of-the-art security architecture.\n\nOyetola who appealed to the citizens to continue to be law abiding and always demonstrate the virtues of Omoluabi ethos that the State is known for, said the State would spare no effort to create an ambience of peace and tranquility for the citizens across the nooks and crannies of the State.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s occasion should therefore be regarded as a deliberate quest to redress the wrongs of yesterday and set our society on the path of true healing.\n\n\u201cOur decision to pay compensation, which ordinarily is not the responsibility of the State, since the Police is not directly under our control, is a further testament to the commitment of our Administration to peace, and the rule of law.\n\n\u201cLet me however reiterate here that the list of all those that have secured judgement debts have been passed on to the federal government for necessary action, in line with the recommendation of the Panel.\n\n\u201cAs an administration, we understand that no society can truly progress where the reign of injustice, inequality and lawlessness is encouraged to thrive.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the Government and our people, I passionately appeal to all those who are justifiably aggrieved for the wrongs meted to them in one way or the other to forgive and allow the next chapter of true and sustainable healing to open up for the good of all.\n\n\u201cI assure you that we are committed to supporting the Nigeria Police Force in fully implementing relevant reforms that would enable it play its role of maintaining law and order.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s event is a further testament to the commitment of our Administration to peace, and the rule of law. As citizens and officers of the State, let us reciprocate this gesture by continuing to relate with each other with the highest mutual civility, respect and understanding in the interest of sustainable peace and development.\n\n\u201cI salute the leadership of the Civil Society Organisations and youths for their understanding and tolerance over the years. I assure you that we will never let you down as a government in ensuring that we secure your future.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the Government and People of Osun, I express immense gratitude to the Hon. Justice Oladimeji-led Judicial Panel of Inquiry against Police Brutality, Human Rights Violations and Related Extra Judicial Killings for their impeccable services to the State\u201d, he said.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Chairman of the Panel, Justice Akin David Oladimeji, extolled Governor Oyetola for deeming it fit to compensate the victims despite the lean purse of the State.\n\nOladimeji who described the gesture as a right step in the right direction noted that the decision would further register confidence in the minds of the people.\n\nSpeaking after receiving their cheques, some of the victims, who narrated their ordeals at the hands of police, expressed their profound gratitude to the Governor for the kind gesture, saying he has indeed demonstrated that he is people\u2019s Governor.",

          "title": "Mushe (XMU) and Fantom (FTM): Why Analysts Say You Should Buy and Hold",
          "text": "Technological evolution has brought about many benefits and one of them is the digital currency or cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency or \u2018crypto\u2019 is arguably the future of currency and a facilitator of cross border trade.\n\n\n\nCurrently, people dealing in crypto do it because it is quickly becoming a popular means of income trading. Others do it because they like the stability that comes with crypto, unlike currencies that can be manipulated by central banks, while others like the privacy that comes from transitions.\n\n\n\nFor whatever reason you pick it up, cryptocurrency is the currency of the future and identifying which value tokens to invest in is critical.\n\nAnalysts have recommended buying and holding two crypto tokens, Mushe (XMU) and Fantom (FTM), and here\u2019s why. With thousands of tokens currently available on the market, finding the right ones to invest in might seem like a challenge, especially for new investors still gaining experience using decentralized blockchains to complete transactions.\n\n\n\nHowever, both Mushe and Fantom make investing easy because they\u2019re both designed with the future in mind, prioritizing scalability, security, and speed to offer safer, faster experiences. Anyone interested in a seamless investing opportunity could benefit tremendously from what these tokens offer.\n\nThe two tokens have significantly lower fees than most cryptocurrencies on the market. Higher fees often discourage people from investing in the first place. The low fees involved help reduce expenses while further enhancing the opportunity for individuals to earn a more significant ROI from buying and holding. In addition, investors can hold for as little or as long as they would like to make substantial gains.\n\nAdditionally, both tokens offer world-class security guaranteed for investors. For example, Mushe is built on the Constellations Hypergraph, which offers the highest security possible. Provided by the Constellations Network, the Hypergraph provides one of the most credible secure blockchains available. Its security level is so high that it is used by the US Department of Defense.\n\nBefore investing in an asset, the speed and scalability of cryptocurrency are important factors to consider. Speed looks at the number of transactions that can be made within a second while scalability determines the number of nodes that can be available in a network, which affects the number of transactions that a network can carry at a time. Both Fantom and Mushe can quickly and efficiently process thousands of transactions within seconds while scaling to thousands of nodes in no time. The speed at which these transactions occur is a major convenience to individuals wanting to put money into decentralized tokens while making even more money from the investments.\n\nInvestors will find Mushe and Fantom easier to invest in because of their compatibility with different platforms. While built with layer_0 technology, Mushe can connect with any blockchain, allowing investors to decide which platform they want to use. Providing a more customized experience is a top priority for Mushe, ensuring investors have an enjoyable experience, tailored to their preferences. Fantom is only compatible with Ethereum, but as the second most commonly used blockchain, it makes completing these transactions such a simple, stress-free experience.\n\nAccording to analysts, Mushe and Fantom have all the right features that will keep their tokens useful and valuable for the foreseeable future.

          "text": "Harry Kane scored twice as Tottenham beat 10-man Arsenal 3-0 on Thursday with a north London derby masterclass that kept alive their hopes of finishing in the Premier League\u2019s top four.\n\nAntonio Conte\u2019s side would have been eliminated from the race to qualify for next season\u2019s Champions League if they had lost to their bitter rivals on Thursday.\n\nBut Kane tormented Arsenal once again as the Tottenham striker opened the scoring with a controversial penalty.\n\nCrucially, Arsenal\u2019s Rob Holding was sent off for two bookings in seven minutes.\n\nREAD ALSO: FG Withdraws Nigeria From International Basketball Competitions\n\nKane netted again before the interval and Son Heung-min bagged Tottenham\u2019s third goal in the second half.\n\nInstead of sealing a return to the Champions League for the first time since the 2016-17 season, fourth-placed Arsenal now face a nerve-jangling conclusion to the top-four battle.\n\nArsenal still hold a slender advantage, but the end of their four-match winning run leaves them just one point ahead of fifth-placed Tottenham, with both sides having two games left.\n\nConte said several weeks ago that it would be a \u201cmiracle\u201d if Tottenham reached the Champions League given their lowly position when he replaced the sacked Nuno Espirito Santo in November.\n\nBut their victory in arguably the biggest north London derby since Arsenal won the league at White Hart Lane in 2004 ensured that miracle could still come true.\n\nConte believes finishing in the top four is \u201clike winning a title in another country, a big achievement\u201d given the depth of talent and wealth at the top of the Premier League.\n\nTo decide who takes the lucrative prize, Tottenham host struggling Burnley on Sunday then travel to relegated Norwich, while Mikel Arteta\u2019s men visit Newcastle on Monday and entertain Everton.\n\nArteta\u2019s bewildered expression throughout Arsenal\u2019s capitulation suggested it is far from certain he will be able to lift his players to finish the job.\n\nThird-placed Chelsea, five points above Tottenham, will likely need a draw from their last two games to be sure of their top-four place given their vastly superior goal difference.\n\nAs well as the huge European stakes for both sides, Tottenham also felt lingering resentment about Arsenal\u2019s successful appeal to have this fixture postponed in January due to Covid and injury problems.\n\nKane stars\n\nThe acrimony did not take long to boil over in the deafening atmosphere at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with tackling flying in and Conte booked for protesting vigorously after Ben Davies\u2019s foul on Bukayo Saka.\n\nAmid the maelstrom, it was Tottenham who landed the first blow after 22 minutes.\n\nCedric Soares collided with Son as they contested Dejan Kulusevski\u2019s cross in the six-yard box and the contact was enough to convince Paul Tierney to award a penalty.\n\nArsenal surrounded Tierney to complain angrily, but Kane stepped up to send Aaron Ramsdale the wrong way with a nerveless spot-kick.\n\nThe wall of sound from four sides of the stadium underlined the significance of Tottenham seizing the initiative.\n\nArsenal were shell-shocked and the game shifted decisively in Tottenham\u2019s favour in the 33rd minute.\n\nEric Dier\u2019s long pass targeted Son and Holding crudely blocked his path with his shoulder, a needless offence that prompted Tierney to send off the defender for his second booking.\n\nScenting blood, Tottenham doubled their lead four minutes after Holding\u2019s premature exit.\n\nRodrigo Bentancur flicked on a corner and Kane stooped to head home from virtually on the line as Conte celebrated with a jig of delight.\n\nKane, the top scorer in north London derby history in all competitions, now has 13 goals in 17 meetings with Arsenal, who must rue the day they rejected him as a eight-year-old.\n\nThe night got even better for Conte in the 47th minute as Kane rolled Gabriel and the ball broke for Son to clip a deft finish into the corner.\n\nRamsdale made fine saves from Emerson Royal and Kane to stop Arsenal being completely humiliated, but the damage had already been done.\n\nAFP",

You heard me, I said there is no news but there will be news.\u201d\n\nWhen further told that international community as well as Nigerians are interested in his position as regards the presidential directive, the CBN Governor stressed that he was not bothered by their concern saying he was having fun while those concerned are free to have heart attack.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cLet them have heart attack, its good to have heart attack. I am having a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nEmefiele had on Monday approached Federal High Court sitting in Abuja for an Order restraining the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and Attorney-General of the Federation from preventing or hindering his participation in the process of the presidential election slated for February next year.\n\nSpecifically, he argued that by virtue of being a public servant, he cannot be barred from participating in the political primaries of political parties by Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nHe submitted that Constitutional provisions stipulated that he can only resign his appointment as Governor of CBN 30 days to the presidential election which he is interested in contesting.\n\nAmong the court processes he filed before the court was an application for maintenance of status quo, which he predicated on the fact that he would be prejudiced against or hurt if the court does not restrain the defendants from taking any step that would jeopardize his desire to contest the presidential election.\n\nArguing the motion for maintenance of status quo, Emefiele\u2019s lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, told the court that Emefiele \u201cis in a delimma\u201d as to whether he can run in the forthcoming presidential election.\n\nThe Federal Government had on Wednesday issued a circular directing serving ministers in the cabinet, heads of government agencies, ambassadors and other political appointees of the administration, coveting political ambitions in 2023, to resign from the government.\n\nThe circular, dated May 11, 2022 with Ref. No.SGF/OP/l/S.3/Xll/173, a copy which was sighted by THISDAY, was issued by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustapha.\n\nThe circular was addressed to all serving ministers, Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, National Security Adviser, Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission, Governor, Central Bank of Nigeria, Chairman, Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission, Chairman, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Chairman, National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, Chairman, Federal Inland Revenue Service and heads of extra-ministerial departments, Directors-General/Chief Executive Officers of parastatals, agencies and government-owned companies among others.\n\nIn the circular, Mustapha said President Muhammadu Buhari had observed and noted the expression of interest and intention by some members of the Federal Executive Council, Heads of Extra-Ministerial departments, agencies, parastatals of government, ambassadors and other political office holders to contest the upcoming Presidential, Gubernatorial, National and State Assemblies\u2019 elections.\n\nHe said the President had directed that the affected office holders aspiring to run for various offices in the 2023 General Elections, should tender their resignation on or before Monday, May 16, 2022.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

          "text": "RelatedStories No Content Available\n\nNigeria\u2019s federal government has insisted that it wasn\u2019t in breach of any part of the treaty setting up the West African Gas Pipeline Authority (WAGPA) by the selection of a Nigerian to head the organisation.\n\nWAGPA is an international institution established by the treaty on the West African Gas Pipeline (WAGP) Project signed by the Heads of States of the Republics of Benin, Ghana, Nigeria and Togo.\n\nBut it was gathered that the selection of a Nigerian, Ms. Chafari Kanya, had raised eyebrows within the regional body , with the francophone countries insisting that Nigeria cannot have both the headquarters and the director general simultaneously.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that Nigeria\u2019s argument is that no part of the international agreement imposes any obligation on members of the organisation to forfeit their right to produce the DG even if the head office is situated in their country.\n\nThe pipelines project is run by the West African Gas Pipeline Company limited (WAPCo), jointly owned by Chevron (36.7 per cent), Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) (25 per cent), Shell Overseas Holdings Limited (18 per cent), Takoradi Power Company Limited (16.3 per cent), Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Togolaise de Gaz (2 per cent) and et Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 BenGaz (2 per cent).\n\nSpeaking at the meeting of the Committee of Ministers (CoM) of WAGP in Abuja, Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Mr Timipre Sylva, maintained that the Accra resolution of November 2021, to move ahead with the appointment of a Nigerian as the head of the body remains very critical.\n\nHe called for the understanding of member nations, urging them to stick to the rules setting up the body.\n\n\u201cDear colleagues, I know we have some differences in respect of the appointment of the DG but I am confident that through a common understanding, which has been the hallmark of this body, we will all agree to respect one another\u2019s existing right under the WAGP Treaty.\n\n\u201cAs parties to the treaty and the agreements, we should all be guided by the applicable provisions of these legal instruments especially section 4(2) of Article IV of the Treaty, which guides the appointment of the Director General of WAGPA.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that section 4(2) of Article IV of the WAGP Treaty does not discriminate against any State Party in the appointment of the Director General of WAGPA and by my letter earlier to you my dear colleagues, I have conveyed this express position of the Treaty.\n\n\u201cIn the circumstances therefore, I will seek the understanding and cooperation of all of us to be guided by the provisions of the Treaty in reaching a sustainable, profitable and fair decision on this matter.\n\n\u201cIt cannot be argued otherwise that in a situation like this, to be guided by the Treaty, which brought the State Parties together is the most dependable internal mechanism provided for conflict resolution,\u201d the minister pointed out.\n\nAccording to him, it would be most unfair to disregard an applicable provision of the treaty in violation of the existing right of one of the parties to the treaty, which is Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI am certain that as committed signatories to the treaty, we shall not find any difficulty in allowing section 4(2) of Article IV of the Treaty to resolve the issue of the appointment of the Director General for all of us.\n\n\u201c If section 4(2) of Article IV of the Treaty says a Nigerian is not qualified to be appointed the Director General, then such agreement must be kept and be upheld.\n\n\u201c But if section 4(2) of Article IV of the Treaty is to the effect that Nigeria is qualified, then, there need not to be further objection against what section 4(2) of Article IV of the Treaty plainly stated,\u201d he argued.\n\nSylva noted that the meeting was coming at a very critical time especially the changing socio-political landscape occasioned by the Russian-Ukrainian war that has put pressure on global gas demands across Europe.\n\nNoting that the organisation was set up to ramp up cross border natural gas transportation, he pointed out that since inception, the Takoradi-Tema Interconnection Project (TTIP) and the lifting of force majeure that was in place by Nigeria Gas Company (NGC) between June 2013 and October, 2020 had been achieved.\n\nIn addition, he listed the reforms of the Access Code to the WAGP Network Code and the ongoing amendment to the WAGP Act and the WAGP Regulations to give licencing power to WAGP Authority to oversee the activities of the Shippers as some other milestones.\n\n\u201cWe will as a nation continue to work with all stakeholders for the improvement of the project performance. I must dare say that we have not done badly in our collective quests to realise these laudable objectives,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that since the global community had classified gas as part of renewable energy and since members cannot but join the global energy transition train, they must hurry to explore and exploit the abundant natural gas deposits within their borders.\n\nIn her comments, the new DG, Kanya, pledged to collaborate with WAPCo and other stakeholders in the WAGP Project to identify areas of gaps in the delivery of better services to ensure continuous, increased and sustainable flow of gas.\n\n\u201cTo me, this is important because adequate flow of gas to end users through the WAGP will fast-track positive growth of the power sector of the countries, accelerate industrialisation, generate employment, increase revenue for the State Parties and increase infrastructural developments for our people,\u201d she noted.\n\nShe affirmed that she was aware of the sentiments that over-regulation could bring discouragement and be counterproductive , but said that the regulations fashioned out for WAGP Project were amendable where they become counterproductive.\n\nMinister of Energy, Ghana, Dr. Matthew Prempeh, who is also chair of WAPG, in his intervention, stated that in spite of the \u201ctechnical breaches\u201d encountered in the past, the WAGP remains a regional asset and has been a significant contributor to the stability of power supply in beneficiary countries.\n\n\u201c It is therefore appropriate that there are plans to extend the pipeline further along the West African Coast up to Morocco to supply natural gas to the countries along the pipeline route, as well as those inland.\n\nHe pledged Ghana\u2019s commitment to the Takoradi to Tema Interconnection Project (TTIP), which was fully paid for by the Government of Ghana at the cost of approximately $200 million.\n\nManaging Director of WAPCo, Gregory Germani, lauded the role of the committee of ministers in keeping the WAGP a going concern as it celebrates 10 years of commercial operations.\n\nHe noted that WAGP was important for regional integration and the sub-region\u2019s energy future, saying it continues to serve its purpose as a development instrument among member countries.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
