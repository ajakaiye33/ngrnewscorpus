Also, your leadership roles in preserving and promoting the cultural and traditional heritage of Yorubaland, as well as your advocacy for the development and peaceful coexistence of Yorubas and Nigerians remain noteworthy.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, Hon.

          "text": "By Omeiza Ajayi \u2013 Abuja\n\nThe Social Democratic Party, SDP, has expressed deep anger at the propensity of political money bags to rig elections in the country, saying ahead of the 2023 general election, it has become imperative to advocate the death penalty for election riggers.\n\nThis was as the party kicked against zoning of the Delta State Governorship ticket to the Central Senatorial District, saying in a state like Delta with its political maturity and as home to eggheads, competence must trump zoning.\n\nChairman of the party in the state, Amb Oke Idawene who is also the Chairman, Forum of SDP State Chairmen, stated this in an interview with Vanguard.\n\nHe commended the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, for its decision to deploy the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System BVAS in the September 11 state Assembly bye-election in Isoko South 1, Delta state, saying the technology helped to reduce incidences of multiple voting.\n\nIdawene said the device was able to guarantee the credibility of voter accreditation by preventing incidents of multiple voting or the use of stolen Permanent Voter Cards PVCs to vote while the use of the incident form was eliminated.\n\nElection rigging\n\nOn rigging, he said the problem is not with INEC but other stakeholders.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe problem we have right now is not INEC. It is the people. Somebody tried to snatch a ballot box in Isoko South and he was gunned down. I don\u2019t like bloodshed, but that is the way to go. Ahead of 2023, the punishment for such electoral malfeasance should be death by hanging. Anybody rigging elections is an enemy of the people and must be so treated.\n\n\u201cWith the BVAS, the votes were not adulterated. There was no rigging in that election. For the first time in Nigeria, I went for an election where until the morning of the elections, the collation officers were not known and the voting pattern was clear.\n\n\u201cTo this end, I think we should give INEC all the support for electronic voting, electronic collation and transmission of results. It is only then we can get genuine leadership and see Nigeria tilting towards progressive tendencies. I want to call on the National Assembly to support this BVAS and other technologies used by INEC.\u201d\n\nOn Zoning the 2023 presidency to the South and the Delta Governorship ticket to Delta Central, the SDP Chairman said; \u201cSDP is not for zoning. We are for competence. It is time we stopped regional tendencies. Nigeria is one. No matter how you try, you cannot break us. Let us elect a leader who is a true Nigerian in body, soul, and spirit so that at the end of the day we can say we are going forward.\n\n\u201cSDP is anti-zoning. For the Southern leaders, if you want the presidency, I call on you to lobby. Power is not given for free. It is a collective responsibility. Leave your comfort zones and go to the North and explain why you should be given the opportunity to produce the next president. Apart from that, every Nigerian is qualified to run for president.\n\n\u201cIn Delta State, the Central is claiming that it is their turn to produce the next governor. No. I am a Delta. I have the right to contest. If Delta Central wants to contest election and win, let them come out and convince us in the South and North why we should give you room to produce the next governor come 2023. Apart from that, do not claim it. It is not your right. You lobby for it. Power is not given for free\u201d, he added.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Dr. Chris Ngige, Labour and Employment Minister\n\nMinister of Labour and Employment, Sen. Chris Ngige, has reiterated the Federal Government\u2019s commitment to revamp the educational system in the country.\n\nNgige said this during the reconvened meeting between the leadership of the Academic Staff Union of Universities, (ASSU) and the federal government on Thursday in Abuja.\n\nHe assured the union that the federal government would not abandon the public universities in spite dwindling resources.\n\nREAD ALSO:ASUU hails Ngige for sending his children to Nigerian public schools\n\n\u201cASUU is not asking for things that are impossible. They are not asking that we give them our head or blood.\n\n\u201cThey are interested in getting good working condition for their members and for the public university system to be conducive for teaching and research,\u201d he said.\n\nNgige said that government would be happy to concentrate its limited resources in areas that would produce good effect for the country.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cif the private sector can bring excellence to our universities, government can as well do same. So, working hand in hand with ASUU as we are currently doing is a model we must keep.\n\n\u201dWe will not be going to war with ASUU all the time. We can do constructive engagement. If there is something that government can do and it says it can\u2019t, I am here to say no, you can because I am privy to some information.\n\n\u201cSo, we will give the public university system a pride of place, so that when next global assessment is done, we will get more Nigerian universities in the first 1,000 in Africa.\n\n\u201cI am a firm believer in the public university system. That is why my children are there. I didn\u2019t send them to private ones. One graduated from Odumegwu Ojukwu University, Awka, and my daughter, from UNILAG.\n\n\u201dMy third child will also come out possibly next month from a public university again. I don\u2019t believe that public universities are going to be abandoned.\n\n\u201dWe cannot do so. If we abandon them, the children of not-too privileged or not-too rich will not go anywhere and education is the civilisation we need.\n\n\u201cIf any group of government workers or public officers will be on the side of public university system, I am the number one. I also attended a public university. I attended University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN).\n\n\u201dI didn\u2019t go to United States of America when my classmates were going there. so, Government will do its own side, despite lean resources,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister added that some of us in government may not be the Ministers of Education, but we can influence things.\n\n\u201dWe sit at the same Federal Executive Council (FEC). I therefore want to reassure you that you are in very safe hands.\n\n\u201cIf we continue this way, we will make more progress and restore faith in the university system,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ASUU President, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke, commended the minister for demonstrating an uncommon faith in the university system by sending his children to Nigerian public schools.\n\nHe said that Ngige\u2019s commitment to growth and development of the country\u2019s educational system should be emulated by other ministers.\n\n\u201cI hope other ministers will follow the same step as you. I think you are the only Minister whose children are in the country.\n\n\u2018We see others standing by their children outside the country during graduation. But, we saw you standing by one of your children who graduated in Lagos, proudly.\n\n\u201cWe hope that all others will emulate you and that government will make it mandatory that if you accept a government appointment, your children must attend universities in the country.\n\n\u201dThe National assembly must formulate a law that if you take an appointment, your children must study here. If you know that your children cannot be here, don\u2019t take Government appointment,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, lamented the decay in public universities in the country, adding \u201cwhen you hear those in government who send their children to schools abroad say that ASUU go on strike, they should know that strike is not the problem.\n\n\u201dThe problem is that the issues afflicting the universities; nobody is interested in tackling them. Look at the budget we have seen recently, it is exactly the same thing we have been seeing. Nothing has changed .\n\n\u201cAnd this country is paying the high price for neglecting education \u2013 the banditry you see, the kidnapping and what have you, is because people are not being taken care of.\n\n\u201dThat is why ASUU has been struggling so that Nigerian universities will be revamped for our children to attend and stop going outside the country to study.\n\n\u201cChildren from other countries will come here too and pay to this country in hard currency,\u201d he said.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria reports that at the time of filing this report, both parties were still locked in their meeting",

And every right-thinking Nigerian can attest to this.\n\n\u201cYoruba remains the first race in Nigeria to have experienced tremendous progress and exposure among all the tribes and such feats were made possible through quality education, and transformation of the southwest region in the 60s.\u201d\n\nHe, however, urged the South-West governors to promote the use of Yoruba language during plenary, as it is done in Lagos and Ondo States respectively.\n\nAlso speaking, the Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, said Yoruba have all its takes to achieve whatever the race is determined to achieve.\n\nAdams said: \u201cYoruba can re-establish the finest moments in its history, rise to the challenges and explore the beauty of our language, culture and tradition to achieve the positive potentials of the race.\n\n\u201cThe Yoruba history is very rich; our language remains the most potent tool that has kept us far above other races. Our culture, tradition and heritages are next to none, but even at that, there is an urgent need for us as promoters of Yoruba culture and tradition to step up the values and champion the cause for the sustenance and rejuvenation of those rich languages, culture, tradition, history and values.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Experiences in the past would remind us of the bitter tales our farmers have had to tell.\n\n\u201cMany of our farmers have left their farms for either the fear of being killed by notorious herders or because of great losses they have recorded overtimes due to the wanton destruction of their farms by these set of people and their animals.\u201d\n\nSpeaker of the Assembly, Adebo Ogundoyin, in his remarks, maintained that continuous destruction of farmlands by Fulani herders and their cattle was unacceptable.\n\nOgundoyin, who presided over the plenary, maintained that security agencies must work together to ensure that the issue of farmers/herders is addressed.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur security agents, Amotekun Corps and other vigilance groups must work together to address this menace and arrest these agents of destruction.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to have an increase in the activities of Fulani herders on our farms\u201d.\n\nWe will send anti-open grazing bill to state Assembly soon \u2013 Gov Wike",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja and Paul Osuyi, Asaba\n\nFormer Senate president, Iyorchia Ayu, yesterday, emerged consensus candidate of the North for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) national chairmanship.\n\nAdamawa State Governor, Ahmadu Fintiri, announced it after a meeting of PDP northern caucus at the Bauchi Government in Abuja.\n\nFintiri, who is chairman of a panel set up by northern leaders to screen aspirants from the zone, said with Ayu\u2019s emergence, the North would reach out to party leaders in the South to sell his candidature.\n\nWhile the North Central nominated Ayu as its consensus candidate, North East and North West nominated former Senate leader, Abdul Ningi and former Kastina State governor, Ibrahim Shema, respectively.\n\nHowever, the Adamawa governor said although the three aspirants were qualified to lead the party, following intense discussion, northern leaders settled for Ayu.\n\n\u201cAll of them were immensely qualified but through discussion and reconciliation, we have emerged with consensus list that was endorsed by the candidates themselves. There was no election and there was no selection.\u201d\n\nAyu\u2019s emergence is the climax of days of intrigues and horse-trading among northern PDP stakeholders.\n\nThe former Senate president would be presented to the PDP National Convention holding in Abuja from October 30 to 31 for ratification as national chairman.\n\nA party source, who attended the meeting, told Daily Sun that \u201cat the meeting, Ningi withdrew from the contest as the North East pledged support for the North Central. When the North West discovered they cannot go alone, they equally supported Ayu.\u201d\n\nAyu, in a chat with journalists, said as chairman, he would run an inclusive administration and work with all leaders of the party across the country to return the PDP to power.\n\n\u201cThe PDP will be back to its winning ways. And we will work tirelessly after the convention to rebuild the party to take over power to rebuild the country.\n\n\u201cI believe Nigerians want a PDP government. Our 16 years moved this country forward. We intend to work together with all the leaders, not only in the North, but across the country to reposition this country for the next generation of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt will be an all-inclusive administration of the party. We will work collectively to produce policies which will be acceptable Nigerians. Today, our currency is the weakest in the world. Even the Somalians are better than us in Africa. We will work hard to solve the issue of insecurity.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the Northern leaders, who are united, determined and who are willing to work with me. I am a foundation member of this party. I worked in the party before, but I know that you cannot do it alone. We shall work as team,\u201d he said.\n\nMultiple sources said he emerged based on agreement that his adoption would not preclude anybody from any zone from contesting the Presidency.\n\nOne of the decisions reached at the meeting was that if the emergence of a presidential candidate tilt the scale in favour of any zone, the chairman would resign and work for the candidate.\n\n\u201cIt is after Ayu and the governors agreed to this that Shema and Nazif agreed to withdraw from the race.\u201d\n\nHe said Atiku played no role in all the negotiations and observed that it was only last weekend that both men spoke for the first time after many years of not communicating.\n\nMeanwhile, former minister of State for Education, Kenneth Gbagi, has said the PDP wwould win the 2023 presidential election.\n\nGbagi, governorship aspirant in Delta State, said Nigerians have seen the difference between the PDP and the All Progressives Congress (APC), and now know better where to cast their votes.\n\nHe said the country has deteriorated in the past six years under the APC-led Federal Government of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nGbagi spoke at Oginibo in Ughelli South Local Government Area of Delta State after his return from Ondo State where he was conferred with Aare Atunluse of Akure kingdom.\n\nThe former mnister is convinced that politicians defecting from PDP to APC were be coerced, adding that such persons remained PDP members who would work for the success of the party.\n\n\u201cAll the people running from PDP to APC are not APC members. They are PDP members in blood, soul and body, and they are all going to work for PDP.\n\n\u201cPDP is going to produce the next president in Nigeria. If you don\u2019t marry two wives, they say, you do not know which one is better. It is for you to marry two wives and see the difference.\n\n\u201cAnd you will have a situation in the next election where they, who thought they are forced by their own thinking to join APC, will be bearing APC in the day and at the night, they are PDP members,\u201d he said.\n\nThe security expert and renowned entrepreneur also said Nigeria would not disintegrate, and accused the Federal Government of being the problem of the country.\n\n\u201cIf there is any problem in Nigeria, it is the government. What ought to be beautiful, what ought to be the happiest thing of our life is our population.\n\n\u201cPopulation anywhere in the world is a money spinner, an economic driver, but all of that we are toiling with, hence we are where we are today,\u201d he said\n\n\u201cWe, as Nigerians, must correct immediately the situation before machineries or government of nations other than our nation come to correct it for us.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a pressure group within the PDP, North Central PDP Rebirth Forum ( NCPDPRF) has rejected the emergence of Ayu as consensus chairmanship candidate.\n\nThe convener of the group, Mohammed Idah, in a statement, yesterday, stated that the former Senate President\u2019s adoption is part of alleged plan to exclude the North Central from the 2023 presidential contest..\n\n\u201cThe North Central has produced several PDP national Chairmen. For the avoidance of doubts, the Pioneer PDP chairman was Chief Solomon Lar from Plateau State, Engr. Barnabas Gemade and Chief Audu Ogbe were all PDP chairmen from Benue State.\n\n\u201cAhamdu Ali from Kogi state, Alhaji Kawu Baraje from kwara state also became chairman of our party without any benefit to the North Central. We totally reject the move to stop the North Central from aspiring for the Presidency in 2023 using any guise. Not even the position of the National Chairman of PDP,\u201d the group stated.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

          "title": "Fayemi, Sanwo-Olu, Obaseki, El-Rufai make case for state police",
          "text": "From Priscilla Ediare, Ado-Ekiti\n\nGovernors Kayode Fayemi, Godwin Obaseki, Babajide Sanwo-Olu and Nasir El-Rufai of Ekiti, Edo, Lagos and Kaduna states respectively, yesterday, made a case for state police saying it would mitigate the problem of insecurity and promote investments.\n\nThey argued that preventing governors from taking charge of security was adversely affecting investments, development and wellbeing of people.\n\nThis came as Vice President Yemi Osinbajo called on governors of the 36 states to stop relying on federal allocations for survival charging them to invest in areas where they have comparative advantages to boost their internally generated revenue.\n\nThey spoke in Ado-Ekiti during the Ekiti Economic and Investment summit tagged: \u2018Fountain Summit 2021\u2019 organised by Governor Fayemi\u2019s government to find solutions to the socio-economic challenges facing the state.\n\nGovernor Fayemi insisted that multi-level policing system remains the best way out of the lingering security crisis that is gradually crippling the economy.\n\n\u201cThis request does not mean abrogation of the central police. If you have problem of security in Kaduna, Governor El-Rufai can easily take charge. My recent experience, and many of our governors were not even palatable where we wanted to procure drones and Mr President was with us on the issue, but the NSA refused us End User Certificate, but we got it one year after.\n\n\u201cAs of now, security is on the exclusive list. Even If the Federal Government is ready to allow us procure some arms, we have to sign MOU with the Airforce. We have to work together collaboratively, because investors consider security as number one in any state.\u201d\n\nLending his voice to the creation of state police, Governor Sanwo-Olu, said: \u201cWhen you have investments, you would have to protect them and take responsibility for whatever happens. The investors will rely on the governors for protection and it is sad that we are not in charge. This is the area where the Federal Government must look into the issue of state police.\u201d\n\nGovernor Obaseki said police should be removed from the Exclusive List for state chief executives to be in firm control.\n\n\u201cIf you have businesses, you have to protect them and you must have the apparatuses. Security is on the exclusive list and we are looking up to the Federal government to remove it for states to take charge. We must provide facilities for the police to be able to train our local vigilante, because in Edo State that was what we did. We raised a vigilante group to police our villages from kidnappers and other criminals.\u201d\n\nGovernor El-Rufai described security as a big problem that every Nigerian should be concerned about.\n\nLaying the foundation for why the policing system should be decentralised, he said: \u201cWe have 150,000 personnel in the army. Police was 400,000 by the time this government came on board, but has gone down to 300,000 now. We need multi level police. Policing is local just like a unitary environment like Britain. Kaduna State is about 46,000sqkms in size. Boko Haram has been chased from North East by ISWAP and now occupying the North West. But if they are dislodged here, where would they go? This is why we should all be concerned.\u201d\n\nVice President Osinbajo, who was one of the panelists, said time had come for chief executives of the states to start thinking about how to grow the economy like a nation, by investing in most appropriate ways in areas of their economic strength.\n\n\u201cThe attractiveness of investments to any state should be in radical, because that is the revenue hub and determinant of how happy the people of any state will be in terms of economic development in relation to their standard of living.\n\n\u201cBut while trying to grow investments, we must be cautious about multiple taxation, it weighs down businesses. Ekiti is a business-friendly environment. Ekiti has also excelled in the aspect of ease of doing business. You have vast arable lands for agriculture.

The question we should ask ourselves is that if I were the landlord of this nation, how do we survive?

The seizure of Lagos funds by President Olusegun Obasanjo made us think like a sovereign state. Today, Lagos is making over N45 billion monthly.

          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nFederal Government has explained that taking COVID-19 vaccine is a choice and not a compulsory exercise, even though it is expected that every Nigerian should get vaccinated against the dreaded COVID-19 virus.\n\nThe explanation came against the backdrop of criticisms that followed media reports that effective December 1 2021, federal civil servants would be expected to present their vaccine cards or risk not being allowed into their work places.\n\nExecutive Director, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr. Faisal Shuaib, at a press conference, yesterday, in Abuja, however, clarified that federal civil servants were not under obligation to take the vaccine, but that they must show negative COVID-19 PCR test.\n\n\u201cThe Presidential Steering Committee (PSC), on Wednesday, announced interventions to, not only protect the most vulnerable people in our society, but to also ensure that the work place is safe for all citizens. Clearly, there is loss of productivity and its impact on socio-economic development when workers are unable to come to work on a regular, and consistent basis due to outbreaks of an infectious disease such as COVID-19.\n\n\u201cFollowing advice by public health experts, the PSC announced that all Federal Government employees should make a choice as to how they can contribute towards making the work environment COVID-19-free. The logical choice is between taking the vaccine and showing the evidence or presenting proof that one is COVID-19-free by showing a negative PCR test taken 72 hours prior. This provision is applicable to all Federal Government institutions. The decision to release the advisory was not taken lightly. It is part of the PSC and Federal Ministry of Health\u2019s mantra to always use scientific evidence to make decisions for the benefit of all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nOn the question of availability of vaccines, he said they had already done a comprehensive analysis and forecast of COVID-19 vaccines and it was confirmed that there\u2019s enough vaccines to cover more than the population of Federal Government employees.\n\n\u201cBased on delivery forecasts from the COVAX facility and African Union, Nigeria will have adequate vaccines to cover more that 50 per cent of eligible populations by the end of the first quarter of 2022. In order words, please do not worry about the availability of vaccines because we have the supply chain figured out already,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also explained that NPHCDA is committed to ramp up COVID-19 vaccine uptake, and it had put in place plans for the establishment of mass vaccination sites across the country.\n\n\u201cThe objective is to vaccinate a high volume of individuals through large sites such as federal institutions, shopping malls, religious centres, sporting events, conference centres, and markets etc. This will require strong collaboration between NPHCDA, state governments, religious bodies, school authorities and governing bodies of malls and large sporting events.\n\n\u201cAs we expand the vaccination sites, we encourage all eligible Nigerians to avail themselves for vaccination. We have commenced the process of decentralising COVID-19 vaccination in Nigeria, to include private health care providers. This is to expand access and increase utilisation of the vaccines which will not affect free vaccination policy.\n\n\u201cWe are working with relevant security agencies to make examples of these individuals who may wish to buy or sell the cards by naming and shaming them. We are also enhancing the security features of our vaccination cards in order to limit forgeries,\u201d he said.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "*How Mark, Shema, Nazif stepped aside\n\n*Nigeria is worse than Somalia under APC, says new helmsman\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nNorthern stakeholders of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have picked former Senate President, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, as the consensus national chairmanship candidate of the party.\n\nIt was learnt Thursday that two other contenders from the North, where the position has been zoned, former governor of Katsina State, Ibrahim Shema, and the incumbent deputy national chairman (North), Senator Nazif Suleiman, stepped down for Ayu to emerge.\n\nAt a press briefing on Thursday in Abuja, Governor of Adamawa State, Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, confirmed that the Northern Caucus of the party had unanimously picked Ayu as the candidate for national chairman.\n\nAyu had earlier emerged the consensus national chairmanship candidate for the North-central zone after other contenders from the zone withdrew from the race early this week.\n\nThe office of PDP national chairman, currently occupied by the South, has been zoned to the North ahead of the next general election.\n\nThe party\u2019s national convention holds in Abuja on October 31.\n\nOn Wednesday, the northern PDP stakeholders had met to select a consensus candidate, but the meeting could not hold.\n\nThey, then postponed the meeting till 11am yesterday. Another meeting later held last night, where the Bauchi Governor, Bala Mohammed, and others hinted that all the governors had decided on Ayu.\n\nAyu was also brought in to appeal and plead for support and he assured that he would ensure a level playing field, before eventually emerging consensus candidate.\n\nThe scheme began to unravel at the North-east meeting, when Nazif found out that the Bauchi governor had encouraged Senator Abdul Ningi to join the race in order to stop him. The plan was for them to pick Ningi over Nazif and get Ningi to withdraw for Ayu.\n\nBut when Nazif threatened he would contest, regardless, and Shema also sent a signal that he would not withdraw, Mohammed and the other governors realised their plot might fail except they begged other stakeholders. It was at this stage that they pleaded and persuaded Shema and Nazif to step down, which they accepted.\n\nHowever, after over three hours meeting at the Bauchi State Government Lodge, the Northern PDP stakeholders settled for Ayu as their consensus national chairman.\n\nFintiri, who is the chairman of the PDP national convention committee, said, \u201cThere is no vanquished, there no victor in this meeting. We all came out united\u2026\n\n\u201cDistinguished Senator Iyorcha Ayu has emerged consensus candidate of the north. With this, we are fully prepared; we are ready. We will be talking with our colleagues from other parts of the country, especially, the south that they see reasons for this consensus candidate and give us support during the 30 and 31 convention of PDP.\n\n\u201cAll of them were immensely qualified but through discussion and reconciliation, we have emerged with consensus list that was endorsed by the candidates themselves. There was no election and there was no selection.\u201d\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Ayu said, \u201cIt is my singular honour to accept the accept the responsibilities, which has been put on my shoulders from the North. I believe that at the end of the day, it will not only be the North, but it will be all Nigerians. The PDP will be back to its winning ways. And we will work tirelessly after the convention to rebuild the party to take over power to rebuild the country.\u201d\n\nInsiders privy to the horse trading said Ayu emerged based on agreement and undertaking that he and the governors gave that his emergence would not preclude anybody from any zone from contesting the Presidency.\n\nIt was also agreed that if the emergence of a presidential candidate tilted the scale in favour of any zone, the chairman would have to resign and work for the candidate if such affected the equation.\n\nAlso, it was after Ayu and the governors agreed to this that Shema and Nazif agreed to withdraw from the race.\n\nTHISDAY further gathered that Alhaji Atiku Abubakar played no role in all these.\n\nIn fact, the source said, \u201cIt is only last weekend that both men spoke for the first time after many years as they have been feuding for years. The governors made sure Atiku did not play a role.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the PDP has approved the extension of sale of nomination forms for national officers for the October 30 to 31 National Convention, from the earlier announced date of Friday, October 15, 2021 to Sunday, October 17, 2021\n\nThis was contained in a statement signed by Kola Ologbondiyan, the National Publicity Secretary and Secretary, National Convention Publicity Sub-Committee of the party.\n\nConsequently, the last date for the submission of duly completed forms has also been extended from Saturday, October 16 to Tuesday, October 19, 2021.\n\nAccordingly, he said that the date for the Screening of aspirants for various national offices has also been adjusted to Wednesday, October 20, 2021, while Screening Appeals, to consider appeals arising from the Screening Exercise, is now scheduled for Saturday, October 23, 2021.\n\nPlease note that the date for the National Convention still remains Saturday October 30 \u2013 Sunday 31, 2021.\n\nAll aspirants, leaders, critical stakeholders and teeming members of our great party are by this statement guided accordingly, he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says terrorists not amassing around FCT, Niger\n\n*Explains military operations in Southeast\n\n*Confirms ISWAP leader, Abu Musab Al-Barnawi, is dead, denies Gumi working for the army\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe military authorities, yesterday, announced the killing of 250 bandits as well as arrest of 600 others terrorising the North West, as testament to some of the new security measures taken lately, especially, the shutting down of telecommunications services in that part of the country.\n\nThe military high command also refuted claims in some quarters that terrorist groups had begun to amass around Abuja and Niger State, even as it explained the current military operations in the South East, saying it has no discriminatory undertone.\n\nChief of Defense Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor, who made these disclosure while featuring at a ministerial briefing put together by the Presidential Media Team at the State House, Abuja, said no fewer than 250 bandits had been killed following telecommunication blackout in parts of the Northwest region since September, this year.\n\nHe added that over 600 other bandits had been captured in the successful military operations facilitated by the interruption of the telephone and internet services in some states in the zone.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe are responsible for the security content in that regard, so to that extent, looking at the numbers, from the last report that I got on Monday, we have neutralised over 250 of the bandits, we have equally arrested well over 600 and because it is a continuous thing, the figures might also change.\u201d\n\nMilitary operations against the bandits were intensified with a sudden shutdown of the telecoms services in the Northwestern state of Zamfara early last month and it was extended to parts of Sokoto, Katsina, and Kaduna States, all in the Northwest zone.\n\nIrabor said the strategy has so far been helpful to the military\u2019s operations in that part of the country, including the rescue of kidnapped persons from various camps of the bandits.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe shutdown will remain as long as it is necessary. The shutdown is more of a blessing than anything else. Telecommunication in the Northwest was shut down out of necessity. We have achieved successes within this period.\u201d\n\nWith the ongoing operations, the CDS said government\u2019s primary objective was to ensure the peace and wellbeing of every citizen.\n\n\u201cI will like to also indicate that the rescue operations have led to the rescue of many of those recruited by the bandits, which is also part and parcel of that action and is not limited to Zamfara State but it also extends to Sokoto and Katsina,\u201d Irabor explained.\n\nHe said the military was ready to scale up operations across the country, in view of the worrisome security situation, adding that a larger number of the bandits had been identified in the Northwest region.\n\n\u201cOf course, a few who are having inroads into the North-central, we are taking action, so that they do not spread beyond the known locations. But more seriously, a larger number of the bandits remain in the northwest.\n\n\u201cThe Primary objective of government is to ensure the peace and well-being of every citizen so, we undertake our operations and activities to ensure there is peace, development and the provision of amenities that aggregate to governance,\u201d he said.\n\nExplaining why banditry attacks have remained relatively high, since the military launched major onslaught against them, he said, \u201cthey are essentially, where they are. That is the reason why we are pursuing them. But more seriously, a larger number of the bandits remain in the North West. Of course, a few who are having in-road into the North Central, we are taking action, so that they do not spread beyond the known locations. But let me tell you also that threat as it were, whether terrorism, banditry, or any form of criminality, are not confined to boundaries.\n\n\u201cThis is the reason why when we speak to issues that have to do with national security, it is placed in context with our neighbours, because, if all is well in our home and all is not well with our neighbours, then, of course, we can\u2019t have peace. So, this is the reason why kineticism has become an approach in this regard.\n\n\u201cAnd for many of you who have been very close observers, I want you to know that there are greater interactions that we have with our neighbours and we do not also want to offset the good relations we have with our neighbours, because it is from the enlightened self-interest perspective that we would do that\u201d.\n\nIrabor, however, allayed the fears of a possible regrouping of suspected terrorists within the vicinity of Abuja and Niger State, describing the source of the said information as handiwork of mischief makers.\n\nThe Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, had on Wednesday, raised the alarm that it had intelligence from some sources that the terrorists had started setting up camps around the FCT and Niger State, calling for immediate action.\n\nBut Irabor described the claim as false and should be discountenanced forthwith, stating that many people pushing out information do so to \u2018fly agenda kites\u2019, adding that if there was anything as being claimed by those raising the alarm, the military would have known.\n\nHis words: \u201cWell, that\u2019s interesting, but can I please confirm to you that what we saw was social media reports raising some form of apprehension as to the presence of some alien individuals or criminal elements within the precincts of the FCT, to which we have taken measures to confirm or not and then in our efforts, we have seen that that the report is not true and besides, we have equally taken measures to ensure that should anyone be desiring or having an idea to do that, then that has not happened.\n\n\u201cOne thing you must understand is that by virtue of the current environment, climate, okay, technology climate, as it were, fear is being duplicated by various means and so, some individuals that have ideas, the only way they can sell the idea is by pushing it to the public, hoping that there will be an acceptance of that idea.\n\n\u201cSo, if the security agencies are oblivious about certain\u2026 of course they get hoodwinked and then, of course, lose focus. So, for you as members of the press, you must have also come to terms with that reality, that sometimes you\u2019ll find that many of these reports have an intended aim, an intended purpose and so the narrative has to be created to make it fit into that purpose.\n\n\u201cThis is why sometimes some people have to have a rebuttal, some have to say actually, this news is fake and so on and so forth. But on this matter, it is not true. Is it true, it\u2019s not a true report\u201d.\n\nOn the alleged military brutality in the Southeast, Irabor said the perception of discriminatory military engagement against the people of the region was not correct.\n\nAddressing why the military chose to scale up operations in the Southeast, while bandits in the Northwest and Northcentral zones were considered for negotiations, and repentant terrorists in the Northeast were being rehabilitated, the Defence Chief emphasised that insecurity varies from region to region.\n\nHe explained that, what you find in the Southeast was different from what was obtainable in the North, adding that despite the military engagement in the Southeast, he had led discussions with people of the area.\n\nHe said while Nigerians have the right to pass their views to government, they must not do so through the use of violence, saying, \u201cif anyone thinks they can try the armed forces, let him try the shape of the armed forces.\u201d\n\nAlso, on the activities of the Muslim cleric, Sheikh Gumi, who had been leading negotiations with bandits, the CDS said Gumi did not work for the military but that the military would equally not prevent anyone from playing his part in the fight against insecurity.\n\nHe said what was not acceptable to the military was when such persons work at cross-purposes with security agencies\u2019 objectives.\n\nAsked to confirm the news that the the leader of the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP), Abu Musab Al-Barnawi, was dead, the Defence boss said, \u201cI can authoritatively confirm to you that Abu Musab is dead. As simple as that. He is dead and remains dead.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Hinges floating the naira on Dangote Refinery, petrochemical plant coming on stream\n\n*Assures foreign investors of prioritised settlement\n\nObinna Chima\n\nCentral Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday lamented that the country spends almost 40 per cent of its scarce foreign exchange (FX) on the importation of petroleum products as well as petrochemicals, which continues to put pressure on the naira exchange rate.\n\nSpeaking during a media briefing on the sidelines of the ongoing International Monetary Fund (IMF)/World Bank annual meetings in Washington DC, Emefiele, however, expressed optimism that once the Dangote Refinery and Petrochemical Plant commence operations around July next year, the country would be in a position to be able to save 40 per cent of the FX it spends on the importation of petroleum products as well as petrochemicals.\n\nThis, he also pointed out would put the central bank in a better position to float the naira.\n\n\u201cOn the Dangote Refinery, by the time it begins production latest July next year, it is going to be a major source to save forex for Nigeria. Right now, the overall forex we spend on imported items, the importation of petroleum products consumes close to 30 per cent.\n\n\u201cBy the time you add diesel, aviation fuel, petrol and the rest of that which makes up the 30 per cent, the Dangote Refinery has the capacity to produce 650,000 barrels per day. There is a domestic component that is about 455,000 barrels. Even if the 455,000 is what is sold to Dangote in naira alone, it is going to be a major forex savings for Nigeria,\u201d he explained.\n\nResponding to a question, the CBN governor revealed that the total cost of the Dangote Refinery project was about $17.5 billion and the total equity from the Dangote Group in the project was $9 billion.\n\nSo, less than $9 billion was contributed by a combination of foreign and local banks and the CBN, he disclosed.\n\n\u201cSo, you are looking at a transaction where the leverage is almost one-to-one. We think that is going to be a major FX saver for our country and we would export those refined products.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the cost of freight alone, it is a major saving for Nigeria. That is because if we have to go to Europe or other parts of the world to bring in petroleum products where we pay heavily in freight and in stocking those products in the high sea before we offload them, Nigerians would benefit a lot from the Dangote Refinery,\u201d he added.\n\nEmefiele pointed out that the project was one of Nigeria\u2019s backward integration programmes, saying the country was proud that it was coming to light.\n\n\u201cIndeed, we know that refineries abroad are already scared because they know the market they would lose because Nigeria will prefer to patronise Dangote Refinery instead of foreign refined petroleum products.\n\n\u201cOn the petrochemical, it is also expected to commence about same period next. That petrochemical plant will be producing 900,000 tonnnes of polyethylene and polypropylene granules. Nigeria\u2019s annual consumption here is less than 200,000.\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean? It is going to save five per cent of our imports. If you save five per cent of your imports and another 30 per cent in petroleum products and then in fertliser where we would save about two per cent of our imports, we are moving close to saving 40 per cent of the country\u2019s imports.\n\n\u201cBy that time, you will see what we would be doing when people talk about floating the naira, and then let\u2019s see how the currency will depreciate,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking further, Emefiele told foreign investors that the federal government ensures that any of its debts that is due was given utmost priority, particularly foreign debts.\n\n\u201cIt is like a first line charge. The Minister talks to me about it and we ensure that wherever we are going to find the dollar, we pay any of our debts, even before we service any obligation. That is the rule if is Nigeria\u2019s authentic sovereign debt,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Urges governors to be wary of multiple taxation\n\n*Says focus on areas of economic strength crucial\n\n*Fayemi, Obaseki, Sanwo-Olu, El-Rufai insist on state police\n\nVictor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo, yesterday, said the seizure of funds belonging to local governments in Lagos State by former President Olusegun Obasanjo in 2005 provided ample opportunity for Lagos to think like a sovereign state able to overcome its financial challenges. Osinbajo, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), said the capacity of the state to rethink its predicament at the time resulted in huge increase in its Internally Generated Revenue (IGR), which is today in the region of N45 billion.\n\nOsinbajo spoke in Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, at an Economic and Investment summit the \u201cFountain Summit 2021,\u201d organised by the Governor Kayode Fayemi administration. The vice president appealed to governors of the federation to start making huge investments in areas they have comparative advantage to shore up their IGR and stop complete reliance on federal allocations for survival. He said the governors could grow investments without resorting to multiple taxation.\n\nOsinbajo\u2019s suggestion came as Fayemi and Governors Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, and Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State canvassed robust multi-level policing system in the country, to protect citizens and investments.\n\nThey insisted that preventing governors from taking charge of security was affecting investment, development, and wellbeing of the people adversely.\n\nTitled, \u201cInvestment attractiveness, and Economic Development: Lesson for the Sub-nationals,\u201d the summit, which was designed to proffer solutions to some socio-economic issues rattling the state, was also attended by the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, represented by his deputy, Lucky Ayedatiwa.\n\nOsinbajo, who was one of the panellists, stated that time had come for the chief executives of states to start thinking about how to grow their respective economies like a nation, by investing in the most appropriate ways in their areas of economic strength.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe attractiveness of investments to any state should be radical, because that is the revenue hub and determinant of how happy the people of any state will be in terms of economic development in relation to their standard of living.\n\n\u201cBut while trying to grow investments, we must be cautious of multiple taxation. It weighs down businesses. Ekiti is a business-friendly environment. Ekiti has also excelled in the aspect of ease of doing business. You have vast arable lands for agriculture.\n\n\u201cAlso, of recent, the government of Ekiti divested 76 per cent of shares in the Ikun Dairy farm for Promasidor for the production of 80,000 litres of milk daily. Let me say that Ekiti has a bigger economy than many Africa nations. The question we should ask ourselves is that if I were the landlord of this nation, how do we survive?\n\n\u201cDuring my time as a commissioner in Lagos, we started with N600 million monthly Internally Generated Revenue in 1999. The seizure of Lagos funds by President Olusegun Obasanjo made us to think like a sovereign state. Today, Lagos is making over N45 billion monthly.\n\n\u201cThe surest way forward is to deepen investments in the areas where Ekiti has comparative advantage. We should also make good investments in technology to grow the knowledge economy, which is education.\n\n\u201cLet me commend the foresightedness of the governor, Fayemi, to know that technology is the best way to go. I am even happy that the low in charges of the broadband airwave has already started attracting investments to Ekiti. What is in vogue now is that, well-trained people in technology are the game changers.\n\n\u201cI urge Ekiti to leverage on the value in education it has acquired to develop its investments. I believe Ekiti has not lost this value. It has to be fountain of the knowledge economy, not just the fountain of knowledge.\n\n\u201cThe Afe Babalola University multisystem hospital in Ado Ekiti is now being mentioned internationally. It has made breakthroughs in neurosurgical, surgical, plastic surgery and many other areas of medicine. Many countries don\u2019t have such facility.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the lingering security crisis that was gradually crippling the economy, Fayemi insisted that a multi-level policing system remained the best way out.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis request does not mean abrogation of the central police. If you have problem of security in Kaduna, Governor el-Rufai can easily take charge. My recent experience and many of our governors were not even palatable, where we wanted to procure drones and Mr President was with us on the issue, but the NSA refused us End User Certificate, though we got it one year after.\n\n\u201cAs of now, security is on the Exclusive List. Even if the federal government is ready to allow us procure some arms, we have to sign MoU with the Nigerian Air Force. We have to work together collaboratively, because investors consider security as number one in any state.\u201d\n\nFayemi stated that his government had signed a bill into law establishing Ekiti Economic Council to plan and implement the summit and ensure that the outcome outlives his administration.\n\nOn how to cut cost in governance, Fayemi said the COVID-19 pandemic had helped in no small measure, saying the dwindling revenues to states has also taught a lesson that governors must block leakages in revenue collection and leverage on areas, where they could get support from the federal government, especially, the social intervention programmes.\n\nThe Ekiti State governor said he had completed many of the projects left behind by former Governor Ayodele Fayose, saying abandonment on the basis of lack of interest and change of party constitutes great impediment to growth and development.\n\nSupporting the call for state police, Obaseki said the police should be removed from the exclusive list for states\u2019 chief executives to be in firm control.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIf you have a businesses, you have to protect them and you must have the apparatuses. Security is on the exclusive list and we are looking up to the federal government to remove for states to take charge.\n\n\u201cWe must provide facilities for the police to be able to train our local vigilantes, because in Edo State, that was what we did. We raised a vigilante group to police our villages from kidnappers and other criminals.\u201d\n\nOn the role of ICT in driving economy at the subnational level, Obaseki advised that states should use ICT to recast primary education results, by making the children at their tender age to perceive computer as part of their lives.\n\nThe Edo State governor commended Fayemi\u2019s transformation agenda in Ekiti State, saying the state is lucky to have a resourceful and innovative chief executive that could turn things around with lean resources.\n\nDoing a holistic appraisal of the projects executed by Fayemi, he said he was stunned by the quantum of projects executed in water and other sectors, despite the COVID-19 challenge and the lean allocation accruing to Ekiti internally and from the federation accounts.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cEkiti is lucky, you don\u2019t know how lucky you are to have the kind of governor God has given you. Ekiti is not a big state. You are not even rich, but you have the greatest resource any nation can have, which is human resource.\n\n\u201cGovernor Fayemi is not only leading Ekiti people well, he is leading all the governors well as the chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 forum.\n\nLending his voice to the issue of state police, the Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu said, \u201cWhen you have investments, you would have to protect them and take responsibility for whatever happens. The investors will rely on the governors for protection and it is sad that we are not in charge. This is the area, where the federal government must look into the issue of state police.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu suggested how Ekiti could transform its IGR and break the challenge of sole reliance on federal allocation, saying Lagos State now makes between N45 and N48 billion monthly from the paltry N600 million realised in 1999.\n\nThe Lagos State governor suggested that the state should digitalise its revenue collection process and give staff in the state Internal Revenue Service incentives to do their jobs without perpetrating corruption.\n\nSanwo-Olu stated, \u201cYou must have robust technology and ensure people don\u2019t collect money with hands. Make sure your money is centrally collected. Also, block all loopholes, encourage your staff by giving them small bonuses, so that they can deliver more. Ekiti has the potential to think like a country.\u201d\n\nEl-Rufai described security as a big problem that every Nigerian should be concerned about.\n\nThe Kaduna State governor said, \u201cWe have 150,000 personnel in the Nigerian army. Police was 400,000 by the time this government came on board, but it has gone down to 300,000 now. We need multi-level police. Policing is local, just like a unitary environment like Britain.\n\n\u201cKaduna State is about 46,000 square kilometres in size. Boko Haram has been chased from North-east by ISWAP and now occupying the North-west. But if they are dislodged here, where would they go? This is why we should all be concerned.\u201d\n\nHe added that the country must decentralise the power of National Judicial Council to determine the number of judges a state could have.\n\nHe said, \u201cNo country can develop beyond the level of its civil service, you must appoint the right civil servants and we just give way for younger people to take Nigeria to the next level.\n\n\u201cI have just appointed the youngest chief executive of any agency in Nigeria, a 28-year old to be in charge of Kaduna State Investment Promotion Agency.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "FG May Expand Access to Covid-19 Vaccination Ahead of December Deadline",
          "text": "*Resolves to enhancing security features of cards\n\n*US donates over 3.5 million doses of vaccine to Nigeria\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nFollowing the federal government\u2019s December deadline for civil servants to get the COVID-19 vaccination as precondition for accessing their offices, the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA) has expressed its commitment to ramping up vaccine uptake across the country.\n\nThe agency said it had put in place plans for the establishment of mass vaccination sites across the country. It also said the government had begun to work on the possibility of enhancing the security features of the vaccination cards to limit forgery.\n\nExecutive Director of NPHCDA, Dr. Faisal Shuaib, said at a media briefing on Thursday in Abuja that the objective of the strategy was to vaccinate a large number of people through big sites, such as federal institutions (universities, polytechnics), shopping malls, religious centres, sporting events, conference centres, and markets.\n\nShuaib said the agency had already done a comprehensive analysis and forecast of COVID-19 vaccines\u2019 availability.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have enough vaccines to cover more than this population of federal government employees and we are expecting even much more. Based on delivery forecasts from the COVAX facility and the African Union, Nigeria will have adequate vaccines to cover more than 50% of eligible populations by the end of the first quarter of 2022.\u201d\n\nShuaib explained that the agency was currently enhancing the security features of the vaccination cards in order to limit forgery.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe are working with relevant security agencies to make examples of these individuals, who may wish to buy or sell the cards by naming and shaming them. We are also enhancing the security features of our vaccination cards in order to limit forgery.\u201d\n\nThe executive director said the exercise would require strong collaboration between NPHCDA, state governments, religious bodies, school authorities, and governing bodies of malls and large sporting events.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs we expand the vaccination sites, we encourage all eligible Nigerians to avail themselves for vaccination. I am also glad to inform you that we have commenced the process of decentralising COVID-19 vaccination in Nigeria, to include private health care providers. This is to expand access and increase utilisation of the vaccines.\u201d\n\nShuaib assured that decentralisation would not affect the federal government\u2019s free vaccination policy, adding that COVID-19 vaccines would be administered free of charge at both government and private health facilities and the vaccination cards would be given free of charge after vaccination.\n\nHe, however, noted that private health facilities might need to charge for their hospital registration cards, which would be different from the COVID-19 vaccination cards.\n\nShuaib said in order to ensure a seamless decentralisation, the agency had begun the training of health workers in selected private health care facilities and the sensitisation of critical stakeholders to create awareness on the plan and criteria for involving the private sector in COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nHe said the process of involving the private sector would be transparently done in line with the agency\u2019s pledge of accountability to Nigerians.\n\nOn the supervision of private healthcare providers involved in COVID-19 vaccination, the NPHCDA boss said the agency was putting measures in place to ensure close and effective monitoring and supervision of participating private health facilities to ensure standards were not compromised.\n\nHe said interested private health facilities would be required to meet certain criteria, including having the requisite qualified health care workers, among others. To ensure delivery of the vaccines by private health facilities as expected, he said the agency would engage in regular supervisory visits to the facilities and provide clear rules of engagement to the participating facilities.\n\nShuaib gave an update on the vaccination efforts, saying as at the morning of October 14, a total of 5,246,523 eligible populations had received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria, representing 4.7 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s target population.\n\nHe further said the number of eligible persons fully vaccinated in Nigeria was now 2,546,094, representing 2.3 per cent of the target population.\n\nShuaib also gave an update on the outcome of the study on the vaccination exercise conducted in six states of the federation, namely Anambra, Borno, Edo, Katsina, Lagos, and Plateau. He said the overall aim of the observational study was to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in enrolled adult individuals of 18 years and above, who had received the authorised COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria for the purpose of safety signal detection.\n\nShuaib disclosed that Professor Akin Osibogun, a Professor of Community Medicine at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, led the study. He said the study sought to estimate the incidence of adverse events following immunisation with different brands of the COVID-19 vaccine in all enrolled immunised subjects.\n\nShuaib explained, \u201cFindings of this study showed that 52.6 per cent of enrolees (1,284 were enrolled) reported non-serious adverse effects and only one subject or 0.08 per cent reported serious adverse effect in the first week following vaccination. None of the enrolled subjects, who reported adverse effects, required hospitalisation.\n\n\u201cThe commonest reported symptoms among vaccines were tenderness at injection site (20.9 per cent) and fever (20.3 per cent). Most of the reported symptoms (55.5 per cent) occurred within the first three days of vaccination while 40.2 per cent of the vaccines with reported symptoms could not recall time of onset of symptoms. \u201c\n\nBut the adverse effects, he stated, were reported more in the older age groups, with 61.5 per cent of those older than 60 years reporting symptoms compared to 34.9 per cent of those aged 18-24 years.\n\nHe said the difference for age was statistically significant (p=0.003).\n\nShuaib stated, \u201cThose with pre-existing morbidities were also observed to have higher rates of reported symptoms (AEFIs) than those without pre-existing morbidities even though the observed difference was not statistically significant (p=0.551)\n\n\u201cThe findings suggest that from the perspective of public communication, the vaccine is quite safe and the reported symptoms are mild and to be expected in the first three days following vaccination.\n\n\u201cOlder vaccines are to be particularly counselled as to what to expect and not to panic as the symptoms are mild and time limited. During this study, there was no report of Vaccine-induced COVID-19 or deaths related to the vaccines.\u201d\n\nUS Donates over 3.5 million Doses of COVID-19 Vaccine to Nigeria\n\nMeanwhile, the United States has shipped in over 3.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines into Nigeria.\n\nA statement yesterday from the US Embassy noted that the US Mission in Nigeria was pleased, \u201cto announce the arrival of 3,577,860 doses of Pfizer vaccine for the public health and benefit of the Nigerian people through COVAX, the worldwide initiative ensuring equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.\u201d\n\nThe statement further disclosed that the US shipment arrived at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja on October 14.\n\nAccording to the statement, the shipment would bring the total number of US-bilaterally donated doses to Nigeria to over 7.5 million, noting that the US also contributed to the first multilateral donation of AstraZeneca vaccine in March 2021.\n\nThat meant that overall, COVAX has provided Nigeria with over 10 million doses to date.\n\n\u201cSafe and effective vaccines are our best tool to ending the pandemic. The United States has pledged to purchase and donate 1.1 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses worldwide, and to date has delivered more than 180 million doses to more than 100 countries,\u201d it added.\n\nThe US government pointed out that its continued efforts to provide vaccines to African Union (AU) member countries was to fulfill President Biden\u2019s pledge when he said: \u201cThe United States is committed to bringing the same urgency to international vaccination efforts that we have demonstrated at home. We are sharing these vaccines to save lives and to lead the world in bringing an end to the pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe statement further noted that vaccine donations were part of the US government\u2019s continued partnership with the government of Nigeria in combatting COVID-19.\n\n\u201cTo date, the US government has provided $130 million of support to Nigeria\u2019s Ministry of Health and Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19. The US government is looking forward to continued coordination with Nigeria and its Center for Disease Control to deliver life-saving doses across the country through the COVAX initiative,\u201d it added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

They are not asking that we give our head or blood,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey are interested in getting good working conditions for their members and for the public university system to be conducive for teaching and research.\n\n\u201cIf the private sector can bring excellence to our universities, the government can as well do the same. So, working hand in hand with ASUU as we are currently doing is a model we must keep.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe will not be going to war with ASUU all the time. We can do constructive engagement. If there is something that government can do and it says it can\u2019t, I am here to say no, you can because I am privy to some information.\n\n\u201cSo, we will give the public university system a pride of place, so that when next global assessment is done, we will get more Nigerian universities in the first 1,000 in Africa.\u201d\n\nASUU had also called for legislation mandating the children of public office holders to school in Nigeria.\n\nThe union had embarked on a nearly nine-month strike in 2020 over the unmet demands by the federal government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast August, it had threatened a fresh shutdown after lamenting FG\u2019s non-implementation of some signed agreements that prompted the strike\u2019s suspension which included increased funding for public varsities.\n\nSpeaking further, Ngige described himself as a firm believer in Nigeria\u2019s public university system.\n\n\u201cThat is why my children are there. I didn\u2019t send them to private ones. One graduated from Odumegwu Ojukwu University, Awka, and my daughter, from UNILAG,\u201d the minister added.\n\n\u201cMy third child will also come out possibly next month from a public university again. I don\u2019t believe that public universities are going to be abandoned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe cannot do so. If we abandon them, the children of not-too privileged or not-too rich will not go anywhere and education is the civilisation we need.\n\n\u201cIf any group of government workers or public officers will be on the side of the public university system, I am the number one. I also attended a public university. I attended the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN).\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go to the USA when my classmates were going there. The government will do its own side, despite lean resources.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable. All rights reserved.

Look at the budget we have seen recently, it is exactly the same thing we have been seeing. Nothing has changed.\n\n\u201cAnd this country is paying the high price for neglecting education. The banditry you see, the kidnapping and what have you, is because people are not being taken care of.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201dThat is why ASUU has been struggling so that Nigerian universities will be revamped for our children to attend and stop going outside the country to study.\n\n\u201cChildren from other countries will come here too and pay to this country in hard currency.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable.

A new Governing Council was inaugurated in April this year and it decided in its wisdom to start the process afresh. A new advert was placed in July this year and after the expiration of the advert, fourteen (14) candidates applied for the position.\n\n\u201cIn line with the University Acts, Search Team was subsequently constituted to search for suitable persons who might not apply on their own volition. At the end of the exercise, additional two applications were received and this brought the number of the applicants to sixteen (16).\n\n\u201cOn Wednesday, 13 October 2021, Council interacted with all fifteen (15) candidates. All members of Council scored the candidates using approved Council guidelines. At the end of the exercise, eight (8) candidates in order of merit were shortlisted for the final interview.\n\n\u201cAt the meeting, two (2) members of Council, as required by Law, were also appointed. Earlier in the week, Senate had elected two (2) members of the Senate to serve on the Selection Board for the appointment of the Vice-Chancellor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Governing Council at its just-concluded meeting today considered the report of the Selection Board and approved the recommendation of the Board to appoint Professor Kayode Oyebode Adebowale as the next Vice-Chancellor of the University of Ibadan.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, my pleasure to present to you the new and the 13th Vice-Chancellor of this great University, University of Ibadan, Professor Kayode Oyebode Adebowale.

          "text": "Sparkle, a mobile-based digital bank that provides a combination of financial, lifestyle, and business support services to Nigerians, on Thursday, announced a $3.1 million seed fundraise from entirely Nigerian investors.\n\nThe round, which was oversubscribed according to a statement from the company, was led by Leadway Assurance with the participation of Trium Networks and a number of undisclosed high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) in the country.\n\nThe latest funding brings Sparkle\u2019s total investment secured to $5.1 million, having previously raised $2 million in pre-seed from friends and family.\n\nSparkle plans to use the new investment to scale its talent teams across engineering, financial risk, and marketing departments as well as invest in its automated back-end processes and digital infrastructure, it said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted to be collaborating with a group of highly respected Nigerian businesses, investment firms, and captains of industry,\u201d said Sparkle founder Uzoma Dozie, who is an ex-CEO of the defunct Diamond Bank. \u201cThey all understand the real need for a digital-first platform such as Sparkle.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIt\u2019s not common in the Nigerian tech ecosystem that a funding round of such value comprises only local investors. The majority of the funding for startups in the country and across Africa comes from foreign investors and in some cases, both local and foreign VCs invest in the same venture.\n\nAccording to Dozie, the Sparkle team was \u201cvery deliberate\u201d about having an all-Nigerian round as it always felt that having a selection of strategic local investors would be beneficial to the startup\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cNigerians know Nigerians\u2014their banking and spending habits, quirks, challenges\u2014both as consumers and businesses. We wanted to make sure our investors really understood the market before committing to this round,\u201d he told TechCabal.\n\nAsked if his background in the financial services industry played a role in the successful fundraising effort, Dozie admitted his familiarity with local financiers and high-net-worth Nigerians helped convince them to bet their money on Sparkle.\n\n\u201cI think that helped, yes. I am used to speaking to financiers and know the language and the key triggers to galvanise them into action. And they are used to me shouting loud and hard, over the years, about leveraging digital and technology to scale financial services for Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nDozie adds that he will be \u201cleaning on sector expertise and insight\u201d of the new investors to build long-lasting partnerships as Sparkle scales and predicted an improvement in the participation of HNWIs in Nigeria\u2019s tech and venture capital space in the near future.\n\n\u201cI think the trend will change as the market opportunities become more obvious to them, and better connections and networks are forged between tech entrepreneurs and HNWIs in Nigeria,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to see barriers to access broken down, which is important, but HNWIs also need to feel comfortable in investing in new sectors that they may not be so familiar with.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, neobanks are known to provide cheaper and more personalised banking through various models. Sparkle stands out in the sense that it is one of the few that offers a mix of individual and business banking services via a single platform.\n\nWhile individuals can use features such as savings, bill payments, money transfers, and other basic services, Sparkle Business, launched in April this year, offers MSMEs and SMEs functions that include inventory and invoice management, a payment gateway service, tax advisory, and employee management.\n\nThe startup has partnerships with Visa, Network International, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Nigeria that help power its offerings, and it has also secured a microfinance bank licence from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nPer TechCrunch, Sparkle has signed on over 40,000 individual banking customers and 2,000 businesses since its launch. It plans to continue focusing on connecting Nigerians and the global Nigerian diaspora, according to Dozie.\n\n\u201cNigeria has a massive youth population who increasingly live, work and play beyond physical borders\u2014we build with them in mind,\u201d Dozie said. \u201cWhether we are building services for individuals or businesses, we\u2019re fully focused on creating a connected tribe of Sparklers.\u201d\n\n***The article was updated with responses from Uzoma Dozie on the connection between his background and the Sparkle fundraise in the 9th and 10th paragraphs.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nAccording to court documents, the contract stipulated that the plaintiffs would transport Uber\u2019s Kenya customer base at a minimum of $0.54 per kilometre, with a minimum fare of $2.71. Under this agreement, Uber Kenya Limited retained a 25% cut of overall profits from each ride.\n\nIn July 2016, Uber reduced the minimum rate per kilometre to $0.32 and the minimum fare to $1.81 per trip. This, claimed the drivers-turned-plaintiffs, was a breach of contract that left them unable to earn profits as Uber drivers and maintain vehicles purchased to adhere to Uber standards.\n\nUber Kenya Limited had a different story. They claimed that the group of 34 drivers had not entered into contracts with them but had done so with Uber BV, a private LLC registered in Amsterdam. Because of this, Uber Kenya Limited said they were not liable for the breach of contractual obligations.\n\nAfter years-long litigation in the High Court of Kenya, during which the drivers fought to prove that Uber Kenya Limited and Uber BV are one and the same, the High Court of Kenya has finally issued its ruling on the issue this week highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry.\n\nThe Corporate Veil\n\nUber BV is an Amsterdam-based company that owns the rights to the Uber app. Uber Kenya Limited acts as a subsidiary that contracts Uber drivers in Kenya. While Uber BV claimed it was a separate entity from Uber Kenya Limited, the High Court of Kenya concluded that there was an intricate link between both companies.\n\nEvidence presented to the court revealed that the group of Ubers shared the same email address and hired the same council to litigate disputes in court.\n\nThis, stated Milimani court justice, Francis Tuiyott, lifted the \u201ccorporate veil\u201d off of the conglomerate, making Uber Kenya Limited and Uber BV liable to the plaintiffs.\n\nUber and Its Drivers\n\nUber, as a company, maintains the claim that it does not employ drivers but acts as an intermediary between the drivers and clients. This murky relationship has landed the company in court cases across the world.\n\nIn April, a group of South African lawyers partnered with a UK law firm to file a class action suit against Uber that would force the company to recognise drivers as employees with benefits rather than independent contractors.\n\nUber has also been in and out of UK courts over how it classifies its drivers. In February, the company finally agreed to treat drivers as workers after losing in front of the Supreme Court. More recently, The Court of Amsterdam struck down Uber\u2019s intermediary status ruling that drivers are, in fact, employed by the company.\n\nIn Kenya, the line between Uber as an intermediary and employer becomes even blurrier.\n\nUber employed over 12,000 drivers in Kenya as of November 2020. While some of Uber\u2019s fleet owns their vehicles, many do not.\n\nDrivers who cannot afford their own cars are employed by private sub-contracted companies that run their own group of cars. Others act as private chauffeurs whose employers allow them to drive their vehicles as Ubers between pickups.\n\nThis sub-contracted third-party relationship means that returns to Uber drivers in Kenya are even lower than the cut they receive from Uber itself.\n\nFuel to the Fire\n\nAdding to reduced incomes are Kenya\u2019s ongoing petrol price hikes that have placed fuel prices in Kenya at a historic high.\n\nDavid Muteru, Chairman of the Digital Taxis Association of Kenya, claims that after the fuel price hike, Uber failed to cushion the financial blow for drivers\n\n\u201cThey did not raise fares. Instead, they introduced new cheaper products,\u201d said Muteru in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Muteru claims he has been deactivated from the Uber app as a result of his activism.\n\nUber has consistently lowered its prices to suit the needs of the Kenyan market. For over two months, the rideshare app has been offering weekly 25% discounts to loyal customers, competing against Bolt who is also making inroads in the Kenyan market. The reduction in fare is then shirked to the driver.\n\nBottoms Up\n\nUber cannot be blamed for this alone. Its strategies in rapidly expanding African cities are permitted by policymakers who see Uber\u2019s entry as a red stamp of approval for on-track development. The ability for a city to Uber everywhere also delays the need to address and urgent need for reliable public transportation.\n\nKenya\u2019s Uber drivers recognise the company\u2019s important presence in the nation\u2019s transport infrastructure. David Muteru and his colleagues do not want an all-out ban of Uber in Kenya but better regulation that yields a more transparent relationship between the company and its contracted drivers.\n\n\u201cit\u2019s opaque,\u201d said Muteru of the current situation. \u201cUber should start by recognition of driver representation from registered bodies\u2026the end goal is compensation for losses incurred\u201d.\n\nBut, will it be worth it in the long run? While powerhouses like Uber can keep up in a foot race, local tech companies with little capital in their early stages cannot. If this trend continues, large multinationals may price out drivers, as well as local tech companies hoping to cash in on Kenya\u2019s digital revolution.\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author",

          "title": "M-Pesa, Opay, Telebirr, Palmpay: How Chinese tech is powering African fintech",
          "text": "In 2013, M-Pesa, Africa\u2019s largest mobile money platform, was faced with a major challenge: Its users couldn\u2019t settle insurance premiums and make bank payments in real-time. Payments made to Kenya Power took 48 hours before reflecting in the company\u2019s systems; other payments, like the one to the National Hospital Insurance Fund, experienced longer delay times, often taking three days before they were acknowledged.\n\nAmong the many reasons for these lengthy settlements and transfer times was the fact that M-Pesa\u2019s mobile money platform could only handle between 200 to 300 transactions per second. But that needed to increase by at least tenfold to make transactions more seamless.\n\nDesperate for a way out, the Vodacom and Safaricom-owned M-Pesa turned to Chinese tech giant Huawei, which helped migrate M-Pesa\u2019s 12.8 million active users over the space of 18 months to a better-performing mobile money platform.\n\nEight years later, M-Pesa has scaled operations to cater for its 50 million active users in the seven African countries it operates in \u2013 Kenya, Tanzania, Lesotho, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Mozambique and Egypt. It now processes over a billion transactions every month.\n\nMostly working in the background, Beijing Murong Technology, a Chinese financial software company, also collaborated with Huawei over the years to introduce some features to M-Pesa.\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\n\n\nSuccess begets success\n\nM-Pesa\u2019s success meant that when Ethiopia\u2019s state-owned telecoms company Ethio telecom decided to build the country\u2019s first mobile money platform, TeleBirr, they turned to Huawei.\n\nLaunched in May 2021, TeleBirr caters to the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. In just two months since its launch, TeleBirr has added six million users to its mobile payment system without a hitch.\n\nFor Huawei, these feats highlight its shift from providing solely telecommunications infrastructure to now providing its network customers with technology to run mobile payment applications in as many as 19 African countries. Encouraged by its accomplishments, Huawei also recently announced its intention to build an innovation and research centre in Tunisia, head of the company\u2019s North Africa region.\n\nThe success of M-Pesa and Telebirr has enhanced Huawei\u2019s reputation as the poster child for China\u2019s enterprising tech sector. Meanwhile, the collaboration between Huawei and Beijing Murong Technology highlights a bigger trend: Beyond building bridges, rail lines, airports and roads across the continent, Chinese companies are increasingly building digital infrastructures in Africa.\n\nWhy Africa? The African market offers Chinese companies and investors a growing young population expected to reach 1.7 billion by 2030. Presently, about 50% of this growing population is excluded from the financial system and less than 40% have access to the internet. This presents a massive opportunity to boost financial inclusion and connectivity.\n\nThe indispensable player\n\nThe presence of tech companies like Huawei and ZTE in Africa dates back to the 1990s. Their expansion to Africa was fueled by the desire to fill a vacuum left by the growing disinterest by Western companies and countries to invest in Africa. These Chinese tech companies decided to establish a stronger presence in Africa despite the political and economic instability. In the long run, this move has paid off and the results are glaring.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that you wouldn\u2019t have a thriving African tech ecosystem today without the Chinese,\u201d said Eric Olander, Managing Editor of the Chinese Africa Project, a media organisation dedicated to exploring every aspect of China\u2019s engagement with Africa.\n\n\u201cIf the Chinese were not there, Africa would be 15 years behind at least. Think about it, about 50% of the phones in Africa are controlled by one company: Transsion.\u201d\n\nOlander cites the success of Transsion, Africa\u2019s leading mobile phone maker which went public on a $7 billion valuation, and more recently Opay, a fintech platform with over 5 million users, which raised $400 million at a $2 billion valuation from investors like Softbank.\n\n\u201cThese Chinese companies are challenging the assumption that you can\u2019t make money in Africa and that the African tech ecosystem isn\u2019t really that big.\u201d\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\nBeyond just making money, once these Chinese companies strike gold, they go on to invest in other upcoming Chinese startups. In 2018, Transsion led a $40 million seed investment in PalmPay, a digital payment service, with participation from China\u2019s NetEase and Taiwanese chip designer MediaTek. PalmPay offers peer-to-peer money transfers, airtime purchase and bill payments in Nigeria and Ghana with plans to expand to other African countries.\n\nRiding on Transsion\u2019s wings, in 2020, PalmPay came pre-installed on about 20 million units of Transsion phone brands \u2013 Tecno, Infinix and itel. Likewise, from June 2021, Huawei Mobile Kenya users were able to make in-app purchases via M-Pesa.\n\nChinese tech giant, Alibaba Group, hasn\u2019t been left out of the action. Its online and mobile payment platform Alipay collaborated with Vodacom to develop VodaPay, a super app positioned to drive financial inclusion and economic growth in South Africa. In June 2021, VodaPay was unveiled, with 70 companies already signed up on it.\n\nNotably, Wapi Pay, a Singapore-based Kenyan fintech startup powering the Africa-Asia cross-border payment, uses Huawei\u2019s mobile money services. An indication that contemporary fintech startups are also relying on Chinese tech.\n\n\u201cChinese technology is the foundational technology in Africa. I call it the indispensable player in the African tech space. You take the Chinese piece out and African tech falls apart,\u201d Olander said.\n\nCaution, concerns and the reality\n\nThe proliferation of Chinese enterprises in Africa has attracted a great deal of scepticism from academics, policymakers and other observers in recent years. Of particular concern is the relationship between Chinese companies and the Chinese communist party as well as how the data from Africa is used.\n\nJili Bulelani, a South African researcher at Havard with research interests in Africa-China relations, is concerned about this.\n\n\u201cThe question a lot of the time is how deep Chinese companies like Huawei are involved,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt some level, we can see them supporting fibre optics, cloud storage and mobile money projects. But there are questions around who owns this data and the legal ramifications around people securing themselves and their data.\u201d\n\nThese issues around data usage are worsened by the fact that there aren\u2019t effective data laws in Africa to protect its citizens. About 50% of countries on the continent don\u2019t have data protection laws backed by legislation.\n\nWhile Olander agrees that the answer to these questions about Huawei\u2019s practices is relatively opaque, partly because Huawei does not communicate well enough about this, he also clamours for a practical look at the situation.\n\nHe believes that, from a practical standpoint, African countries are better served by these Chinese companies because their products are cheaper and more tailored to the African market. Africa is a difficult place to do business, and as such, most African countries and companies are not in a strong negotiating position.\n\n\u201cWhen the Americans told the Kenyans that they should not use Huawei for 5G networks, the answer from Safaricom was, \u2018Okay, but what do we do?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cFor African countries, the choice at the end of the day is not between Nokia, Alcatel, Ericsson, Samsung and Huawei. Oftentimes, it\u2019s between Huawei and nothing.\u201d\n\nHe also points out that the accusations against Huawei aren\u2019t about the performance of their products and services. A testament to the fact that they make quality products that meet the needs of their clients.\n\nHenry Tugendhat, a senior policy analyst with the China team at the US Institute of Peace, is of the opinion that if Africans are really concerned about cybersecurity then they have to start with the assumption that everybody is interested in our data and communications.\n\n\u201cUntil African countries manufacture their own equipment, they\u2019ll always be susceptible to international organisations having access to their data,\u201d Tugendhat said. \u201cTo manage the situation it\u2019s going to come down to how African countries can legislate and how they enforce that legislation.\u201d\n\nIs there room for competition?\n\nDespite the immense contribution of Chinese tech to the African fintech space, there\u2019s still room for growth. Per the GSMA report 2020, less than 50% of the African population have a phone. This pales in comparison with the US (81%) or even China (63%).\n\nThe race is still on for the different players building digital infrastructure for the African fintech space. Iginio Gagliardone, author of China, Africa, and the Future of the Internet is of the opinion that there might not be much room left for competition in the next few years.\n\n\u201cChina tends to approach projects with a longer time horizon. With it making headway in the physical and digital infrastructure space, it could use its pervasiveness to lock in standards against competitors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they keep creating at this momentum, it\u2019ll be difficult to unbundle and pull the plug. I\u2019m a bit more worried about the future,\u201d Gagliardone added.\n\nIn the past decade, China has become a central player in Africa\u2019s development. Having a strong Chinese presence in African tech has clearly been very beneficial; a monopolistic dominance is what\u2019s worrying.\n\nTechCabal contacted Huawei for comments but had not got a response at the time of publishing this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate",
          "text": "When Kemi*, 26, received a rejection email from Twitter about a software engineering role she\u2019d applied to, she was devastated, and she cried. She\u2019d previously aced Palantir\u2019s recruitment process for the same role and was going to travel for the final interview, on-site, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and thwarted that plan.\n\nBefore all of these, Kemi had applied to Google, Amazon and Apple but didn\u2019t scale through their recruitment processes. These initial rejections didn\u2019t faze her like Twitter\u2019s, though, because, by the time she applied to the social media giant, she felt she\u2019d already acquired enough skills to land the job.\n\nYet she didn\u2019t. The common response she got across these companies was that she\u2019d submitted her coding assessments later than required; they thought she was slow in coming up with solutions. But she had a demanding, full-time job, and that took up most of her time.\n\nShe decided, then, to take a break from applying for international jobs and focus on her current job at the time. The job paid her enough to sort out personal and family bills, after all.\n\nAnd yet, her ambitions wouldn\u2019t take a break. So it was only a matter of weeks before she was back to applying again to these international jobs.\n\nSo, how did a girl like her \u2013 who came from a poor background \u2013 go from selling fufu and dried fish on a university campus to almost working with Google, Amazon, Twitter and Palantir, and finally landing a software engineering role at the world\u2019s biggest financial data and news company, Bloomberg?\n\nIt all began in Lagos, Nigeria, 26 years ago.\n\nKemi was the first child of her family, born in 1995, in the Akowonjo area of Lagos, Nigeria. Her mother, Mrs Adeoye*, was a schoolteacher and fabric trader. But not the kind that owned shops. Mrs Adeoye sold fabric to her colleagues at school and neighbours. On weekends, she and Kemi hawked them on the street.\n\nDue to their inadequate salary, it\u2019s common in Nigeria for teachers, especially female ones, to double as traders. But it\u2019s not common to see a schoolteacher hawking on the street.\n\nMrs Adeoye collected the fabrics on credit from wholesalers and could only restock after paying for the previous wares. She embodied steadfastness and diligence \u2013 values she has passed down to her daughters.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKemi watched her mother juggle two jobs to provide for her and her sister and that influenced her decision to work hard and smart. \u201cMy mum raised us alone, and I just got the memo, from a young age, that if I didn\u2019t want to suffer, I\u2019d have to hustle.\u201d\n\nIt was a lonely journey for a single mother raising two daughters alone in Lagos with the little money she made from her teaching job and side hustle.\n\nBut where was her father?\n\n\u201cBold of you to think my dad is dead,\u201d Kemi said, when I asked when her father had died.\n\nHer father had left her mother when her younger sister, Ayo,* was a year old. There was no reason for his disappearance \u2013 at least not any Kemi or her mother knew of. Kemi was five when he left and never looked back.\n\nThe next time Kemi saw him again, she was 12.\n\nHer father\u2019s return was bad luck\n\nIn 2007, Kemi\u2019s sister Ayo fell seriously sick and Mrs Adeoye had to send for her daughters\u2019 father. He showed up, surprisingly, like a hero who\u2019d come to save the day. He spent some months with his earlier-abandoned family and ended up turning everything upside down before he left them yet again. Kemi, her mother and sister had gone out one day, and when they returned, found that he had disappeared with Mrs Adeoye\u2019s goods and put her in debt.\n\nThis event marked the beginning of a negative turn for the family, throwing them into a state of penury that would last over three years. Those goods had been collected on credit and now the wholesalers were upset and wanted their money.\n\nMrs Adeoye had to repay her debts in bits, from her meagre salary, leaving her with almost nothing for feeding and housekeeping. Sometimes, her creditors stormed the school where she taught to embarrass her about their money. By now, things had gotten so bad that Kemi and Ayo used polythene bags to carry their books to school.\n\nSchool fees were the least of the Adeoye sisters\u2019 problems, however, because they both attended schools where their mother taught. There was a staff discount for teachers\u2019 kids at these schools, and sometimes, a complete fee waiver.\n\nExcelling in school\n\nAmid all this chaos, Kemi remained one of the most brilliant students in her class. Being a teacher\u2019s kid may not have come with life\u2019s best comforts, but it gave her something: strict supervision that drove her to excellence.\n\nTwo years after secondary school, Kemi was admitted into the Faculty of Engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife.\n\nThings had gotten better for her family while she was in SS 3, her final year of secondary school. Her mother got a new job in another school. The job came with accommodation, free lunch and better pay. Mrs Adeoye bought Kemi her first laptop and was able to pay her university bills.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut their problems were far from over.\n\nA few months into Kemi\u2019s freshman year, terror hit again. Her mother lost the new job, and the family was back to square one. Her mother never found her feet again after that.\n\nFor five years, Kemi struggled through university. In her second year, her friend\u2019s father paid her school fees, and in her third year, her fees would come from money she made hawking food on campus. In her third year, she took fufu, eggs and dry fish from one hostel room to another, calling on her fellow students to come buy.\n\nShe stopped selling food after her internship at a tech firm in Lagos. And she used part of the money she made during the internship to sort out her fees for her fifth year of school.\n\nWriting code changed Kemi\u2019s story\n\nKemi started writing code in her freshman year. Some guys at her school had organised a coding bootcamp, which she passively attended. At OAU, it was easy to get into coding as there were always coding camps going on, on the campus.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to continue coding. After the bootcamp, Kemi wasn\u2019t really excited about the skill and discontinued further development in that area \u2013 until her third year when she started working as a software development trainee in a tech company in Yaba, Nigeria\u2019s biggest tech hub. The company picked up students, trained and paid them a stipend for learning.\n\nWhile that was going on, one of her lecturers organised a coding training and, at the end of it, a hackathon, which marked the beginning of it all.\n\nIf Nigerian universities were to be graded based on the number of top tech talents produced, OAU would be in the top three. The school is popular for this, and the Nigerian tech ecosystem testifies to this.\n\n\u201cI like to say I officially became a software engineer during my internship at a leading e-commerce company,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cThat was the turning point for me.\u201d\n\nSince her internship at Konga, all the jobs she\u2019d gotten had been based on recommendations.\n\nDuring her time at her first job out of school, she got an offer from a company based in Germany, but her Nigerian company made a counter-offer and she remained with them. However, when Bloomberg called, it was a case of not every offer can be countered.\n\n\u201cGetting into tech wasn\u2019t really about passion. It was more about getting stability in life,\u201d Kemi told me. \u201cA career as a software engineer has allowed me to do things I could only dream of [before].\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s reality is the same for most Africans, especially young people going into tech; many available jobs can barely cater for their own immediate needs, not to talk of catering for other family members.\n\nKemi wants to continue supporting her mother and sister, not only by clearing their bills but also helping them to be independent of her. \u201cI want to help my family build generational wealth, and you know that can\u2019t happen if I\u2019m the only one giving.\u201d\n\nKemi graduated from OAU with a first-class. This revelation was enough to start an entirely new conversation. There were so many more questions I wanted to ask her, but the answer to them all, she told me, was grit, ambition and a staunch fear of poverty.\n\n*Names have been changed to protect subjects\u2019 identities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe office suddenly felt much colder as the young man took in the departmental officer\u2019s words. His dream of being one of the foremost robotic engineers at a top university in the Francophone world seemed to have ended before it even began as he encountered an unexpected problem.\n\nHe had told everyone who cared to listen in Cameroon that he was going to the prestigious Toulouse III University \u2013 Paul Sabatier in France to study, and he had gathered enough resources to make it happen. After a tense five-hour flight and barely enough rest the previous night, he didn\u2019t understand what he was hearing.\n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he asked, to be sure.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry you can\u2019t pay with cash Monsieur,\u201d the officer responded, \u201cYou have to deposit at the bank and make the payment electronically with your card.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFeeling hopeful once more, he thanked the officer. He darted out of the office, making a beeline for the nearest bank, where he excitedly informed the cashier of his intentions and received another shocker.\n\n\u201cYou need to have a school certificate to open a student bank account and get a card.\u201d\n\nThe young man was at his wit\u2019s end. He couldn\u2019t register for his student certificate without paying with a bank card, which he couldn\u2019t get without his student certificate.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t his fault that he went to France with cash to pay his registration fees and tuition. After all, he\u2019d left French-speaking Africa, where barely 20% of the population had access to banking services, so that was the obvious option.\n\nThe young man in this story is Roger Noel Nengwe, Co-founder and CEO of PaySika, a neobank looking to provide banking services to the unbanked in Francophone Africa. PaySika has just raised $350,000 pre-seed from Angel investors in France, England, and Nigeria to fund this mission.\n\nAlongside Stezen Bisselou-Nzengue, Co-founder and CEO, Nengwe is building PaySika on Francophone Africa\u2019s existing mobile money infrastructure. It offers banking services not just on an app like most neobanks but on their favourite messaging apps. Think Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Telegram.\n\nIts chatbot helps users open an account, request free physical and virtual debit cards, and make transfers with these messaging apps without having to download the PaySika app or use its website.\n\nWhile the registration requirements for neobanks in Nigeria, for example, implicitly require you to have a bank account already, PaySika requires the phone number associated with the widely used mobile money.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis mission has given him the confidence of investors like Charles Edouard Bou\u00e9e (former CEO of Roland Berger), Benjamin Chemla (founder of Stuart), and several others.\n\nNengwe\u2019s Toulouse experience was four years ago, in 2017, before he and his co-founder knew how to build chatbots and financial services applications.\n\nAs he sat in the bank, not knowing what to do next, a sandy-haired middle-aged man with what looked like a never-ending smile walked into the bank with deliberately measured steps.\n\nLooking around and waving at some familiar faces, he spotted Nengwe, whose hands covered his face as he tried to calm himself down.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked Nengwe as he got within earshot, his perpetual smile still in place masking his seriousness.\n\nNengwe glanced at him, unsure if trusting a stranger in a foreign country was his best move.\n\nRealising he didn\u2019t have much choice, Nengwe explained his situation as calmly as he could.\n\nWhat followed was the stuff of dreams, the kind Nengwe had before leaving Cameroon.\n\nThis stranger offered to pay his fees with his card and collect cash. Probably more surprising was the man\u2019s seeming familiarity with his story.\n\nThis man turned out to be one of Nengwe\u2019s professors at Upssitech, in Toulouse University.\n\nThis gut-wrenching episode was pretty much par for the course for Africans migrating to study in France. Bisselou-Nzengue, with whom he would later form a close bond, also had a similar experience after leaving his home country of Gabon.\n\n\u201cLater on, I helped some people by providing them with my card and had them give me cash back,\u201d Nengwe reveals.\n\nHowever, he\u2019s quick to state that this is not the case for students from Germany or even Asia; it happens to just people coming from Africa.\n\nA seed had been sown, albeit in unpleasant circumstances, and both men would begin thinking of ways to solve this problem, which they figured needed to be tackled at the roots. It was clear that they had to democratise access to cards and digital payments services in countries like Cameroon where, only 34% of its adults have a bank account, DR Congo (25%), and Gabon (58.5%), to mention a few.\n\nBuilding that first MVP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoger Nengwe, Co-founder and CEO of PaySika\n\nAfter graduating in 2019, he quickly decided that working for a company was not for him and began to put his knowledge to good use, testing some of his ideas.\n\n\u201cI started my first company, MyMoney, a chatbot that connected to users\u2019 bank accounts and sent notifications. But it failed because of product-market fit. We started working on PaySika right after,\u201d Nengwe says.\n\nBeing one of the most regulated globally, Africa\u2019s financial services sector is not kind to newbie fintechs with no track record, so building PaySika wasn\u2019t a walk in the park.\n\nExpectedly, the inexperienced entrepreneurs were in dire need of cash to build PaySika\u2019s first MVP.\n\n\u201cWe entered French Tech Tremplin, a startup competition organised by the French government to invest in high impact startups. We received $23,000 that helped us in part to build the MVP at the beginning. This plus friends and family, and our own savings, of course,\u201d Nengwe says.\n\nAfrica might have a distinct lack of senior developers, and local startups struggle to keep them, but PaySika is rapidly securing the goodwill of talented senior developers who experienced similar problems when moving to Europe.\n\nNengwe also reveals that while fundraising, he and his co-founder surrounded themselves with investors who understand the fintech and banking spaces.\n\n\u201cI would say we were lucky because we were able to get an amazing network of business people that really helped us understand how this startup business works.\n\n\u201cWe have investors with a background in banking infrastructure. We have some who are CTOs, and some who are really good at hiring. We just surrounded ourselves with people who are knowledgeable about key topics that affect us.\u201d\n\nA fully-locked MVP gives Nengwe and Bisselou-Nzengue the confidence to look for mature angel investors. Some of whom would later join its just-concluded round. But despite this funding, a mammoth-sized issue remains unresolved.\n\n\u201cThe financial sector in francophone Africa is heavily regulated. So we started scouring through all the details and regulatory requirements. We then partnered with some financial institutions that will help us implement what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d he says.\n\nBusiness model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: majjed2008 Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nIn 2020, Bisselou-Nzengue, COO of PaySika, decided to hone his business skills to complement his technical background. He made the necessary preparations and left for Grenoble Business School in France for a year-long MBA in international business.\n\nThe new business he\u2019s building with Nengwe needs refining, but they seem to be headed in a promising direction.\n\nWith free physical and virtual debit cards and a 1% transaction fee on transfers, the startup does not look like it will be making much money. Nonetheless, Nengwe believes they are taking baby steps.\n\nThough the startup is yet to launch fully, it already has over 20,000 pre-registrations, mainly (90%) made up of young people aged 18 to 35.\n\n\u201cThis was gotten organically. We didn\u2019t do any sort of aggressive marketing to get people onboard. Just referrals from different people who are excited about what we\u2019re building.\u201d\n\nThe future is within reach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNengwe says he wants to make the PaySika customer onboarding process seamless enough to cater to people without mobile money accounts. Once it can get its banking licence, it plans to add a savings account service, which he believes would be a major cash cow.\n\n\u201cWe will innovate in the offline space, so our customers can also perform transactions offline. But definitely not USSD. We\u2019re also planning to hire more experienced developers and build a marketing team.\u201d\n\nPaySika has some interesting counterparts in Francophone Africa. Ivory Coast\u2019s Djamo is building a financial super app, and Julaya wants to help businesses reach the unbanked. Wave, a mobile money service provider, became the region\u2019s first Unicorn in September 2021.\n\nAs recently as last year, it seemed like there wasn\u2019t much attention being paid to French-speaking Africa, but that seems to be changing.\n\nFor Nengwe and Bisselou-Nzengue, their story with PaySika is just beginning, and we\u2019ll leave several blank pages to document what promises to be an interesting journey.\n\n*The conversations and narrative may not have happened exactly the way we told it. But everything was based on facts supplied by PaySika Co-founder, Roger Nengwe, and our research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Senior Reporter at Techpoint Africa | Website Writer and Narrator.

Trium Networks and other unnamed individuals participated in the round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaunched in the fourth quarter of 2019 by Uzoma Dozie, Sparkle CEO, the startup says it provides seamless solutions to Nigeria\u2019s retailers, SMEs, and individuals.\n\nIn 2020, Sparkle launched Sparkle Business to offer banking services to individuals and businesses.\n\nPer Techcrunch, Sparkle differs from other neobanks because it provides Nigerians with financial, lifestyle, and business support services.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the funds will be used to develop robotic process automation to aid in mundane and repetitive tasks, and to hire talent in engineering, financial risk, and marketing.\n\nFacebook\u2019s new policy on sexual harassment of public figures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the news? As part of a new update to its bullying and harassment policies, Facebook announced on Wednesday, October 13, 2021, that it would begin removing \u201csevere sexualising content\u201d directed at public figures.\n\nFacebook stated that as part of the policy update, it would remove any profiles, pages, groups, or events dedicated to sexualising public figures, like celebrities, politicians, and content creators.\n\nAntigone Davis, Global Head of Safety at Facebook, said that \u201csexualised photoshops and drawings, and any degrading content depicting individuals in the process of bodily functions,\u201d is prohibited.\n\nAlso, Facebook stated that it would remove \u201cunwanted sexualised commentary\u201d and repeated attacks sexually harassing a person.\n\nDavis said, \u201cPublic figures, either politicians, journalists, celebrities, or content creators use Facebook and Instagram to engage directly with their followers. We made these changes because attacks like these can weaponise a public figure\u2019s appearance, which is unnecessary and often not related to the work these public figures represent.\u201d\n\nIn Case You Missed It\n\nWhy Techpoint Africa is making all its past premium reports free.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDamilola*, a 24-year-old female, believes sex is disgusting and painful. She has no desire for sex and finds it difficult to discuss this challenge with her parents and friends because she is wary of the possible stigmatisation.\n\n\u201cI was only five years old when I was sexually assaulted for the first time, and I\u2019ve been a victim of sexual assaults since then. Well, I guess it\u2019s normal now, because how else would you know you\u2019re a beautiful girl if you haven\u2019t been sexually assaulted? I\u2019m simply being sarcastic. But it hurts so much that I can\u2019t stop thinking about it,\u201d she tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), sexual health is more than just the absence of sickness, malfunction, or infirmity. It is a condition of physical, emotional, mental, and social well-being associated with sexuality.\n\nSo even though Damilola shows no signs of illness or infection, she\u2019s sexually unhealthy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSexual assault can lead to sexual dysfunction \u2014 a sexual health problem \u2014 but there are tech tools to make us feel safe.\n\nSexual health in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Shawn Fields on Unsplash\n\nWhile growing up, unintended pregnancies were commonplace. It was surprising to see young people deviate from the abstinence training they\u2019d received.\n\nThen again, maybe I was wrong to assume their parents or guardians taught them about abstinence.\n\nI\u2019m much older now, and unplanned pregnancies are still prevalent. And this makes me wonder why parents still fail to teach their children about sex or give sexual health tips and abstinence talks.\n\nIf you\u2019re a Gen Z or Millenial, you\u2019ll be familiar with adverse reproductive health outcomes like unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and high HIV infection rates.\n\nIsaac Ogal, a Sexual Health Advocate and Volunteer with the International Youth Alliance for Family Planning (IYAFP) in Uganda, says, \u201ctraditional, cultural, and religious barriers to sexual health continue to exist in Africa.\n\n\u201cAnd due to high illiteracy rates and limited access to technology, a very small number of Africans have access to and understand sexual health information.\u201d\n\nPerhaps, this explains why some African parents don\u2019t give their children the necessary sex education.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides, a study shows that access to and utilisation of youth-friendly sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services remains a significant challenge for the African youth, particularly in the sub-Saharan region.\n\nThe study also reveals that sub-Saharan African youth face numerous significant SRH challenges, including limited access to youth-friendly services (YFS) such as information on growth, unsafe abortion, gender-based violence, sexuality, and family planning.\n\nAccording to WHO, achieving our sexual health and well-being depend on our \u201caccess to comprehensive, good-quality information about sex and sexuality, knowledge about the risks they may face and their vulnerability to adverse consequences of unprotected sexual activity, ability to access sexual health care, living in an environment that affirms and promotes sexual health.\u201d\n\nIn other words, sexual health issues occur when we lack access to sexual health information and education.\n\nSexual health issues are diverse, encompassing sexual orientation and gender identity, sexual expression, relationships, and pleasure.\n\nThey also include adolescent pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), endometriosis, and sexual dysfunction.\n\nHow is technology promoting sexual health?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDamilola only realised her problem when she came across \u201cSexual Dysfunction\u201d on the Internet in July 2021. She noticed that one of the dysfunctions addressed her desire and pain disorders. And this prompted her to seek help, even though she was devastated at first.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my condition was huge. I knew I had a problem, but I didn\u2019t realise it required me to be deliberate and attentive. I assumed it would go in marriage. What an irony! Thanks to the Internet, I began asking questions and researching sexual dysfunction,\u201d she says.\n\nAccording to a study, healthcare is being increasingly delivered via digital channels such as the Internet, mobile phone messaging, social media, apps, voice, video messaging, and telemedicine.\n\nThis trend has been aided by the spread of mobile technology and rapid advances in artificial intelligence.\n\nInterestingly, the study also shows that digital communication channels provide widespread coverage, allow messages to be targeted to specific groups or individuals, and have the potential to improve the delivery of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) information and support.\n\nConsequently, technology can help people in Africa access sexual health information since the continent\u2019s Internet population is rapidly increasing.\n\nOgal believes that technology significantly bridges the sexual health information gap, as many educated youths have smartphones connected to the Internet.\n\n\u201cHowever, people with sexual health issues are afraid of accessing these services because of the stigma associated with them in a society that is already historically and culturally biased,\u201d he says.\n\nBesides, we may face barriers to access sexual health services, such as concerns about confidentiality and privacy, high costs, insufficient transportation, and a scarcity of medical providers.\n\nAlso, living in remote or isolated areas can limit options because there may be no sexual health specialist available and no choice of a male or female doctor.\n\nHence, the use of telemedicine to increase access to sexual health information.\n\nTelemedicine makes use of information and communication technology to overcome geographical barriers and increase access to healthcare services.\n\nTechnological advancements are removing the stigma associated with seeking information on sexual health and related issues.\n\nWe discuss four tech tools that can help us improve our sex lives while avoiding stigma.\n\n1. Ask Without Shame (AWS)\n\nAsk Without Shame was founded by Ruth Nabembezi, who grew up in a Ugandan orphanage home.\n\nAfter Nabembezi\u2019s parents died of AIDS, her sister developed severe skin rashes, and fellow villagers assumed demons possessed her. Instead of taking her to a healthcare centre, they took her to a witch doctor\u2019s place, where she later died.\n\nFollowing her sister\u2019s death, Nabembezi was unhappy that people in Uganda not only lacked information about sex and sexual health but were not allowed to have such discussions. And that prompted her to start Ask Without Shame (AWS) in 2015.\n\nAWS is a non-profit organisation that uses mobile technology to deliver sexual health information from medical experts and counsellors to young people to dispel sexual myths and taboos, halt potential HIV transmissions, and prevent unwanted pregnancies in Africa.\n\nAsk Without Shame offers emergency sex education through an Android mobile app, WhatsApp, phone calls, and SMS. It puts sex education at the fingertips of young people aged between 12 and 35 without judgment or shame.\n\nIt also allows many users to disclose information that they are too embarrassed or afraid to reveal to others. The organisation claims it wants all African youth to have access to the sexuality information they need to make informed sexual decisions.\n\n2. Honey and Banana Connect\n\nAccording to a Guttmacher Institute fact sheet, 15.7 million of Nigeria\u2019s 45 million women of reproductive age (15\u201349 years) want to avoid pregnancy.\n\nIn addition, 61,000 Nigerian women die each year from birth-related complications, abortions, or miscarriages. However, with better access to contraception information, most of these deaths can be avoided.\n\nHoney and Banana Connect claims it\u2019s helping to reduce this number through its call centre \u2014 which can be reached by dialling 55059 \u2014 that provides access to supportive, affordable, and high-quality family planning services.\n\nAfter calling 55059, you will be connected to live agents who will respond to all of your family planning, birth spacing, and contraceptive-related questions.\n\nFor the purpose of this article, I dialled the code to learn more about what they do.\n\nA bot welcomed me before my call was transferred to one of their agents \u2014 whom I\u2019ll call Aramide \u2014 in under 10 seconds.\n\nAramide introduced herself, asked for my name, and wanted to know why I called.\n\nI told her I\u2019d had unprotected sex the previous night and was terrified because it was my first time.\n\nAnd without asking embarrassing questions or judging me, Aramide told me to get Postpill from a pharmacy close to me and use it. I ended the call after telling her my age and where I was calling from.\n\nTo learn more about Postpill, I redialed the code. As I\u2019d hoped, another agent answered; I\u2019ll call him Julius.\n\nJulius told me that the Postpill is an emergency contraception (EC) that prevents pregnancy if taken within 24 hours of having sex. Asked if I could use it before sex, Julius said, \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nAccording to studies, using emergency contraception before having unprotected sex may not provide the best long-term protection because sperm can live inside the body for up to five days after ejaculation.\n\nBecause these drugs only provide the most effective protection for three to five days after sex, having unprotected sex after taking EC means the sperm may outlast the medicine\u2019s most effective window.\n\nSo, taking Postpill after sex is more effective.\n\nFurthermore, he stated that the pill should be taken three times per month but not as regular birth control.\n\nAccording to Honey and Banana Call Centre, callers are guaranteed complete confidentiality and privacy.\n\nIn Nigeria, calls are free on all mobile networks except Glo.\n\n3. Blueheart\n\nBlueheart is a sex therapy app that provides access to sex therapy, helping users overcome sexual dysfunction and have healthy personal relationships.\n\nFounded in 2019 by Sachin Raoul (CEO), Blueheart uses guided audio sessions to help people regain their libido.\n\nRenowned sex therapist, Dr Katherine Hertlein, and Dr Laura Vowels, a specialist in libido and sex drive problems within relationships, provide the information on the app.\n\nBlueheart uses the Sensate Focus technique \u2014 a hybrid of exposure therapy and mindfulness. These methods are known for dealing with a wide range of issues, including sexual health issues.\n\nAvailable in text and audio, Blueheart encompasses thought sessions that focus on sexual fears and anxieties, body sessions that focus on developing a positive relationship with your body \u2014 alone and with a partner \u2014 and connection sessions that focus on communication.\n\n4. Scarleteen\n\nFounded in 1998 by Heather Corrina, Scarleteen answers sex-related questions in a straightforward yet friendly manner. The young-adult-friendly website discusses a wide range of topics such as anatomy, pregnancy and STI prevention, abortion, sexual orientation, and sexual pleasure.\n\nYoung adults can use the online resource to learn about their bodies and health. It\u2019s a place where they can get answers to questions they\u2019d be too embarrassed to ask someone in person.\n\nIt also offers a one-on-one live chat with trained volunteers, extensive articles, and a forum where visitors can talk with people dealing with similar adolescent issues.\n\nThe significance of sexual health cannot be overstated, as it allows people to control their reproductive health and emotional well-being in intimate relationships.\n\nSexual health is an essential component of living a happy life. And prioritising it can improve a person\u2019s emotional, physical, and mental well-being, as well as their intimate relationships.\n\n* \u2013 not real name\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Evercare sees patient influx on rising demand for quality health care",
          "text": "Seven months after it commenced operations, one of Nigeria\u2019s most equipped private healthcare providers, Evercare, is riding on the back of investment in quality service delivery to gain popularity among its increasing number of patients, Ayo Shonibare, the chief medical officer confirmed to BusinessDay.\n\nThe hospital sitting in the centre of Lagos highbrow Lekki is seeing a rise in demand for cutting-edge service from a mix of cash-paying and insured Nigerians, who might have otherwise taken their needs abroad,\n\nAccording to Shonibare, some of the 30,000 Nigerian patients who fly out annually for \u2018world-class\u2019 health services such as advanced cancer care and transplant surgery for various organs have been searching inwards for local substitutes.\n\nWhile the impact of forex shortage on the high cost of getting medical care abroad has made Evercare the go-to place, on the one hand, restrictions due to COVID-19 have also been supportive.\n\nTravel restrictions in top destinations of medical trips from Nigeria have made travelling a tasking exercise.\n\nAfter India was rocked by a dangerous variant that forced a surge in COVID-19 infections and death, travel restrictions were introduced, limiting regular health visits, Tayo Ojuri, managing partner at Aglow Aviation Support Services Limited explained, noting it has been the same for the United Arab Emirates and Europe.\n\nSome of these restrictions meant that even if a Nigerian patient was fully vaccinated here, testing and staying in quarantine was still necessary, deterring very sick people who cannot afford to isolate for weeks before seeing a doctor.\n\nShonibare says the hospital is aware of these needs and working to retain the confidence it has gained within its short while of existing in Nigeria.\n\nWith more than half of its bed capacity occupied, one of the things working for the hospital is how it has managed to pool multi-specialties and numerous health services under a roof.\n\nRead Also: \u2018Telemedicine will increase Nigerians access to premium healthcare\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s still uncommon in Nigeria\u2019s private medical practice for a facility to host nearly 40 subspecialists, all working full-time to deliver patient-centric care. And at their call are tools, including full imaging machines, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan, mammography, dialysis, chemotherapy, physiotherapy and rehabilitation and laboratory.\n\n\u201cPatients require round-the-clock attention to ensure that they get the best clinical outcomes. So we are doing a lot in continuous training and education, changing people\u2019s mindset about patient-centric care,\u201d Shonibare said\n\n\u201cWhat we have also done is our pricing is discounted compared to our competitors. We want to improve access to as many people as possible. We are also putting processes in place to ensure that people follow guidelines to get the best for the patient\u201d\n\nManaged by TPG Capital, the Evercare Hospital is owned by Evercare Health Fund, comprised of some leading development finance institutions and other impact investors.\n\nIt is a part of the Evercare Group which operates across Africa and Asia, with a portfolio of 29 hospitals, 16 clinics, and more than 75 diagnostic centres.\n\nThe 165-bed multi-specialty private hospital touts itself as an institution resourced to function in a broad range of specialties from interventional cardiology to neonatal intensive care.\n\nIt\u2019s equipped with a 22-bed intensive care unit, possibly the largest in the nation, and 4 negative pressure Isolation Rooms, as well as a Spect CT scan.\n\nThis is a time when investors in local healthcare are clamouring for import duty waivers for medical equipment.\n\nSetting up specialist practices in Nigeria often requires importing diagnostic equipment that gulps high costs worsened by the volatile foreign exchange rate and import duty level.\n\nIndustry analysts say these are signs that Nigeria\u2019s ambition to cut a substantial part of the luxurious bill on medical tourism annually is realistic, although more effort has to go into widening access.\n\nFemi Olugbile, former health commissioner in Lagos says the government needs to design practical ways to multiply the number of Nigerians under the national health insurance scheme to expand access to care.\n\nAccording to Olugbile, leaving less than 10 percent of the entire population covered is a major challenge that can eventually affect the thriving of private healthcare investments such as Evercare.\n\n\u201cIt is a journey, not an event. It will just make people work harder to remove the access barrier so that all the people who actually need care can access it irrespective of the size of their pocket. And there will be more Evercares that can be run sustainably in different parts of the country,\u201d Olugbile said.",

          "title": "Higher oil prices fail to plug trade deficit as in 2019",
          "text": "Unlike in 2019, higher crude oil prices in 2021 have failed to lift Nigeria\u2019s one and half years\u2019 trade deficit out of the negative due to what analysts blame on stagnating oil production and the country\u2019s increasing dependence on imported goods.\n\nNigeria\u2019s trade balance took a turn for the worse in the first half of 2021 as imports surged and the trade deficit hit N5.81 trillion, according to the latest foreign trade report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nAfrica\u2019s largest economy exported goods worth N7.99 trillion in the review period, 72.72 percent less than its total import value of N13.8 trillion, the highest since the NBS started collating publishing the data.\n\n\u201cDespite these relatively high crude oil prices, trade will remain negative because import continues to outpace our export,\u201d Laolu Boboye, an economist at Cardinal Stones said.\n\nAs long as Nigeria is not self-sufficient in some key imports, Boboye said the economy will continue to \u201cimport more which would be outpacing exports.\u201d\n\nThe decline in Nigeria\u2019s import value in the third quarter of 2019 that led to a trade surplus of N1.3trn (125 percent higher than the previous quarter) was primarily due to the quarter-on-quarter decreases recorded in the importation of agricultural products, raw materials and solid minerals.\n\nNigeria\u2019s persistent foreign trade deficit continues to pile more pressure on the exchange rate as negative trade dampens the country\u2019s current account position and foreign reserves.\n\nWhile 2021 crude price has increased to over $83 per barrel, higher than the $62 reported in 2019, Nigeria\u2019s low oil production at 1.45 million barrels per day in September (1.79mb/d in 2019) is one of the key drivers of the country\u2019s persistent trade deficit, analysts said.\n\nNigeria has had an incessant report of production shortening and declaration of false majeure at major export terminals that have realised production losses for the country, according to Seun Arambada, investment research associate, Meristem Securities.\n\n\u201cSo while we can produce more oil by OPEC quota, production losses arising from the factors mentioned earlier capped oil prices. This explains why we are experiencing a deficit,\u201d said Arambada.\n\nNigeria\u2019s crude oil production has been languishing at only two-thirds of its full capacity this year, especially many of its large oil fields in the Niger Delta.\n\nKey Nigerian grade, Forcados, had been disrupted for almost a month until Shell lifted the force majeure on loadings on September 10. Industry sources say the suspension of exports was due to an oil spill near the Forcados terminal.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria\u2019s trade sector turns positive after 8 quarters of negative growth\n\nOther Nigerian crudes such as Bonny Light, Escravos, and Qua Iboe have also faced production issues in recent months due to operational and technical reasons.\n\n\u201cThroughout 2021, we\u2019ve struggled to achieve less than 1.3 million bpd, which is abysmal for a country depending on crude oil revenues to feed over 200 million people,\u201d Kelvin Atafiri who runs Cavazanni Human Capital Limited, an investment firm exposed to the oil and gas sector, states.\n\nEfforts to diversify the economy are yet to materialise and reflect substantially in the country\u2019s international trade numbers.\n\nA cursory look at the data showed that crude oil still accounted for 90 percent of Nigeria\u2019s export value in the first half of 2021, after multiple investments in other sectors of the economy to ensure local production, especially in the agricultural sector.\n\nNigeria\u2019s top imports were motor spirit, otherwise known as petrol, durum wheat, used vehicles, antibiotics, gas oil and machines. Petrol imports gulped N1.47 trillion between January and June 2021, followed by durum wheat with N583.02 billion; used vehicles valued at N498.94 billion, other antibiotics (N480.98 billion), gas oil (N273.41 billion), and machines for reception (N261.73 billion).\n\nAlthough the trade balance is still in the negative, data from NBS show it has been trending downwards. Nigeria\u2019s trade deficit declined by 52.6 percent quarter-on-quarter to N1.9 trillion in Q2-2021 from N3.9 trillion in Q1-2021.\n\nAnalysis of Nigeria\u2019s Foreign Trade in Goods Statistics report by NBS for Q2-2021 revealed that total merchandise trade grew 23.3 percent quarter-on-quarter and 88.7 percent year-on-year to N12.0 trillion from N9.8 trillion in Q1-2021 and N6.4 trillion in Q2-2020. The increase was due to a sharp growth (74.7% q/q) in the value of export compared to N2.9 trillion in Q1-2021 and 128.3 percent year-on-year compared to Q2- 2020.\n\nAs a result, export totalled N5.1 trillion, accounting for 42.2% (Q1-2021: 29.8%) of the entire trade component, while import was valued at N7.0tn accounting for 57.8 percent (Q1-2021: 70.2%) of total trade.\n\nThe surge in export proceeds was driven by higher crude oil exports, which grew 111.3 percent quarter-on-quarter and 164.4 percent year-on-year to N4.1 trillion in Q2-2021 from N1.9 trillion and N1.6trillion in Q1-2021 and Q2-2020, respectively, accounting for 80.3 percent of total export trade.\n\n\u201cYou will notice that deficit has been moderating compared to what we had in the previous quarter, that will explain the role of higher oil prices,\u201d Arambada said.\n\nThe surge in crude oil receipts was broadly driven by higher oil prices with average Brent price printing at $69.1/b in Q2-2021, 106.9 percent y/y and 12.7percent q/q higher than $33.4/b and $61.3/b in Q2-2020 and Q1-2021.",

          "text": "Over 40 million young Nigerians under 29 years could abandon furthering their higher education to join the informal sector over worsening poverty on the continent by 2030, a new World Bank report has said.\n\nThe report titled \u2018Good Jobs for a New Generation: Delivering Quality Jobs for Young Nigerians After COVID-19\u2019, said about 19.7 million will engage in household agriculture, 13 million in non-farm household enterprises, and 3.9 million holding wage jobs.\n\nThis could worsen poverty on the continent as informal sector jobs are unlikely to offer secure pathways out of poverty, the report said.\n\n\u201cMost farms are not commercialized and lack access to key inputs, so farming may not generate the earning needing to lift Nigerians out of poverty and non-farm enterprises are similarly small scale,\u201d Jonathan Lain, Economist at World Bank and one of the authors said at the media briefing of the report that took place on Thursday.\n\nLain further said that these labour patterns reflect the slow pace of structural transformations in Nigeria.\n\nOver 90.1 million Nigerians are now living in extreme poverty, up from 82.9 million three years ago; according to the World Poverty Clock. It makes a mockery of the Buhari government\u2019s plan to lift 100 million people out of poverty by 2030.\n\nThe World Bank findings relied on the Nigeria General Household Survey-Panel (GHS) and the COVID-19 National Longitudinal Phone Survey (NLPS) to draw its conclusions.\n\n\u201cYouth responded to both the 2016 oil recession and Covid-19 crises by leaving school earlier to enter the labor market, thus increasing overall labor supply. Rising labor supply amid chronic job shortages have further widened precarity and informality in Nigeria\u2019s labor market,\u201d the report stated.\n\nLeaving school early to find work could affect the country\u2019s human capital stock, notably through declines in educational attainment, the report said.\n\nIt added that the continued underinvestment in human capital may keep Nigeria from harnessing the economic potential of its young population through two main channels: weakening workforce productivity and slowing any fertility transition.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s economy to grow on oil boost but won\u2019t outpace poverty\n\nNigeria\u2019s economy has slumped into two recessions within the past five years owing to the collapse of oil prices, disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and an inability of the government to reform the economy.\n\nThe contractions have weakened consumers\u2019 purchasing power, throwing millions into poverty and now precipitating a rush to the job market with limited skills.\n\nAccording to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), headline inflation, which serves as a measure of consumer prices, rose by 17 percent in August 2021 while Nigeria\u2019s unemployment rate came to 33.3 percent in 2020.\n\nThe report said that between 2015/16 and 2018/19, the share of working-age Nigerians who were working increased from 60.8 percent to 67.3 percent, while the share of young Nigerians who were working jumped even more, from 38.6 percent to 50.7 percent.\n\nIt also stated that by February 2021, the share of working-age Nigerians who were working was significantly higher than would be expected, given previous seasonal patterns.\n\nTo test the report\u2019s conclusions, BusinessDay sampled the opinion of several young people engaged in menial jobs and found that poverty is the biggest motivation for the leap into the job market even with limited skill sets.\n\nDaniel Ekurume, a 20-year-old domestic worker said he had no plans to attend a university immediately after graduating secondary school three years ago.\n\n\u201cBeing the first child of my family, I have a lot of responsibilities at home. My father abandoned us when we were young, so as the man of the house I just have to do my part to support my family,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, 23- year old Survival Gabriel, who was unable to finish secondary unlike Ekurume said he engages menial jobs.\n\n\u201cMy father is sick, so he is unable to work, while the proceeds from my mother\u2019s catering business is not enough to take care of four kids,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NBS data shows that there are 69.7 million people in the labour market, out of which 30.6 million between the ages of 15-34 are fully employed.\n\nA further breakdown of the 30.6 million employed shows the most employed persons are those with Senior School Certificate Examination (9.7million) followed by no education (8.4million) and First School Leaving Certificate (4.2million).\n\n\u201cThe economic situation in the country has affected the capacity to retain jobs, create new jobs and sustain people in schools, thereby aggravating the high unemployment crisis,\u201d said Muda Yusuf, former director-general, Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI).\n\nThe World Bank recommends more investments in human capital, recouping learning opportunities lost during the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nThis will not only provide workers with the skills needed to prosper in the labor market and create jobs themselves but could also foster an improved standard of living for Nigerians, the report said.\n\nThe report also called for macroeconomic reforms to the exchange rate, trade, and fiscal policies to diversify revenue sources away from oil and ignite the structural transformation needed to create good wage jobs.\n\nIt is also called rendering help to small enterprises so they can thrive and grow. For farms, this involves research into improved crop and livestock varieties as well as public investment to support storage, transport, and market access could help boost agricultural productivity, the World Bank report said.\n\nFor non-farm enterprises, it called for policies that will loosen credit constraints and build the infrastructure and markets on which small businesses rely could bolster productivity, profits, and job creation.\n\n\u201cEvidence-based policy action in these areas can help ensure good jobs are available, enabling Nigeria to seize the demographic dividend of its young population and lay strong foundations for future inclusive growth,\u201d Tara Vishwanath, Lead Economist at World Bank and author of the report advised.",

          "text": "The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Friday withdrew its suit seeking the forfeiture of the N20billion bailout funds granted to the Kogi State Government by Sterling Bank.\n\nThe money was meant for the payment of Kogi State workers, but was alleged to have been, instead, domiciled in an interest yielding account with the bank.\n\nJustice Chukwujekwu Aneke granted the order of withdrawal sequel to a motion filed and argued by the counsel to EFCC, Kemi Pinheiro, SAN.\n\nMr Pinheiro listed six grounds upon which the judge granted the prayer, adding that \u201cthe EFCC is a responsible body\u201d.\n\nOne of the grounds was that questions resulting in the commencement of the suit had been clarified, and an intention had been shown to return the sum of N19,333,333,333.36 back to the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nJustice Tijjani Ringim had on August 31, granted an ex-parte application brought by the EFCC for an interim forfeiture of the N19, 333, 333, 333.36 billion, said to be warehoused in state\u2019s Sterling Bank account number 0073572696.\n\nJustice Ringim made the order of the interim forfeiture after taken arguments from the EFCC\u2019s counsel, Abbas Muhammed.\n\nThe judge ruled that the order was pending the conclusion of an investigation or possible prosecution by the EFCC.\n\nWhen the matter came up on September 28 before Justice Aneke, he adjourned to hear all applications relating to the loan.\n\nAt the resumption of proceedings Friday, Mr Pinheiro presented the EFCC\u2019s grounds for discontinuance as contained in an October 13, 2021 application.\n\nThe application titled \u2018Notice of discontinuance\u2019 stated the grounds for the discontinuance: \u201cThat the account upon which this Suit was instituted was frozen by an Order of this Honourable Court.\n\n\u201cThat the Management of Sterling Bank Plc, where account No 0073572696 with the name KOGI STATE SALARY BAIL OUT ACCOUNT is domiciled, has clarified the questions resulting to the commencement of this suit.\n\n\u201cThat the management of Sterling Bank Plc, where account No 0073572696 with the name KOGI STATE SALARY BAIL OUT ACCOUNT is domiciled, has since acknowledged the existence of the said account in their book but claimed same was a mirror account.\n\n\u201cThat the sum of N19,333,333,333.36 is still standing in the credit of the account frozen pursuant to the Order of this Honourable Court.\n\n\u201cThat the management of Sterling Bank Plc, where account No 0073572696 is domiciled, has pursuant to a letter dated 21st September, 2021, signed by its Managing Director indicated intention to return the total sum of N19,333,333,333.36 back to the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThat it is expedient for the instant suit to be discontinued and the account unfrozen to enable the management of Sterling Bank Plc, effect the transfer/return of the sum of N19,333,333,333.36 back to the coffer of the Central Bank of Nigeria where the said bailout funds was disbursed.\u201d\n\nGranting the EFCC\u2019s application, Justice Aneke said he had listened to the application and perused the motion to withdraw.\n\n\u201cMy humble opinion is that application is meritorious and ought to be granted.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the application is granted as prayed.\u201d\n\nCounsel to the Kogi State Government, Sam Erogbo (SAN), commended the EFCC for its \u201cprofessional approach\u201d.\n\nHe prayed the court that the interim forfeiture order earlier granted should be vacated, for the purpose of clarity.\n\nBut the judge declined, noting that the EFCC was \u201cvery clear in their motion to withdraw, which is clearly established in paragraph 6.\u201d",

The other day I was at the National assembly, I informed the senate that we were 95 percent ready for 5G.

We have been working on it for some months now and the goal is to see how we can upgrade every healthcare operator from manual record keeping to a digital system.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, Sterling Bank has always felt that one of the challenges facing the healthcare sector is the lack of proper documentation or inability to keep suitable records of operations. This state of affairs has made it difficult for financial institutions to examine the books of healthcare practitioners in a transparent manner, he said.\n\nUkachukwu said, \u201cWith HFN being the umbrella body for all the serious healthcare professionals in the country, it is better to partner with the group to drive a process like this because it is an accountability group that could help members learn from one another.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are trying to introduce transparency which will enable HFN members to have access to finance at different levels and we are optimistic that this would help scale up the industry.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Dr. Pamela Ajayi, President of HFN who commended Sterling Bank for its commitment to the healthcare industry, remarked that the bank has been involved in the sector for more than 20 years ago through Magnum Trust Bank, which invested in a company she founded as an SME. Magnum Trust is one of the legacy banks that formed Sterling Bank during the consolidation in the banking industry.\n\nShe described the MoU as another step in the right direction and a huge step for all healthcare practitioners because the terms that Sterling Bank is giving them are exceptional. The terms would ensure that HFN members will be able to achieve their objectives through this funding, she said.\n\nDr. Ajayi, who is the founder and CEO of Synlab Nigeria, noted that the digitisation aspect of the MoU is useful in so many ways because apart from increasing access to finance, it would also help with the health outcomes in line with global trends because every healthcare provider that is digitally inclined would remain in business for long.\n\nDr. Ajayi who explained the mechanics of the MoU, said what HFN is trying to achieve is to make it easier for members that qualify to have access to finance at good interest rates and speed up their investments.\n\nAccording to her, HFN is also interested in ensuring that members take full advantage of Sterling Bank\u2019s drive to give opportunities to healthcare providers so that they can gain access to ERM and HMS systems while also benefitting from financial advisory services provided by the bank",

          "text": "Ahead of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Convention slated for 30th and 31st October, the northern stakeholders unanimously adopted former President of the Senate Dr Iyorchia Ayu as their consensus candidate for the position of national chairman.\n\nBefore this, the North Central stakeholders drawn from Kogi, Niger, Kwara, Plateau, Benue states and Federal Capital Territory, had Tuesday, at Benue state Governor\u2019s Lodge in Abuja, unanimously adopted Ayu as their consensus candidate for the position of national chairman.\n\nChairman of PDP zoning committee and governor of Enugu state, Mr Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, last week recommended that \u201c\u2026the current offices being held by officers in the Southern Zones of the country, namely, South West, South East and South-South zones, should swap places with the offices currently in the northern zones of Nigeria, namely, North West, North East and North Central zones.\u201d\n\nGoing by the committee\u2019s recommendation, whosoever emerges consensus candidate of the North may become the next national chairman of the opposition party.\n\nBlueprint gathered that after Wednesday\u2019s stalemate at the northern stakeholders\u2019 meeting due to what a source called communication gap, the governors and other leaders reconvened to take a firm decision on the aspiration of former Katsina state Governor Ibrahim Shema, outgoing PDP deputy national chairman north, Senator Sulieman Nazif and former Senate President Ayu.\n\nAfter a few hours\u2019 meeting at Bauchi state Governor\u2019s Lodge, Abuja Thursday, Chairman Convention Planning Committee who also doubles as Chairman 20-man committees on Northern Consensus candidate, Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri declared Ayu as the north\u2019s candidate for the position of national chairman.\n\nFintri revealed that other aspirants from other zones willingly stepped down for Ayu.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is no vanquished, there is no victor in this meeting. We all came out united. Out of the three northern candidates that all the three zones produced, the candidates themselves in the spirit of unity and togetherness, in the spirit of ensuring that PDP emerges and benefits from our efforts, so that we can win together for a Nigerians the 2023 general elections, stepped down.\n\n\u201cDistinguished Senator Dr Iyorchia Ayu has emerged as a consensus candidate of the north. With this, we are fully prepared, we are ready. We will be talking with our colleagues from other parts of the country, especially the south that they see reasons for this consensus candidate and give us support during the 30 and 31 convention of PDP.\u201d\n\nThe Adamawa state governor also added that \u201d all of them were immensely qualified but through discussion and reconciliation, we have emerged with consensus list that was endorsed by the candidates themselves. There was no election and there was no selection.\u201d\n\nWinning ways back \u2013 Ayu\n\nAccepting the task, Ayu, a former minister of industry assured party faithful that PDP would be back to its winning ways.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is my singular honour to accept the responsibilities which has been put on my shoulders from the North. I believe that at the end of the day, it will not only be the North, but it will be all Nigerians. The PDP will be back to its winning ways. And we will work tirelessly after the convention to rebuild the party to take over power to rebuild the country.\n\n\u201cI believe all Nigerians want a PDP government. Our 16 years moved this country forward. We intend to work together with all the leaders, not only in the North but across the country to reposition this country for the next generation of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nSenator Ayu said if elected party chairman, his leadership \u201cwill be an all-inclusive administration of the party. We will work collectively to produce policies which will be acceptable to all Nigerians. Today, our currency is the weakest in the world. Even the Somalians are better than us in Africa. We will work to solve hard to solve the issue of insecurity.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the leaders of the North, who are united, determined and who are willing to work with me. I am a foundation member of this party. I worked in the party before, but I know that you cannot do it alone.\n\n\u201cWe shall work as a team. And I believe with the support of Nigerians who have suffered in the hands of a party that does not exist, of a party that does not care for the youths of Nigeria, of a party that doesn\u2019t care for anybody but themselves, the victory, we shall achieve and administer to this country to the greater glory of God.\u201d\n\nS/west chapter in disarray\n\nHowever, it was a different scenario in the south-west chapter of the party, as stakeholders and leaders slugged it out with the Oyo state governor, Engr. Seyi Makinde, over national offices.\n\nBlueprint gathered that the south micro-zoned the party\u2019s deputy national chairman (South), National Publicity Secretary and Deputy National Secretary to the south-west.\n\nOur correspondent gathered that the governor was allegedly determined to ensure his loyalists occupy all the offices micro-zoned to south-west.\n\nBut former governor of Ekiti state, Ayo Fayose and other stakeholders, said our sources, \u201crejected the move.\u201d\n\nAlthough the source was silent on time and venue of the meeting, the parley may have held in Ibadan.\n\nBlueprint also observed that though the stakeholders do not have issues with the distribution of offices zoned to the south-west; but they are not happy with the alleged move by Makinde to impose former Osun state governor, Olagunsoye Oyinlola on them as deputy national chairman.\n\nA source who is also one of the leaders in the zone who does not want his name in print, explained that rewarding Oyinlola with \u201csuch a lofty position\u201d in the NWC means that party loyalty is a vice, not a virtue.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe in the Osun state chapter of our party prefer Professor Wale Oladipo as deputy national chairman (South) of our great party. When Oyinlola left the PDP to team up with like-minds to bring President Muhammadu Buhari on us, others stayed put to rebuild the party. One of such persons is Professor Oladipo. He replaced Oyinlola as National Secretary of the PDP.\n\n\u201cWe gathered that even his colleague governors are not happy with his dictatorial dispositions. Let me put it this way that we are not fighting the governor. No one raised a voice about how positions zoned to the region were distributed, but we don\u2019t want Oyinlola. As a listening leader that we think he is, the governor should listen to us and do the needful,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Inspector General of Police Usman Baba has deployed 34,587 police personnel and three helicopters as a major security measure to guarantee safe, secure, and credible electoral process in the November 6 governorship election in Anambra state.\n\nHe also warned subversive elements bent on employing violence as well as political actors who may want to adopt undemocratic and illegal means to achieve their aspiration to bury such thoughts or be prepared to face the wrath of the law, no matter how highly placed.\n\nThe IGP disclosed this Thursday at the Force Headquarters in Abuja while speaking during the second strategic police managers\u2019 conference comprising Commissioners of Police (CP) and above.\n\nBaba, who said the meeting was a follow up to a similar session with Squadron Commanders on the upcoming election, noted that the Police was \u201cfirmly committed to partner with the INEC with the dictates of the Electoral Act towards delivering a credible electoral process and outcome.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn electoral security threat analysis has been conducted by the Force Intelligence Bureau and based on the outcome of this initiative, we have developed a strategic election security operation order which involves the mobilisation and deployment of 34,587 personnel.\n\n\u201cThis will comprise of conventional police officers; Police Mobile Force (PMF); Counter Terrorisms Unit (CTU); special forces personnel; Explosive Ordinance Unit (EOD); Force Intelligence Bureau (FBI), INTERPOL; Special Protection Unit (SPU); as well as police medical teams.\n\n\u201cWe will also be deploying three police helicopter for aerial surveillance as well as detachments of marine police operatives; specially trained Force animals; and our unique technical intelligence capacity towards guaranteeing a safe, secure and credible electoral process in the state.\n\n\u201cDrawing from our previous election security operations, we have also emplaced adequate forward and reverse logistics arrangement to address the welfare needs of all personnel being deployed for operations,\u201d the police boss said.\n\nHe further said: \u201cThe years is gradually winding down and as the lead internal security agency, I must remind you all of your critical roles in projecting nd strengthening the security architecture in Commands towards ensuring that anticipated security threats are prevented in the most professional and proactive manner.\n\n\u201c\u2026To compliment your efforts, I can assure you that we shall soon launch a s deploy new fleet of patrol vehicles and other operational assets which are being procured through the intervention of the Police Trust Fund (PTF) to re-energise the safer highway patrol scheme and strengthen your operations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are also initiating certain actions that are directed at addressing specific issues that impact on our professional output. In this regard, in the course of my recent duty tours, I have noticed, as well as received complaints on the poor and inhabitants state of most police barracks.\n\n\u201cIn response to this, the Force leadership is currently working with the Federal government and PFT as well as taking full advantage of the Public Private Partnership (PPP) window towards redeveloping our barracks and establishing new affordable housing estates for all cadre of Police personnel.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we are working at modernising our police stations across the country, both in terms of architectural design, furnishing, and operational protocols. In this regard, we have developed a model police station architectural design which will be constructed across all the states of the federation in replacement to the existing outdated police stations, most of which are no longer fit for purpose.\n\n\u201cImplementation of this project will soon commence and the initiative is to create a purpose-built, friendly and befitting working environment for police operations in the spirit of community policing a d to start giving practical effect to our vision of modernising the NPF,\u201d Baba added.\n\nSoludo APGA candidate \u2013 S/Court\n\nIn a related development, the Supreme Court Thursday affirmed former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Professor Charles Chukwuma Soludo as the governorship candidate of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA).\n\nThe apex court also returned Chief Victor Oye as the party\u2019s national chairman.\n\nIn its judgment, a 5-man panel of Justices dismissed the appeal filed by Mr Jude Okeke on the ground of being an abuse of court process and lacking in merit and substance.\n\nWhile delivering the lead judgment, Justice Mary Odili awarded a sum of one million naira against Jude Okeke to be paid to both APGA and Oye.\n\nJustice Odili equally upheld the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Kano division which had earlier dismissed the suit filed Okeke.\n\nThe Court of Appeal had earlier dismissed the Jigawa High Court\u2019s decisions, saying it lacked jurisdiction over the matter and should there be set aside.\n\nJustice Odili noted that the appellants, in the desperate bid to abuse the court process, moved their cases from Anambra state to Imo and later to Jigawa state where they eventually got judgment in their favour March 31, 2021.\n\nThe Jigawa High Court judgment delivered in March was also voided and set aside by the Court of Appeal, Kano Division March 8, 2021 on the ground that the high court of Jigawa lacked jurisdiction to have entertained the suit.\n\nIn its ruling, the apex court lambasted the appellants for engaging in forum shopping.\n\n\u201cThis amounts to crass abuse of court process an attempt to get favourable judgment to suit your own purposes.\n\n\u201cOkeke and some other lawyers out there should stop misleading the court through multiple cases over the same subject matters,\u201d Odili held further.\n\nConsequently, the sum of one million naira was slammed as fine against Jude Okeke to be paid to APGA and Victor Oye.\n\nThe Supreme Court also agreed that the election of officers of political officers was an internal affair of respective parties and cannot be challenged in court.\n\nADP urges INEC\n\nMeanwhile, the national leadership of the Action Democratic Party (ADP) has asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to adopt electronic transmission of results in the forthcoming governorship election in Anambra state.\n\nThe opposition party also expressed support for the Senate on the direct primaries decision by all the political parties.\n\nADP national chairman, Engr. Yabagi Sani, said this Thursday in Abuja while inaugurating the party\u2019s campaign council for the governorship candidate in Anambra state\n\nHe said the adoption of direct primaries is a victory for democracy, adding that all members of the party will now have opportunity to participate in the selection of candidates.\n\nAccording to Engr. Sani, \u201cthe ADP wishes to call on the federal government, all other stakeholders particularly, the security agencies not only to ensure that the governorship election in Anambra state is conducted as scheduled on the 6th of November, 2021.\n\n\u201cThere must not be any compromise, all impediments in the way of a hitch-free exercise, must be cleared so that the wishes of the people prevail at the end of the day. The waves of honest and positive change blowing across the entire country have engulfed the shores of Anambra State and, shall we warn that, the consequences of trying to stop the tide, will be fruitless and counterproductive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish to seize this opportunity to congratulate the Independent Electoral Commission, INEC, on its historic victory over the debacle with the National Assembly on the issue of electronic transmission of election results. Most certainly, the courage demonstrated by the leadership of INEC under Prof. Mahmood Yakubu has in no small measures, reinforced the confidence of Nigerians in the possibilities for the conduct of credible elections in the country in times ahead.\n\n\u201cThis is particularly so when cognisance is given to the immense intimidation, arm-twisting and threats from retrogressive agents of anachronism, enemies of democracy, free and fair elections who will want the nation to continue in the old ways that provide them the rooms to manipulate and rape the people of their inalienable and fundamental rights of electing their political leaders in a democracy.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, the ADP emphatically demanding that the electoral body to test-run the electronic transfer of votes in the forthcoming Anambra Gubernatorial election.\n\n\u201cFor its courage of biting the humble pie by retracting its initial unpopular and reactionary stance on the e-transfer of votes from poling units, the ADP wishes to commend the Senate for listening, for once, to the voice of reason.\n\n\u201cOur party is calling on members of the House of Representatives to emulate the latest decision of our Senators in the process of amending the Electoral Act. In the same vein, the ADP is expressing the hope that the Bill will receive assent of the President without much delay,\u201d the ADP stated.",

Aviation is also capable of stimulating recovery and growth of the global economy by acting as an enabler and multiplier of economic activity\u201d.\n\n\u201cConsidering that the global aviation industry operates as an interconnected ecosystem, it is therefore imperative that all the States of the world implement the ICAO Council Aviation Recovery Taskforce (CART) recommendations and guidance, which are based on the latest development of the COVID-19.\n\n\u201cICAO, in collaboration with relevant stakeholders, is required to bring to maturity in short term a consensual modality for establishment and deployment of a global health passport as well as the specification of infrastructure (soft/hard) and training of professionals,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Thursday tasked states to think out of the box in raising their respective Internally Generated Revenues.\n\nHe made the remark at the maiden edition of Ekiti State\u2019s maiden investment forum in Ado-Ekiti.\n\n\u201cThinking differently, there is a need for a sub-national to think like a sovereign State,\u201d the Vice President said.\n\n\u201cYou have a bigger GDP and even more revenues than many nations. There is a different mindset when you are sure of a monthly allocation of cash at least enough to pay salaries, whether you generate income or not. This is the challenge. The so-called Dutch disease, one becomes complacent.\n\n\u201cBut what if you had to take responsibility for all those who reside within your borders, pay all salaries, from internally generated revenue?\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Sanwo-Olu, El-Rufai, Other Governors Call For State Police\n\nThe VP recalled how Lagos State improved its IGR from N600million monthly in 1999/2000 to about N45billion today. He said the illegal seizure of the allocations to the State by the then Federal Government was the shock that forced the state to rethink.\n\nSpeaking further, Prof. Osinbajo noted that although a state within a Federation is not a nation, it must behave like one, to further boost its economic development.\n\n\u201cThe economy of the sub-national is a peculiar animal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe state within the Federation is not a nation, but it must behave like one, it derives some resources from the Federal pool, and generates some income, the overall sum will provide infrastructure and services to the community. The size of the sum and the quantum of opportunity available to provide livelihoods for the populace will depend on how the State enables local and external investors, small and large to put their resources into business and commercial activity business in the State.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThe funded portion of the state\u2019s budget is after all a mere fraction of the sum total of economic activity or income-generating activity, formal or informal within the State. So, the attractiveness of a state to commerce is a radical issue.\u201d\n\nHe asserted that \u201cthe very lives and livelihoods of the people within the borders of the State, whether the people will live prosperous and happy lives, be educated, have access to affordable medical care, depends on it.\u201d\n\nPrivate sector-led\n\nSimilarly, Prof. Osinbajo highlighted how Federal and State governments can benefit from a private-sector led economy, noting that the private sector-led model is the right way to go, as \u201cbusiness is the business of the private sector, while governments should as much as possible facilitate, or at best, collaborate.\n\n\u201cAn excellent example is the formerly State-Owned, Ikun Dairy Farms at Ikun Ekiti. After 40 years of inactivity, the State Government divested 76% of its shareholding to a private dairy company, Promasidor, resulting in a company that is now producing over 80,000 liters of milk per month from a herd of about 500 cows.\n\n\u201cThere is also the recent concessioning of hospitality facilities such as the iconic Ikogosi Warm Springs, affirming the same principle (of collaboration). This is a very important principle, the idea that it is the private sector that really should lead the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nScience and Tech\n\nStates must find ways to harness the potential of their people through STEM education in order to become a more attractive destination for investors, noting that the key to the knowledge economy is education, he declared.\n\n\u201cGone are the days when you could argue that you should be an attractive destination for investment because you have cheap labour. Today, well-trained technology and innovation talent is the game-changer.\n\n\u201cIt would therefore be very important for Ekiti State to leverage its famed love and passion for education by focusing on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.\n\n\u201cSTEM education is vital for being able to participate in the 4th Industrial Revolution which is at once a digital age and a knowledge age. This must be the Fountain of the Knowledge Economy,\u201d referencing the State\u2019s alias.\n\nHe went on: \u201cthe importance of having a pool of healthy, well-trained workers such as electricians, fitters, mechanics, laboratory technicians, welders, machine toolists, and even web designers, is vital for an ecosystem that will be attractive for technology and innovation investments\n\nThriving Ekiti\n\nIn the same vein, the Vice President commended the State Government for establishing the foundations for a modern and thriving economy.\n\nProf. Osinbajo also pointed out the State\u2019s business-friendly environment, having ranked 18th overall out of the 36 States and the FCT in the inaugural edition of Nigeria\u2019s \u201cSubnational Ease of Doing Business Baseline Survey.\u201d\n\nEkiti State also had the highest score amongst all the States in the Technical and Professional Skills category of the Ease of Doing Business Rankings, he noted.\n\nAccording to the VP, \u201cthe fundamentals are there; a modern, strong, consistently improving legal and Justice sector. Ekiti State was strongest in the Skills and Labour and Infrastructure and Security indicators where it had an average score of 5.35 and 5.05, respectively.\n\n\u201cThis is a State that has vast arable land for agriculture and its value chains, a modern, strong, and effective media and public communications system, an experienced CEO of the State, Governor Fayemi, whose academic, civil society background, excellent relationships with international donors and DFIs, his experience as second term Governor, one-time Minister of Mines and Steel, and as Chair of Governors\u2019 Forum whose important experience in extracting benefits for the States from the Federal Government, all put the State at a distinct advantage.\u201d\n\nPointing to yet another area of strength, Prof. Osinbajo said \u201cfor example, there is tremendous potential for the development of a whole medical education and healthcare industry around the huge private investment in the iconic Afe Babalola University and the ABUAD multi-system Teaching Hospital. I know that the State was helpful in providing access roads and some other facilities to the campus.\n\n\u201cMany countries of the world do not have the number of medical talents assembled in that hospital alone. There are huge opportunities here and I believe that we must tap into those opportunities also.\u201d",

          "text": "Lebanon is holding a day of mourning after six people died and dozens were hurt in some of the worst violence for years in the capital, Beirut.\n\nGunfire broke out on Thursday during a protest by Shia Muslim groups against the judge investigating last year\u2019s huge blast at the city\u2019s port.\n\nHezbollah, which organised the protest, says demonstrators were fired on by gunmen on rooftops.\n\nThey blamed a Christian faction, although the group denies the charge.\n\nHuge tension surrounds the inquiry into the port explosion that killed 219 in August 2020.\n\nSwathes of the city were devastated by the blast, but no-one has yet been held accountable.\n\nHezbollah and its allies say the investigating judge is biased, but the victims\u2019 families support his work.\n\nWhat began as a protest outside the Palace of Justice \u2013 the main court building \u2013 by hundreds of people arguing the investigation had become politicised and demanding the removal of Judge Tarek Bitar quickly escalated.\n\nCivilians evacuate homes during clashes in the area of Tayouneh, in the southern suburb of the capital Beirut on October 14, 2021\n\nHeavy gunfire erupted in the streets as the crowd passed through a roundabout in the central Tayouneh-Badaro area.\n\nLocal residents had to flee their homes and schoolchildren ducked for cover under their desks as men armed with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers \u2013 believed to have been members of Shia and Christian militias \u2013 exchanged fire in the streets.\n\nAt a nearby school, teachers instructed young children to lie face down on the ground with their hands on their heads, a witness told Reuters news agency.\n\nThe clashes continued for several hours before calm was restored.\n\nHospital and military sources said some of those killed had been shot in the head. They included a woman who was hit by a stray bullet while inside her home.\n\nThe streets around Tayouneh are still thickly carpeted with shattered glass after hours of gun and rocket fire.\n\nSome families who live there left their homes last night in case violence flared again.\n\nPresident Aoun said it wasn\u2019t acceptable for arms to return as communication between the Lebanese parties. But these divisions run deep.\n\nShia politicians accuse the presiding judge Tarek Bitar of bias.\n\nBut families of those who died in the port blast died back him, saying MPs are trying to evade justice.\n\nFor now there\u2019s an uneasy truce.

It later said it had arrested nine people \u201cfrom both sides, including a Syrian\u201d.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, a court dismissed a legal complaint brought by two former government ministers and Amal MPs \u2013 Ali Hassan Khalil and Ghazi Zaiter \u2013 whom Judge Bitar has sought to question on suspicion of negligence in connection with the port explosion.\n\nThe two men, who deny any wrongdoing, accused the judge of bias.\n\nFamilies of the victims had condemned the complaint, which caused the inquiry to be suspended for the second time in three weeks.\n\nThey have accused the country\u2019s political leadership of trying to shield itself from scrutiny.\n\n\u201cKeep your hands off the judiciary,\u201d they warned the cabinet on Wednesday after ministers allied to Hezbollah demanded that Judge Bitar be replaced.\n\nThe port blast happened after a fire detonated 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, a combustible chemical widely used as agricultural fertiliser, that had been stored unsafely in a port warehouse for almost six years.\n\nSenior officials were aware of the material\u2019s existence and the danger it posed but failed to secure, remove or destroy it.",

          "text": "Authorities in English-speaking western Cameroon have appealed for calm after the killing of a five-year-old girl by a policeman in the troubled region and his subsequent lynching by an angry crowd.\n\nThe incident took place on Thursday in Buea, the capital of the Southwest region where anglophone separatists and government forces in the French speaking-majority nation have been locked in a bitter four-year-old conflict.\n\n\u201cWe urge the public to be calm. This is a sad and unfortunate incident,\u201d Governor Bernard Okalia Bilai told the state television channel CRTV.\n\n\u201cRest assured that those who did it will pay. It is an atrocity,\u201d he said.\n\nBlaise Chamango, head of a local campaign group called Human Is Right, said a woman driving children to school was ordered by police to stop at a checkpoint.\n\n\u201cThe driver didn\u2019t obey. A gendarme opened fire and a schoolgirl was fatally wounded,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPeople responded by lynching the gendarme. More than 500 people came out and marched with the body [of the girl] to the governor\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nThe defence ministry statement confirmed the events, saying in a statement: \u201cIn an inappropriate reaction, unsuited to the circumstances and clearly disproportionate to the irreverent behaviour of the driver, one of the gendarmes \u2026 fired warning shots in order to immobilise the vehicle.\n\n\u201cIn the process, the little Caro Louise Ndialle, a young pupil aged about 5, who was on board the said vehicle, was fatally shot in the head,\u201d it added.\n\nAn investigation has been opened into the death of the girl and the lynching of the policeman, the ministry said.\n\nLater on Thursday, hundreds of residents took to the streets of Buea, some holding tree branches in a sign of peace.\n\nOthers waved 500 franc CFA currency notes ($0.88), which they said was how much the girl\u2019s parents refused to pay before the gendarme opened fire.\n\nSeveral said the incident was part of a pattern of heavily militarised security forces harassing residents.\n\n\u201cAll they do is intimidate people. If you have an identity card, it\u2019s a problem. If you don\u2019t have an identity card, it\u2019s a problem,\u201d said one protester, who declined to give her name for security reasons.\n\nThe Southwest and neighbouring Northwest regions are home to English speakers who comprise about a fifth of Cameroon\u2019s 22 million people.\n\nPerceived discrimination\n\nA decades-long campaign by separatists to redress perceived discrimination at the hands of the francophone majority flared into a declaration of independence on October 1, 2017.\n\nAttacks on the security forces by armed separatists were met with a crackdown, sending the two regions into a spiral of violence that has killed more than 3,500 people and forced about 700,000 people to flee their homes.\n\nLast month alone, 15 soldiers were killed in two attacks in five days, while four suspected separatists were sentenced to death over the 2020 killing of seven schoolchildren.\n\nThe presence of the anglophone regions derives from the colonial era.\n\nThe former German possession of Cameroon was partitioned after World War I between Britain and France.\n\nIn 1961, part of the British territory, the Southern Cameroons, joined Cameroon after it gained independence from France.\n\nAnglophones have long chafed about perceived inequality, especially in education and law.",
