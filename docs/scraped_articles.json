          "title": "Full letter: How I knew Buhari had no preferred presidential aspirant, Tinubu writes",
          "text": "The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, has commended the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), for leaving the party\u2019s presidential ticket open for all aspirants.\n\nHe said this in a letter to the President, which he personally signed. The letter was made public by Buhari\u2019s media aide, Femi Adesina, on Saturday.\n\nIn a copy of the letter obtained by The PUNCH, Tinubu said he didn\u2019t believe that Buhari had no preferred presidential aspirant until the night of the primary when the aspirants walked up to the podium and spoke.\n\nHe also described Buhari as a \u201ctrue leader, brother and friend\u201d who demonstrated a \u201csense of purpose, composure, and maturity\u201d in the weeks leading to the Special Convention of the Party.\n\nTinubu expressed gratitude for the President\u2019s congratulatory letter to him, adding that while all the contestants expected President Buhari to \u201cchoose\u201d his successor, he simply allowed a level playing field.\n\nThe PUNCH had reported that Tinubu defeated 13 other aspirants to emerge as the party\u2019s candidate at the end of the Special National Convention of the party on Wednesday, June 1, 2022, in Abuja.\n\nTinubu scored 1,271 votes to clinch the APC presidential ticket for the 2023 general election.\n\nThe other aspirants included Mr Chukwuemeka Nwajuba, Pastor Tunde Bakare, Chief Ikeobasi Mokelu, Senator Rochas Okorocha, Mr Tein Jack-Rich and Governor Ben Ayade.\n\nOthers were Governor David Umuahi, Senator Ahmad Yarima, Dr Ahmed Lawal, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, Mr Rotimi Amaechi, Governor Yahaya Bello and Mr Ogbonnaya Onu.\n\nThe race began with 23 aspirants but nine withdrew shortly before the commencement of voting at the convention.\n\nThey included Mrs Uju Kennedy-Ohnenye, Dr Felix Nicholas, former Gov. Godswill Akpabio of Akwa Ibom, former Gov. Ibikunle Amosun of Ogun, former Speaker Dimeji Bankole, Sen. Ajayi Boroffice, Gov. Muhammad Badaru of Jigawa, Sen. Ken Nnamani and Gov. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State.\n\nRead full letter:\n\nDear Mr President,\n\nDEEP APPRECIATION\n\nI bring you sincere fraternal greetings and congratulations on the successful conclusion of the special Presidential Convention of our great party, the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nOn behalf of my wife, Oluremi, and my entire family, I want to express my sincere gratitude for the very special and personal congratulatory letter you sent to me. I am deeply honored. Your words in that letter were reassuring, reenergising, and reinvigorating.\n\nYour Excellency, one must admire the sense of purpose, composure, and maturity you demonstrated in the weeks and months preceding the primary elections of our great party. As aspirants and party leaders, we all pleaded with you to \u201cchoose\u201d your successor.\n\nNaturally, this is expected especially in African democracy. Up until the 6th of June, 2022, the day of the APC Presidential primaries, the whole of Nigeria, including myself, was waiting for you to announce your preferred candidate. All of us thought and believed this was a very simple matter.\n\nHowever, it was only as the primary went into the night and as the candidates walked up to the podium and spoke that I fully and truly appreciated your position and stance to be neutral and non-aligned to any of us. As the first person to speak, I also had the special vantage point to carefully hear, without any distraction, what the other candidates had to say.\n\nAs the hours rolled by that evening, it became clear to me that all of us were your preferred candidates. As you captured it aptly in your letter to me, the \u201cspirit\u201d of 2013 and 2014 when we created and built APC was there for all to see.\n\nIn your letter and in our many meetings over the years, you fondly reminisced on fraternal attitude in the days and months before and after formation of the APC, when we all worked day and night to create, sustain and nurture our nascent movements into a credible opposition party and ultimately, become the ruling party. That time, no one spoke about tribe; no one spoke about religion. That was not what drove us. We were driven by a common desire to save and transform Nigeria.\n\nOne by one, I saw my colleagues and partners stand on the podium, full of the same passion and patriotic zeal they had in 2013/2014, presenting their ideas on how to build on your successful legacy. Back then, as it is now, we were from all parts of the country, all tribes, and all religions. We all had deep personal and strong bonds with you. We were together back then and our bonds remained strong up till now.\n\nMr. President, as the night of 6 June turned to morning of 7 June, I fully understood and appreciated your stance. \u201cYou belonged to everybody in the party and you belonged to none of the individual candidates of the party.\u201d A true leader, brother and friend.\n\nMr. President, the delegates from all over the country nominated my humble self to be their candidate. I must acknowledge that my nomination would not have become a reality without your support and that of the party leaders across the country. Indeed, as I reflect on my political journey, most of the 2022 APC presidential aspirants, members of the Progressive Governors Forum and National Assembly leaders and members all had a role to play in my successes and achievements thus far.\n\nI will forever be grateful to them for shaping my political journey over the decades. I want to assure you that I will continue to work with them going forward. My emergence as a candidate is also a victory for them.\n\nI have met most of them in the past few days and will continue these engagements as we plan for the general elections. Mr. President, APC is united and will remain united as we move towards the general elections.\n\nI have taken note of the message you sent to all Presidential Candidates in your Democracy Day speech to the nation on the 12th June, 2022. Our country is going through a very sensitive period and no one should put their personal desires above and beyond the nation\u2019s peace and prosperity.\n\nAs you said, the \u201cmessage we set at the top will be replicated in our followers.\u201d At this point, I will take this opportunity to assure Your Excellency of my commitment to running an issue focused campaign as we move into the general elections. I will personally engage the candidates from other political parties to urge them to do same. Voters should elect us based on our policies, programmes, and projects. By the grace of God, we as candidates will avoid having divisive, destructive and disruptive campaigns.\n\nI will conclude by once again thanking you for being there for all of us. By the grace of God and with your leadership, guidance and support, I am confident that we will lead our great party, the APC, to victory in the February 2023 general elections. We will ride on the back of your successes. We will build on the foundations of transparency and integrity which you have laid.\n\nMr President, together, side by side, in the spirit of 2014, we will win and Nigeria will move forward to a progressive, peaceful and prosperous future.\n\nAsiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu\n\nAPC Presidential Candidate",

          "text": "By Steve Oko\n\nThe Nigeria Army has promised to continue to train and re-train its personnel to enhance their combat-readiness.\n\nThe General Officer Commanding 82 Division of the Nigeria Army, Enugu, Maj. Gen. T.A Lagbaja, made the pledge Friday at the closing ceremony of the 82 Division Inter-Brigade Warrant Officers and Senior Non Commissioned Officers competition held at 14 Brigade Ohafia.\n\nGen. Lagbaja who was represented by the Commandant of 13 Brigade Calabar, Brig. Gen. Everest Okoro, said that the Army would continue to prioritise training and professionalism.\n\nHis words: \u201cThis Division will continue to pursue its training schedules in order to perfect on current tactics, techniques and procedures and as well acquire new ones with a view to realizing the COAS Vision which is to have a professional Nigerian Army ready to accomplish assigned missions within a Joint Environment in Defence of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn the last four days, we have witnessed passion, doggedness, dexterity, skills and professionalism from all the participants.\n\n\u201d This glamorous outing is in no doubt a culmination of hard work, discipline and resourcefulness put in at various levels of preparation by the various contingents.\n\n\u201d Purposeful training which is the bedrock of military professionalism was the catalyst to what we have witnessed during the competition. With this, let me remind all that, we must continue to train ourselves so that we can develop the required capability in our troops to handle every challenge thrown at them by the security dynamics.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the just concluded competition is not only timely but key in improving the combat readiness of our Warrant Officers and Senior Non Commissioned Officers in 82 Division.\n\nThe GOC commended participants at the competition especially those who won various medals while urging them to improve on areas of observed weaknesses and strengthen the areas of strength.\n\nVarious events where the participants competed on include: weapon handling, digital map reading and navigation, obstacle crossing, combat swimming, night and day firing among others.\n\nMeanwhile, 13 Brigade Calabar emerged the overall best with a total of 4898 points, followed by 82 Division Garrison Brigade which scored 4836 point while 14 Brigade Ohafia came third with 4365 points.\n\nThe Golden spoon award for the best Brigade from the rear was collected by 44 Engineer Brigade Enugu.\n\n82 Division Garrison Brigade Enugu came first in weapon handling while 44 Engineer Brigade emerged best in navigation. 13 Brigade Calabar was the best in combat swimming.",

          "text": "\u2026.charges Christians on barking dog\n\nBy Providence Ayanfeoluwa\n\nThe Catholic Bishop of Diocese of Sokoto, Matthew Kukah, yesterday, said that toxic politics has poisoned religion in Nigeria, while charging Christians to walk towards the barking dog.\n\nHe said this while delivering an anniversary lecture at the flag off ceremony of the 70th Anniversary, Logo and Mascot launch of the order of the Knights of Saint Mulumba, KSM Nigeria.\n\nKukah said Nigeria now ranked as 9th worst country for Christians to live in the world.\n\nHis words: \u201cNow Nigeria is being ranked as 9th worst country for Christians to live in. We are number nine and Iran is number eight, everywhere I go, people keep asking me what is happening to Christians and Muslims in Nigeria. Toxic politics has now poisoned our religion.\n\n\u201cThough I am not a Vetinarian, but I was told that when a dog is barking, you walk towards it because if you turn back, it would attack. My point is that we Christians must walk towards the barking dog.\n\n\u201cAs I speak, for past three weeks my Priest, a young man and a sister are still in captivity even though the Nigerian state wishes to pretend that we are not negotiating with the kidnappers but as I am talking we are negotiating with the kidnappers because I don\u2019t know how else to get back my priest.\n\n\u201cIt is a very painful experience, my own blood relations have been kidnapped, I lost a Priest last year to kidnappers, I have lost a Seminarian to kidnappers and somehow we like to pretend we have a government, of course we have the apparatus of government, we have the scaffolding, but this scaffolding is important because people are able see access and appropriate resources of state.\n\n\u201cAs to what the state needs to do, they are still far away from that reality. It is a very painful and sad reality that as at the last conversation with the kidnappers we have negotiated up to N20 million which I do not have.\n\n\u201cAnd the kidnappers think this is chicken fee. And I am supposed to pay money to people who are murderers, who would murder anybody, I am supposed to pay money to people who are buying aeroplane and killing people as you hear about Southern Kaduna last week, I was supposed to pay money to people who are prepared to destroy our country and there seems to be no sign to end this madness,\u201d he said\n\nThe Archbishop of the Metropolitan See of Lagos, Most Rev. Alfred Adewale Martins represented by\n\nVicar General, Catholic Archdiocese of Lagos, Monsignor John Aniagwu, advised Nigerian electorates to get their PVCs and avoid being manipulated in the 2023 elections.\n\nAniagwu said: \u201cThere is a way forward if we allow through democracy to prevail and elect the right people. Nigeria is endowed with so many right people who can who can lead us to the right direction to overcome the challenges we are facing.\u201d\n\nChief host and Worthy Supreme Knight, Charles Mbelede, alongside Chief hostess, Ladies of Saint Mulumba, Lady Meg Anozia, appreciated God for the landmark event while assuring that the group will do more to impact the society positively.",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Miftaudeen Raji\n\nThe Muslim Students Society of Nigeria (MSSN), Lagos State chapter has applauded the judgment of the Supreme Court upholding the use of hijab in Lagos schools.\n\nThe judgment, which was delivered on Friday in Abuja, had no fewer than seven justices on the panel, out of which six backed the use of hijab in Lagos schools.\n\nThe apex court dismissed an appeal by the Lagos State Government and upheld the use of hijab in Lagos schools.\n\nIn his reaction to the judgment, Friday, the Amir (President) of MSSN Lagos, Miftahudeen Thanni, said with the judgment, students in public primary and secondary schools in Lagos State can now wear hijab to school without harassment.\n\nHe appealed to teachers and government officials in the State to refrain from harassment of female Muslim students, urging that the Supreme Court judgement should put a stop to the \u201cundue\u201d punishment of students willing to wear the hijab.\n\nThanni, however, assured the state government and residents of peaceful co-existence, noting that Muslim students won\u2019t abuse the judgement.\n\nAccording to him, the judgment has deepened the confidence of students and Nigerians in the judiciary.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe judgement simply means that though hijab is not mandatory in Lagos schools, Muslim students who wish to wear it are free to do so and legally allowed.\n\n\u201cWe are a law-abiding organization and we will continue to uphold the law of the land. We applaud the judgment. The position of the law is very clear on the subject matter. This matter once more assures us that all hope is not lost on having a modest society.\n\n\u201cThe government should not be waging war against youths who chose to cover their nakedness while encouraging those who walk naked and engage in illicit acts in public,\u201d he said.\n\nThanni said, \u201cIt gladdens to see that the injunction which the LASG is using as a basis to deny the rights of Muslim students has been decided by the apex court.\n\n\u201cWe hereby urge all stakeholders to be law-abiding for a peaceful implementation of the judgment. There should be no violation of human rights against our students while we expect an immediate implementation of the judgment in all schools across the state. We urge the government not to delay implementation,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile congratulating and thanking Muslims and the legal team on the recent apex court judgment, Thanni said, \u201cWe congratulate the entire Muslim Ummah (community) and urge our Muslim students to uphold decency and cleanliness which are the hallmark of Islam while exercising their rights. We also pray to Allah to forgive the shortcomings of the late Alhaji Adetola Kassim (SAN) who started this case without collecting a dime from us.\u201d\n\nVanguard recalls that the Lagos State Government had in February 2017 approached the Supreme Court to challenge the July 21, 2016 judgment of the Court of Appeal,which reinstated the use of hijab by Muslim pupils in Lagos public primary and secondary schools.\n\nThis was after the state government sought to stay the execution of the judgment at the Lagos Division of the Court of Appeal but failed.\n\nThe case, CA/L/135/15, is between the Lagos State Government, Miss Asiyat AbdulKareem (through her father), Miss Moriam Oyeniyi and the Muslim Students\u2019 Society of Nigeria.\n\nA five-man special appellate court panel, presided by Justice A.B. Gumel, had on July 21, 2016, overruled the October 17, 2014 judgment of Justice Modupe Onyeabo of the Lagos State High Court in Ikeja, which banned the use of hijab in public primary and secondary schools in Lagos State.\n\nWhile striking down Justice\u2019s Onyeabo\u2019s verdict, the Justice Gumel panel had held that the ban on hijab was discriminatory against Muslim pupils in the state.\n\nThe panel upheld the Muslim students\u2019 contention that the ban violated their rights to freedom of thought, conscience, religion, dignity of human persons and freedom from discrimination guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution.\n\nJustice Gumel also held that wearing the hijab was an Islamic injunction and an act of worship required of Muslims.\n\nHe said the use of hijab by Muslim pupils could not cause disunity, distraction and discrimination against students of other faiths as declared by the lower court judge.",

But, he was quick to say that his party was not involved in vote buying deal.\n\nHe made the allegation at his country home, Efon Alaye, following allegation of inducement of voters by the political parties.\n\nBesides, The Nation also saw some voters, who were agitating over neglect to benefit from the largesse.\n\nThese voters, who came from another polling unit in Ward 8, met Kolawole.\n\nShortly after, the voters were seen compiling their names on a sheet of paper.\n\nBut Kolawole discountenaced the allegation saying it was possible that other political parties were doing that.\n\nHowever, he said he had heard reports that vote buying happened in the state capital, Ado-Ekiti.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are not in government. We don\u2019t have such money for vote buying.\n\n\u201cWe heard there was vote buying in Ado-Ekiti, but PDP.\n\n\u201cWe have campaigned and have left Ekiti people with their conscience to vote according to their conscience\u201d, he said.\n\nAt unit 09, ward 10 in Ikere council areas, a gang of security operatives snatched huge money meant to buy votes. Many voters who had hoped to collect money we\u2019re said to have been disappointed with the action of the security agents.\n\nSome political party agents present at the polling unit said officials of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps were on routine patrol when they stormed the polling unit.\n\nThe party agents, did not, however state which political party owns the money that was snatched.\n\nThey said the NSCDC officials took a short cut within the community and spend off.\n\nWhen asked if they could identify the officers, one party agent said, \u201cEven if I see the person, do you expect me to say this is the person? I know they will not admit that they collected money from this place. They will not even take it to their office.\u201d\n\nSpeaker of the Ekiti State House if Assembly, Hon Funminiyi Afuye, who was seen at the polling unit, said the money supposedly snatched does not belong to the All Progressives Congress.\n\nHon Afuye said he had voted at his polling unit and had to monitor the election around his vicinity.\n\nHis words, \u201cI have voted in my unit and I decided to just go about. But there is no violent anywhere. The people have been conducting themselves well.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t here when money was snatched . I am not aware of any money snatched. If they are snatching money, they are not snatching from my party.\n\n\u201cThere is no violence that has been reported to me.\u201d\n\nExplaining why was he present at the polling unit other than where he voted, Hon Afuye said \u201cBy virtue of my position as the Chief Lawmaker in the State and I do not interfere with the process, I can observe election.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to go about without my security agents. Are they harassing people. They are on their duty. The only time I went towards the polling units was when I wanted to confirm the number of machines there.\u201d\n\nSpokesman for the Ekiti NSCDC, Afolabi Tolulope, said he was not aware of such incident.\n\nHe said he was not yet at the office to know if any NSCDC officials on patrol made report about money at voting centres.\n\nMeanwhile, there were also pockets of ballot snatching at two polling units in Ilawe-Ekiti, Ekiti South West council area of the state and Ado-Ekiti.\n\nThe Spokesman of the Ekiti State Police, Abutu Sunday, confirmed the incident but said normalcy was restored immediately\n\nHe stated the Command have arrested four people for disruption of the voting excercise, adding that the suspects are already in its custody cooling their legs.",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Priscilla Ediare, Lateef Dada, Ado-Ekiti and Okwe Obi, Abuja\n\nThe 2022 triangular governorship race in Ekiti State to succeed Governor Kayode Fayemi was keenly contested mainly among the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nThe results that have been obtained as at 7:30p.m on Saturday showed that the APC candidate, Biodun Oyebanji, was in early lead, while the SDP candidate, Segun Oni, was closely following behind.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThe PDP candidate, Bisi Kolawole is in far distant third position. But the entire results would determine the winner of the poll, which should be announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) today.\n\nBut a report of ballot box snatching was received from Yiaga Africa in two polling units with codes 13/05/06/005 and 007 in Ilawe Ward IV, near St. Patrick\u2019s School.\n\nIn some of the polling units visited by our reporters, supporters of APC and SDP were noticeable, while PDP supporters were minor.\n\nIt was observed that the supporters of the two leading parties cut across the state, while the PDP was leading majorly in Efon Local Government, where its candidate hails from.\n\nFigures obtained in some of the polling units showed that APC was in early lead while SDP maintained a close contest. In Iworoko ward 9, unit 6, APC led with 102 votes with SDP having 95 votes. The PDP followed with 35 votes. In Ogbonuro/Ori-Olode, Ifaki-Ekiti, unit 8, the SDP won with 218 votes, while his closest contender, APC, got 15 votes. The candidate of PDP got 02 votes.\n\nIt was observed that APC is prominent in Ado-Ekiti, with SDP contesting closely and leading in some local governments. The governorship candidate of the PDP polled 98 to defeat his counterpart from APC, who got 13 votes and the SDP who scored 02 votes in his polling unit.\n\nIn unit 3, Ikogosi, Ekiti West, where the candidate of APC voted, APC scored 296 votes, while PDP got 01 and SDP got no vote. Also, in Ado-Ekiti ward 12, APC got 1,534, SDP scores 409 and PDP had 178. In Otun-Ekiti unit 01, results obtained showed APC leading with 148 against SDP and PDP following with 130 and 33 votes respectively.\n\nResults obtained from Oye-Ekiti, Atatiba-Aafin, showed APC winning with 78 votes, while SDP polled 36 and PDP got 25 votes. In Ijero Igbooloko/Odo-Ese, APC had 130 votes, SDP got 21, while PDP scored 20 votes.\n\nThe results in Apaso unit, Ijero-Ekiti, showed APC leading with 110 votes, while SDP got 66 and PDP had 27 votes. In Ijero, Oke-Iroko, APC led with 74 votes, SDP had 33 votes and PDP got 31 votes.\n\n\u2026Large turnout, heavy security, vote buying, peaceful conduct greet poll\n\nLarge turnout of eligible voters, scientific financial inducement of electorate, heavy security presence, peaceful conduct, and partial malfunctioning of BVAS greeted the conduct of the 2022 governorship poll that was held yesterday in Ekiti State.\n\nAs early as 7:30 a.m, many electorate were sighted at different polling units in Ado-Ekiti, even before the arrival of officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nIt was gathered that as at 8:30a.m, about 70 per cent of INEC officials were already at the various polling units, while about 90 per cent were at their duty posts by 9:00a.m. People, both young and old, trooped out in their large numbers to exercise their franchise.\n\nThe exercise began seamlessly in many of the polling units, while a number of them experienced partial hitches due to the malfunctioning of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) machines deployed by the INEC for authentication of voters. But the issues were promptly resolved by technical personnel of INEC.\n\nHowever, vote-buying was observed in many places. In some places, some politicians purportedly distributed N10,000, while it was N4,000 or N5,000 in other places. But it was reported that some voters out-rightly rejected financial inducement from politicians, which led to a minor rumpus, which was promptly brought under control by security agents.\n\nIt was observed at Okesa Roundabout in Ado-Ekiti, as well as Ifaki-Ekiti and Iyin-Ekiti that some metres away from the polling units, agents of a political party were stationed secretly there and monitoring voters.\n\nAs gathered, the voters that cast their votes for them would stylishly display the ballot papers before dropping them into the ballot boxes, and thereafter, they would go and collect the inducement.\n\nOne of the voters told Sunday Sun: \u201cIn 2018 when we held governorship election in this state, it was \u2018E dibo, e se\u2019be\u2019 (Vote and get money to prepare soup), while this year 2022, it is \u2018E dibo, ki e san school fees\u2019 (Vote and pay school fees). Don\u2019t ask me if I collect the money or not. It is none of your business.\u201d\n\nA young man that looked like somebody under the influence of hard drink, was sighted at Iyin-Ekiti when he cast his vote. He staggered and raised up the ballot paper, saying: \u201cI have voted o.\u201d Later, he was sighted some metres away from the polling units, talking to some people. He said: \u201cI have voted for you people. Where is my money?\n\nA fight broke out in Iworoko-Ekiti, Irepodun-Ifelodun Local Government, when some agents of the political parties in the town disagreed over vote-buying.\n\nA councillor in the town was accused of giving the electorate N10,000 each, having shown their ballot papers to ascertain that they voted for his party.\n\nEfforts to speak with the alleged councillor proved abortive as he walked away.\n\nThe agent of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Bukunmilade Oluwafemi, said that some voters are showing their ballot papers to the people to go and collect money after voting.\n\nAlso, the agent of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Yusuf Kehinde, accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) of buying votes in the unit.\n\nHe said, \u201cvoters are showing their ballot papers to them and that is what we are saying it shouldn\u2019t be. The APC members are buying votes here.\n\nBut, the agent of the APC, Fatayo Muideen, described the allegation as a lie, saying there was no problem in the unit and that everything went well.\n\nAlso, the agent of PDP, Fapohunda Matthew, said that he was not aware of vote-buying.\n\nThe governorship candidate of SDP, Segun Oni, said that he received calls that vote-buying took place in some areas in the state.\n\nHe particularly mentioned Ado-Ekiti and Oye-Ekiti as the major towns, where the vote-buying allegedly took place.\n\n\u201cThere is no problem in my area where I voted. The security and officials of INEC are doing well.\u201d\n\nOn the allegation that he has withdrawn from the race, he said the peddlers of fake news are jittery because they know his strength.\n\nActing Deputy Commandant-General in charge of operations of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Haruna Mohammed, who led 9,749 personnel of the security agency to Ekiti, said that the process went smoothly and the turnout of voters was very impressive.\n\nAn observer with YIAGA Africa, Ezenwa Nwangwu, said that it was observed that vote-buying was witnessed in a number of polling units that his team visited.\n\nHe added that financial inducement of electorate has gone scientific, saying that the country needs to do more on vote-buying because one would not notice any sign of such, going to the polling units.\n\nHe said that it would take more than ordinary interest to discover it.\n\nCommenting on the alleged vote-buying, he said that people should have called the attention of the security agents at each polling unit to the alleged financial inducement, and they would have acted promptly on the information.\n\nHe admitted that the 2022 governorship poll in Ekiti State was an improvement on the previous polls, especially being the first to be conducted under the new Electoral Act.\n\nBut there was heavy security presence across the state. Two helicopters of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) were also sighted moving round the state. The security personnel included the military and paramilitary organisations.\n\nA section of Ado-Iyin dual carriageway in front of INEC office, was completely barricaded by security agents to ensure adequate security for the venue, where results of the poll will be officially announced by the chief returning officer.\n\nBut no report of violence or hijacking of ballot boxes was received from any part of the state at the time of filing this report.\n\n\u2026CDD says poll marred by vote buying, fake news\n\nThe Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) has given its verdict on the Ekiti State governorship election held yesterday.\n\nIts Chair, Election Analysis Centre(EAC), Prof Adele Jinadu, at a press briefing yesterday in Abuja, noted that the exercise was marred by vote buying and fake news, adding that some voters cast their ballot without being authenticated by the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS).\n\nJinadu said: \u201cCDD-EAC Fake News Hub tracked and fact-checked a number of fake news and misinformation trending on Election Day.\n\n\u201cA major trending item was the purported withdrawal letter of the SDP candidate Segun Oni, and his endorsement of the PDP candidate, which circulated across social media. This claim was subsequently confirmed to be \u2018false\u2019.\n\n\u201cCDD-EAC observers reported a worrisome situation in which some voters were allowed to cast their ballot without being authenticated by the BVAS.\n\n\u201cCDD-EAC observers also documented instances where young voters openly displayed the cash given to them to buy their votes.\n\n\u201cThese anomalies confirm CDD-EAC observation in the pre-election period that the ongoing strike by universities has grounded the local economy.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month! Skills open the doors to financial opportunities Click here to learn it .\n\n\u201cThe situation has in turn influenced a number of young voters to perceive the election as an opportunity to solve their economic challenges by accepting inducement from political actors.\u201d",

CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nAs the dust raised by the Mbaka outburst is yet to settle, Bishop Onaga shutdown his Adoration Ministry in Enugu.\n\nOpinions are, however, divided over the bishop\u2019s action with many hailing him while others said the charismatic priest had not committed any offence.\n\nIn a letter addressed to \u2018All the Clergy, Religious and Lay faithful in the Catholic Diocese of Enugu\u2019, the bishop banned Catholic faithful from having anything to do with the Adoration Ministry.\n\nHe said in the letter that Mbaka having refused to heed to the Church\u2019s persistent directives, \u201cand in fulfillment of my pastoral duties as the Chief Shepherd, I hereby prohibit all Catholics (clergy, religious and lay faithful) henceforth from attending all religious and liturgical activities of the Catholic Adoration Ministry until the due canonical process initiated by the Diocese is concluded.\u201d\n\nNoting that his decision was based on the fact that Mbaka\u2019s teaching and utterances were not consistent with the teachings of the Catholic Church, the bishop enjoined all Christian faithful to keep praying for the embattled priest.\n\nMbaka had in his midweek sermon made provocative remarks about Obi and his presidential aspiration.\n\nThis was not the first time that the fiery priest would attack the ex-Anambra governor as he had in the build up to the 2019 general election embarrassed Obi at the Adoration Ground.\n\nMbaka tendered an apology although he later said that he was forced by the bishop to do so.\n\nThe diocese described Mbaka\u2019s diatribe on Obi as not only inflammatory, but an injury to the reputation of the former governor.\n\nWhile some adorers criticized the ban, Obi\u2019s supporters hailed it, insisting that the ban was long overdue.\n\nOne of the respondents, Chris Ifechukwu said that though he respects Fr. Mbaka, the ban would help him retrace his steps.\n\n\u201cI respect Father Mbaka a lot. I hope he retraces his step. Nobody is above the rules and regulations guiding the mother church. It should be strictly adhered to.\n\n\u201cThe wise will always swallow pride and take corrections. His die-hard supporters that were defending his action should as well apologize. Never allow religion to becloud your sense of reasoning,\u201d he counselled.\n\nCommenting on the ban, Ofo Daniels cautioned that \u201cantichrist members may likely hide under the guise as Peter Obi\u2019s supporters to destroy the Adoration Ministry facilities or possibly take human lives. Fr Mbaka remains God-chosen servant.\u201d\n\nFor Igwe Alexander, the bishop has shown that he can bite, but urged him to also tamper justice with mercy as, according to him, the bishop should remember that \u201cif you beat a child with one hand, you should bring him back with another.\u201d\n\nHowever, James Ajayi, an ardent follower of Mbaka, said that the charismatic priest\u2019s prophecy was true and it will only take time for them to manifest.\n\n\u201cI think Mbaka will soon become the chief cornerstone because what he said about Peter Obi is a known fact no matter the critics. A governor for eight years without structure, he cannot go far in politics no matter the grammar. Let me ask, who are his followers in the North? How many people that matter from the East are with him? Let us put sentiment apart,\u201d Ajayi said.\n\nAnother faithful, Chidi Nnamani said that nobody would tell them where to worship, urging that Fr. Mbaka should be left alone. He said: \u201cPeter Obi is a betrayer to us; Ndigbo. They can\u2019t use him to stop Biafra.\u201d\n\nAlso, his colleague, John Chuks said that the bishop lacks the power to decide where anybody worships, noting that the \u201cChurch belongs to the Holy Spirit and never to Onaga or his cohorts!\u201d\n\nBut another of the congregants, Mrs Edna Nwoye described the development as unfortunate, wishing the matter would be resolved soonest.\n\nShe also begged the bishop not to throw away the baby with the bath water, especially as the Adoration Ministry had done a lot in assisting people both spiritually and materially.\n\n\u201cI sincerely feel bad about the whole thing and I think that Daddy (Mbaka) this time did not do it right, but we must not throw away the baby with the dirty water. Again Father Mbaka has apologized to all about what he said against Peter Obi,\u201d Nwoye said.\n\nA resident of New Haven, Enugu, Eugene Ag\u1ee5, who said he had followed Father Mbaka for a long time and had supported all his prophecies and statements stated that he was uncomfortable with the current diatribe on Obi.\n\nOn the ban placed on the ministry, he said: \u201cI am a Catholic and will always abide by the orders of the church declared by Bishop Onaga. But I want to plead with the church to keep the Adoration Ministry alive, I am sure that Daddy Mbaka has learnt some lessons with this. The ministry should steer clear of politics.\u201d\n\nFor some other followers of Mbaka like George Odo, a bus driver, their spiritual director should be left alone, after all, the things he said about former President Goodluck Jonathan and President Muhammadu Buhari and Governor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State had all come to fruition.\n\nIn his reaction, Christopher Nnadi said that calling Mbaka to order was timely because there \u201cis already political tension in the land and I believe this is to calm the situation.\n\n\u201cAs a Catholic and member of Adoration family, it is not easy for me and other members, but we equally believe whatever our spiritual head says stands. The ban is from our bishop and we are bound to abide by it.\n\n\u201cHowever, let us not forget that it is not only Catholic members from Enugu Diocese that attend the Adoration Ministry, non-Catholics and people from different parts of Nigeria and outside the country, even from Europe, Asia and other parts of the world are members.\n\n\u201cWe should also know that Mbaka should not be insulated for talking about Nigeria politics and politicians because politics controls the society, and as an ordained priest and a prophet, he is expected to talk and comment on day-to-day happenings in our society.\u201d\n\nAnother adoration worshiper, Mrs Grace Ugwuanyi, a trader at Ogige Main Market, Nsukka said that she received the ban of Catholic faithful from Mbaka\u2019s Adoration Ministry with shock and disbelief.\n\nUgwuanyi who said she had prepared to go for last Friday\u2019s adoration prayers only to be informed by one of their members also said that every Catholic faithful was under obligation to obey and carry out all instructions by the church leaders even when it is against their wish.\n\nLike Mrs Ugwuanyi, a Catechist at St. Peter\u2019s Parish Uwell-Owerre/Amokwe, Nsukka Catholic Diocese, Charles Odo, said that as the leader of the church, Bishop Onaga has every right to sanction and discipline any priests under him that were found wanting in their pastoral duties.\n\nHe described what was happening to Mbaka as normal within the Catholic Church.\n\nIn Ebonyi State, adoration worshippers there appealed to the Bishop of Enugu Diocese to forgive their spiritual director and reopen the adoration ground to worshippers.\n\nChinenye Ogbaga, told our correspondent in Abakaliki that the priest was not above mistakes.\n\nShe said: \u201cMbaka is a respected servant of God whose prophecies hardly fail. His comment on Peter Obi, I don\u2019t know it as a prophecy or a personal comment. I just want the authorities concerned to forgive him and reopen the adoration ground.\u201d\n\nBut her counterpart, Esther Ndubuisi, said that Satan was fighting back to reclaim lost souls by using his agents to attack Fr. Mbaka.\n\n\u201cIf they are not agent of Satan why targeting the adoration ground? Mbaka said his mind or divine revelation; why didn\u2019t they say their own or ignore him and continue with their lives? By targeting the adoration ground, it is clear who they are serving,\u201d she said.\n\nBut another Catholic in Abakaliki, Agbo Clement, regretted that the fiery priest was fond of controversy, saying that \u201cthe Catholic Church must act now before Mbaka rubbishes its image.\u201d\n\nBy and large, another ardent Catholic and vociferous fan of Obi in Ebonyi State, Nonso Ezeaka, urged people to pray for Mbaka, hoping that he emerged stronger after the ongoing canonical process of the Church.\n\n\u201cWhat we owe Rev. Fr. Camillus Ejike Mbaka right now is prayers. The prayer point should be that he may remain obedient, strong and faithful till the end of the canonical process already in progress.\n\n\u201cMy thoughts and prayers are with him. Surely, he\u2019ll come out stronger and a better Catholic priest in the mind of Christ Jesus,\u201d Ezeaka enthused.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

Her desire is to see the girl child enlightened and empowered, in order for her to make a wise, conscious and responsible decision regarding relationship and sexuality.\n\nOkenwa beat 26 other contestants from across the country to emerge winner of the National Queen Nigeria 2021 beauty pageant, organised by Sanj BornStar Entertainment. She carted away a brand new car, one-year modeling contract and cash prizes among other gifts.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThe beauty queen, who hails from Nkporo in Ohafia Local Government Area of Abia State, was in Lagos during the Easter and Sunday Sun caught up with her for a brief chat. Here are excerpts:\n\nHow has it been since you emerged winner of the National Queen beauty pageant?\n\nIt has been exciting, awesome, fascinating and beautiful getting a lot of attention and respect from people.\n\nIs there anything about the limelight that you don\u2019t like?\n\nActually, I\u2019m enjoying being in the limelight; the celebrity lifestyle is so fascinating.\n\nWhat has been your greatest challenge?\n\nIt\u2019s getting sponsorship and fundraising for my pet project.\n\nTell us about your pet project.\n\nMy pet project is on \u201cSexuality Education\u201d and my target audience is the girl child, ranging from age 10 to 18, and the aim is to educate a minimum of 500 girls. During the course of the programme, we will be educating them on issues concerning the stages of puberty in female, HIV/AIDs, STDs, and abstinence, which aims to develop and strengthen the ability of the girl child to make a wise, conscious, satisfying, healthy and responsible choice regarding relationship and their sexuality. Afterward, there will be gifts like (sanitary) pads, notebooks and other writing materials.\n\nHow far have you gone in achieving it?\n\nI am still in the process; graphic is out, but the date is yet to be communicated as we are putting final touches on the logistics. But I\u2019m open to sponsorship and partnership\u2026\n\nAfter your reign, what will be your next move?\n\nI will like to represent Nigeria in an international pageant, go for a reality TV show preferably BBN; and also become a successful health educator.\n\nIs your boyfriend intimidated by your new status as a queen?\n\nWell, I\u2019m single but not searching.\n\n\n\nWhat has been your saddest experience since you became the queen?\n\nIf I miss a call or reply late to a massage, people immediately relate it to pride, that it\u2019s because I\u2019m now a queen. But they don\u2019t know the circumstances surrounding the late response; words like that make me sad.\n\nTell us one of your best experiences and one of the best personalities you\u2019ve met since your reign.\n\nEvery moment has been beautiful. I can\u2019t really pick a particular one as best because I have met a lot of great minds, and great personalities. One is the deputy governor of my state, Abia State, His Excellency, Ude Oko Chukwu.\n\nWhat is your best food?\n\nI love basmati rice, Jamaican chicken sauce with fried plantains.\n\nWhich celebrity thrills you the most?\n\nThey are many but Rihanna, Priyanka Choper and Saweetie, probably because we look alike.\n\nWhat type of man would you want to marry?\n\nI am sapiosexual. My type of man will be intelligent, understanding, God-fearing, educated and hardworking.\n\nWhat do you hate in people?\n\nI hate gossip, laziness and talkativeness.\n\nHow do you handle men who want to date you now that you are a queen?\n\nI go straight to the point. I tell them, \u2018I can\u2019t date you but we can be friends\u2019. I do not disrespect them.\n\nHow would you encourage young, upcoming female enthusiasts to be part of future pageants?\n\nIt is one of my promises to assist them. It\u2019s my promise to encourage other young ladies, who have been yearning for a true pageant, to look no further. They should associate with the National Queen Nigeria to help build their modeling dreams and careers.\n\nIf you meet President Buhari today, what\u2019s the one thing you will tell him?\n\nI will tell him that he should fulfill his promises, especially on security and economy.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

There is a large turn out of security agencies. The police are here in large numbers.\n\n\u201cIn all, the electorate themselves have been very disciplined. So far, there have not been any incident of violence or fighting,\u201d Adebayo said.\n\nHe advised the voters to continue to conduct themselves peacefully during and after the election.\n\n\u201cGet accredited, cast your votes and go home or stay around, listen to the results and go home and celebrate,\u201d Adebayo said. (NAN)\n\n1:52 pm\n\nEkiti Decides: Bamidele Hails Use of BVAS, Seeks e-Tranfers of Votes\n\nVictor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\nThe Senator representing Ekiti Central Senatorial District, Opeyemi Bamidele, Saturday urged the Independent National Electoral Commission to improve on the Bimodal Voter Authentication System in the next election.\n\n\n\nBamidele said there was a need for the technological innovation to encompass all facets of electoral process, incuding accreditation, voting and electronic transfer of votes.\n\nThe Senator said this in Iyin Ekiti, Irepodun/Ifelodun Local Government area, after voting at Ward B unit 003 in the town.\n\n\n\nThe All Progressives Congress chieftain, said electronic transfer of votes would not only improve the poll credibility, but would stamp out the fear of people tampering with results at collation centres.\n\nThe Chairman, Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, hailed the security arrangements and massive turnout of voters across the state.\n\n\n\nHe said the upsurge in number of voters substantiated that Nigeria is having a remarkable improvement in the conduct of elections.\n\n\u201cWith BVAS, there is no fear of anybody tamepering with the accreditation process and that is the beauty of democracy.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, the the next stage for INEC is having electronic transfer of votes. With this, nobody will have any fear of interception at the collation centres and that will add to the integrity of our election\u201d, he said.\n\nSpeaking further on the pervasive serenity in Ekiti and massive turnout of voters, Bamidele added: \u201cFrom the reports I heard from the start of the voting. It has been a peaceful process. We owe it a duty to collectively protect the integrity of this process.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll of us are bothered with the kind of tension in town before this election, but I am personally happy for the way it has turned out peacefully\u201d.\n\n11:47 am\n\nI\u2019m Confident of Winning, Oyebanji Boasts After Voting\n\n\n\nVictor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\nThe All Progressives Congress Governorship candidate in today\u2019s election in Ekiti State, Hon Biodun Oyebanji, has expressed confidence that he will win the keenly contested election.\n\n\n\nOyebanji spoke in Ikogosi Ekiti, Ekiti West Local Government Area of Ekiti State after voting at Okelele ward 06 unit 003 in the town.\n\n\n\nHe was accompanied with his wife, Dr. Olayemi Oyebanji to the unit.\n\nHe praised INEC for improving on the electoral process through Bimodal Voter Authentication System technology innovation, saying this has made the process faster and credible.\n\n\n\nHe hailed the voters for enthusiastically trooping out en masse to cast their vote, saying there wasn\u2019t any case of apathy with the reports he had been getting across the 177 wards\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is an improvement and my expectation is that I will win . I am happy that there was no case of apathy. The security build up has also been impressive, so the process has been good and fine.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am coming with a change agenda and my manifesto is clear about the changes I am bringing\u201d, he said.\n\n10:44 am\n\nPDP candidate, Bisi Kolawole at Ward 8 unit 1, Efon Alaaye, casting his vote\n\n10:14 am\n\nVoters on Queue\n\n10:13am\n\nTight Security, Early Arrival of INEC Officials, Massive Turnout of Voters as Guber Election Holds in Ekiti\n\n\n\n*EFCC deploys operatives to prevent vote buying\n\n\n\nChuks Okocha in Ado Ekiti\n\n\n\nWith over 75 percent of voting materials and INEC officials arriving at the polling stations across the local governments of Ekiti state, voting for the next governor of the state have commenced in most of the areas visited by THISDAY .\n\nAs a preemptive measure against vote buying, officials of the EFCC were seen at the Police Command in their red reflective jackets.\n\n\n\nReports by Yiaga Africa said that out of the 250 polling units at 8.38 am, that 246 were already open for business, while the remaining four within the Ado Ekiti metropolis were awaiting arrival of INEC officials.\n\nLater at 9.30nam, Yiaga Africa posted from its situation room that at the 250 polling stations earlier visited accreditations and voting had commenced .\n\n\n\nSecurity was tight with vehicular movement partially restricted. There were operatives of security agencies like Policemen, Civil Defence officials seen in most of the polling centres visited.\n\nSamples of voting situations in places visited:\n\n*Voters not coordinated at this polling unit 017 ward 10 Bashiri, Security agents have ordered stoppage of exercise, pending when normalcy will be restored.\n\n\n\n*At Ward 13, unit 01, Itanla beside delight hotel, Ilawe road, Ado Ekiti there is confusion as to whether their polling unit has been moved. Prospective voters who claimed that they had been voting there could not see INEC officials or voting materials.\n\n\n\n* At the same polling 17 in ward 10 of the Ado local government, gunshots were fired to disperse the agitated crowd due to rowdy situation.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has deployed its operatives in Ekiti state to monitor today\u2019s governorship election with a view to addressing the possibility of vote buying.\n\nSome of the operatives and armed police personnel attached to the commission were sighted in a convoy of vehicles within Ado Ekiti, the state capital.\n\n9:40am\n\nVoting Begins as Voters Lament Slow Accreditation\n\n\n\nVictor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\nVoting has commenced in some polling units in today\u2019s governorship poll in Ekiti State, as voters have queued up in some units to exercise their voting rights.\n\nIn some units in Ado Ekiti, Ilawe, Igede and Iyin Ekiti, voters were being accredited with the aide of Bimodal Voter Authentication System(BVAS) and given the ballots to vote.\n\n\n\nThere was impressive turnout of voters in virtually all the polling units.\n\nAlso, despite the peaceful conduct of voters, there were complaints in some of the units that the BVAS was slow and keeping voters on the queue for too long.\n\nHowever, the presiding officers in areas where BVAS seemed to be slow have complained to the Independent National Electoral Commission for proper and swift action.\n\n\n\nMilitary personnel were also stationed at entering points between Ado and Iyin Ekiti and at border towns .\n\nOperatives of the Department of State Services were also seen moving around to ensure orderliness and peaceful conduct of the poll in all the towns.\n\nSome of the agents were also seen complaining about reported cases of vote buying and such complaints were being handled by security operatives.\n\n8:09am\n\nVoters Trek Long Distance to Polling Units\n\nVictor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\nAs the Independent National Electoral Commission prepares to conduct the Governorship poll in Ekiti State today, it was observed that voters were resolute to cast their votes by trekking several kilometres to exercise their franchise.\n\n\n\nThe candidates of the All Progressives Congress, Biodun Oyebanji, People\u2019s Democratic Party, Bisi Kolawole and Social Democratic Party , Segun Oni, are the leading candidates in the impending electoral battle.\n\nThe election is billed to begin at 8am going by INEC time table .\n\n\n\nBut as early as 6am, those living along Federal Polytechnic road and Afe Babalola University areas, with a distance of about eight kilometres to the voting centres, were seen trooping out and trekking long distance to exercise their franchise in today\u2019s election.\n\n\n\nSome of them were compelled to go on foot owing to the 18-hour restriction placed on the state by the Inspector General of Police, Mr Usman Alkali Baba.\n\n\n\nOne of them, who identified himself as Ojo Adeniyi said he was trekking to his polling unit at Ori -Ekiti, which was about six kilometres to his residential area.\n\n\n\nWhen THISDAY visited some polling units at Odo Ado, Oke- Ori Omi, Okeyinmi, Irona and Oke- Ila areas in Ado- Ekiti, voters trooped out in large numbers to the extent that the polling units were becoming overcrowded.\n\nUnarmed Policemen were also deployed in all the polling units as early as 6am, while armed policemen were also noticed in some strategic areas to prevent violence.\n\n6:50am\n\nEkiti Decides: Oyebanji, Oni, Kolawole in Three-Horse Race\n\n*INEC promises free, fair poll, orders staff to resist unethical behaviour\n\n*Police impose 18-hour curfew, deploy 17,000; NSCDC 9,747\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Chuks Okocha and Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\nThousands of voters will today file out in Ekiti State to elect a new governor that will succeed Kayode Fayemi who is at the tail end of his second four-year tenure.\n\n\n\nNo fewer than 16 political parties are fielding candidates for the election, but it is expected to be a fierce battle involving Biodun Oyebanji of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC); Segun Oni of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and Bisi Kolawole of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\n\n\nFor most of yesterday, tension remained very high across the state, with voters bitterly divided among the three leading candidates. Fear of violence was palpable.\n\n\n\nFor seamless conduct of today\u2019s election in Ekiti State, the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, yesterday ordered the restriction of vehicular movements along entry and exit points to the state from 12:00am on 18th June, 2022 to 6:00pm of the same day.\n\n\n\nThe police added: \u201cTo this end, operatives of the Nigeria Police Force and the military, as well as other security agencies have been deployed across the state borders to enforce the restriction order to the letter and ensure criminal minded individuals do not infiltrate the State.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Deputy Inspector General of Police, Johnson Kokumo had earlier disclosed that Ekiti State would be properly secured to avoid any breakdown of law and order during the poll.\n\n\n\nHe also revealed that a total of 17,000 personnel had been deployed for the poll.\n\nThe DIG added that soldiers would be at the borders of the communities to prevent any form of intrusion.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, all security operatives with VIPs should be withdrawn and returned to base for the purpose of the election. The DIG called on the people to be law abiding and to respect all the processes of the elections to be able to have a peaceful governorship election in the state.\n\n\n\nINEC Says it is Ready\n\nINEC spent most of yesterday moving sensitive voting materials to the wards, while assuring all that the election would be free and fair.\n\nThe electoral umpire had earlier revealed that 988,923 voters captured in the Commission\u2019s register would decide who becomes the new Ekiti State Governor.\n\nINEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu appealed to staff of the commission to be neutral and abide by the code of conduct signed by them.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cI appeal to you to uphold our Code of Conduct, display your usual sense of responsibility and professionalism; remain above board and firmly resist any unethical behaviour.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe further charged them to ensure that no political party or candidate was accorded any advantage over the other.\n\n\u201cWe must also always stick strictly to the oath of neutrality to which we have all subscribed and continually live up to the trust that Nigerians repose in us,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\n\n\nThe National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said 734,746 persons had collected their Permanent Voters Card for the election.\n\n\n\nOkoye assured electorates of the commission\u2019s readiness to conduct a free, fair and credible election.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is now a matter of common knowledge that we have 16 LGAs in Ekiti State and the election will be staged in 177 registration areas.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, yesterday said it would deploy 9,747 personnel drawn from FCT, Lagos, Ondo, Ogun, Osun, Oyo, Kogi, Kwara and Edo commands to provide security for the election.\n\nAddressing personnel at the Ekiti State Command headquarters of the NSCDC in Ado Ekiti, before they moved to their respective places of deployment, Acting Deputy Commandant General Operations, Lawal Haruna, disclosed that some flash points had already been identified and would be properly monitored.\n\n\n\nOni Alleges Intimidation\n\nThe SDP candidate yesterday alleged that some desperate politicians were already violating the peace accord signed this week before the Abdudalami Abubakar-led National Peace Commission.\n\nOni said rather than adhering to the tenets of democracy in the conduct of the June 18 Ekiti election, those he described as \u201coppressors\u201d, had allegedly been dehumanising and demobilising his supporters through unlawful arrests.\n\n\n\nOni, who addressed pressmen in Ado Ekiti, alerted INEC, international community, security agencies, observers and other stakeholders, saying \u201cfor this election to be acceptable, the REC must stamp and sign all forms EC8A, EC8B, EC8C and EC8D and not by any other agent or staff. Once the REC stamps and signs, nobody will be able to smuggle any form of fake results.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the imperative of peace for the election to be successful, Oni said: \u201cI will keep to the peace accord. But when you are kidnapping people, it renders every peace document invalid. Let us tell them not to set this state on fire.\n\n\u201cThose who had been going round to kidnap my supporters should be called to order now. They are testing the patience and tolerance of the people. They shouldn\u2019t set this state on fire. If anybody commits an offence and they think they are the authorities to go round and arrest people at night, then the peace accord becomes shattered immediately.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow the Battle will Be Fought\n\nThe APC looks good to win Ekiti South Senatorial District, comprising six local governments \u2013 Gbonyin, Ekiti East, Ikere, Ekiti Southwest, Emure and Ise/Orun. Oyebanji\u2019s running mate, Mrs Mojisola Afuye hails from Ikere. With the votes from Ikere and party chieftains in the area, APC may likely win the zone.\n\n\n\nIn Ekiti South, the APC boasts of bigwigs like the Speaker, Ekiti State House of Assembly, Hon Funminiyi Afuye; two members of House of Representatives \u2013 Hon Femi Bamisile and Yemi Adaramodu; the APC State Chairman, Paul Omotoso; former Minister, Dayo Adeyeye and Chief Afolabi Ojuawo. These big wigs that can make things happen for the APC.\n\n\n\nOyebanji and Kolawole are from Ekiti Central Senatorial District, comprising five local government areas \u2013 Ado, Irepodun/Ifelodun, Efon, Ijero and Ekiti West. This is going to be a battleground. Oyebanji is from Ekiti West while Kolawole is from Efon.\n\n\n\nIn the last election, APC won four local governments in the senatorial zone and may still retain at least three this time, with the exception of Efon and Ado Ekiti.\n\n\n\nThe PDP may spring surprise in Efon because Kolawole hails from the town.\n\nThe influence of Segun Oni\u2019s Deputy, Ladi Owolabi in Ado Ekiti is also enormous. The large concentration of pensioners and civil servants, who seem to be backing Oni may also help the SDP tremendously in Ekiti Central.\n\nIn Ekiti Central, the APC also parades political heavyweights like the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Niyi Adebayo; Deputy governor, Bisi Egbeyemi and Senator Opeyemi Bamidele; These people are capable of doing the magic for APC. Victory for APC Ekiti Central may be by a narrow margin.\n\n\n\nEkiti North Senatorial District has always been a natural habitat and stronghold of Oni since 2007.

          "text": "\n\n*INEC promises free, fair poll, orders staff to resist unethical behaviour\n\n*Police impose 18-hour curfew, deploy 17,000; NSCDC 9,747\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Chuks Okocha and Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\nThousands of voters will today file out in Ekiti State to elect a new governor that will succeed Kayode Fayemi who is at the tail end of his second four-year tenure.\n\n\n\nNo fewer than 16 political parties are fielding candidates for the election, but it is expected to be a fierce battle involving Biodun Oyebanji of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC); Segun Oni of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and Bisi Kolawole of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\n\n\nFor most of yesterday, tension remained very high across the state, with voters bitterly divided among the three leading candidates. Fear of violence was palpable.\n\n\n\nFor seamless conduct of today\u2019s election in Ekiti State, the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, yesterday ordered the restriction of vehicular movements along entry and exit points to the state from 12:00am on 18th June, 2022 to 6:00pm of the same day.\n\n\n\nThe police added: \u201cTo this end, operatives of the Nigeria Police Force and the military, as well as other security agencies have been deployed across the state borders to enforce the restriction order to the letter and ensure criminal minded individuals do not infiltrate the State.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Deputy Inspector General of Police, Johnson Kokumo had earlier disclosed that Ekiti State would be properly secured to avoid any breakdown of law and order during the poll.\n\n\n\nHe also revealed that a total of 17,000 personnel had been deployed for the poll.\n\nThe DIG added that soldiers would be at the borders of the communities to prevent any form of intrusion.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, all security operatives with VIPs should be withdrawn and returned to base for the purpose of the election. The DIG called on the people to be law abiding and to respect all the processes of the elections to be able to have a peaceful governorship election in the state.\n\n\n\nINEC Says it is Ready\n\nINEC spent most of yesterday moving sensitive voting materials to the wards, while assuring all that the election would be free and fair.\n\n\n\nThe electoral umpire had earlier revealed that 988,923 voters captured in the Commission\u2019s register would decide who becomes the new Ekiti State Governor.\n\nINEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu appealed to staff of the commission to be neutral and abide by the code of conduct signed by them.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cI appeal to you to uphold our Code of Conduct, display your usual sense of responsibility and professionalism; remain above board and firmly resist any unethical behaviour.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe further charged them to ensure that no political party or candidate was accorded any advantage over the other.\n\n\u201cWe must also always stick strictly to the oath of neutrality to which we have all subscribed and continually live up to the trust that Nigerians repose in us,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\n\n\nThe National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said 734,746 persons had collected their Permanent Voters Card for the election.\n\n\n\nOkoye assured electorates of the commission\u2019s readiness to conduct a free, fair and credible election.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is now a matter of common knowledge that we have 16 LGAs in Ekiti State and the election will be staged in 177 registration areas.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, yesterday said it would deploy 9,747 personnel drawn from FCT, Lagos, Ondo, Ogun, Osun, Oyo, Kogi, Kwara and Edo commands to provide security for the election.\n\nAddressing personnel at the Ekiti State Command headquarters of the NSCDC in Ado Ekiti, before they moved to their respective places of deployment, Acting Deputy Commandant General Operations, Lawal Haruna, disclosed that some flash points had already been identified and would be properly monitored.\n\n\n\nOni Alleges Intimidation\n\nThe SDP candidate yesterday alleged that some desperate politicians were already violating the peace accord signed this week before the Abdudalami Abubakar-led National Peace Commission.\n\nOni said rather than adhering to the tenets of democracy in the conduct of the June 18 Ekiti election, those he described as \u201coppressors\u201d, had allegedly been dehumanising and demobilising his supporters through unlawful arrests.\n\n\n\nOni, who addressed pressmen in Ado Ekiti, alerted INEC, international community, security agencies, observers and other stakeholders, saying \u201cfor this election to be acceptable, the REC must stamp and sign all forms EC8A, EC8B, EC8C and EC8D and not by any other agent or staff. Once the REC stamps and signs, nobody will be able to smuggle any form of fake results.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the imperative of peace for the election to be successful, Oni said: \u201cI will keep to the peace accord. But when you are kidnapping people, it renders every peace document invalid. Let us tell them not to set this state on fire.\n\n\u201cThose who had been going round to kidnap my supporters should be called to order now. They are testing the patience and tolerance of the people. They shouldn\u2019t set this state on fire. If anybody commits an offence and they think they are the authorities to go round and arrest people at night, then the peace accord becomes shattered immediately.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow the Battle will Be Fought\n\nThe APC looks good to win Ekiti South Senatorial District, comprising six local governments \u2013 Gbonyin, Ekiti East, Ikere, Ekiti Southwest, Emure and Ise/Orun. Oyebanji\u2019s running mate, Mrs Mojisola Afuye hails from Ikere. With the votes from Ikere and party chieftains in the area, APC may likely win the zone.\n\n\n\nIn Ekiti South, the APC boasts of bigwigs like the Speaker, Ekiti State House of Assembly, Hon Funminiyi Afuye; two members of House of Representatives \u2013 Hon Femi Bamisile and Yemi Adaramodu; the APC State Chairman, Paul Omotoso; former Minister, Dayo Adeyeye and Chief Afolabi Ojuawo. These big wigs that can make things happen for the APC.\n\n\n\nOyebanji and Kolawole are from Ekiti Central Senatorial District, comprising five local government areas \u2013 Ado, Irepodun/Ifelodun, Efon, Ijero and Ekiti West. This is going to be a battleground. Oyebanji is from Ekiti West while Kolawole is from Efon.\n\n\n\nIn the last election, APC won four local governments in the senatorial zone and may still retain at least three this time, with the exception of Efon and Ado Ekiti.\n\n\n\nThe PDP may spring surprise in Efon because Kolawole hails from the town.\n\nThe influence of Segun Oni\u2019s Deputy, Ladi Owolabi in Ado Ekiti is also enormous. The large concentration of pensioners and civil servants, who seem to be backing Oni may also help the SDP tremendously in Ekiti Central.\n\nIn Ekiti Central, the APC also parades political heavyweights like the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Niyi Adebayo; Deputy governor, Bisi Egbeyemi and Senator Opeyemi Bamidele; These people are capable of doing the magic for APC. Victory for APC Ekiti Central may be by a narrow margin.\n\n\n\nEkiti North Senatorial District has always been a natural habitat and stronghold of Oni since 2007. The district has five councils \u2013 Ido/Osi, Moba, Ilejemeje, Ikole and Oye local governments. Oni is from Ido/Osi.\n\nAPC won the five councils in Ekiti North in the last election, but Oni was still in the ruling party then. As strong as Oni is in Ekiti North, he will meet a match in Fayemi, who is from the area.\n\n\n\nThe Director General, Biodun Oyebanji campaign council, Cyril Fasuyi, is also from Ekiti North. But Segun Oni still has visible and electrifying presence in Ido/Osi, Moba and Ilejemeje\n\nAPC also has influential politicians in Ekiti North.

          "text": "\n\n\n\nFidelis David in Akure\n\nGovernor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State yesterday blamed himself and government at all levels for failing to defend the victims of June 5 attack on St Francis Catholic Church, Owo, which claimed 40 lives.\n\n\n\nAkeredolu made the declaration during the funeral Mass for 18 of the victims, held at the Mydas Resort and Hotel, Owo.\n\n\n\nAkeredolu, who was at the event alongside his wife, Betty; former governor of the state, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko; Chairman of the state\u2019s chapter of the All Progressives Congress, Ade Adetimehin; and a chieftain of the APC, Chief Olusola Oke (SAN), stressed that evil will not triumph forever.\n\n\n\nAkeredolu, who wept during his speech, said the government failed to protect the victims of the terror attack.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cWe have failed to defend these people. Not because we have not tried, but because these forces on the other side are evil and they have support.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe noted that something must be done about security in the country, adding that the security architecture of the nation needs rejigging.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I see the sea of heads that are here, it speaks volumes. What has happened to us in Owo is indescribable. A lot of words are used to qualify it \u2013 dastardly, horrendous. But I still believe there are words to describe it but I am still short of those words.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have just 22 deceased in this hall. A few of them have been buried, because the relatives couldn\u2019t wait till today. But as at the last count, these animals came to the church and murdered 40 people.\u201d governor Akeredolu said.\n\n\n\nResponding, the Bishop of Ondo Catholic Diocese, Dr. Jude Arogundade declared that Akeredolu had not failed in protecting his people.\n\n\n\nBishop Arogundade said: \u201cYou didn\u2019t fail. You are a strong soldier. Your determination to protect those who voted you into power is unquestionable. This was done by cowards. You have tried your best.\u201d\n\nBishop Arogundade wondered why the people of the country need to beg for state police, despite the endless attack and killings, while thanking the governor for accepting to designate a memorial park in honour of the victims.\n\n\n\nHe stressed that those who created the situation that made the incident happen have blood on their hands.\n\nEarlier in his funeral Mass message, Catholic Bishop of Oyo Diocese, Most Rev Emmanuel Badejo called on relatives of the victims to allow God to fight their battle.\n\n\n\nBishop Badejo said: \u201cIt will not be an exaggeration at all to begin this funeral Mass with Psalm 22 where David said \u2018my God, my God, why have you forsaken me.\u2019 This is not a homily, I am not happy to preach at all, and it is not an occasion which any of you ever pray to witness in this side of the world or our country.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo doubt we all gather today in deep sorrow and mourning, for this funeral Mass for over 40 of our departed people who were brutally murdered, mindlessly massacred while at worship at St Francis Catholic Church, Owo, on Pentecost Sunday.\n\n\n\n\u201cIndeed, the event catapulted Ondo State, the Catholic Diocese of Ondo and Nigeria into the limelight of world attention, unfortunately, for the wrong reason. Since then, the world has condemned the crime perpetrated against humanity and against God in this state.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, there was no mass burial for the victims of the attack, as relatives individually took possession of the corpses and were seen taking them to their home of origin.\n\nSome of those who spoke with THISDAY said it was a taboo for an adult to be buried outside his or her home of origin.\n\n\n\nA mourner, Nwani Christopher Chudi said since the death of his brother who was the breadwinner of the family, had been a battle for survival.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cI lost somebody who was very dear to me, a senior brother, with the daughter; a promising child that we were hoping will be a person the family will depend on tomorrow. It was a tragic event on June 5 that somebody went to church and never came back.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt has been a trauma because he is the breadwinner of the family. In my nuclear family, I\u2019m the only surviving son. I have only five girls that are my younger ones to attend to. He used to support us, although he was married. You know Igbo tradition, once you are married, you have a wife, your siblings, are on their own. He will face his own immediate family, even the son that survived, that they call Victor, he just miraculously survived. It was God\u2019s grace because he was inside the church while the shooting was going on but he survived. We thank God.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe wife\u2019s BP had already risen above normal; her BP was already 180/170, which is very abnormal. You know she visited the hospital the other day. On two occasions, we took her to the hospital, since then she\u2019s not eating well, she\u2019s not sleeping, the trauma is so much.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was born and brought up in Owo, I don\u2019t have a father, I don\u2019t have a mother.My daddy has died likewise my mother. My late brother has been my pillar. I\u2019m a graduate; I graduated from University of Jos in 1996, no white-collar job.\u201d\n\nTears flowed freely from relatives of the victims and sympathizers who thronged the venue of the funeral Mass.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Abena, a voice assistant wants to preserve African languages",
          "text": "Like many kids who grew up with an elderly relative, Nana Ghartey was used to helping his grandmother out around the house. He was 9 years old, and they lived together in Winneba, a small town in Ghana about 65 kilometres east of the capital city of Accra. Ghartey told TechCabal that because his grandmother didn\u2019t have the best eyesight and had trouble walking around, he regularly had to support her in completing basic tasks and functions: turning the lights in her home on and off, operating the radio and TV, and dialling numbers on her mobile phone on her behalf, and helping her check her phone credit balance. Another reason Ghartey needed to assist his grandmother was that she primarily speaks Fante, a tonal language native to the Akan tribe in Ghana and had trouble understanding the Western languages predominantly used by tech devices.\n\nBut in addition to being a dutiful young boy, Ghartey was also a budding computer geek. His late mother was a programmer at Wang Computers, so even as a toddler, Ghartey was used to being surrounded by them. With time, he slowly began to teach himself how to operate them; once he learned how to type, he was able to help his mum out with small tasks on Microsoft Word.\n\nGhartey, who is now 32, told TechCabal that he credits the needs of his grandmother during his adolescence and his early exposure to computers through his mother\u2019s profession as the inspiration and catalyst, respectively, of the artificial intelligence products he created, initially to help his grandmother out, Kofi, and the one he made for the wider public, Abena. They are the first voice assistants offered in Fante and Twi, respectively.\n\nFor all the opportunities technology affords to customise experiences by catering to users\u2019 needs with hyper-specificity, millions of Africans like Ghartey\u2019s grandmother, who either don\u2019t speak English or other Westernised languages or simply prefer not to, are often excluded from these benefits. The linguistic dominance of Western languages also threatens indigenous African languages; as big, Western-based tech companies spread their influence across Africa, both as service and product providers, and as job creators, indigenous languages are often deprioritised and nudged into the background.\n\nThe invention of the first voice assistant in 1992, Radio Rex, marked an era where computers developed the ability to translate on-screen actions or words into text. By 2010, the wealthiest American tech companies had launched language technologies: Siri was released that year, Google Now in 2012, and Alexa in 2014. But these voice technologies support only Western languages and are unavailable in African languages because of the low-revenue opportunities in African markets.\n\nIt\u2019s not as though these behemoth tech companies lack the means to build products that support indigenous African languages. And, to be fair, some have made efforts to catch up, slowly but surely, like Google Translate\u2019s addition of 10 African languages to the platform last month. Some language experts argue that these companies are the only entities, along with robust AI labs (though often the two are linked), that can solve what they characterise as a \u201clow resources\u201d problem.\n\nGhartey has his own theories about that.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say they can\u2019t build such systems for African languages. Surely they can,\u201d he told TechCabal from Accra, where he now lives. \u201cThey\u2019ve prioritised the languages that they want to focus on first.\u201d\n\nSo rather than wait for big tech to do all of the problem solving, he\u2019s been working towards a solution for nearly a decade\u2014with a much smaller team and significantly fewer resources\u2014and has already made headway.\n\n\u201cWorking on voice tech for African languages has been a completely different ball game. Data set out there are based on religious text, so you end up building a system that has a bias for biblical words.\u201d\n\nBy the time Ghartey reached his teenage years, he was consumed by a desire to learn as much about computers as he could. In high school, he was the designated tech guy, often helping his classmates do things like connect to the internet on their phones. (This was 2005 when such functions weren\u2019t yet second nature.) Sometimes, because he wasn\u2019t allowed to use the campus computer lab, he skipped class and sneaked off to internet caf\u00e9s just to spend more time tinkering with them, he recalled to TechCabal. After years spent assisting his grandmother, he had become accustomed to using his skills to help anyone who needed it.\n\nHe still graduated, though, and went on to study Information Technology at the Ghana Telecom University in Accra. But Ghartey taught himself mobile app development and built desktop applications, websites, and eventually mobile games, none of which were part of his school curriculum, by reading the programming textbooks which an uncle who came visiting from the US had left behind. By the time graduation came around, Ghartey graduated top of his class and secured a scholarship to do a master\u2019s in software development, in a partnership programme between his alma mater in Accra and Coventry University, UK.\n\nHis prolonged stay in Accra meant that he would not be able to go back home to continue helping his grandmother. For a while, his younger sister stepped in to assist her, but eventually she moved out, too. Even after Ghartey received his master\u2019s, he stayed back in Accra and went on to build his mobile app development company, Mobobi LLC. But he knew he needed to come up with a solution to assist his grandmother in operating her tech devices and performing little chores, and quickly. After years of obsessive learning about computers, he knew the solution would be AI-driven, but at the time, he knew nothing about AI development.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy. I remember the sleepless nights reading research papers and benchmarking frameworks and tools to find the right solution for my grandmother. I knew that if I intended to bootstrap and ship a production build to the masses, I\u2019d need to further hone my skills in AI, so I set on a mission to educate myself on what was required, \u201d Ghartey told TechCabal.\n\nFirst, he addressed the most immediate need: that of his grandmother. Using her voice and that of his sister\u2019s as data, he built Kofi, a voice assistant that supported Fante, his grandmother\u2019s preferred language and one spoken by 6 million Ghanaians. The product enabled her to use mobile apps without having to scroll through the home screen, which was difficult for her due to her impaired vision. All she had to do was tap the side of the button to launch the Kofi app, and she could instantly receive news updates, play music, stream radio programmes, and follow Twitter trends\u2014curated by the AI with human moderators to prevent misinformation\u2014without having a Twitter account.\n\nGhartey said that when he introduced her to Kofi and asked her to try it out, she initially thought she was interacting with a real person and became frustrated at times when the voice assistant didn\u2019t comply with some of her commands. Ghartey had to explain to her some of Kofi\u2019s limitations, but that process helped him recognise how useful a native voice assistant could be for the wider public. In order to serve them, he would need to build a voice assistant in Ghana\u2019s most widely spoken language: Twi.\n\nThis would prove to be a much larger undertaking than Kofi. First of all, Ghartey didn\u2019t have nearly as much data to work with initially, and he already knew the next iteration would require a large data set so that he could offer the product in several different dialects in order to avoid bias toward certain intonations. Secondly, Twi, like many other languages in the south of the Sahara, is tonal; accent marks dictate tones and make a difference in communication, which demanded even more research.\n\nAnother important factor to consider was access. In Winneba, where he lived with his grandmother, internet connection was patchy and inconsistent. Ghartey didn\u2019t want his users to worry about constantly having to purchase data in order to use the app, which meant that Abena would need to function offline. (For context, with Apple\u2019s Siri, this offline feature is only available to users with iOS 15.) Abena\u2019s offline operation was also an effort to cut costs on his end; online operation would have required a server that processed thousands of user requests from users in real time, and thus enormous computing power from costly cloud servers.\n\nBut Ghartey knew his efforts would be worth it. He spent 6 years building Abena AI, and released it in the Google Play Store this April as a Mobobi product. (At that point, Mobobi had already gained some traction for Real Piano Teacher, a popular game that has amassed more than 20 million downloads and is the first Ghanaian-made game on Google Play Pass.) Just like the features offered on Kofi, users can check trending news on Twitter; follow weather reports; check, transfer, and recharge their airtime balances; and transfer money with their preferred mobile payment app, all using voice commands on Abena AI. The offline mode also supports an in-app community feature that allows users to send text messages, images, and videos with each other.\n\nThe reception was immediately enthusiastic. Just a few days after launching Abena AI, a health influencer shared a demo of the app on Twitter, which catapulted it to trending topic popularity and demonstrated the need of a voice assistant offered in a language that was the second most spoken in the country after English.\n\nSimilar to the way his grandmother benefitted from Kofi, Ghartey realised that in addition to being more linguistically inclusive, Abena AI also served people with visual impairments who speak or preferred to speak Twi, many of whom were elders. They became fast fans of Abena AI, he said, because it made it easier for them to check and recharge their credits from their phones, which otherwise required tech-savviness or Western language literacy.\n\nOnce Abena AI was out in the world, it was time to refine it, a task that turned out to be just as challenging as building the voice assistant in the first place. He couldn\u2019t afford to pay professional linguists to help him with the training data for Twi, so he crowdsourced translation data from users by using third-party pop-up apps that requested translations. That proved unsuccessful when he discovered that the responses users provided were either inaccurate, or complete diversions of the words he asked them to translate. He tried incentivising users by offering to pay 5 cedis ($0.6) per translation, which worked for a while, but eventually he ran out of money. He remained tenacious, though, and eventually hired religious translators who worked on church-related translations in Twi. Still, he said he is always on the lookout for more ways to gather information about the language.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a work in progress,\u201d he said, adding that he accounts for the context of every word and crowdsources information about dialects from Abena AI app users. \u201cYou need lots of data to build these models.\u201d\n\nLike Google Nest and Amazon Echo\u2014both hardware using their respective company\u2019s voice recognition software\u2014Abena also functions as a home automation system. Abena AI works with smart lights, smart plugs, and other smart home devices.\n\nIn the nearest future, Ghartey is looking to ship an update that will see Abena support 5 more Ghanaian languages and hire professional natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning engineers to speed up his work and help him ship updates to other African languages like Swahili, Kinyarwanda, Afrikaans, Sesotho, and isiZulu.\n\nGhartey works on Abena AI for 3 hours on workdays, while working full time at his company Mobobi, to allow him to keep bootstrapping it.\n\n\u201cThe feedback from a few people who tried Abena AI out before it was released kept us going. That smile on a 60-year-old\u2019s face as he listened to his airtime being read out without stress\u2014it was paving the way for people to perform tasks easily, tasks they\u2019d never been able to do in the past,\u201d Ghartey said.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "This article was co-authored by Koromone Koroye, Hannatu Asheloge, and Ngozi Chukwu\n\nAfrica\u2019s technology ecosystem as we know it is thriving and primed for astronomical growth and success in this decade. Over the past 5 years, our ecosystem has celebrated several key milestones:\n\nExits and acquisitions in the millions.\n\nImpressive funding rounds ranging from seed to Series C.\n\nThe arrival of new angel investors and venture funds eager to serve African entrepreneurs.\n\nBusiness and product expansions into multiple regions within Africa.\n\nWhile these milestones are valid and deserve amplification, we cannot ignore the diversity elephant in our meeting rooms, tech conferences, pitch stages, and panel sessions. Funding received by female-owned startups is still significantly low compared to what their male counterparts receive from foreign and local investors. In this widely-read piece by Max Culliver and Africa: The Big Deal, they paint a gloomy picture of existing gender disparities within Africa\u2019s venture funding space. In 2021, 93% of the funding in Africa went to male-led startups \u2013 a pretty shocking figure by any standard.\n\nBut the news isn\u2019t all doom and gloom. This year alone, we\u2019ve seen more African female founders raise capital for their startups and get accepted into reputable accelerators like Techstars Toronto Accelerator (Techstars Toronto) and Y Combinator (YC). This article aims to recognize some African female founders making great strides across various industries and sectors on the continent.\n\nThis list comprises women who are mothers, advocates, readers, dancers, hikers, swimmers, entrepreneurs, founders, and so much more.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "At a time when central banks around the world are mounting desperate battles to contain inflation, in Nigeria it could be a case of the country\u2019s central bank fanning embers of spiralling inflation, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit, EIU and economists at the World Bank.\n\nThe EIU in particular said the central bank might have been breaking the law which stipulates a limit beyond which it shall lend to government.\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank tightened monetary policy with a 150-basis point hike last month, supposedly to attain its 9% inflation target, but the same central bank has continued to directly finance government deficit in an unbridled manner, the economists say.\n\nWhen central banks around the world tighten monetary policy the primary goal is to curtail money supply, but there is a curious case in Nigeria where the central bank is tightening monetary policy and at the same time pumping more money into the system by deficit financing and by its development finance initiatives says the World Bank.\n\nAccording a report published Saturday by the EIU, \u201cthe CBN has continued to print money for the federal government, whose overdraft facility with the CBN reached N19trn (US$46bn) in April 2022, up from N17.4trn at end-2021. The CBN is also operating a range of direct lending schemes for the agricultural, manufacturing and energy sectors, currently totalling about N3.6trn (US$9bn).\u201d\n\nThe EIU said the ability of the CBN to tame Nigeria\u2019s inflation through raising rates is being undermined by its continued direct financing of the budget deficit. \u201cBuilding credibility in the target rate (of inflation) has not been a priority in recent years. The continued printing of money at the same time as tightening policy would prevent effective control of the price level,\u201d the EIU said.\n\nNigeria has rules that limit how much lending the central bank should offer the government and there are statutes that forbid the government from reckless borrowing, but the EIU inferred that these rules have been contravened repeatedly.\n\n\u201cAll prudential rules on the government borrowing through the (CBN\u2019s) overdraft facility have long been broken,\u201d the EIU said in its report.\n\nInflation is expected to continue to surge in Nigeria especially with elevated food prices rising by 19.5% year on year in May, but the EIU says the CBN\u2019s tolerance of high inflation over the years leading up to the rate hike in May has also made the task of resetting expectations far harder and. \u201cIt seems highly plausible that the CBN will continue financing a widening budget deficit through the overdraft facility,\u201d the EIU predicted, saying, \u201cif the overdraft gets larger, it would be a clear sign that the CBN is politically unable or unwilling to take a clear stance on inflation and the anchoring of expectations.\u201d\n\nThe World Bank on its part says the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s development finance intervention is fuelling inflation in the short term and weakening the ability of the apex bank to control inflation.\n\nIt argues that the CBN\u2019s continued provision of subsidised funding to certain sectors has to slow down as it is undermining the ability of commercial banks to lend on a risk-adjusted pricing basis. It added that the apex bank\u2019s disbursement in the private sector as its share of private sector credit rose from 6.5 per cent in 2019 to 10 per cent in 2021.\n\nIn a new report titled the \u2018Nigeria Development Update (June 2022): The Continuing Urgency of Business Unusual, the World Bank said, \u201cCBN disbursements are growing in funding the private sector, with the CBN\u2019s share of private sector credit rising from about 6.5 per cent at end-2019 to 10 per cent by end-2021.\n\nAlthough some of the COVID-related tools deployed by the CBN are being phased out (e.g., the moratorium on principal repayments on CBN-funded credits lapsed in March 2022), the Central Bank has introduced new intervention facilities without a publicly available evaluation of their impact.\u201d\n\nRead also: CBN, banks, NPA to fix export bottlenecks in 90 days\n\nOn Nigeria\u2019s lingering foreign exchange crisis, the EIU said, \u201cthe naira continues to weaken on the parallel market, which is an important indicator for inflation as the parallel market is widely used by businesses and individuals.\n\n\u201cForeign reserves have been relatively steady over the course of 2022, dropping by only 5%, but in terms of import cover are down considerably as a result of high international prices for food and fuel, especially. EIU projects import cover of 5.9 months in 2022, down from 7.2 months in 2021.\n\n\u201cThe CBN\u2019s inflexible currency regime and constrained ability to intervene have left it unable to meet the demand for hard currency on time or in full. Firms and individuals often have to turn to the parallel market, where the US dollar traded for N600:US$1 in early June, a 45% premium on the official NAFEX rate.\u201d",

We looked at the examination last year and improved on our lapses this year.

So, why are we waiting till the last minute?\n\n\u201cWe would be aiming to get this done by April and by the third term, we should be focusing on getting our pupils ready for JSS 1 and the third term will be a transition term for us.\u201d\n\nShe hinted that the Ministry plans to improve on the conduct of the examination next year, adding: \u201cWe will be introducing technology to help us know the cognitive ability of every child and help us produce a very robust analysis result to their parents.

Justice I.E Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja over his abuse and disobedience to laid down rules and regulations guiding the conduct of judicial officers in the course of their duty is receiving attention by the Investigation Department of the Code of Conduct Bureau, Abuja.\n\nMr. Peter Omoruyi Igbinedion who in his petition titled: Monday Iyore Osagie & ORS.V PDP &ORS, Suit No. PHC/ABJ/CS/ 598/2022 addressed to the Chairman of the Code of Conduct Bureau, CCB, in Abuja stated that \u201che has suffered terrible pains in connection with Justice Ekwo\u2019s breach of the Code of Conduct for public officers anchored on his unlawful acquisition of monetary benefits while performing his official duties\u201d.\n\nHe noted that \u201cas a member of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, his right has been affected by Justice Ekwo\u2019s grant of frivolous exparte orders, which conflict with the provisions of the CCB and Tribunal Act, saying it is unheard of that different ex-parte orders will be given on the same issue just for justice to be allowed to suffer untold abuse for monetary benefits.\n\nAccording to the petitioner: \u201d I Mr. Peter Omoruyi Igbinedion, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ward 12, Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State write this petition against Hon. Justice l.E Ekwo, of the Federal High Court, Abuja. That Hon. Justice l. E Ekwo had through his relationship with the Governor of Rivers State, His Excellency Barr, Nyesom Wike created crisis and division in Edo State chapter of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe PDP\u201d) in preparation of the 2023 general elections via the grant of ex-parte orders in lieu of financial consideration.\n\n\u201d Governor Wike allies in Edo State led by one Chief Dan Orbih, the National Vice Chairman of the PDP South South, kept running to Hon. Justice Ekwo\u2019s Court to truncate the activities of Edo PDP in preparation for the 2023 general elections by faulting and frustrating the legitimate activities of the party and legalizing the illegitimate activities of Governor Wike\u2019s allies in Edo State through frivolous exparte orders. His Lordship conduct above in my opinion violates Rule 1.4 of the Code of Conduct which states;\n\n\u201cThat the judge must be sensitive to the need to avoid contacts that may lead people to speculate that there is a special relationship between him and someone whom the judge maybe tempted to favour in some way in the course of his judicial duties\u201d.\n\nIgbinedion noted that the conduct of Hon. Justice Ekwo has presently placed the fate of Edo PDP in confusion, as the National Working Committee of his party is in possession of 2 separate results emanating from the just concluded PDP ward, Local Government Delegate Congresses and primaries in Edo State.\n\n\u201d One result from the Edo State PDP supervised by the National office of the PDP and another result from Chief Dan Orbih faction backed by Barr. Nyesom Wike and endorsed by Justice Ekwo.\n\n\u201d The National office of the PDP is presently in confusion thanks to the conducts of Hon. Justice Ekwo, which is characterized by the frivolous ex-parte orders he was granting in favour of Chief Dan Orbih\u2019s faction against the PDP in respect of the conduct of PDP congresses and primaries, which is in violation of Rule 3.5 of the Code of Conduct, which States;\n\n\u201cA judicial officer must avoid the abuse of the power of issuing interim injunctions, ex-parte\u201d.\n\n\u201cAfter the conduct of the Party Ward Congresses across various Wards in Edo State, Chief Dan Orbih and his team being dissatisfied with the outcome of the congresses, instead of approaching the appeal panel set up by the National Working Committee of PDP, rushed to Hon. Justice Ekwo\u2019s Court to obtain a restraining order through ex-parte application against the PDP from recognizing and accepting its own results. Justice delivered violates the principles of judicial precedent and the provisions of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution, as amended and the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act\u201d, he said.\n\nThe following are the other allegations against him:\n\n\u201d That in the light of the foregoing, Hon. Justice Ekwo is believed to have received certain financial inducements, which was obtained through third parties but now forms part of his personal assets, contrary to the contents of his assets declaration form with the Bureau and therefore abused his Judicial office for financial gains.\n\n\u201d That contrary to the provisions of Paragraph II of Part 1 of the Fifth Schedule of the 1999 Nigeria Constitution, as amended, Hon. Justice Ekwo being a public officer failed, refused and/or neglected to properly declare both his real and personal assets within the last four years and failed to submit himself for asset verification\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cThat there is urgent need for the verification of the items in the asset declaration form of Hon. Justice I.E Ekwo, presently in the custody of the Bureau.\n\n\u201d That Hon. Justice I.E Ekwo of Court No. 5 of the Federal High Court, Abuja be investigated for all the above allegations and if found wanting, be consequently prosecuted before the Code of Conduct Tribunal.\n\n\u201d Ekwo hastily ordered PDP to use and recognize the list/ result prepared by Chief Dan Orbih and his allies. Even though there was an earlier order from the Edo State High Court validating the result of the PDP Ward congresses across the State. Vide Victor Enoghama & ors .v. PDP & ors, Suit No. B/408/2022.\n\n\u201d His Lordship Order was in contradiction to the earlier order of the Edo State High Court on the same subject matter and also operated as appeal against the earlier Order of the Edo State High Court\u201d, he said.\n\nHe reiterated that the subject matter and material facts contained in the earlier judgment of the Edo State High Court is on all fours with the suit before Hon. Justice Ekwo and it was the outcome of the judgment of the Benin High Court that paved way for the conduct of the various Party primaries in Edo State ranging from House of Assembly, House of Representatives and Senate.\n\n\u201d It was after the conduct of the said party primaries that Hon. Justice Ekwo delivered a contradictory judgment invalidating the Party primaries already conducted. He further validated the results of the parallel primaries of Chief Dan Orbih\u2019s faction. Again, His Lordship sat as an appellate court against the Judgment of Edo State High Court, which is contrary to Rule 5 of the Code of Conduct for judicial officers, thereby exposing the dignity of the judiciary to public ridicule and tarnishing the public confidence and impartiality of the judiciary.\n\n\u201d Rule 5 states inter alia; \u201ca judge shall always conduct himself in such manner as to preserve the dignity of the judicial office and the impartiality and independence of the judiciary. Accordingly, a judge shall act with such restraint as is necessary to; a. Maintain public confidence in the impartiality and Independence of the Judiciary.\n\nWhen contacted, a top official of the Code of Conduct Bureau who does not want his name mentioned confirmed that the petition has been referred by the Chairman of the Bureau to the investigation department for further action.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

I\u2019m definitely an Igbo man. There\u2019s no doubt about that. I\u2019m from Delta State in the South-South, but if you\u2019re looking at the Igbos across the country, I\u2019m an Igbo man, I can\u2019t be counted out and that is the true situation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe issue of the vice presidency has not been on the debate where it will go to is actually premised on the fact that when the presidential candidate emerges he looks for what possible zone and what person can work with me and what can be part of the team that can make us actually succeed in governing the people aright. I think that is what informed the decision,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI am just a lucky person. Being from the South-South I am also an Igbo man and to that extent, I fit into all the divides, because my brother from the South-East, I\u2019m part of them. I am also part of the South-South, but that does not stop the agitation for the future as it stands for the Igbo for the presidency of this country,\u201d he added.\n\nHe described Atiku\u2019s emergence as the presidential candidate of the PDP as a good sign for the future of the South-East region.\n\n\u201cThere are two geo-political zones that feel shortchanged; The North-East (where Atiku is from) and the South-East geo-political zone, because none of them, no son from these zones have actually been president of this nation. They obviously have a point and I believe that we sympathize with them.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe also that since one of us has emerged from the North-East at this point in time, it\u2019s a good sign for the future, that if the North East has the opportunity and by God\u2019s grace Atiku becomes the president, then it\u2019s a good sign that the South-East will have the opportunity.\n\n\u201cBecause the next point in time what we will be talking about is that the South-East itself is the only zone that is left and they will lay claim to it,\u201d he said.\n\nOkowa, who noted that the unity of the country is the most important, said the priority should be given to building the nation and moving the country forward.\n\nHe described the selection process of the party\u2019s presidential and vice presidential candidates as a good step in the right direction.",

          "text": "Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, governor of Delta State and vice presidential candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), has said that he did not betray southern Nigeria by accepting to be Atiku Abubakar\u2019s running mate.\n\nThe Delta governor who was reacting to a statement from Southern and Middle Belt leaders accusing him of betraying the south, explained that he belonged to a political party that agreed to throw the presidential ticket open as the best way to rescue the nation.\n\nOkowa, who spoke on Arise Television on Friday night, said he would not join issues with any group on the issue, especially the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders\u2019 Forum (SMBLF) \u201cbecause they are leaders I hold in high esteem\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI want to respect our leaders; I always do and I believe that they have their opinions and they are well-meaning leaders so I am not going to join issues with them.\n\nHe explained that the important thing was that he belonged to a political party and was part of the decisions of the party, including agreement of it\u2019s leadership that the best part to rescue the nation was to throw the presidential ticket race open.\n\nThe vice-presidential candidate said \u201chaving agreed to that and also submitted myself to be a politician in the Peoples Democratic Party, I am ruled by the polices of the party as they are.\n\n\u201cAnd, since we have all agreed that we wanted to throw the presidential candidacy open and Atiku Abubakar emerged, the onus is for us to support him.\n\n\u201cWe are not expecting that he would be the candidate from the North and also have a vice presidential candidate from the North. That would be leading to further division.\u201d\n\nHe added that as a party craving to rebuild the nation, taking the right decisions that would foster unity of the nation was very important to the PDP.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about rebuilding this nation and our unity. So, to a very large extent, we have to take the right decisions, and having submitted myself to be a member of the PDP, I would have to submit myself to the decisions of the party and that is what has happened.\n\n\u201cThat does not mean a disrespect to the views of those leaders. They are leaders that I respect so much. But under this condition, they have to understand that I have committed myself to the PDP.\n\n\u201cI am a politician. If I am not, it may be different. So, I will have to play along to the collective decisions of the party and I want to appeal to them that they need to actually look at the issue as it is and be very cautious about the stands that we take.\n\n\u201cEvery statement we make, even while it is important that we make our decisions, it is important that we also realise that the unity of this nation is important and we need to move forward from whereever we are at the moment,\u201d Okowa said.\n\nOn adding strength to the presidential ticket of the PDP, he said that he was acceptable to the structures of the party across the nation having been in the party since inception and grown through political ranks.\n\n\u201cI am somebody who is a team-player which is very important for us, and we have various experiences in various elections before now.\n\n\u201cThough I am a governor, I have grown through the political ranks and I have played very critical roles in the party at some point in time.\n\n\u201cI believe that a combination of all these will enable me assist the presidential candidate of the party and the rest of the party leadership to be able to put up the right strategy for us to win the elections,\u201d he explained.\n\nOkowa said that he had a very clear understanding of what the issues in the polity were and how to navigate through them.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cI have a very clear understanding of the issues that have been put forth by our candidate and in terms of governance, I have been privileged to have started my politics at the grassroots.\n\n\u201cMy being in the Senate exposed me to national politics and issues of national development and I have been relating well with my colleagues as a governor in the last seven years, discussing what is best for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAll of these exposures are huge advantage, understanding grassroots and national politics and I think that will obviously enable me add strength to the ticket,\u201d he stated.\n\nOn unifying the party, Okowa said that he had started reaching out to his colleagues and other leaders of the party and that he was encouraged by the response so far.",

          "title": "Financial Inclusion: Experts identify gaps in CBN\u2019s set target",
          "text": "Experts in the nations financial sector have identified gaps in the set objectives by the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, to significantly reduce the number and percentage of adult Nigerians who are excluded from the formal Financial System of the country.\n\nSpeaking at the inaugural conference of Oriental News Nigeria with theme \u201cEngaging with critical groups to develop effective financial inclusion initiative\u201d which held on Thursday at the Sheraton hotel Ikeja Lagos, Dr Uju Ogubunka, CEO Bank Customers Association of Nigeria, stated that the financial inclusion policy of the federal government which commenced in 2012 is geared towards ensuring that no Nigerian is short changed in its financial intermediations policies and economic development plans.\n\nOgubunka said that the government then out of the 84 percent financially excluded population, targeted to achieve 20 percent financial inclusion by year 2020.\n\n\u201cThe adult population has now increased above 84 percent and the un banked population has also increased remarkably. If the people are outside the financial system, the economy will not develop\u201d Ogubunka stated.\n\nHe explained that financial inclusion commences with opening bank account, which factors in the account holder towards benefiting from all forms of government\u2019s financial support as the account drives all other transactions of the account holder.\n\nAlso, to have insurance policy, investment accounts in the capital market, pension account and all forms of life and business enabling transactions driven only by the nation\u2019s financial system, you need to be financially included, he stressed.\n\n\u201cAs some of us will remember, the CBN initiated the National Financial Inclusion Programme in year 2012 that is, about a decade ago. The Programme is kind of a response to the discovery from a study in 2010 that about 39.2 million or 46.3% of the then 84.7 million adult population in the country were excluded from the formal Nigerian Financial System.\n\n\u201cThat meant that 45.5 million or 53.7% of the 84.7 million were included in the system. It was also noted that of the excluded 39.2 million adult Nigerians, about 21.3 million or 54.4% were females; meaning that about 17.9 million (i.e. 45.6%) were males. So, females accounted for a higher number and percentage of the excluded than males. On the other hand, males accounted for a higher number and percentage of those included in the Nigerian Financial System.\u201d he stated.\n\nOgubunka, pointed that the above situations were identified to have negative/adverse consequences/implications for the financial system and the economy, especially as almost half of the financial resources in the country were in the hands of people operating outside the formal financial system.\n\nHe said, \u201cConsequent on the foregoing, the CBN saw the need to redress it. Thus, it floated the Financial Inclusion programme and supported it with a Strategy Document tagged \u201dNational Financial Inclusion Strategy\u201d that encapsulated, among many othe\n\nthings, the Strategy Objectives, Strategy Stakeholders and their Interests, and Key Financial Inclusion Targets. The initiative targeted a reduction of the rate of the excluded from 46.3% to 20% come year 2020. ( i.e. a reduction of 26.3%), meaning that the percentage of the included would rise to 80% from 53.7% within the same period.\u201d\n\nHe said, Stanmeg Communication publishers of Oriental News, Nigeria, have provided this platform for the audience here gathered to brainstorm and contribute towards achieving total inclusion of all eligible adult Nigerians in the Financial System in order to drive and attain higher growth and development in both the Financial System and the National Economy, for the benefit of all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cI am impressed with this provided opportunity and therefore Congratulate the Organisers for their initiative which is worthy of emulation. By this, they have shown that they are concerned and serious minded stakeholders in the Nigerian Financial System and of colours, the economy.\u201d\n\nThe guest speaker, Mallam Garba Kurfi, Managing Director APT Securities and Fubds Limited buttressed that financial inclusion policy of the government helps to ensures that funds that could have been deployed for entrepreneurial initiatives don\u2019t end up in cupboards at homes.\n\nManaging Director; CEO Arms Securities Limited, Mr Rotimi Edu, representing Mallam Kufre, in his presentation said that the government is recording remarkable progress in the financial inclusion target, adding more hands are on deck to ensure that economic advantage of the country\u2019s large population translates to financial benefits to the people and institutions.\n\nThe government, he stated has designed financial support initiatives for rural women, artisans, petty traders, the financially disadvantaged, which can only be extended to only people who operates bank accounts.\n\nHe said that funds are aggregated through savings in banks, investments in capital market or taking policies in insurance companies, such funds are further deployed to catalize economic development through lending or for institutional growth.\n\nEarlier in her opening address, Editor Oriental News Nigeria , Mrs Yemisi Izuora said that the conference was conceived by Stanmeg Communications, publishers of Oriental News Nigeria after a pain staking study the progress and prospects of the financial inclusion policy in the country since inception in 2012.\n\n\u201c The conference is being organised given that the past couple of years , the federal government and stakeholders in the financial sector have had to deal with expanding financial services tp large community of underserved pupulation and dealing with resilience challenges brought about by confluence of events that have taken place\u201d Izuora stated.\n\nExecutive Director, Centre for Citizens with Disability (CCD) David O. Anyaele however called on the federal government as well as the Central bank of Nigeria (CBN) to expand the nation\u2019s financial inclusion policy to include provisioning for the disabled people in the society.\n\nHe bemoaned the sustained lack of considerations for the disabled in the Nigerian financial system through different kinds of neglect and rights denials.\n\nAnyaele stated that audit of bank branches across the country showed the total absence or lack of access and convenience facilities for the disabled.\n\nHe admonished prevailing attitudes of the financial systems against the disabled, describing it as major institutional barrier to financial inclusion",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nIn continued efforts to grow the economy through the mining sector, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite, Thursday, has wooed investors abroad with huge gold, lead-zinc, iron-ore and barite deposits in Nigeria.\n\nAdegbite made the revelations\n\nin his paper titled \u2018The Mechanisms of Transparency and Commitment in Mining Governance as Tool for Attracting Foreign Direct Investment to Nigeria\u2019 on the Nigerian Day at the \u20182022 Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada, PDAC, International Convention, Trade Show and Investors Exchange\u2019 in Toronto, Canada.\n\nHe also assured them of the Buhari-led administration\u2019s resolve to give the best of incentives never found anywhere in the world to interested and serious investors.\n\nHe made it clear that Nigeria\u2019s solid minerals are ranked among the best in quality and quantity as these minerals are rated highest in return on investment, because they are closer to surface and low cost in production.\n\nHe added that the Nigerian Government was seriously focusing on the solid minerals sector, which investors and investments bare top on its priority list as as far as policies are concerned which make the mining sector very business friendly because of mechanisms put in place to promote ease of doing business as this is built on strong policy and regulatory structure is very the years.\n\nMeanwhile, according to him, the robust structure, line by line, was the reason Nigeria has been seeking to attract investment into the sector.\n\nHowever, the Minister acknowledged the the fact that global economies have experienced unprecedented challenges since the break out of COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result the conference is holding in June.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigeria has been part of this event for several years because of our determination to see exponential growth of the mining sector\u2019s contribution to our GDP more than it has done in the past forty years.\n\n\u201cWe are here to collaborate and network with global leaders, professionals, investors, Chief Executives of junior, mid-tier and major mining companies. It is also on this premise that the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, in collaboration with industry stakeholders, vowed to pull resources and consolidate on the 2016 Roadmap for the Growth and Development of the Nigerian Mining Industry.\n\n\u201cIn pursuit of the goals set forth in the roadmap, the government initiated an ambitious reform regime in the sector, the flagship of which was the National Integrated Mineral Exploration Programme, NIMEP, designed to rapidly generate bankable geoscientific data with the aim of de-risking the sector and attracting high caliber investments.\n\n\u201cTarget minerals under the first phase include Gold, Lead-Zinc, Iron Ore, and the Battery Minerals, among others. The contractors have executed and completed the exploration works on Gold, Platinum Group of Elements, PGEs, Lead-Zinc, Iron Ore and Barites.\n\n\u201cCurrently, there is an ongoing review of the Nigerian Minerals and Mining Act 2007, aimed at bringing legislation into conformity with global best practices, limiting the role of government to that of regulation, and creating the space for the private sector to maintain a more expansive presence in the sector.\n\n\u201cThe early evidence that our framework is on the right track is the inflow of notable investments.\n\n\u201cThese include Thor Exploration Limited\u2019s Segilola Gold Mine Project, in Osun State, which has an initial production capacity of 80,000 ounces of gold annually, representing the first large-scale Gold Mine in Nigeria.In June last year, we commissioned the Dukia Gold & Precious Metals Refinery, DGPMR, Project.\n\n\u201cThe company set out to be a foremost indigenous refiner and trader of gold and other precious metals. Its potential impact on the gold sector is nothing short of revolutionary.\n\n\u201cBy providing offtake opportunities through the establishment of Precious Metals Buying Centres, it serves as a spur for more small and medium scale mining investment, while its refinery symbolizes its focus on value addition in the gold and precious metals industry in Nigeria and West Africa.\n\n\u201cA similarly remarkable investment is the integrated Iron Ore Mining and Processing Plant set up by African Natural Resources and Mines Limited (ANRML) in Kaduna, which has an initial production capacity of 4.704 million tons of iron per annum and will scale up to 5.88 million tons per annum by 2025.\n\n\u201cIn line with the economic diversification plan of the Government, my Ministry has issued a Request for Qualifications for bidders interested in receiving concessions to begin the production of bitumen in Nigeria as the country possesses about 42 billion tons of proven reserves of bitumen, estimated to be the sixth largest in the world.\n\n\u201cThese blocks are located close to key ports for export purposes and import of mining equipment, and railways cutting across areas with bitumen deposits.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we seek for suitably qualified investors with pre-requisite experience, technological expertise and financial capacity for the development of bitumen resources in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAdegbite also made it known that, \u201cResults on Greenfields and Brownfields are on process to be declared for investment opportunities.\n\n\u201cWe have also commenced the process of retrieving Nigeria\u2019s colonial geological data from the United Kingdom by engaging the British Geological Survey, BGS, to build a national electronic geo-data archiving management system to be called the Nigerian Geo-Data Center at the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA.\n\n\u201cThis would provide easy access to geoscience data for prospective investors on potential areas to target for exploration and mining within and outside Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAlso, he made it known to that there are a lot of incentives enshrined in the Nigeria Minerals and Mining Act, 2007, which include:Customs and import duties waiver for plant, machinery and equipment imported for mining operations; Tax holidays of between three to five years as applicable;Free transferability of funds and permission to retain and use earned foreign exchange;Capital allowances of up to 95% of qualifying capital expenditure; Deductibility of Environmental Costs (money meant for environmental remediation will be tax free); and100% ownership of mineral properties.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, part of our modest efforts towards achieving the desired aim is repositioning the Mining Cadastre Office to promote transparency in mineral title administration.\n\n\u201cThe processes have been streamlined to enable investors to apply online and obtain licenses and leases within and outside Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFrom the revenue drive perspective, the Nigerian Mining Sector has demonstrated a marked improvement despite the challenges of the pandemic. The secret of the sudden jump can be attributed to the introduction of \u201cFirst Come, First Served\u201d and \u201cUse it or Lose it\u201d in the licensing administration,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe further stated that this has helped to re-organize, eliminate speculators, and led to the revocation of about 1,566 mineral titles, activated many dormant licenses and increased revenue inflow into the treasury.",

          "text": "The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu, has described President Muhammadu Buhari as a \u201ctrue leader, brother and friend\u201d who demonstrated a \u201csense of purpose, composure, and maturity\u201d in the weeks leading to the Special Convention of the Party.\n\nSpokesman for the president, Femi Adesina in a statement on Saturday disclosed that Tinubu\u2019s compliments were contained in a letter personally signed by the APC chieftain.\n\nTinubu expressed gratitude for the President\u2019s congratulatory letter to him, adding that while all the contestants expected President Buhari to \u201cchoose\u201d his successor, he simply allowed a level playing field.\n\n\u201cYou belonged to everybody in the party and you belonged to none of the individual candidates of the party,\u201d Asiwaju\u2019s correspondence partly read.\n\nHe congratulated the president for the successful conclusion of the convention and assured him of an issue focused campaign leading to the 2023 general elections.\n\nBelow is the full text of the letter as presented by Mr Femi Adesina\n\nREAD ALSO: We Are In Talks With Peter Obi, Says Kwankwaso\n\nDear Mr President,\n\nDEEP APPRECIATION\n\nI bring you sincere fraternal greetings and congratulations on the successful conclusion of the special Presidential Convention of our great party, the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nOn behalf of my wife, Oluremi, and my entire family, I want to express my sincere gratitude for the very special and personal congratulatory letter you sent to me. I am deeply honored. Your words in that letter were reassuring, reenergizing, and reinvigorating.\n\nYour Excellency, one must admire the sense of purpose, composure, and maturity you demonstrated in the weeks and months preceding the primary elections of our great party. As aspirants and party leaders, we all pleaded with you to \u201cchoose\u201d your successor.\n\nNaturally, this is expected especially in African democracy. Up until the 6th of June, 2022, the day of the APC Presidential primaries, the whole of Nigeria, including myself, was waiting for you to announce your preferred candidate. All of us thought and believed this was a very simple matter.\n\nHowever, it was only as the primary went into the night and as the candidates walked up to the podium and spoke that I fully and truly appreciated your position and stance to be neutral and non-aligned to any of us. As the first person to speak, I also had the special vantage point to carefully hear, without any distraction, what the other candidates had to say.\n\nAs the hours rolled by that evening, it became clear to me that all of us were your preferred candidates. As you captured it aptly in your letter to me, the \u201cspirit\u201d of 2013 and 2014 when we created and built APC was there for all to see.\n\nIn your letter and in our many meetings over the years, you fondly reminisced on fraternal attitude in the days and months before and after formation of the APC, when we all worked day and night to create, sustain and nurture our nascent movements into a credible opposition party and ultimately, become the ruling party. That time, no one spoke about tribe; no one spoke about religion. That was not what drove us. We were driven by a common desire to save and transform Nigeria.\n\nOne by one, I saw my colleagues and partners stand on the podium, full of the same passion and patriotic zeal they had in 2013/2014, presenting their ideas on how to build on your successful legacy. Back then, as it is now, we were from all parts of the country, all tribes, and all religions. We all had deep personal and strong bonds with you. We were together back then and our bonds remained strong up till now.\n\nMr. President, as the night of 6 June turned to morning of 7 June, I fully understood and appreciated your stance. \u201cYou belonged to everybody in the party and you belonged to none of the individual candidates of the party.\u201d A true leader, brother and friend.\n\nMr. President, the delegates from all over the country nominated my humble self to be their candidate. I must acknowledge that my nomination would not have become a reality without your support and that of the party leaders across the country. Indeed, as I reflect on my political journey, most of the 2022 APC presidential aspirants, members of the Progressive Governors Forum and National Assembly leaders and members all had a role to play in my successes and achievements thus far.\n\nI will forever be grateful to them for shaping my political journey over the decades. I want to assure you that I will continue to work with them going forward. My emergence as a candidate is also a victory for them.\n\nI have met most of them in the past few days and will continue these engagements as we plan for the general elections. Mr. President, APC is united and will remain united as we move towards the general elections.\n\nI have taken note of the message you sent to all Presidential Candidates in your Democracy Day speech to the nation on the 12th June, 2022. Our country is going through a very sensitive period and no one should put their personal desires above and beyond the nation\u2019s peace and prosperity. As you said, the \u201cmessage we set at the top will be replicated in our followers.\u201d At this point, I will take this opportunity to assure Your Excellency of my commitment to running an issue focused campaign as we move into the general elections. I will personally engage the candidates from other political parties to urge them to do same. Voters should elect us based on our policies, programmes, and projects. By the grace of God, we as candidates will avoid having divisive, destructive and disruptive campaigns.\n\nI will conclude by once again thanking you for being there for all of us. By the grace of God and with your leadership, guidance and support, I am confident that we will lead our great party, the APC, to victory in the February 2023 general elections. We will ride on the back of your successes. We will build on the foundations of transparency and integrity which you have laid.\n\nMr President, together, side by side, in the spirit of 2014, we will win and Nigeria will move forward to a progressive, peaceful and prosperous future.\n\nAsiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu\n\nAPC Presidential Candidate",

          "text": "Channels Television and Yiaga Africa have launched an Election Results Analysis Dashboard (ERAD) to promote transparency of election results.\n\nThe dashboard is based on official results uploaded on the INEC\u2019s Results Viewing Portal (IReV).\n\nIReV involves scanning or photographing Polling Unit result sheets (Form EC 8A) once they are completed and verified and subsequently uploading the pictures to a dedicated backend server.\n\nAt the front end, the portal allows members of the public to create personal accounts and log-in details with which they can gain access to all uploaded results stored as PDF files.\n\nThe real-time publishing of polling unit-level results and transmission of results using the IReV demonstrates INEC\u2019s commitment to transparency in results management. This commitment is backed by the Electoral Act 2022, which confers INEC with powers to transmit election results electronically.\n\nWhile the introduction of IReV has increased public confidence in results management, it offers wide-ranging opportunities for public information based on data directly sourced from INEC\u2019s portal and backed by informed analysis of the results.\n\nFor this reason, the ERAD is developed to support INEC by providing the public with access to election results from the polling unit in relative real-time. To achieve this goal, the Election Results Analysis Dashboard will be embedded within the election-day broadcast of Channels Television.\n\nIn addition, the ERAD will provide an independent audit and integrity test of INEC\u2019s election results management system by tracking results from the polling units based on Commission\u2019s own published results.\n\nThe business process of the ERAD entails download, extraction, and verification of results from the IReV, visualization of the data in diverse formats, scriptwriting, and expert analysis of the results.\n\nYiaga Africa and Channels Television recognize INEC\u2019s constitutional mandate to declare electoral outcomes; therefore, the ERAD will not declare any party or candidate winner of the election.\n\nThe ERAD will be limited to publicizing results released by INEC on its online portal. With this innovation, members of the public with limited internet access to the results viewing portal can obtain polling unit results through the ERAD.\n\nIt is important to note that Yiaga Africa is deploying the Parallel Vote Tabulation (PVT) for the Ekiti election. While the PVT is based on results declared by INEC officials from a random sample of polling units and transmitted by Yiaga Africa citizens observers to the Watching The Vote data center in Ado-Ekiti, the ERAD is strictly based on official results uploaded on the INEC results viewing portal. Both tools will play a complementary role in ensuring the Ekiti election pass the electoral integrity test.\n\nAs partners, we expect that the net effect of the ERAD will be improved public confidence in election results management and the broader electoral process.",

          "text": "Some asylum claimants who arrived in the UK in small boats or in the back of lorries could be electronically tagged under a new Home Office trial.\n\nA 12-month trial could affect adults due to be removed from the UK after arriving via what the government calls \u201cdangerous or unnecessary\u201d routes.\n\nThe first to be tagged will likely be people who successfully challenged their removal to Rwanda this week.\n\nCritics say the plan treats those fleeing persecution as criminals.\n\nThe pilot comes days after the first flight taking asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda was cancelled following a last-minute intervention by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).\n\nThe Home Office said the trial, which began on Thursday in England and Wales, would test whether tagging helps maintain regular contact with asylum claimants and progresses their claims more effectively. It will also collect data on how many people abscond.\n\nPeople who have been tagged may be subject to a curfew, and those who fail to comply with their conditions could be taken back to detention, or prosecuted.\n\nThe guidance says those who are informed that they are to be removed from the UK may be at an increased risk of absconding and and have less incentive to comply with immigration bail conditions.\n\nIt is unclear exactly how decisions will be made on who to tag, but Home Office guidance says it will not include children or pregnant women.\n\nCaseworkers must also consider whether the device would cause serious harm to the person\u2019s mental or physical health, or whether they have been a victim of torture or modern slavery.\n\nHowever, the guidance says these factors do not in themselves prohibit imposing a tag.\n\nThose with the location-tracking device will be required to regularly report in person to an immigration centre or police station.\n\nThe idea of tagging will, the government hopes, show it is serious in getting tough on those it believes are exploiting the asylum system.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear how many people will be tagged \u2013 or how keen immigration judges will be to introduce electronic monitoring as part of any bail conditions.\n\nAnd groups supporting refugees say once again government policy will lead to vulnerable people being demonised.\n\n2px presentational grey line\n\nEnver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: \u201cIt\u2019s appalling that this government is intent on treating men, women and children who have fled war, bloodshed and persecution as criminals.\n\n\u201cThis draconian and punitive approach not only shows no compassion for very vulnerable people; it will also do nothing to deter those who are desperately seeking safety in the UK.\u201d\n\nBut a Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe government will not be deterred as we plan for the next flight to Rwanda.\n\n\u201cWe will keep as many people in detention as the law allows, but where a court orders that an individual due to be on Tuesday\u2019s flight should be released, we will tag them where appropriate.\u201d\n\nIt comes as Home Secretary Priti Patel said a decision by a European court which effectively grounded the first Rwanda-bound removal flight was \u201cabsolutely scandalous\u201d and politically motivated.\n\nJudges at the ECHR granted an injunction that left a chartered plane to Kigali unable to depart.\n\nMs Patel told the Daily Telegraph the court had been \u201copaque\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know who the judges are, we don\u2019t know who the panel are, we haven\u2019t actually had a judgment \u2013 just a press release and a letter saying we can\u2019t move this person under rule 39,\u201d she said.\n\nThe ECHR protects civil and political rights established in the aftermath of World War Two. It is separate to the EU.\n\nThe Rwanda plan, announced by the government in April, intends to give some migrants who cross the Channel to the UK a one-way ticket to Rwanda to claim asylum there instead.\n\nThe government has said the scheme, which has come at an initial cost of \u00a3120m, would discourage others from crossing the Channel, although Home Office civil servants have not been able to precisely quantify the benefits of the policy.\n\nBBC",

          "text": "Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State in Nigeria\u2019s southwest on Friday blamed himself and government at all levels for failing to defend the victims of June 5 attack on St Francis Catholic Church, Owo, which claimed 40 lives.\n\nAkeredolu made the declaration during the funeral Mass for 18 of the victims, held at the Mydas Resort and Hotel, Owo.\n\nAkeredolu, who was at the event alongside his wife, Betty; former governor of the state, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko; Chairman of the state\u2019s chapter of the All Progressives Congress, Ade Adetimehin; and a chieftain of the APC, Chief Olusola Oke (SAN), stressed that evil will not triumph forever.\n\nAkeredolu, who wept during his speech, said the government failed to protect the victims of the terror attack.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cWe have failed to defend these people. Not because we have not tried, but because these forces on the other side are evil and they have support.\u201d\n\nHe noted that something must be done about security in the country, adding that the security architecture of the nation needs rejigging.\n\n\u201cWhen I see the sea of heads that are here, it speaks volumes. What has happened to us in Owo is indescribable. A lot of words are used to qualify it \u2013 dastardly, horrendous. But I still believe there are words to describe it but I am still short of those words.\n\n\u201cWe have just 22 deceased in this hall. A few of them have been buried, because the relatives couldn\u2019t wait till today. But as at the last count, these animals came to the church and murdered 40 people.\u201d governor Akeredolu said.\n\nResponding, the Bishop of Ondo Catholic Diocese, Dr. Jude Arogundade declared that Akeredolu had not failed in protecting his people.\n\nBishop Arogundade said: \u201cYou didn\u2019t fail. You are a strong soldier. Your determination to protect those who voted you into power is unquestionable. This was done by cowards. You have tried your best.\u201d\n\nBishop Arogundade wondered why the people of the country need to beg for state police, despite the endless attack and killings, while thanking the governor for accepting to designate a memorial park in honour of the victims.\n\nHe stressed that those who created the situation that made the incident happen have blood on their hands.\n\nEarlier in his funeral Mass message, Catholic Bishop of Oyo Diocese, Most Rev Emmanuel Badejo called on relatives of the victims to allow God to fight their battle.\n\nBishop Badejo said: \u201cIt will not be an exaggeration at all to begin this funeral Mass with Psalm 22 where David said \u2018my God, my God, why have you forsaken me.\u2019 This is not a homily, I am not happy to preach at all, and it is not an occasion which any of you ever pray to witness in this side of the world or our country.\n\n\u201cNo doubt we all gather today in deep sorrow and mourning, for this funeral Mass for over 40 of our departed people who were brutally murdered, mindlessly massacred while at worship at St Francis Catholic Church, Owo, on Pentecost Sunday.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the event catapulted Ondo State, the Catholic Diocese of Ondo and Nigeria into the limelight of world attention, unfortunately, for the wrong reason. Since then, the world has condemned the crime perpetrated against humanity and against God in this state.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, there was no mass burial for the victims of the attack, as relatives individually took possession of the corpses and were seen taking them to their home of origin.\n\nSome of those who spoke with THISDAY said it was a taboo for an adult to be buried outside his or her home of origin.\n\nA mourner, Nwani Christopher Chudi said since the death of his brother who was the breadwinner of the family, had been a battle for survival.\n\nHe said: \u201cI lost somebody who was very dear to me, a senior brother, with the daughter; a promising child that we were hoping will be a person the family will depend on tomorrow. It was a tragic event on June 5 that somebody went to church and never came back.\n\n\u201cIt has been a trauma because he is the breadwinner of the family. In my nuclear family, I\u2019m the only surviving son. I have only five girls that are my younger ones to attend to. He used to support us, although he was married. You know Igbo tradition, once you are married, you have a wife, your siblings, are on their own. He will face his own immediate family, even the son that survived, that they call Victor, he just miraculously survived. It was God\u2019s grace because he was inside the church while the shooting was going on but he survived. We thank God.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe wife\u2019s BP had already risen above normal; her BP was already 180/170, which is very abnormal. You know she visited the hospital the other day. On two occasions, we took her to the hospital, since then she\u2019s not eating well, she\u2019s not sleeping, the trauma is so much.\n\n\u201cI was born and brought up in Owo, I don\u2019t have a father, I don\u2019t have a mother.My daddy has died likewise my mother. My late brother has been my pillar. I\u2019m a graduate; I graduated from University of Jos in 1996, no white-collar job.\u201d\n\nTears flowed freely from relatives of the victims and sympathizers who thronged the venue of the funeral Mass.\n\nFidelis David in Akure",

          "text": "Thousands of voters will on Saturday file out in Ekiti State to elect a new governor that will succeed Kayode Fayemi who is at the tail end of his second four-year tenure.\n\nNo fewer than 16 political parties are fielding candidates for the election, but it is expected to be a fierce battle involving Biodun Oyebanji of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC); Segun Oni of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and Bisi Kolawole of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nFor most of Friday, tension remained very high across the state, with voters bitterly divided among the three leading candidates. Fear of violence was palpable.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nFor seamless conduct of Saturday\u2019s election in Ekiti State, the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, on Friday ordered the restriction of vehicular movements along entry and exit points to the state from 12:00am on 18th June, 2022 to 6:00pm of the same day.\n\nThe police added: \u201cTo this end, operatives of the Nigeria Police Force and the military, as well as other security agencies have been deployed across the state borders to enforce the restriction order to the letter and ensure criminal minded individuals do not infiltrate the State.\u201d\n\nThe Deputy Inspector General of Police, Johnson Kokumo had earlier disclosed that Ekiti State would be properly secured to avoid any breakdown of law and order during the poll.\n\nHe also revealed that a total of 17,000 personnel had been deployed for the poll.\n\nThe DIG added that soldiers would be at the borders of the communities to prevent any form of intrusion.\n\nAccording to him, all security operatives with VIPs should be withdrawn and returned to base for the purpose of the election. The DIG called on the people to be law abiding and to respect all the processes of the elections to be able to have a peaceful governorship election in the state.\n\nINEC Says it is Ready\n\nINEC spent most of Friday moving sensitive voting materials to the wards, while assuring all that the election would be free and fair.\n\nThe electoral umpire had earlier revealed that 988,923 voters captured in the Commission\u2019s register would decide who becomes the new Ekiti State Governor.\n\nINEC Chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu appealed to staff of the commission to be neutral and abide by the code of conduct signed by them.\n\nHe said: \u201cI appeal to you to uphold our Code of Conduct, display your usual sense of responsibility and professionalism; remain above board and firmly resist any unethical behaviour.\u201d\n\nHe further charged them to ensure that no political party or candidate was accorded any advantage over the other.\n\n\u201cWe must also always stick strictly to the oath of neutrality to which we have all subscribed and continually live up to the trust that Nigerians repose in us,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nThe National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said 734,746 persons had collected their Permanent Voters Card for the election.\n\nOkoye assured electorates of the commission\u2019s readiness to conduct a free, fair and credible election.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is now a matter of common knowledge that we have 16 LGAs in Ekiti State and the election will be staged in 177 registration areas.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, yesterday said it would deploy 9,747 personnel drawn from FCT, Lagos, Ondo, Ogun, Osun, Oyo, Kogi, Kwara and Edo commands to provide security for the election.\n\nAddressing personnel at the Ekiti State Command headquarters of the NSCDC in Ado Ekiti, before they moved to their respective places of deployment, Acting Deputy Commandant General Operations, Lawal Haruna, disclosed that some flash points had already been identified and would be properly monitored.\n\nOni Alleges Intimidation\n\nThe SDP candidate yesterday alleged that some desperate politicians were already violating the peace accord signed this week before the Abdudalami Abubakar-led National Peace Commission.\n\nOni said rather than adhering to the tenets of democracy in the conduct of the June 18 Ekiti election, those he described as \u201coppressors\u201d, had allegedly been dehumanising and demobilising his supporters through unlawful arrests.\n\nOni, who addressed pressmen in Ado Ekiti, alerted INEC, international community, security agencies, observers and other stakeholders, saying \u201cfor this election to be acceptable, the REC must stamp and sign all forms EC8A, EC8B, EC8C and EC8D and not by any other agent or staff. Once the REC stamps and signs, nobody will be able to smuggle any form of fake results.\u201d\n\nOn the imperative of peace for the election to be successful, Oni said: \u201cI will keep to the peace accord. But when you are kidnapping people, it renders every peace document invalid. Let us tell them not to set this state on fire.\n\n\u201cThose who had been going round to kidnap my supporters should be called to order now. They are testing the patience and tolerance of the people. They shouldn\u2019t set this state on fire. If anybody commits an offence and they think they are the authorities to go round and arrest people at night, then the peace accord becomes shattered immediately.\u201d\n\nHow the Battle will Be Fought\n\nThe APC looks good to win Ekiti South Senatorial District, comprising six local governments \u2013 Gbonyin, Ekiti East, Ikere, Ekiti Southwest, Emure and Ise/Orun. Oyebanji\u2019s running mate, Mrs Mojisola Afuye hails from Ikere. With the votes from Ikere and party chieftains in the area, APC may likely win the zone.\n\nIn Ekiti South, the APC boasts of bigwigs like the Speaker, Ekiti State House of Assembly, Hon Funminiyi Afuye; two members of House of Representatives \u2013 Hon Femi Bamisile and Yemi Adaramodu; the APC State Chairman, Paul Omotoso; former Minister, Dayo Adeyeye and Chief Afolabi Ojuawo. These big wigs that can make things happen for the APC.\n\nOyebanji and Kolawole are from Ekiti Central Senatorial District, comprising five local government areas \u2013 Ado, Irepodun/Ifelodun, Efon, Ijero and Ekiti West. This is going to be a battleground. Oyebanji is from Ekiti West while Kolawole is from Efon.\n\nIn the last election, APC won four local governments in the senatorial zone and may still retain at least three this time, with the exception of Efon and Ado Ekiti.\n\nThe PDP may spring surprise in Efon because Kolawole hails from the town.\n\nThe influence of Segun Oni\u2019s Deputy, Ladi Owolabi in Ado Ekiti is also enormous. The large concentration of pensioners and civil servants, who seem to be backing Oni may also help the SDP tremendously in Ekiti Central.\n\nIn Ekiti Central, the APC also parades political heavyweights like the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Niyi Adebayo; Deputy governor, Bisi Egbeyemi and Senator Opeyemi Bamidele; These people are capable of doing the magic for APC. Victory for APC Ekiti Central may be by a narrow margin.\n\nEkiti North Senatorial District has always been a natural habitat and stronghold of Oni since 2007. The district has five councils \u2013 Ido/Osi, Moba, Ilejemeje, Ikole and Oye local governments. Oni is from Ido/Osi.\n\nAPC won the five councils in Ekiti North in the last election, but Oni was still in the ruling party then. As strong as Oni is in Ekiti North, he will meet a match in Fayemi, who is from the area.\n\nThe Director General, Biodun Oyebanji campaign council, Cyril Fasuyi, is also from Ekiti North. But Segun Oni still has visible and electrifying presence in Ido/Osi, Moba and Ilejemeje\n\nAPC also has influential politicians in Ekiti North. Whichever way it goes, Oni may likely carry the day in Ekiti North.",
