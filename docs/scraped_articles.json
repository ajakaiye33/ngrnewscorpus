          "title": "FG\u2019ll look into ASUU\u2019s grievances, strike threat \u2013 Ngige",
          "text": "The Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, on Wednesday, stated that the Federal Government would look into the threat by the Academic Staff Union of Universities.\n\nThe minister also said most of the union\u2019s grievances were domiciled in the ministries of Education and Communications and Digital Economy.\n\nNgige stated this in an interview with The PUNCH in Abuja.\n\nASUU had issued several threats of an indefinite strike over what the union tagged the failure of the Federal Government to honour some of the agreements it signed with it in the past.\n\nIn 2020, ASUU went on a nine-month strike, which was called off in December of that year.\n\nIn 2021, the union issued fresh threats and gave the Federal Government a three-week ultimatum to address its grievances. The union later shelved the move following the payment of N22.1bn earned allowances and the release of N30bn revitalisation fund to the universities.\n\nSome members of the Nigeria Inter-religious Council, led by the co-chairmen, the Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammad Abubakar III, and the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria, Dr Samson Ayokunle, visited the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), over the failure to implement the Memorandum of Understanding the government signed with ASUU in 2009 and other agreements.\n\nAt the meeting, Buhari said the government remained committed to fulfilling the promises made to the union.\n\nDespite this, ASUU issued directives to its chapters and encouraged members to continue mobilising for the impending strike.\n\nNgige, however, told one of our correspondents, \u201cThe truth is that ASUU\u2019s grievances are with the NUC, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy. The issues are the deployment of their UTAS and the White Paper report on the universities.\n\n\u201cYou know that we at the Ministry of Labour are not their employer; the Education ministry is their employer. Our job here is to act as reconciliatory officers.\n\n\u201cThe President has mandated his Chief of Staff and the Minister of Education as well as the Ministry of Labour to step in, but my job is to step in as the reconciliatory officer if both sides refuse to settle their grievances. We will surely look into the matter.\u201d\n\n\u2018FG deliberately destroying educational system\u2019\n\nThe Federal University of Technology, Owerri, chapter of the union, on Wednesday, accused the Federal Government of deliberately destroying the country\u2019s educational system.\n\nThe union said at a press conference on the campus that the Federal Government was forcing it to shut down all public universities nationwide.\n\nThe Chairman, ASUU FUTO, Chinedu Ihejirika, said the Federal Government had consistently failed to honour the Memoranda of Understanding and Memoranda of Action it signed with the union since 2009.\n\nFG, serial defaulter in honouring pacts, says MOUAU ASUU chair\n\nThe Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike, Abia State chapter of ASUU says the Federal Government is a deliberate serial defaulter in terms of honouring agreements.\n\nAddressing a press conference after the meeting of the chapter in Umuahia, on Tuesday, the Chairman, Prof Chike Ugwuene, listed various unresolved grievances the union had with the government, which he noted arose from a 13-year-old ago.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government is a deliberate serial defaulter in terms of honouring its agreements; it is in arrears of several billions of naira in terms of the Nation Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy, NEEDS Assessment funds and the earned academic allowances,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe Chairman, ASUU, Owerri Zone, Prof Uzo Onyebinama, and a former Investment Secretary of the union, Charles Ononuju, were at the conference.\n\nGovt has pushed us to the precipice \u2013 UNIUYO lecturers\n\nThe Chairperson of ASSUU in the University of Uyo, Dr Happiness Uduk, has castigated the Federal Government for being adamant to the plights of lecturers.\n\nAccording to her, the government has remained insensitive, insincere and dubious following it failure to honour the agreement it reached with the union in December 2020.\n\nMembers of the union had earlier attended an enlarged meeting with other bodies such as the None Academic Staff Union and Senior Staff Union of Universities, where they hinted of the plan to embark on another round of indefinite.\n\nThey also staged a road walk round the campus of the institution to sensitise the public to the impending strike.\n\nAddressing a press conference, Uduk lamented that the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), had pushed the union to the point that it had no other option but to embark on an indefinite strike.\n\nTaraba varsity lecturers protest poor welfare\n\nBarely a week after Governor Darius Ishaku commended members of staff of the Taraba State University for their hard work, which made the institution to be ranked 17th in the country, the lecturers, on Wednesday, staged a protest against what they called poor welfare.\n\nThe lecturers, under the auspices of ASUU, rose from their congress and staged a peaceful protest round the university\u2019s campus and demanded improved welfare.\n\nThe Chairman of the union in the university, Dr Samuel Shiikaa, told journalists during the protest that the members were tired of signing memoranda of understanding with the state government, which would not be implemented.\n\nHe said, \u201cSince 2009, we have been signing memoranda of understanding with the state government, but the government will always not honour its own side.\n\n\u201cOur members are tired of the memos and want the government to honour its agreement to pay pension and ensure timely promotion of our members.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal University, Wukari, branch of the union resolved to go by the resolution that would be reached by the national secretariat of ASUU regarding the planned strike.\n\nThis resolution was reached at the congress of the union held on the campus of the institution.\n\nAddressing journalists shortly after the congress, the branch Chairman, Joseph Ikwebe, said the institution declared Wednesday a lecture-free day in order to enlighten students and parents about the plights of ASUU members.\n\nThe management of the University of Ilorin shifted all examinations scheduled for Wednesday to Saturday following a work-free day declared by the local branch of ASUU.\n\nThe union, in a statement jointly signed by Prof Moyosore Ajao and Dr A. G. Olatunji, Chairman and Secretary of the UNILORIN branch of the union, respectively, after a congress held on Tuesday said it members would observe a work-free day on Wednesday, during which members would attend to no official duty.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "We assembled 100 presidential materials, says 2022 Committee",
          "text": "The 2022 Committee, which is an association of businessmen, political figures and others, has stressed the need for Nigeria to produce quality leaders in next year\u2019s elections.\n\nThe committee, which comprises business tycoons like Aliko Dangote, Femi Otedola, Fola Adeola, Jim Ovia, Abdulsamad Rabiu and several others, said in a statement that it was not in support of any particular candidate.\n\nA Co-convener of the committee, Kashim Ibrahim-Imam, in an interview on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today programme on Wednesday, said the group was not partisan, but assembled 100 presidential materials.\n\nIn a statement jointly signed by Imam and another co-convener, Nduka Obaigbena, who is ThisDay Newspapers Publisher, the committee stated that it was interested in quality leadership that would emerge in 2023.\n\nAccording to the statement, the leaders met from February 4 to 6, 2022. It, however, did not reveal the names of the 100 leaders who met in Lagos but The PUNCH gathered that top chieftains from both the ruling All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party attended the event.\n\nIn the interview on Channels Television on Wednesday evening, Ibrahim-Imam said it was encouraging to see business tycoons participating in the event for three straight days.\n\nHe noted that the 100 people that were part of the committee were all presidential materials.\n\nIbrahim-Imam said others who attended the three-day event include: Governor Aminu Tambuwal (Sokoto), Governor Dave Umahi (Ebonyi), Governor Ben Ayade (Cross River), Governor Nasir el-Rufai (Kaduna), Governor Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti), Governor Ifeanyi Okowa (Delta) and several others.\n\nThe committee chairman said he was hopeful that all those who participated in the deliberations would implement the resolutions reached.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe hope that whoever emerges (as President) will abide by the template that was put together. We are also concerned about the quality of leadership. Leadership is not restricted to who becomes President. The National Assembly, the judiciary are also important institutions.\n\n\u201cWhat is equally important is that somebody like Aliko Dangote, Abdulsamad Rabiu, Jim Ovia, Herbert Wigwe, Atedo Peterside, Udo Udoma, Fola Adeola, Femi Otedola, I can go on and on that men of this calibre will leave everything that they are doing and lock themselves up in a hotel for three days is in itself encouraging.\u201d\n\nOn whether the resolutions reached could solve Nigeria\u2019s problems, Ibrahim-Imam stated, \u201cWe assembled 100 presidential materials any of whom can serve as President of Nigeria. All of whom have distinguished themselves in their various fields. If those who are gathered in that room cannot solve our problem, then we are in trouble.\u201d\n\nThere had been speculation that the committee was working in the interest of the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, to be the next President of the country.\n\nHowever, the committee dismissed such speculations, insisting that some of its members were also presidential aspirants\n\nIn the statement signed by Ibrahim-Imam and Obaigbena, the group stated, \u201cWhilst The 2022 Committee is interested in the quality of leadership that will emerge in Nigeria at all levels, we consider attempts to link the committee with candidates or political parties for the 2023 elections as an unwarranted and unnecessary distraction \u2013 candidates are only chosen by political parties and we are not a political party.\n\n\u201cAll the 100 leading lights of the 2022 Committee have the capacity for national leadership; indeed, amongst the very active participants in the work of the Committee are over seven persons, from three or more political parties, who have already publicly declared their aspiration to lead the country but are desirous of working with other patriots for non-partisan greater national goals. We must have a secure, peaceful and united nation before we can have candidates for political offices.\u201d\n\nThe committee said it believes that what Nigeria needed today was for all patriots to come together to rescue the nation from all political, economic and security threats, and promote the unity of the country.\n\nObaigbena and Ibrahim-Imam said the leaders worked in three sub-committees of national security, the economy and Nigeria in transition, noting that \u201cthe participants recognised that there is an urgent need to seek common ground and irreducible minimum actions to stabilise the polity at this critical time of transition.\u201d\n\nSome of those in attendance that our correspondents could confirm included a former Governor of Ogun State, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, former Senate President and Secretary to the Federal Government of Nigeria, Anyim Pius Anyim, who is also a PDP presidential aspirant; ex-Senate President Bukola Saraki, also a PDP presidential aspirant; former Governor of Imo State; Ikedi Ohakim, former Governor of Cross Rivers State, Donald Duke and former Deputy Governor of Osun State, Senator Iyiola Omisore.\n\nA member of the committee, who spoke on condition of anonymity, further explained reasons for the formation of the group.\n\nHe stated, \u201cNigeria is in crisis, we are ready to rescue Nigeria. We cannot all sit down and be burning every day. There is security, economic issues and transition \u2013 how to get free and fair election. We have to come together to rescue the country.\n\n\u201cIf you sit back, insecurity catches somebody in Zamfara State, it could be you tomorrow. So, it is in order to stabilize the system towards transition and to ensure we get quality leaders in 2023. That\u2019s our mandate really.\u201d\n\nHe added that the committee consisted of members of leading political parties, adding that it would not transform into a party.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe are not a political party, we have leading figures in the PDP, the APC and APGA, we have the three key parties represented. We are 100 wise men.\n\n\u201cIt is not a Third Force, we are not fighting anybody; we are just there to assist a process, it is a national movement to assist a process and political parties.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\n**It\u2019s difficult to solve our problems without paying attention lower strata\n\n**To present new book The Centrist Manifesto, next Tuesday in Lagos\n\nBy Clifford Ndujihe, Politics Editor\n\nTO surmount the deluge of socio-economic challenges burdening Nigeria, policymakers and all stakeholders must apart from the government pay attention to what happens at lower levels such as companies and individual economic behaviour, erudite author, Uchenna Nwankwo, has said.\n\nNwankwo, in his latest book, The Centrist Manifesto, which will be launched next Tuesday, in Lagos, his study shows that \u201cNigeria\u2019s commercial, professional and industrial leaderships have not been as visionary and as creative as they ought to be. To a large extent, it is the economic collapses that occur within their scope of operation and influence, at the micro-levels, that manifest at the national scale and have largely led to the persistent cycles of massive corruption and economic stagnation that have become the norm of the Nigerian system for quite some time.\u201d\n\nThe 202-page book, which will be presented at the Nigeria Institute of International Affairs, is geared towards addressing the hydra-headed socio-economic and political problems militating against mankind, in general, and Nigeria, in particular.\n\nRenowned Economist and Management Consultant, Mr Victor Mbamalu, will chair the event with Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State as a special guest of honour.\n\nNigeria\u2019s socio-economic challenges\n\nExamining Nigeria\u2019s socio-economic challenges in Part 1 of the Three-part book, Nwankwo wrote: \u201cMost often analysis of Nigeria\u2019s social, economic and political conditions or lack of well-being focuses almost entirely on the role or contribution of government and political leaderships to that state of affairs. We generally tend to lose sight of the crippling input made by other forms of leadership to the nation\u2019s socio-economic and socio-political failures.\n\n\u201cI am talking about the contribution of the nation\u2019s captains of industry, pioneers and leading entrepreneurs, etc. to the malady. A close examination readily reveals that the extent to which the national economy is compromised at these lower levels is indeed enormous and ought to be taken into consideration by any genuine attempt at analysing, resolving and reversing the trends that have brought the society and economy to their present sorry past.\n\n\u201cIndeed, in so far as macroeconomic aggregates subsume the aggregation of decisions and activities at the micro-level, any pretensions at solving or proffering solutions to Nigeria\u2019s problems without paying adequate attention to the occurrences at the lower strata, at the level of companies and individual economic behaviour will completely miss the target.\n\n\u201cOur study shows that Nigeria\u2019s commercial, professional and industrial leaderships have not been as visionary and as creative as they ought to be. To a large extent, it is the economic collapses that occur within their scope of operation and influence, at the micro-levels, that manifest at the national scale and have largely led to the persistent cycles of massive corruption and economic stagnation that have become the lot of the Nigerian system for quite some time.\n\nAlso Read:\n\n\u201cThe contribution of the private sector of the Nigerian establishment to the dismal performance of the economy is best analysed using the professionals or professional groupings as an index. We are referring to the style and modus operandi of our doctors, architects, engineers, accountants, pharmacists, lawyers, etc. It is noteworthy that one of the chief characteristics of Nigerian professionals is the trend towards fragmentation and the establishment of one-man practices. In Nigeria today, virtually every qualified professional architect, engineer, pharmacist, lawyer, etc., is a firm by himself.\n\n\u201cThis should be contrasted with the trend in most other parts of the world where it is common to find professional firms with very large pools of professional men and women making up each firm or corporate practice. In virtually all the developed economies, emerging markets and the seriously upwardly mobile developing countries most professional groups or firms usually consist of upwards of scores and hundreds of professionals. You would find, for instance, big law firms with up to one thousand or more lawyers, all working together and under one single corporate leadership; ditto for architects, engineers, etc.\n\nThe advantage of the latter kind of set-up, collocation or clustering together is that there is synergy, specialisation even within the profession, cross-fertilisation of ideas, research and economy of scale. This is a recipe for efficiency, optimum performance and progress. Indeed, this is what organisation is all about! It is well known that usually, each professional man tends to be very good in particular branches of the profession and not so good in some others. There are really very few all-rounders.\n\nThus, some architects, for instance, are either good in design, detailing, presentation, site works or supervision, contract management or job let, etc., or a combination of a number of these or other aspects of the professional duties of the architect. Large professional architectural firms thus have the potential of being made up of \u2018experts\u2019 in virtually all the branches and aspects of the professional calling. On the face of it, therefore, the large firm is in a better position to handle a professional job and assignment more efficiently and successfully than a small group or one-man firm.\n\n\u201cIt is these successes that are recorded at the micro-levels, at the level of companies and firms by such large and organised groups that translate into the economic success and development that manifest at the macro-level, at the level of society and nation. In contrast, the presumed failures, handicaps or inefficiency and poorly conceived and shoddily executed projects that characterise small professional groups or one-man firms translate to dismal economic performances that seem to have become part and parcel of \u2018unorganised\u2019 societies and countries like Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHave you stopped to imagine or contemplate how the many one-doctor clinics and hospitals that dot the Nigerian landscape and healthcare delivery system manage \u2013 say, during surgery? Well, the picture is that you would in a generality of cases, have the single in-house doctor perform diverse roles \u2013 acting the part of the surgeon and perhaps those of a number of these: the aesthetician, technician or controller of the oxygen cans and other equipment, biochemist, pharmacist, administrator of all the myriad operations that go with surgery \u2013 all by himself, and perhaps with the aid of a few ill-qualified, ill-motivated and inexperienced nurses. With that kind of scenario, does it surprise anybody that these one-doctor clinics and hospitals have very few successful operations or surgery; that they indeed constitute slaughterhouses in which innumerable patients get butchered every now and then?\n\nSo to recap, the failures and collapses recorded by these outfits constitute part of the drawbacks that have kept Nigeria\u2019s healthcare delivery system in the doldrums.\n\nIt can equally be shown that the picture painted above of the one-man architectural firm or the one-doctor hospital in Nigeria could be replicated and likened to some of the operations of the other numerous one-man professional outfits in Nigeria, be it in engineering practice and some of the ill-network of roads, public drains or other line-systems some of the design and supervise; in accountancy and some of the shoddy and fraudulent audit reports that emanate from that sector; in law practice and some of the innumerable un- researched ill-conceived advocacies some of them proffer; and the rest of them. It is all a catalogue of dismal failures at the micro-levels that have ultimately translated to collapses at the macro-level or the level of nation and society.\n\n\u201cIt is not only that these small practices do not have the right depth of staff to generate the right professional advice and work, they also cannot muster the right resources to acquire the needed tools and equipment, books, professional journals, etc. that should keep them in line with the latest developments and new concepts in any of the professional callings. Little wonder then that they can hardly perform, help themselves and make the requisite contribution expected from them to our social, economic, technological, and even political progress.\n\n\u201cWhat are the unique factors that have tended to detract the Nigerian professionals from the corporate track commonly trodden by their counterparts in other parts of the world? What are those peculiarities of the Nigerian professionals that seemingly make them so different from professionals from other lands? Again, we prefer to seek the answers from the micro-levels. The truth is that historically the Nigerian pioneer and leading professionals who more or less took over from the expatriate professional firms did not take care of the younger generation of (Nigerian) professionals that came later or that served under them.\n\n\u201cIn their general drive to \u2018maximise\u2019 profit, the pioneers and leading professionals threw the standards established by white men or the colonialist expatriates they replaced, overboard and began to appropriate virtually all incomes made by the new firms to themselves, leaving peanuts for the retinue of employed fellow professionals and other sundry\n\nstaff that worked under them even when these employees worked on multi-million dollar projects which attract huge fees for the firm.\n\n\u201cIn fact, matters did degenerate to a point where the corporate leaders began to determine the salaries of their employees based on the notion that they should and would be collecting huge sums of money as \u2018gifts\u2019 from whatever contractor or companies they supervise or superintend over. This generally forces the younger professional to depend on the contractors\u2019 hand-outs for virtually all his livelihood. And being thus compromised, the project suffers, for as the saying goes, there is no free lunch. It is this kind of in-built corruption that account for shoddy jobs and the lowering of standards that is so commonplace in Nigeria. The scenario is also typified in the civil service where too many people are employed but paid such mean salaries that they become permanently and perpetually corruption-prone.\n\n\u201cIt is in fact woe betide thee for any of these young professionals or employees that refuse to toe the line; to feed on the filthy lucre offered by those individuals or companies he superintends over, for it is his colleagues, bosses, even relatives and \u2018friends\u2019 that will bury him alive and dance on top of his grave for his mere non-compliance with the subsisting system in operation \u2013 to say nothing about the excruciating impact of the poor salary and wages on which he is signed on. Yet we all moan about corruption and make-believe that we detest its negative impact on the country! And that we would want it eradicated from society.\n\nGiven that scenario, it can be said that in Nigeria, corruption is compelling, and will remain so for as long as the status quo persists. The above scenario should be contrasted with what obtains among some internationally-linked business outfits where some level of prudence and fairness in distributive standards \u2013 the so-called \u2018international standards of ethics\u2019 \u2013 prevail. We are talking about what is witnessed among some of the foreign oil companies and suchlike that do\n\nbusiness in Nigeria. Here, different rules appear to operate. We find that in the generality of cases, many Nigerians who work for such companies refuse to accept hand-outs from contractors and professional groups that work for them or handle their consultancy briefs. But this, as many of such individuals would say, is because they are well paid by the companies they work for and therefore do not need to \u2018palm\u2019 such \u2018gifts\u2019 or \u2018hand-out\u2019. We agree that this might well be due largely to the monitoring mechanisms inherent in most of these multinational companies. But these are Nigerians nonetheless!\n\nTherefore, it is safe to conclude that what makes the difference is the system. And that the persistence of corruption as witnessed in the earlier scenario is patently systemic. The average Nigerian young professional is, therefore, more of a victim of the system than the happy exploiter of it. Indeed, many feel quite humiliated by the status quo, and some do try to extricate themselves from that system of values and livelihood; to shorn a beggarly existence and perpetual manipulation by (or collusion with) contractors, or clients in the case of accountants, auditors, etc.\n\nMovement of Individualism & Enthronement of Anarchy\n\nHistorically, the above subsisting Nigerian system has led to bad blood and fragmentation of professional firms across the board as well as a gross lowering of professional ethics and standards. For being thus humiliated and short-changed by the system, most of the younger Nigerian professionals predictably move out from the established firms to seek solace in the establishment of smaller groups and/or one-man outfits. Before you knew it, a pattern emerged in which younger Nigerian professionals generally moved on or were expected to establish their own professional firms as soon as they pass their professional practice exams or immediately after pupillage.\n\nHence the emergence of the unique degenerate Nigerian system and fractured or compromised professional ethics or culture discussed above, in which virtually every qualified professional becomes a firm of his own. That culture is one of incipient disorganisation and anarchy, which has inextricably affected the larger society for the worse.\n\nIt is now clear that what happened was that as the number of firms in any one professional group mushroomed, the practitioners were inevitably forced by the cut-throat competition that became the order of the day to begin to undercut one another in order to remain afloat. The rules of professional conduct and all the extant regulations that were set up to regulate and guide professional practice were virtually jettisoned and compromised by the day.\n\nIn Nigeria today, we have degenerated to severe underhanded practices; to a level where, for instance, a professional firm could, in collusion with government officials steal a proposal submitted to the government by another professional group, erase the name of that firm from the document, affix his own imprint, resubmit same, collect the contract and smile to the banks without any repercussion for such dastardly unprofessional conduct. In Nigeria today, integrity hardly counts, nor is professional competence of much consequence. All these have in turn ravaged the professions leading to paralysis and the collapses of many professional groups, large or small.\n\nMeanwhile, the predictably derisory services offered by the inadequately staffed, ill-funded and withering local firms and companies became manifest and unbearable. The trend has partially created a loophole for foreign professional groups and companies to recapture the commanding heights of professional practice in the country. It has reasserted the \u201conly-white-hand-can-do-it\u201d syndrome in virtually all areas of professional practice in the country, be it in engineering design and construction, accountancy and architecture.\n\nThus many key projects or contracts are now being let out as turn-key projects in which foreign groups and companies handle everything from design to construction and even furnishing and interior decor. Examples abound and include the refurbishment and standardisation of the nation\u2019s Railway, the multi-billion naira Abuja National Stadium Complex and of course innumerable important projects in the private sector, especially in the nation\u2019s fledgling oil industry.\n\nThe Nigerian medical system with its many ill-staffed, ill-equipped hospitals and clinics, public or private, is side- tracked by those who can afford to go abroad for even the slightest of afflictions. But for the expected insurmountable difficulties the nation\u2019s judicial and legal systems pose for the foreigner or the uninitiated, foreign lawyers and legal practitioners would have invaded and taken over legal advocacies offered by the lucrative litigation-prone Nigerian environment. Did the Federal Government of Nigeria not hire a team of foreign lawyers to research into and represent her at the World Court in our then dispute with Cameroun over the ownership of the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula?\n\nObviously, one of the reasons for that action was that no local legal firm was thought to possess the manpower and research capability and resources to corner such a lucrative contract or brief. In the same vein, it would appear, no local accounting firm is thought large and strong enough to possess the capacity to audit big government parastatals like the NNPC. The pre-shipment inspection agents that inspect imports coming into the fatherland at about one per cent of the value of these imports as fee must not be Nigerians, if for no other reason, because Nigerian professionals and businessmen have not been able to show capacity and capability by building any agency or firms that can boast of the staffing and other resources to undertake such assignments. So, we have to pay huge scarce foreign exchange resources to get foreigners to perform these otherwise simple tasks for us.\n\nOne obvious and damaging consequence of the above trend is that the government\u2019s presumed attempts to reflate the economy by the award of huge road construction and other contracts have ended up being dismal failures because the multi-national companies that get these contracts repatriate virtually all the disproportionately large proceeds while their local counterparts similarly siphon whatever they get abroad for savings and investment in the more stable economies of the Western world. Under the prevailing system where no form of protection is offered to workers, they get away with paying the local labourers and employees that work under their supervision just enough to keep body and soul together.\n\nThis then obviates and obstructs the trickle-down effect that should have put more money into the hands of Nigerians through the quantum of solid and substantial earnings expected to accrue to the skilled and unskilled workers in the nation\u2019s construction or service sector in general. The effect is to prolong the economic depression that has been with us for so long by stagnating consumer purchasing power and disposable incomes of the masses of Nigerian citizens.\n\nIndeed, in recent times, many leading Nigerian professional architects and engineers have turned into portfolio consultants. They no longer maintain offices and staff nor do they bother to make use of (younger) Nigerian professionals and draughtsmen as employees in the execution of lucrative design schemes and briefs that come their way. Rather, the practice today is to hop over to Ghana where they engage Ghanaian consultants and professional groups in the execution, design, detailing and drafting of the assigned projects, and of course pay cheaply in grossly devalued cedi, the Ghanaian currency.\n\nIn the meantime, many young Nigerian graduate- professionals are left without work and avenues to imbibe needed professional ethos and practical training. It is clear that if this trend continues, then in the near future, the professional instincts of jobless Nigerian graduate professionals will atrophy; many will turn to trade and crime, and national professional and technological know-how will be the worse for it.\n\nIt is regrettable that some senior Nigerian professionals who have been exposed to and are knowledgeable about developments and professional practice in the more advanced countries of the world could allow themselves to embrace the odd notion that there are too many professionally trained people in Nigeria. Trained architects in Nigeria for instance number less than a few tens of thousands! In some of the developed economies, that number could make up just about three or four architectural firms. Sadly, in Nigeria, they would represent thousands of firms. Mark you; we are not saying that small or one-man practices are native to Nigeria alone. No, developed countries equally have them but their proportion in such climes are not as large as what we have!\n\nThe picture in other professions conforms to the above model. But rather than see the problem in the available number of firms, many Nigerian professional leaders prefer or pretend to see the problem in terms of the available number of individual professionals! Thus instead of devising measures to mollify the alienated younger professionals, they cast off in the opposite direction and adopt measures that further alienate and frustrate the younger members of the professions, creating chaos and untold upheavals and declines in the social and economic aesthetics of the nation.\n\nBut the above synthesis is not limited to the professions. The model is applicable to all private sector players and operators in the Nigerian economy, be they in the commercial, industrial or agricultural sectors. The winner-takes-all syndrome painted for professionals above is noticeable in the myriad trading, manufacturing, agricultural and other establishments or sectors of the economy. There is a systemic process and abiding general propensity for those at the helm to consistently corner a disproportionate size of company incomes or added-value to themselves and leave a pittance to the mass of hired hands and labourers that are used in running these outfits, companies and organisations.\n\nA survey of factor-shares in Nigeria\u2019s quoted or public liability companies clearly underscores this point. Many of these companies devote very low proportions of their added- value to the payment of salaries and wages and general staff welfare. This is to say nothing of undeclared incomes that do not come under the purview of distribution between the relevant and requisite factors of production \u2013 Labour and Capital.\n\nThe situation is even worse in the private or limited liability companies and in the so-called informal sector where generally speaking one man represents or functions both as chairman and managing director of a company as well as its board of directors. Here anything goes, and really nobody is there to call the chief executive officer, CEO, to account for anything, either in terms of taking good care of employees, paying adequate salaries and wages or even in terms of paying commensurate tax to state coffers, and over-indulgence.\n\nWhen these occurrences are put down in a generalised fashion, people might and do get the impression that the situation is exaggerated. But we have come across several instances of this discouraging practice on the part of some Nigerian business organisations that could startle anybody.\n\nAbout ten years ago, we came across a letter of employment emanating from a renowned law firm in which a qualified lawyer and university graduate of nearly ten years\u2019 postgraduate experience was being offered a basic salary of N3,000.00 a month with various allowances making up a total of N10,000.00 gross monthly pay package, to work six-days a week in the company.\n\nMany graduate school teachers earn less than N6,000.00 per month, all-found, to teach in many of the growing numbers of private schools that actually make a killing in their line of business; that derive fantastic revenues from the army of Nigerian parents and guardians that are so eager to pull their wards out of the deteriorating Nigerian public schools. This is at a time when the stipulated minimum wage in the country was put at N18,000.00 per month for unskilled workers.\n\nIndeed, Governments\u2019 attempts to bolster the take-home pay of workers through the praxis or stipulation of the minimum wage have been less than effective for a number of reasons. One, such stipulations usually do not go far enough. Two, the stipulations are hardly adhered to in the private sector. Three, in the areas where such is respected and upheld, like the civil service and the big firms, these pegged rates are usually quickly overtaken over time by developments in the economy, especially in times of galloping inflation and as a result of stiff increases in national income or productivity.\n\nNow if the above salary offer, in our above example of a company which offered a pittance to a university graduate it wanted to employ, was coming from some low-level company battling to stay afloat, the offer would not cause any consternation or surprise anybody. But the Law firm alluded to the above and its subsidiaries were leaders in the industry and were known to be making a killing in the field. Its proprietor was one of the nation\u2019s leading lights, a social and human rights crusader who ought to know the overall impact and implication of this kind of salary structure on the economic and other rights of the recipient and the Nigerian economy as a whole.\n\nAs a highly successful firm, the company could afford to pay a lot more than it was offering. But the instinct to maximise profit in an environment with a glut of qualified applicants and job-seekers appears to be the restraining factor. With this scenario, it appears that the hope of reflating the Nigerian economy via the so-called trickle-down effect, (in which large firms and/or generous recipients of high incomes and government fat contracts are expected to better the earnings of their employees) will never come about.\n\nIn the Nigerian informal sector, the notorious one-man business syndrome is most pronounced. Take the traders and the array of semi-skilled artisans, welders, plumbers, motor mechanics, for instance. There is little effort on the part of this social category to forge medium or large-scale organisations, to build economies of scale, trading conglomerates and such like; structures that can muster the resources that would ensure sustainable and promising future and leverage for the company, and that would cushion its members against risks and unforeseen bad times and hence enhance the quality of life of its members.\n\nRather, what we see is the same propensity on the part of leading members of this group to build one-man empires, short-change their employees, associates and appropriate virtually every income to themselves. Again, the result has been the kind of fragmentation prevalent among the professionals. It is a situation that, for the traders, produces honeycomb market structures and myriad tiny squalid windowless market stalls where these traders display their odd wares and engage in cut-throat competition and petty frauds. This should be contrasted with the modern emergent mega-shopping facilities and department stores that have become a permanent and endearing feature of progressive nations of the world.\n\nIn all the more progressive states of the world, what we see or what transpires virtually by the day are mergers of giant corporations to produce even larger groups and combines. The new emergent mega-companies are then able to pool together more resources to carry out new and intricate research, patent new inventions and create new wealth and fantastic fortunes. In Nigeria on the other hand, the general trend is towards ruptures and disintegration into smaller ineffective and unproductive groups.\n\nConversely, Nigeria\u2019s pinnacle of wealth is not populated by men that have patented any inventions nor even earned their riches through copyright in artistic or any other form of intellectual work. Rather the majority of the country\u2019s men of riches are people who made their money through government either as contractors, suppliers or through dubious deals and swindling, grand larceny and outright embezzlements. It is a process that impoverishes the masses and breeds more and more corruption, indolence, and dependence on crude petroleum resources that Nigerians do not even tap or mine by themselves. This truncates societal values and work ethic, erodes and whittles the authority of those in government to the extent that there is such acute erosion of authority that they virtually fall back to the naked force to get anything done.\n\nParlous Economy & Social Disintegration\n\nThe cumulative effect of the above build-ups can be easily enumerated. First, there is a mammoth concentration of national resources in fewer and fewer hands that have practically wiped off the middle class in the country. (Nigeria is now said to have one of the world\u2019s highest levels of inequality; its Gini coefficient, which is a measure of the level of inequality in the system, is put as high as 0.6. Of course, with such a high level of inequality, most people are untouched by economic development as most increases in income accrue to those who are already rich).\n\nSecondly, there is a dangerously depreciating disposable income and purchasing power for a large proportion of the populace. Thirdly, mass unemployment and a process of internal marginalisation that has been grinding away the foundations of society are evident everywhere. Fourthly, public life is marked by financial indiscipline at the workplace and a concomitant endemic corruption in high and low places. Fifthly, the crime waves keep rising.\n\nThese then are some of the main factors or manifestations that shape the decidedly parlous Nigerian economy. The low and depreciating purchasing power of consumers has been responsible for poor sales on the part of manufacturers and producers in general, leading as it were to overflow inventory in company warehouses, cut-backs in production, retrenchments and general business collapses.\n\nAnother remarkable dysfunctional feature of the Nigerian economy is the tendency on the part of owners and captains of industry to import wholesale foreign-built industrial plants and machinery. There is little attempt to have Nigerians design and fabricate machinery and manufacturing plants locally. The persistent attempt by our industry captains to rely solely on foreign technology for Nigeria\u2019s industrial production purposes has indeed had a very profound and negative impact on the economy.\n\nIn the first place, because these imported technological artefacts are too sophisticated for our stage of development and call for a continuous and steady supply of spare parts from the original producers, they constitute a permanent drain of the nation\u2019s scarce resources. Even so, Nigerian technicians often have great difficulty in providing the kind of maintenance demanded by these machines and production plants. Invariably, the plants break down and have to be discarded and replaced with new and even more sophisticated newer models.\n\nAlternatively, foreign engineers and technicians are imported at a great cost to fix or repair them. It has in fact been calculated that the cost incurred by Nigerians in importing, repairing and replacing these plants generally outstrip the net value added to the economy by these artefacts. Conversely, the indiscriminate wholesale importation and employment of foreign technology or alien machines and production plants contribute more in the impoverishment of Nigerians than in the economic development of the country we target.\n\nA case in point is the unending turn-around- maintenance of Nigeria\u2019s foreign-built state-owned oil refineries. The project which again is being handled by foreign technical experts is said to have gulped, in the last thirty years, over N5.5 billion (about US$3 billion dollars), an amount that could quite easily have built new refineries for the country, especially, if handled by local engineers and technicians, for some of these foreign-built refineries are not better than the Biafran-built Amandugba petroleum refinery now of yore. It is truly arguable whether the actual values added to the nation\u2019s economy by these foreign-built refineries are anywhere near the total cost paid by Nigeria for their construction and maintenance over the years.\n\nSecondly, the wholesale employment of foreign technological artefacts by Nigerian manufacturers, construction firms, etc., tends to de-emphasise and discourage the use of labour-intensive modes of production as well as whittle labour incomes. It alienates the masses of abundant and capable human labour resources in the country from the workplace and creates what is generally termed technological unemployment. This adds to the massive unemployment situation in the country and helps swell the rank of retail traders milling around in every nook and cranny of the country virtually stampeding or choking the economy by its sheer size. For what we have is a situation where a disproportionate size of young men and women who should be working in factories, farms, etc., roam the streets all day long in the name of trading or business.\n\nIndeed, in the last few decades, Nigeria has witnessed a geometric rise in the proportion of its populace engaged in the retail trading sub-sector while the proportion of those that could be regarded as producers of any kind of goods have shrunk to a point where Nigeria could be derisively referred to as largely a nation of traders \u2013 traders of mainly imported goods. This is a minus for the country, for no great economy can be built through low production at home and a propensity for a great majority of its citizens to turn into importers and sellers of foreign goods.\n\nThe third consequence of Nigeria\u2019s over-dependence on foreign technological artefacts is that local initiative at the creation of indigenous technological culture is dampened and permanently stifled. The Biafran revolution had aptly\n\ndemonstrated that an indigenous black technological civilisation is possible and achievable around here. The absence of such a civilisation in Nigeria today is therefore clearly not inherent in the quality of mankind that inhabit the geographical space called Nigeria, but definitely on the way the country has been managed or mismanaged since the end of the Nigeria-Biafra war.\n\nWeak and visionless political leadership\n\nOur analysis in the foregoing has tended, on the face of it, to blame the dismal performance of the economy on the actions of company managers, captains of industry and leading members of the business community. The analysis may have given the impression that the problem of efficient and sound national economic management is further complicated by the fact that actors and managers in the economy are many and diverse, pursuing multiple and often mutually opposing objectives. It is not by any means so.\n\nThe operators and managers mentioned above only deal at the micro-levels of the economy. National economic management deals with the issues at the macro-level, at the level of national political leadership. It is thus the general duty of government, at the national level, to give overall direction in all matters of economic development. It is the duty of the Federal Government of Nigeria to manipulate the macro-economic variables in such a way as to check any dysfunctional and economically oppressive attitudes and enactments at the micro-levels, to provide overall health to the national economy. But how well has this vital role of government been handled over the years?\n\nThe answer to that question is of course located in the perceived and actual state of well-being of the economy itself. Accordingly, it is obvious that governments\u2019 efforts in this direction have been less than assiduous and efficacious.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".\n\n\n\n**Signs MoU with UNILAG; Says Proposed National Hydrographic Agency calls for human capacity development.\n\nBy: Kingsley Omonobi -Abuja.\n\nChief of the Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Zubairu Gambo has said the Federal Government is desirous of opening up Nigeria\u2019s internal waters, through systematic hydrographic survey and charting, for more robust maritime economic development.\n\nThis is just as he disclosed that the recent establishment of new naval bases in security prone communities with predominantly uncharted rivers, as well as the proposed establishment of the National Hydrographic Agency calls for increased human capacity building in hydrography.\n\nThe CNS made the disclosure at the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding on the Hydrographic Survey Partnership between the NN and University of Lagos at Naval headquarters in Abuja on Wednesday.\n\nHe said, \u201cThis is because of the recent acquisition of a 60m Offshore Hydrographic Vessel \u2013 NNS Lana, which has since commenced the survey of Nigeria\u2019s offshore waters, and another 35m survey ship due to join NN fleet in 2023, together with the ongoing survey and charting of lower Rivers Niger and Benue, Lekki and Lagos Lagoons, as well as other survey activities conducted by other stakeholders within Nigeria, requires enough skilled hydrographic manpower to derive maximum value for allocated funds.\n\n\u201cThus, this Memorandum of Understanding between the Nigerian Navy and the University of Lagos is coming at the most appropriate time.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Navy Hydrographic Department is most suited for the training partnership with the Institute for Maritime Studies of the University of Lagos, particularly in the areas of exchange of training, exchange of ideas, materials, resource persons, research fellows.\n\n\u201cAlso, a partnership between both institutions will facilitate International Hydrographic Organization\u2019s accreditation of the MSc Hydrographic Programme of the University of Lagos to Category A Hydrography Programme, which would ultimately attract both\n\ninternational and local patronage.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, I wish to assure UNILAG that the Nigerian Navy is well-positioned to meet up with the terms of our partnership, having trained a considerable number of officers and ratings at professional levels of hydrographic Categories A and B, as well as Survey Recorder Classes 1 to 3.\n\nAdmiral Gambo continued, \u201cThe event we are witnessing today, which seeks to formalize cooperation between the Nigerian Navy and the University of Lagos, is one of the series of Civil-Military relations in the field of hydrography engaged in by the Nigerian Navy, as part of its constitutional responsibilities of coordinating all national hydrographic surveys in Nigeria.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nHerdsmen invade Agatu, destroy property, farmland\n\n\u201cHence, partnering with the academia, particularly the University of Lagos, is a step that will ensure that skilled manpower in hydrography is produced to advance Nigeria\u2019s hydrographic practice in line with international best practice.\n\n\u201cAs you already know, availability of skilled hydrographic manpower as well as requisite survey platforms and equipment in any nation enhances such nation\u2019s capability to explore and exploit the resources of the sea, conduct coastal zone management, develop shore approaches and advance maritime security.\n\n\u201cOptimal execution of these activities supports various maritime economic engagements, which generate revenue for improved economic growth. Hence, effective exploitation of the maritime domain for economic development is hinged largely on effective hydrographic survey capabilities.\n\n\u201cHowever, adequate training of hydrographers remains the fundamental pillar for attaining this hydrographic capability. Nigeria\u2019s need for hydrographic manpower has never been more prominent than in this present time.\n\n\u201cAlso, a partnership between both institutions will facilitate International Hydrographic Organization\u2019s accreditation of the MSc Hydrographic Programme of the University of Lagos to Category A Hydrography Programme, which would ultimately attract both\n\ninternational and local patronage.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, our offshore survey vessel, NNS Lana, which is adequately equipped with state-of-the-art facilities for bathymetric and oceanographic surveys would sufficiently provide the needed internship and attachment training for your students.\n\n\u201cAs I look forward to a mutually beneficial partnership with your institution, I implore both parties to be committed to the attainment of the objectives of the MoU\u201d.\n\nIn his remarks, Vice-Chancellor, University of Lagos, Professor Oluwatoyin Ogundipe commended the Nigerian Navy for the milestones achieved in the field of hydrography noting that the partnership between the Navy and UNILAG will ensure the provision of high-quality hydrographic personnel as facilitators.\n\n\u201cIt will also ensure the training and attachment of trainees onboard Nigerian Navy Ships while institutional support will be provided for hydrographic programmes.\n\nHe added that going forward, the Nigerian Navy is expected to assist UNILAG in securing accreditation for the Master\u2019s Degree Programme in Hydrography.\n\nOn the part of UNILAG, Prof. Ogundipe said the institution will bring to bear, its robust logistics support, safe accommodation environment, guaranteed admission, sponsorship, support for research hardware and software within and outside the country.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".\n\n\u2026Marwa launches WADA Club for Universities at UNIABUJA\n\n\u2026Explains why Drug Integrity Test for Universities is necessary.\n\nBy: Kingsley Omonobi \u2013 Abuja.\n\nChairman/Chief Executive Officer of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, Brig General Buba Marwa has warned that the nation faces a grim future over the rate of drugs prevalence among youths wondering, \u201cwhat will become of Nigeria with about 70% youth population if the future of its youths is ravaged by drugs.\n\nSpeaking while launching the War Against Drugs Abuse (WADA) Club at the University of Abuja, Marwa said, \u201cPart of the measures to reduce drug use in universities is the proposed introduction of the Drug Integrity Test for both new and returning students.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe Drug Integrity Test is anticipated to metamorphose into an anti-drug policy for all higher institutions of learning in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is expected that the University of Abuja, being the \u201cUniversity of National Unity\u201d, will be the first public university in Nigeria to adopt the Drug Integrity Test for fresh and returning students of the institution.\n\n\u201cThe Drug Integrity Test is not a punitive measure, rather it is an early detection tool to ascertain an individual\u2019s drug use status for appropriate intervention, and timely treatment and care.\n\n\u201cThis will also entail that the university will develop a drug policy and make such available to each student.\n\n\u201cEqually important is the need to create an NDLEA outpost on the campus where we\u2019ll deploy our men to assist the authorities, deter drug dealers and users within the university.\n\n\u201cIt is commendable to know that the University of Abuja has a functional Counselling and Career Services Centre which attends to the psychological and emotional needs of the students including those struggling with drug addiction.\n\n\u201cThere is a need to give necessary support and care to those who are already hooked on drugs to get out of the habit.\n\n\u201cAs such. I would recommend the establishment of Counselling (and Career Services) Centres in all universities which are yet to establish such. To the students, I charge you in the spirit of true patriotism to desire and work towards a country devoid of drugs and its attendant consequences.\n\nContinuing on the high prevalence of drug useage, Marwa said, \u201cThe facts have alarming human angles. For instance, the survey revealed that one in every four drug users in Nigeria is female. And it is instructive and worrisome to know that drug use was common among those aged 25-39 years, while the age of initiation was 22 years for heroin and 19 years for cannabis.\n\nEmphasizing that \u201cthese age groups comprised of young people who are either in secondary or tertiary institutions or are on the cusp of graduation\u201d, he said, \u201cTo simplify the report of the survey: young people are overwhelmingly the majority of drug abusers in Nigeria.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nResolve crisis in Abia APC, others before national convention, Nkire tells party\u2019s NWC, BoT\n\n\u201cThat is a jolting reality because youths are the building blocks of every developed nation and anything that affects the youth population affects the nation. The youth population constitutes the country\u2019s workforce and the stronger the youth of a country, the more developed that country would be.\n\nAppreciating Vice-Chancellor and the Counselling and Career Services Centre of the university for finding it imperative to sensitize the students and the entire university community on the devastating consequences of substance use and the way forward, Marwa said the theme, \u201cDrug-Free University and Tertiary Institutions,\u201d is apt and timely as there is no better time than now to combat the drug challenge in the university community and among students.\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe menace of drug use is of worrisome dimension, this is even as the government has put in place measures in line with international conventions to counter this growing challenge among our youths.\n\n\u201cThe abuse and trafficking of drugs is a global problem and Nigeria couldn\u2019t have been insulated from this scourge. This was why in 1990 the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) was established and charged with the responsibility of \u201cenforcing laws against the cultivation, processing, sale, trafficking and use of narcotics and psychotropic substances and to investigate persons suspected to have dealings in drugs and other related matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince then, the Agency has not relented in its efforts at reducing the use and trafficking of drugs. But the truth on the ground indicates that our society needs to do more. The National Drug Use and Health Survey of 2018 showed that Nigeria has a peculiar drug use prevalence.\n\n\u201cAt 14.4%, the country\u2019s drug use prevalence is almost three times the global average of 5.6%. And what is worse, the abuse of drugs cuts across all ages, gender, socioeconomic status and regions.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nHanifa: Let justice prevail, re-open private schools\n\n\u201cAs revealed by statistics from the survey, 14.3 million Nigerians, aged 15-64 years, used psychoactive substances, while 10.6 million abused cannabis and 4.6 million others abused pharmaceutical opioids such as codeine, tramadol and morphine among others.\n\n\u201cTo aggressively reverse the trend, President Muhammadu Buhari launched the War Against Drug Abuse (WADA) campaign on 26th June 2021 to commemorate the United Nations International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking.\n\n\u201cThe goal of WADA is to mobilize all Nigerians, especially the youth population, for active participation in the process of ridding our society of the drug menace.\n\n\u201cAs one of the worst-hit age groups by the drug menace, Nigerian youths are critical stakeholders to the attainment of the laudable goals of WADA.\n\n\u201cSince the launch of WADA, the Agency has initiated evidence-based prevention activities which include focused advocacy, drug awareness campaign, sensitization, treatment and care of People Who Use Drugs (PWUD).\n\n\u201cWe have launched a renewed campaign and intensive sensitization, targeting youths in schools at all levels as well as youths out of school.\n\n\u201cThe pervasiveness and magnitude of the drug use problem have necessitated the change in the name of the club from Drug-Free Club to War Against Drug Abuse Club\u2015WADA Club for short\u2015to inject a renewed vibe and vigour into the club and its members.\n\n\u201cThe main objective of the WADA Club include among others, \u201cTo prevent the use and sale of illicit drugs in schools /institutions and promote alternative activities to involvement in drugs.\n\n\u201cOthers are to Increase the knowledge of members on the dangers associated with the use of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs and persuade those using drugs to seek help and equip students with necessary skills that will enable them to resist pressure to use drugs.\n\n\u201cThese listed objectives can only be achieved through the execution of laudable activities that will promote drug-free lifestyles in educational institutions which will invariably enhance learning.\n\n\u201cThe ambassadors, comprising of the academic and non-academic staff of the university, are to act as good role models to students by leading and living by example.\n\n\u201cThe role of WADA Ambassadors is to supervise, encourage and support the club to ensure that the goals of the WADA campaign are achieved within the university community and its environs.\n\n\u201cWe must be agents of change and the change we desire in others must start from us. We must use all of our talents to serve our country and fatherland.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian youth must be in the right state of physical and mental health as well as sound intellectual condition to adequately contribute to national development.\n\n\u201cThe launch of the WADA Club is a significant gesture that the students, staff and indeed the entire community of the University of Abuja has joined in the campaign against drug abuse.\u201d\n\nOther speakers at the occasion included the representative of the minister of Education and Director Guardiance and Counselling Directorate, Mrs Okereke, Deputy Vice-Chancellor, in charge of Administration, Professor Abubakar Sadeeq, the Representative of the National University Commission, Mr Odia and the Director, Counselling and Carrier Service Center, Prof. Mrs. Ojiha\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The United Nations has said $1.1 billion would be needed in 2022 to undertake humanitarian assistance in the troubled north-east Nigeria.\n\nThe United Nations, which revealed that an estimated 8.4 million people will require humanitarian assistance in north-east Nigeria in the course of the year, lamented that the total number of those displaced in the 12 years crisis in the geopolitical zone was rising to over 2.2 million.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday during the launch of the Nigeria Humanitarian Response Plan 2022, the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator ad interim for Nigeria, Matthias Schmale, lamented that the conflict in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe States has evolved into an alarming humanitarian and protection crisis, disproportionately affecting women and girls.\n\nHe said: \u201cOver 2.2 million people are displaced due to the persistent conflict and face daily threats to their health, food security and safety.\u201d\n\nAt the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan for north-east Nigeria, which was launched on Thursday, were speeches read by the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouq, the governors of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe States, United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard, and other prominent stakeholders.\n\nSchmale said US$1.1 billion is needed to provide critical aid and services to 5.5 million people who are most affected by the crisis.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor many women, men, boys and girls, the profound impact of conflict in north-east Nigeria continues to be felt painfully,\u201d adding that: \u201cAlthough we have seen some hopeful developments last year, many people have still started out 2022 in survival mode.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWhile insecurity is persistent in many areas, there are also some locations of relative peace and stability in the north-east that we must look to for opportunities of long-term or durable solutions.\u201d\n\nSchmale, while disclosing that $700 million was realized from the targeted $1 billion, said should the $1.1 million target for this year not be meant, then the humanitarian assistance would be further trimmed down on top priorities that will include food, shelter and protection of the vulnerable, especially women and children.\n\nThe Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management, and Social Development Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouq said: \u201cMillions of people struggle to have their basic needs met, and the fluctuating food prices have further destabilized the already alarming food security situation. Thousands of children are at risk of becoming severely malnourished, especially during the lean season, which will have a detrimental effect on their future development.\u201d\n\nShe added that: \u201cOperationalising the humanitarian-development-peace nexus is key to meeting both immediate and longer-term needs. As we work with the UN and its partners to build the capacity of partners in affected communities, we are focusing on local solutions to local problems.\u201d\n\nIn a recent visit to the north-east state of Borno, the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mr. Martin Griffiths, spoke about his visit to a camp for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Bama, stating, \u201cHere, about 70,000 people live in a camp built for 25,000 people\u201470,000 people\u2014none of whom know the day when they will be able to go home.\u201d\n\nIn the new 2022-2023 multi-year strategy, the humanitarian community will prioritize lifesaving needs while also working to reduce vulnerabilities through efforts to build resilience and enhance self-reliance.\n\nThrough the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), the Humanitarian Country Team for Nigeria and its partners will work to improve living conditions and strengthen protection, food security, nutrition and livelihoods opportunities. The HRP sets out detailed and prioritised cost plans for meeting the needs of affected people in north-east Nigeria, coordinated across UN agencies and NGO partners, as well as with the Government of Nigeria.\n\nIn 2021, the humanitarian community collectively stepped up to save lives with severely limited capacities and access constraints. With the generous support of donors, the humanitarian community and partners assisted close to 5 million people in 2021, including 1.8 million people with critical protection services and 1.3 million with nutritional support. Through the 2022 HRP, humanitarian actors are ready to again provide targeted, life-saving assistance to the most vulnerable people.",

          "text": "A Benin, Edo State business tycoon, Mrs. Christy Oshogwe and Founder/Senior Pastor of Evidence of Christ Redemption Mission in the Edo State capital, Pastor Emmanuel Obeneti Agbujufie, have clashed over threats to life and alleged abduction of four minors, who are children of a deceased Edo woman.\n\nMrs Oshogwe spoke yesterday in Benin, while addressing a news conference.\n\nShe accused Pastor Agbujufie, who hails from Bayelsa State, but in charge of the headquarters church in the capital of Edo State, of being behind the threats to her life, using fierce-looking men, soldiers and fully-armed policemen.\n\nShe also expressed surprise that the cleric, the husband of her late younger sister, could accuse her of abducting the four children, aged 7, 6, 4, 2, of her deceased sibling, when she only acted on the decision of their family members at Agenebode, Etsako East Local Government Area of Edo State, after the passing of her blood sister, in order to take good care of the innocent children and give them quality education.\n\nThe business tycoon stated that with the recent invasion of her houses in Benin and Lagos by soldiers and policemen, her life was in danger, thereby pleading with the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba, to come to her aid.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nShe said: \u201cI am the elder sister to the late Mrs. Aboshogwe Oshogwe, who died on April 30, 2018. Until her death, she was married to Mr. Emmanuel Obeneti Agbujufie, and they had four children: Goodluck, 7; Jesse, 6; Daniel, 4 (all males); and Emmanuella, 2 (female). The Oshogwe\u2019s family is a closely-knitted one, and we love one another tremendously. My other siblings include Paul and Leonard.\n\n\u201cWe witnessed the marriage of our late sister to the husband, in spite of our fears that he might have only sought her hand in marriage, just because of the pedigree of the family. This is because they met as school mates, and at the time of the marriage proposal, he had no visible means of income. Although, he promised to get a job in his Bayelsa State of origin, he did not do so.\n\n\u201cRather, soon after the marriage, he stayed put in Benin City and claimed that he had a calling to be a pastor, and that he would administer a church. Since we could not do anything about it, we resolved to support our sister and the four children, and her husband financially. So that they would not suffer, especially in key areas as house rent and school fees of the children, which went on for over seven years.\n\n\u201cThings turned bad, when we discovered that our sister was terribly sick and the husband did nothing to give her the needed medical care. Rather, he locked her up in their house, off Universal Road, Benin City, and claimed that he was praying for a miracle of healing for her. By the time we became aware of her ailment and its nature, it was almost too late, as she was diagnosed of cancer of the breast. We spent over N5 million, without a kobo from her husband. Constant maltreatment by her husband led to shock, cardiac arrest and she died on April 30, 2018, with the husband refusing to attend his wife\u2019s burial at Agenebode.\u201d\n\nMrs Oshogwe also stated that his interest in the unfortunate development was to take custody of the four children, feed them well and give them quality education, while stressing that surprisingly on January 7, this year while she was in Lagos with the children, Agbujufie led policemen from Benin to arrest her and the children, and forcibly brought them back to the Edo State capital.\n\nThe cleric, however, declared that the business tycoon lied against him, and unlawfully took custody of his children, while insisting that he had the ability and capacity to take care of his biological children.\n\nAgbujufie said: \u201cI was there for my late wife. Her overseas-based sister assisting my late wife is not a crime on my part. There is no one in this world that does not need assistance. My late wife did not just die because of her sickness, but because they were jealous of her success in marrying a responsible man, as they troubled her with lies.\n\n\u201cAs soon as my wife died, her family members started threatening me. I had to go and report to the police. Before I could get to the hospital, they had made away with my late wife\u2019s body and my four children. Only for them to call me and they gave me two days notice for her burial.\n\n\u201cEven at that, I went to Agenebode with my family and church members. Only for us to discover that they had already buried my wife, and they started attacking us. The police could not rescue us. It took the intervention of soldiers to save us from their attacks. They claimed that they had money. So, they tried to intimidate me with their money.\u201d\n\nThe bereaved husband also stated that he never threatened the life of the business tycoon, but he needed to take back his children, and denied by a gold digger.",

          "title": "Sylva: govt will unravel how toxic petrol was imported",
          "text": "By Muyiwa Lucas; Bolaji Ogundele, John Ofikhenua, Abuja; Segun Showunmi, Ibadan and Toba Adedeji, Osogbo\n\nFear grips Petroleum Ministry department\n\nScarcity spreads to Osun\n\nHow did the adulterated petrol get into the country? Whose negligence or compromise led to it?\n\nThese and other issues around the toxic petrol are to be unravelled after a probe by the Federal Government, Minister of State Petroleum Resources Timipre Sylva said yesterday.\n\nSylva said: \u201cThere\u2019ll be a major investigation to unravel everything and then let\u2019s really get to the bottom of it before we can come back and tell you what is going to happen to the culprits.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cWe know that some people\u2019s vehicles must have also been damaged. That is also going to be taken into consideration in dealing with the situation.\u201d\n\nSylva\u2019s statement unsettled officials of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA).\n\nThe NMDPRA is a department in the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, not a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited as earlier reported.\n\nIt is responsible for the inspection of the imported petroleum products.\n\n\u201cThose in the unit are jittery\u201d, a source told The Nation last night.\n\nNMDPRA on Tuesday said methanol above Nigeria\u2019s specification was discovered in a limited quantity of petrol in the supply chain.\n\nIt said the impacted product had been isolated and withdrawn from the market, including the loaded trucks in transit.\n\nThe development resulted in product scarcity in Abuja, Lagos and other cities.\n\nSylva, speaking with State House Correspondents after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting at the Presidential Villa, said he met with President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday over the matter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in a position to disclose the identities of the companies, but there are some issues and we are actively tackling it.\n\n\u201cNobody has, before now, checked for methanol in our fuel. It\u2019s not very usual and this is the first time this is happening and NNPC is very much up to the task.\n\n\u201cI will also convey your question to NNPC and maybe NMDPRA, but we\u2019re actively handling it and I want to assure you that the problem will be a thing of the past very soon,\u201d he said.\n\nAn industry player wondered how the contaminated product could have found its way into the country as refineries produce only requested specifications.\n\nThe source explained that once an importer sends its country specification to a refinery, the product must meet that standard.\n\n\u201cNormally, if a country is importing from a refinery, it will give its specification of the product. And when the product arrives, it is taken to the DPR laboratory in Lagos for a test.\n\n\u201cIt usually arrives in Lagos by the mother basin in the high sea, from where smaller vessels collect.\n\n\u201cOnce it comes to the depot, the DPR tests the product. DPR has to do a water test and a purity test as to whether the chemical is okay for Nigeria\u2019s standard.\n\n\u201cPeople realised that this particular one was adulterated when motorists started using it.\u201d\n\nThe scarcity caused by the toxic petrol withdrawal extended to Oyo and Osun states yesterday.\n\nThere were queues in many petrol stations in Ibadan, the Oyo capital, and Osogbo, the Osun capital, and environs.\n\nBut the NMDPRA said Nigeria currently has 20 days of petrol sufficiency and that there was no need for panic buying.\n\nThe department said it was also working round the clock with other stakeholders to address the issue of substandard PMS.\n\nNMDPRA Chief Executive Mr Farouk Ahmed, in a meeting with downstream industry stakeholders in Lagos, said: \u201cI am happy to say that loading has been going on in most of the depots because we have been able to identify, isolate and quarantine the limited amount of gasoline that was affected by the methanol volume that was discovered.\n\n\u201cWe have vessels that have arrived in the country recently. At least six arrived in the last few days ordered by the NNPC carrying a total volume of close to 300 million litres just to close the gap created by those vessels we have withdrawn from the system.\n\n\u201cAll in all, as of today (yesterday), we have about 20 days sufficiency of PMS in the country.\n\n\u201cOur ideal days of sufficiency are 30 but the withdrawal of the vessel created the gap in our 30 days sufficiency.\n\n\u201cAgain, with aggressive importation by the NNPC, this will be closed in a few days from the data we got from the NNPC\u2019s import programme.\n\n\u201cLoading is also ongoing in most of the depots that have confirmed spec products so there is no need for panic. Hopefully, by tomorrow (today) or early Friday, Lagos will be cleared.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, a 9,000MT vessel was about to discharge at the Apapa Port, which would be providing PMS to major marketers including OVH Energy, TotalEnergies, 11 Plc, ConOil and Ardova Plc.\n\nThe Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) confirmed the sale of adulterated petrol in some service outlets in the Southeast.\n\nThe Chairman of IPMAN, Enugu Depot Community, Mr Chinedu Anyaso, whose zone covers Anambra, Ebonyi and Enugu states, said the development had been communicated to the headquarters of the association.\n\nMany vehicle ranges are believed to have been damaged by the toxic fuel.\n\n\u201cWe have received complaints about the sale of bad petrol within Enugu Zone for about two weeks now.\n\n\u201cWe have escalated the information to our zonal and national secretariats, which are already talking with the NNPC.\n\n\u201cOn our part, we have tried to protect customers by directing our members to stop selling such product until it is tested and approved by the regulatory agencies,\u201d Anyaso said.\n\nIPMAN has also directed its members to suspend the distribution of the toxic petrol.\n\nIts National Vice President, Alhaji Abubakar Maigandi, told The Nation: \u201cWe have told our marketers to stop buying from the depots until they get the one that doesn\u2019t have methanol.\u201d\n\nMore petrol stations in Abuja sold the petrol yesterday compared to the previous day, but black marketers were seen selling on roadsides.\n\nThe retail outlets that sold had very long queues that obstructed traffic flow on major roads.\n\nThe contaminated fuel was brought in by Duke Oil, a trading arm of the NNPC Limited.\n\nDuke Oil had supplied a cargo of petrol purchased from an international trader, Litasco, which was delivered in Motor Tanker (MT) Nord Gainer.\n\nThe vessel, carrying about 50, 000 metric tons of petrol or 100 million litres discharged in the Lagos port between January 24 and 30.\n\nIt was learnt that from this vessel, some major oil marketers such as OHV, MRS, NIPCO, Ardova and Total got a combined 36.958 metric tonnes of the contaminated fuel.\n\nMRS, in a statement, said upon receiving the product in its depot and distribution to eight of its stations in Lagos, it was observed that the product appeared hazy and dark.\n\nAn analysis revealed that the product had 20 per cent methanol, an illegal substance.\n\n\u201cAs a Company, we are aware that alcohol/ethanol is not permitted to be mixed in PMS specification. We immediately informed NNPC, NMDPRA and MOMAN and it was confirmed that other members had similar experiences,\u201d the statement read.\n\nMRS said the adulterated product had been isolated and would not be sold to the public.\n\nIn Ebonyi State, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) arrested six persons conveying 90,000 litres of adulterated petroleum products.\n\nThe State Commandant, Terrumun Gbue, told reporters in Abakiliki that the suspects were arrested on the Abakaliki-Enugu federal highway on Monday night.\n\nNNPC generates N2.613tr in one year\n\nAlso yesterday, the NNPC said it generated N2.613 trillion from the sale of petrol from August 2020 to August 2021.\n\nThis was contained in the August 2021 Monthly Financial and Operations Report (MFOR), according to the NNPC Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Malam Garba Deen Muhammad yesterday.\n\nHe said: \u201cTotal revenues generated from the sales of white products for the period of August 2020 to August 2021 stood at N2.619trillion with petrol contributing about 99.76 per cent of the total sales with a value of ?2.613trillion.\u201d\n\nThe total sale of white products for August 2020 to August 2021 stood at 20.032billion, with petrol accounting for 99.81 per cent.\n\nIn terms of value, said the NNPC spokesman, a total sum of N203.43billion was made on the sale of white products by PPMC in August 2021.\n\nThe NNPC said in the downstream sector, a total of 1.532billion litres of white products were sold and distributed by the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC), a downstream subsidiary of the NNPC, in August 2021.\n\nThe NNPC also announced a total of $224.29 million receipts from crude oil and gas export in August 2021. This is against $191.26million in July 2021.\n\nA breakdown of the figures captured in the August 2021 NNPC MFOR showed that export of crude oil amounted to $7.77million while gas and miscellaneous receipts stood at $65.26 million and $151.26million.\n\nTotal crude oil and gas export receipt for the period of August 2020 to August 2021 stood at $1.84billion.\n\nIn the gas sector, a total of 233.57 billion cubic feet (bcf) of natural gas was produced in August 2021, translating to an average daily production of 7,534.67million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd).\n\nFrom August 2020 to August 2021, a total of 2,890.67bcf of gas was produced representing an average daily production of 7,303.61mmscfd during the period.\n\nPetroleum tanker drivers threatened to proceed on strike over the condition of critical roads.\n\nIt alleged that some people were already pilfering the N621billion Road Infrastructure Tax Credit Scheme meant for the rehabilitation of 21 critical roads across the country.\n\nIts National Chairman, Comrade Salmon Akanni, told reporters in Abuja that members of his association would proceed on strike at very short notice if the government does not put the roads in order very soon.\n\nOn the N621billion, he said: \u201cTo the delight of all of us, the issue was tabled before the Federal Executive Council and was expressly approved within two weeks as agreed.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, and to our greatest shocks, we heard it from very reliable sources that some vultures in the garbs of being state governments, officials of Ministry of Works and Housing and politicians are already depleting these funds and misappropriating them on roads and projects not intended in the agreement as approved by the Federal Executive Council.\u201d",

          "title": "Withdrawal of petrol with methanol cause of scarcity",
          "text": "From Uche Usim, (Abuja) and Adewale Sanyaolu\n\nAs long queues surfaced across Lagos and Abuja yesterday over sudden fuel scarcity, the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) has blamed the situation on the withdrawal of petrol discovered to have contained methanol above Nigeria\u2019s specification.\n\nAccording to a statement by the agency yesterday, the affected petrol was isolated and withdrawn from the market, including the loaded trucks in transit.\n\nMethanol is a regular additive in petrol and usually blended in an acceptable quantity.\n\nNMDPRA explained that the source supplier has been identified and appropriate actions would be taken.\n\nThe agency said its technical team, in conjunction with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Ltd and other industry stakeholders, would \u201cmonitor and ensure that quality petroleum products are adequately supplied and distributed nationwide.\u201d\n\nIt revealed that the NNPC Ltd and all oil marketing companies had been directed to sustain sufficient distribution of petrol in all retail outlets nationwide.\n\nThe NMDPRA said NNPC had intensified efforts at increasing the supply of petrol into the market \u201cin order to bridge any unforeseen supply gap.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria, (IPMAN) has warned motorists against panic buying, saying petroleum products will be available from today.\n\nIts Vice President, Abubakar Maigandi, stated this yesterday as a guest on Arise TV news programme, Newsday. He said: \u201cThe government and the NNPC is (sic) on it. \u201cThere is no way we can sell those contaminated because it will affect motorists. But\u2026car owners should stop panic-buying. By God\u2019s grace, today or tomorrow, the product will be available nationwide.\u201d\n\nHe gave assurance that Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) wasworking seriously to see that they get the correct product so that the marketers wouldcontinue loading.\n\n\u201cAlready, we told all our marketers to stand by the various depots that they are loading. Immediately when we start receiving the uncontaminated products, the products will be available in most of our filling stations nationwide,\u201d he said.\n\nMaigandi did not mention who was to be held responsible for the contaminated petroleum products in circulation. He, however, said \u201cIPMAN buys its product through NNPC and private depots. In every business sometimes, \u201cthere must an issue and this has been already understanding (sic) without many damages,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso IPMAN National Operations Controller, Mr. Mike Osatuyi, disclosed that the contaminated product is being mopped-up, a development that has caused disruption in the distribution chain.\n\n\u2018\u2018The impact is quickly felt in Lagos because of its huge demand and consumption of petrol. Any disruption in the distribution chain is almost an immediate reaction unlike what obtains in other parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC is doing its best at this critical time and we believe the effort will yield a positive action soon. I implore Nigerians to be patient and not engage in any form of panic buying,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOther marketers who spoke to Daily Sun in confidence for fear of being sanctioned by the regulator confirmed that there was indeed off-spec petrol in circulation.\n\nThe off-spec or contaminated petrol according to the marketers is petrol laden with graded water and already in the tanks of some major oil marketers which included; Ardova, MRS and Total with independent marketers such as NIPCO also involved.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nThey explained that since NNPC is the sole importer of petrol, they should be held liable and made to explain to Nigerians what happened.\n\nHowever, a reliable source in one of the agencies told Daily Sun that the contaminated petrol came in with some quantity of methanol and ethanol and that when tested, the result came out as being fit for use but when exposed to oxygen, it starts to react. The source added that the exposure to oxygen builds up sludge in the petrol, thus causing damage to car engines.\n\n\u2018\u2018I can confirm to you that we have received reports that this contaminated fuel has caused damage to vehicle engines. That is not in doubt.\n\nShe explained that both NNPC and the Nigerian Midstream Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) are both aware of this development and are taken steps to ensure that the situation is arrested.\n\nThe marketer further told Daily Sun that the volume of the contaminated fuel which made is way into the country is about 200 million litres.\n\nHe said the NNPC has given assurance that it would evacuate the contaminated fuel in the tanks of the affected depots while ensuring that they do not suffer any financial loss, they would be reimbursed for the bad product.\n\n\u2018\u2018For now, we are not loading out trucks until this issue is addressed in the interest of the consumers. This may take up till next week before it gets resolved. The result of fuel shortage is what has now translated to queues in some filling stations. But the truth is that, not all depots/fuel marketers are affected.\n\nMeanwhile, Some petroleum marketers say fuel scarcity will persist in Lagos and other parts of the country until depots are restocked with adequate and quality products.\n\nThe marketers who spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on the condition of anonymity equally blamed the current scarcity on the supply of a wrong specification of petrol in some parts of the country.\n\nThey noted that the directive to withdraw the product from the market even after distribution to many filling stations across Lagos and other areas created a supply shortfall, thereby, leading to panic buying.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd is working to ensure that this disruption to the supply chain is addressed as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cHowever, there is the challenge of logistics and how to compensate those who were supplied with the adulterated products.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC is working with marketers on this and once the depots are restocked, tankers will start loading and supply will improve across the country.\n\n\u201cUntil we are able to achieve this, queues will remain at the petrol stations because of the panic already created,\u2019\u2019 one of the top marketers told NAN.\n\nAn independent petroleum marketer (name withheld) said there had been complaints from some motorists on the fuel quality which made his station to stop selling for now.\n\n\u201cSome independent marketers are not hoarding products as is being alleged. Some of us were affected by the supply we got and we are trying to resolve the situation so that we can continue our business,\u2019\u2019 he said.",

          "text": "\u2022371m litres in six cargoes, not 100m litres of petrol affected\n\n*Regulatory agency admits high sulphur content in contaminated product\n\n\u2022Bad fuel withdrawn from circulation, say independent marketers\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari was said to have yesterday expressed anger over the contaminated petrol in circulation across the country, a development that has disrupted the nation\u2019s fuel supply chain for several days.\n\nThe president was said to have therefore ordered that the Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), Mr. Farouk Ahmed, should be queried immediately.\n\nBuhari, who was said to be visibly worried over the situation, leading to the return of long fuel queues in parts of the country, especially in Abuja, Lagos, Ogun, Port Harcourt and others, instructed the Minister of State, Petroleum, Mr. Timipre Sylva, to ask Ahmed to explain how the product came into the country.\n\nAn impeccable presidency source told THISDAY that Buhari felt that the first point to begin to unravel how the product came into the country and invariably began circulating should be the agency, which by law acts as the \u201cpolice\u201d of the downstream and midstream sector.\n\nThe Authority was created in August 2021 in line with the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) and encompasses a merger of three defunct regulatory agencies: Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA), Petroleum Equalisation Fund (Management) Board (PEFMB), and the Midstream and Downstream Divisions of the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR).\n\nIt is responsible for the regulation of the midstream and downstream petroleum operations in Nigeria which includes technical, operational, and commercial activities.\n\nAccording to the source, who asked not be named, the minister who was at the Presidential Villa to brief the president, following the growing outrage over the issue, was directed to, in a short while, send the query to the CEO of the agency.\n\n\u201cThis matter has become an embarrassment to this government. There\u2019s no question that these cargoes of petrol were bad, so he (Ahmed) is being queried over how the fuel came into the country and the president has so instructed,\u201d the presidency source explained.\n\nWhen THISDAY sought to know why the midstream/downstream should be issued a query while the likely importer, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) was seemingly being let off the hook, the source said while investigations were ongoing, the response of the agency would determine which other government agency or private individuals would be sanctioned.\n\n\u201cThe reason the midstream/downstream authority is being queried first is that for now the bulk stops at its desk. They are the first port of call. Ordinarily, they are expected to know how it came into the country.\n\n\u201cThis is because they are the police of the industry. How did it get past them into circulation? It is their job to know. They are the police which should stop bad fuel from coming into the country.\n\n\u201cSo, the NNPC has not been queried for now. The question now is who certified the product clean enough to come into the country?\n\n\u201cWhen the investigation is done, then the federal government will know where the blame lies, but for now, the NNPC is just a company and doesn\u2019t necessarily owe allegiance to government as it were, because it\u2019s now just like every other company with a profit motive.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand the authority is the regulator, they are supposed to flag any adulterated product so that it doesn\u2019t come into the country. For now , the question the government is asking is: How did it come into the country. Who gave the permission or go-ahead? That is the question for now, then other steps will follow.\n\n\u201cIt is on the basis of that the presidency can then apportion blames and sanction other culpable operators accordingly,\u201d the presidency source added.\n\nAccording to the source, the affected volume of products in circulation was more than the 100 million litres being bandied about, adding that it came in six cargoes.\n\n\u201cThe actual figure is 317 million litres that came in six cargoes. So, the argument that it is isolated does not hold water,\u201d the source alleged.\n\nThe current problematic supply of petrol has for days grounded movement in Abuja, Lagos and some other parts of the country, made worse by the shortage of inventory released from the sole importer, the NNPC.\n\nThe prevailing condition has ensured that in Abuja, especially, a majority of filling stations were shut even as motorists spent hours in the sun struggling to buy from the few that were open, causing serious traffic jams in parts of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nThe particular cargoes with the issue were said to have high sulphur content, while marketers have been advised not to sell to consumers.\n\nIn addition, it was learnt that the queues returned partly because the gap which existed when depot owners started hoarding products before the announcement of retention of subsidy by the federal government had not smoothened.\n\nThis has challenged the lifting of products to, especially Abuja and other parts of the north from Lagos, THISDAY gathered.\n\nIn a statement on the matter yesterday, the Authority admitted that \u201climited quantity of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), commonly known as petrol, with methanol quantities above Nigeria\u2019s specification was discovered in the supply chain.\u201d\n\nWhile stressing that methanol is a regular additive in petrol and usually blended in an acceptable quantity, the NMDPRA stated that to ensure vehicular and equipment safety, the limited quantity of the impacted product has been isolated and withdrawn from the market, including the loaded trucks in transit.\n\n\u201cOur technical team in conjunction with NNPC Ltd and other industry stakeholders, will continue to monitor and ensure quality petroleum products are adequately supplied and distributed nationwide,\u201d it added.\n\nAccording to the agency, the \u201csource supplier\u201d has been identified and further commercial and appropriate actions shall be taken by the Authority and NNPC Ltd.\n\nIn addition, it noted that the NNPC Ltd and all oil marketing companies had been directed to sustain sufficient distribution of petrol in all retail outlets nationwide.\n\nSubsequently, the NDMPRA stated that the NNPC has intensified efforts at increasing the supply of the product into the market in order to bridge any unforeseen supply gap.\n\nMeanwhile, in separate interviews on Arise Television, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm, National President of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Mr. Chinedu Okoronkwo and the Vice President of the union, Mr. Abubakar Maigandi, confirmed that the bad products were being withdrawn from circulation.\n\nWhile trying to play down the seriousness of the situation, Okoronkwo who absolved his members of any complicity in the matter, noted that \u201cin any given situation, business-wise, sometimes you might have ups and downs\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThis time, we must let the world know that the Independent Marketers Association of Nigeria has never been part of any scarcity or whatever you may call it.\n\n\u201cOur own duty is to ensure that we get products and take to our station and retail to the masses. So moving forward, on the issue of this contaminated product, it is no more a hidden thing, but we have got an assurance from the NNPC that the fuel has been removed.\n\n\u201cAnd they have brought in new one now that we are now using. You know any ripples in the system for one or two days might exaggerate (extend) into one week,\u201d he posited.\n\nAccording to him, the hope was that the national oil company has now gotten its act together and had taken inventory of the contaminated product which had been withdrawn from circulation.\n\nHe argued that the complaints of vehicles breaking down had markedly subsided, meaning that good product was now in circulation, reassuring that the situation will normalise in days.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the market, you know that people are still buying now, which means the good one is coming into the system,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso in his remarks, Maigandi assured that: \u201cBy God\u2019s grace, today or tomorrow, the product will be available nationwide.\u201d\n\nOn the source of the bad fuel, he said: \u201cAll the marketers as you know, heavily depend on the NNPC. So we buy this product through the NNPC and private depots.\n\n\u201cThat is the source of our getting this product. But, you know, in every business, sometimes there must be an issue. And this issue has already been understood without much damage.\n\n\u201cAnd NNPC is working seriously to see that they get the correct product so that the marketers will continue loading. Already, we have told all our marketers to stand by and we have started receiving decontaminated products.\n\n\u201c You will see that the product will be available in most of our filling station nationwide. Normally we take precautionary measures immediately we bring the product into our filling stations,\u201d he explained.\n\nA day earlier, the South-West Zonal Chairman of IPMAN, Mr. Dele Tajudeen, had lamented that members of the association had suffered severe losses and may ask for damages from the authorities.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says legal interpretations must bow to people\u2019s wish\n\n\u2022Cites Zamfara\u2019s case in 2019 polls\n\n\u2022Visits Hanifa\u2019s family in Kano, prays for the repose of her soul\n\nBy Ibrahim Shuaibu\n\n\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo, yesterday, expressed worry about judicial interventions in election matters, concurring with rising calls for interrogation of the role of the judiciary, especially, the Supreme Court, in electoral issues, specifically, whether it has not been exceeding its remits.\n\nOsinbajo spoke at the 53rd Conference of the National Association of Law Teachers, held at Bayero University, Kano (BUK). The conference had the theme, \u201cLaw, Democracy and the Electoral Process.\u201d\n\nThe vice president said legal interpretation must always bow to the wish of the people, citing what he viewed as the unfortunate outcome of the 2019 elections in Zamfara State.\n\nOsinbajo visited the family of the five-year-old Hanifa Abubakar, who was killed by proprietor of Nobel Kids Academy, Kwanar Dakata, Nasarawa Local Government Area of the state, Abdulmalik Tanko. He condoled with the family and prayed God to give them the courage to bear the painful passing of their daughter.\n\nDelivering his lecture at the conference, Osinbajo insisted that appropriate interpretation of the law should always bow to the will of the electorate, because the idea of democracy was for the people to determine their leaders.\n\nCiting the 2019 elections in Zamfara State, he said, \u201cThe decision of the Supreme Court in the case of APC and Marafa, and that is a case, where the Supreme Court nullified the elections of all candidates of the APC and gave judgement in favour of the party, who were resoundingly defeated in the same election.\n\n\u201cIn that election in 2019, the trouble at the Supreme Court game was that the APC primaries that produced candidates that were voted for were invalid.\n\n\u201cAnd without recourse to the elections that had in the polls rejected all the other candidates in the other political parties, the Supreme Court declared candidates of parties other than the APC as winners of the various offices that were contested, as winners in that February 23rd and March 15 general election.\n\n\u201cThe court held that the APC votes cast by the Zamfara State electorate to select their preferred candidate to governor, senators, members of the House of Representatives, members of the House of Assembly were all, and I quote, \u2018wasted votes\u2019. Why? Because according to the court, APC did not conduct any valid primary elections and as such, had no candidates for any elections in the state.\n\n\u201cSo, here is a situation, where the party that lost every seat, from governorship to House of Assembly, was given all those seats on judicial pronouncements. For the voter, this decision must have at best been puzzling.\n\n\u201cFirst, the voter had no idea that the candidates of their preferred party were disqualified before voting. Indeed, at least, one court had declared the primaries valid and it was on that basis that INEC gave the go-ahead to the candidates to contest.\n\n\u201cSecondly, rather than giving seats to those that the electorate have rejected, ordering a rerun would probably have yielded a fairer result in the opinion of many of those, who went to the polls on that day. And I agree with my brother A.B Mahmoud SAN, that there is a real issue of whether the courts have not assumed a larger duty in election cases than was constitutionally intended.\u201d\n\nThe vice president, who maintained that the judiciary remained the pillar of democracy, said, \u201cIn other words, are our courts going beyond constitutional expectations in election cases? And it is important to emphasise this, because the whole idea of democracy is that the people determine who their leaders will be, the law, electoral processes \u2013 everything must bow to the will of the people.\u201d\n\nRecalling his teaching experience at the University of Lagos in 1981 as Lecturer II, with a salary of N620, Osinbajo, who is believed to be nursing presidential ambition, reiterated, \u201cThe appropriate interpretation must always bow to the will of the people. I am certain that these views will add to the deliberations at the conference.\u201d\n\nWhile declaring the conference opened earlier, Prof. Osinbajo noted that democracy and social justice are closely linked, in his prepared speech titled; The pursuit of Justice is What Helps Build a Good Society, Osinbajo stated that the cornerstone of democracy is the insistence that \u201cour society must be governed by the rule of law and not the whim of man.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs law teachers and legal practitioners, we are custodians of this truth. However, democracy cannot endure without social justice,\u201d he said, noting that \u201cthe pursuit of justice lies at the heart of the quest for the good of society.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThis makes the legal profession one of the cardinal vocations upon which civilization rests. Indeed, law is an instrument of pacific social engineering, the end of which is justice. When it is rooted in this postulate, it follows that the law and therefore democracy, are meant to serve beneficial social ends.\u201d\n\nAccording to the VP, \u201ca society in which an increasing number of people consider themselves alienated from legal institutions or perceive these legal institutions to be incapable of delivering justice for all cannot be stable and prosperous.\u201d\n\nWithout social justice, legal justice is ultimately unattainable, Prof. Osinbajo stated, adding that \u201cour idea of social justice also refers to the social and economic rights of the people.\u201d\n\nHe said these rights, according to the Constitution, include the right to food, shelter, employment, education and a reasonable national minimum living wage, care for the elderly, pensions, unemployment benefits and welfare for the physically challenged.\n\n\u201cThe degree to which citizens are in possession of their social and economic rights has a direct impact on the degree of their access to legal services and, thence, to justice. Our concern as teachers and practitioners of the law, therefore, must extend beyond the courtroom, beyond the precincts of our legal institutions, to the social reality in which these structures exist.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on government\u2019s role in ensuring growth of democracy and social justice in society, the Vice President noted that \u201cthe principle of the dignity of the human person implies that governments must be considerate, egalitarian and universal in the sense that they must serve everyone.\u201d\n\nAgain, he stated that this cardinal principle was a major reason for the Federal Government\u2019s Social Investment Programmes.\n\nThe VP said the Administration will continue to ramp up its efforts in social welfare and expanding universal health insurance to ensure \u201cthat our most vulnerable citizens are not abandoned to the vicissitudes of fate.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on the essence of democracy and the need to preserve democratic institutions in Nigeria and other parts of Africa, the Vice President noted that even as Nigeria has enjoyed 22 years of unbroken democracy, the country is still a young democracy.\n\n\u201cWe have witnessed a series of peaceful transitions of power. This is a huge credit to the democratic sensibilities of our people. Along the way, we are learning valuable lessons that can only make us better practitioners of liberty.\n\n\u201cMany of our institutions are still in their infancy, and we must carefully guide them into maturity. We recognize that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance,\u201d Prof. Osinbajo observed.\n\nHe noted that the Electoral Bill now in process is testament to the Administration\u2019s commitment towards improving Nigeria\u2019s electoral process.\n\n\u201cThe Bill itself has been the subject of robust engagement between the government and civil society. While some have expressed reservations about the time it is taking to enact the new law, we should remember that a truly inclusive democratic, deliberative process often takes time. I am confident that the legislation that emerges will be one that reflects a broad consensus between all the stakeholders,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Vice President added that \u201cwhile INEC continues to improve its capacity to conduct credible elections, particularly through the deployment of technology; we recognize that democracy is about much more than voting. It is also about constitutionalism, rule of law and respect for civil liberties. We must diligently work to uphold these principles.\n\n\u201cOur progress as a democracy must therefore also be prosecuted in terms of the struggle to reduce the basic problems of ill-health, malnutrition, illiteracy, and famine which daily afflict our people. Where social and economic rights are unsecured, people are unable to fully maximize their civil and political rights.\u201d\n\nIn his own speech, Governor Abdullahi Ganduje commended members of the judiciary for organising the conference at Bayero University, Kano, which focused on the role of the judiciary in the development of democracy across the country.\n\nOsinbajo, who used the opportunity of his engagement in Kano to visit Hanifa\u2019s family, condoled with the girl\u2019s parents. Ganduje and other government officials accompanied Osinbajo on the condolence visit.\n\nHanifa was kidnapped last December by her school proprietor, Tanko, who later killed her and buried her in the school compound. He is currently standing trial along with two other suspects at a Kano court on a four-count charge. Tanko was arrested while trying to collect part of a ransom he had negotiated after killing Hanifa.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022US, UK oppose move\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report\n\nThe Nigerian government is locked in a court battle with Britain\u2019s National Crime Agency (NCA) over control of \u20ac180 million (\u00a3150 million) that was stashed abroad by Nigeria\u2019s former Head of State, late Gen. Sani Abacha.\n\nBy yesterday\u2019s official exchange rate of the British Pounds Sterling at N563, as seen on the website of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the money in contention is about N84.5 billion.\n\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s The Telegraph reported that the case was again poised to spark fresh questions about dirty money flowing through the City of London.\n\nIn the latest legal tussle over the money, generally known in Nigeria as \u201cAbacha loot\u201d, the report stated that Nigeria wanted the crime-fighting agency, NCA, to release funds that it froze at the request of US authorities.\n\nIn May 2020, the federal government confirmed the receipt of $311 million looted by a late dictator, Abacha, repatriated from the United States and Island of Jersey.\n\nAccording to Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, \u201cThe amount increased significantly from over $308 million to over $311 million because of the interest that accrued from February 3, 2020, to 28th April, 2020, when the fund was transferred to the CBN.\u201d\n\nIt came after the recovery of $322 million from Switzerland in 2018.\n\nAt the time, Malami noted that the government had committed that the asset would support and assist in expediting the construction of three major infrastructure projects across Nigeria, namely, Lagos \u2013 Ibadan Expressway, Abuja \u2013 Kano Road, and Second Niger Bridge.\n\nIt was estimated that from 2007 to 2020, about $1.5 billion had been returned to Nigeria from different parts of the world.\n\nAccording to the latest report, American prosecutors said the money could be traced back to a suspected $2.2 billion (\u00a31.6 billion) or more that was plundered by Abacha and his associates during the dictator\u2019s five-year reign.\n\nIn the complex issues surrounding the repatriation of the funds, the authorities in the US sought to return the money to \u201cthe people of Nigeria\u201d, under the so-called Kleptocracy Initiative.\n\nBut the Nigerian government was said have sought to \u201csidestep\u201d the process and obtain the funds directly through an application to the High Court, in a move opposed by UK and US authorities, documents seen by The Telegraph and SourceMaterial showed.\n\nAlthough Abacha died more than 20 years ago, the piles of treasure he looted from Nigerian coffers have kept cropping up, with at least $2 billion being thought to have stolen during his five years in power.\n\nThe former dictator\u2019s spoils have been linked to dozens of offshore bank accounts over the years, as investigators unravel the intricate web he and his associates spun across the globe.\n\nBritish and American authorities have been locked in talks over tens of millions of pounds of cash that investigators say can be traced to Abacha\u2019s plundering, the investigation found.\n\nThe case, which involves a serving Nigerian politician who was one of Abacha\u2019s top henchmen, includes cash in British bank accounts that has been frozen by the National Crime Agency.\n\nHowever, the Nigerian government has brought its own legal action against the NCA in a bid to end the tussle, it has emerged.\n\nThe report stated, \u201cIt is a complicated story with many twists and turns. But the on-going struggle for \u2018Abacha\u2019s loot\u2019 reveals the difficulty in recovering stolen funds, the frustrations of law enforcement, and the way people accused of corruption have relied on respectable law firms to argue their cases in court.\u201d\n\nOn the modus operandi used by Abachi to execute the looting, the report stated that after seizing power in a 1993 coup, Abacha set about using his position as Nigeria\u2019s head of state to place himself above the law and skim vast sums of money from the oil-rich nation.\n\nIn perhaps the most brazen example, he would tell advisers to make spurious requests to him for money to deal with national \u201cemergencies\u201d, according to US court documents.\n\nSigned letters would then be sent to the CBN, which would provide cash, travellers\u2019 cheques or arrange a wire transfer.\n\nThe report added, \u201cMoney was stuffed into boxes or bags and transported to Abacha\u2019s house, before associates arranged for it to be sent abroad.\n\n\u201cAt least $2 billion is thought to have been stolen this way, using more than 60 letters to the central bank.\n\n\u201cAbacha also arranged for the government to sell bonds to a company controlled by his allies before buying them back at vastly inflated prices, generating an illicit windfall of $282 million.\u201d\n\nSeparately, the report stated that Abacha and his associates extorted French engineering firm, Dumez Group, of $97 million and used his spoils to live a luxurious lifestyle.\n\n\u201cInside his many sprawling homes, he kept piles of glittering jewellery, including gold necklaces and rings, and at one stage as much as $100 million in cash,\u201d the report noted.\n\nHowever, the money Abacha and his associates plundered became the subject of an international search after the dictator\u2019s sudden death in 1998, aged 54.\n\nThe report stated that weeks after his death, Abacha\u2019s widow was caught trying to flee the country with 38 suitcases packed with money and his family later forfeited nearly $1 billion.\n\n\u201cYet the only clues hinting at where other stashes of money could be found were a few details of secret offshore bank accounts discovered by authorities,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cSince then, the Nigerians have sought foreign help to recover as much as possible, with more than $1 billion eventually returned from Switzerland alone,\u201d it added.\n\nThe effort has been hampered by the sheer complexity of Abacha\u2019s dealings as well as marathon legal battles that have dragged on for years, some involving former associates.\n\nOne of the remaining cases, brought by US prosecutors, aims to recover more than $480 million, the report stressed. In just one example of the web of transactions criss-crossing the globe, they outlined in court filings how money was laundered by Abacha and his associates through bank accounts in Lagos, London, New York, Paris, Zurich, and Geneva.\n\nThe assets were stashed in banks, including Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and Banque SBA, according to the lawsuit, although there was no suggestion that the banks were involved in any wrongdoing.\n\nThe Telegraph stated, \u201cThis legal action eventually resulted in a 2020 deal to repatriate about $321 million, which had been laundered through the US banking system and then held in accounts in Jersey under the name of Doraville Properties Corporation, a British Virgin Islands company, and Abacha\u2019s son, Mohammed.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the new development comes as Britain fights claims that it has been very tolerant of dirty money flowing through the City of London.\n\nUS officials said last month that they were concerned that deep links between the UK and several Russian oligarchs meant that sanctions issued against Moscow if it invades Ukraine could be rendered ineffective.\n\nLast Sunday, Briish Labour MP David Lammy accused ministers of doing too little to deal with corruption in Britain.\n\nLammy said, \u201cWe have to fix the dirty money problem we have, this huge problem of money laundering in London, of corruption and fraud.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much that (ministers) are not doing. Joe Biden knows it and he\u2019s concerned.\u201d\n\nBut simultaneously, another court tussle in the UK is happening in parallel. At stake is more than \u20ac90 million, some of which came from Abacha\u2019s security votes fraud, according to a High Court judgement issued in 2014.\n\nThe money is said to be controlled by a Singapore-based trust set up for the benefit of the family of Abubakar Bagudu, the serving governor of Kebbi State, who is accused of playing an \u201cinstrumental role\u201d in many of Abacha\u2019s corrupt schemes by US prosecutors.\n\nBagudu has always denied any wrongdoing. His office did not respond to a request for comment, the report said.\n\nHis brother, Ibrahim, is a director of two companies known as Blue Holdings that are owned by the Singapore trust.\n\nAccording to the Pandora Papers, a leaked cache of documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists last year, the Bagudu brothers enlisted Farrer & Co, an elite London law firm that has advised the Queen, to help them set up these businesses.\n\nThey moved \u20ac98 million from a British Virgin Islands trust to a new structure spanning Singapore and the Cook Islands.\n\nFarrer & Co said it carried out \u201cextensive due diligence\u201d on Bagudu and that it obtained approval from the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), the precursor to the NCA, to move the funds.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the case, the amount controlled by the Singapore trust may now have grown to as much as \u20ac180 million. It is kept in accounts at Waverton Investment Management and James Hambro & Partners, both based in London.\n\nThe NCA has been working with American authorities in a bid to confiscate the funds and return them to \u201cthe people of Nigeria,\u201d the report stated.\n\nHowever, the Nigerian government wants them to be returned directly to the country and the parties, including lawyers for Bagudu, have been holding negotiations about a possible settlement, court filings in the US show.\n\nBagudu struck a deal with the Nigerian government in 2003, in which he agreed to return a sum of money but made no admission of wrongdoing, and the agreement was reaffirmed by Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in 2018. What this means, according to the report, is that almost 70 per cent of the UK money could be handed to Bagudu if returned.\n\nCourt filings showed the Nigerian government subsequently sought to unlock the funds and repatriate them in legal action against the NCA \u2013 a move that was opposed by the UK and US.\n\nThe country hired Kingsley Napley, the London law firm famed for representing a host of celebrities, including Rebekah Vardy, to represent it. The firm and the NCA both declined to comment, the report noted.\n\nThe report quoted Spotlight on Corruption, a non-profit campaign group, as saying that the case raises questions about whether, \u201claw enforcement is being paid and resourced enough to get its act together\u201d.\n\nIt accused the NCA of having effectively \u201ccleaned\u201d the money by approving the transfer to Singapore and warned against returning cash to Bagudu.\n\nHowever, Jonathan Benton, a former NCA senior detective who now runs consultancy Intelligent Sanctuary, said the case also underlined the sheer complexity of efforts to reclaim Abacha\u2019s loot.\n\nBenton stated, \u201cI care passionately about tackling corruption and it is important we hold people to account.\n\n\u201cBut it can be a challenging and drawn-out process and sometimes you have to be pragmatic. In those situations, the law allows you to negotiate. It is repugnant. But Nigeria desperately needs the money that Abacha stole.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Amedu, announced appearances for both the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Buhari, each claiming to be the genuine legal representative.\nDue to the confusion, the court, therefore, adjourned the case till May 18, 2022.",

          "title": "The viral photographer that Afcon Cameroon made",
          "text": "As the African Cup of Nation (Afcon) fiesta rages in Cameroon, a young photographer is positioned to make a name for himself. The moment comes but his accreditation doesn\u2019t. What next? The making of a viral photographer.\n\nThis article was contributed to TechCabal by Patrick Nelle/bird\n\nThe crowd\u2019s roar is taking eardrums in the stadium to the point of bursting. Colourful and exuberant football lovers have packed the 60,000 seat arena and now they are screaming, shouting, singing, dancing and enjoying themselves as legendary Congolese rhumba hit-maker Fally Ipupa belts out a crowd-pleaser.\n\nThe sky is bright over the Olembe stadium in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon\u2019s capital city, where the 33rd Africa Cup of Nations is opening on a memorable and vibrant show. Standing near the pitch, a young man is looking on. In a few minutes, he will be triggering his camera, producing incredible shots that will go viral and bring him fame. This is the power of Afcon, Africa\u2019s biggest regular footballing event.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe 28-year old Cameroonian in the crowd is Didier Lefa, a wedding and event photographer who spent two years in the run-up to Cameroon\u2019s African Cup of Nations event preparing to break into sports and freelance photography. He upgraded his gear with a new lens and other state-of-the-art equipment to ensure quick delivery of his photos. He\u2019s still bemused at how he has found himself in the crowd and worried that he has somehow messed up. He needn\u2019t worry. He\u2019s minutes away from being one of the most-watched photographers on the continent.\n\nOnly a few hours before the beginning of the competition, Didier\u2019s dream was on the verge of collapse. After two years of preparation, a crucial element was missing\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t received my accreditation yet,\u201d he explained. He had not yet been granted accreditation from the CAF, the Confederation of Africa Football. The accreditation document gives journalists and photographers the right to access stadiums and venues where the Afcon takes place.\n\n\u201cWithout it, I couldn\u2019t do anything. I was totally discouraged. My morale was at its lowest, all of my efforts had been in vain\u201d, he said in an interview.\n\nHad his aunt\u2014who is a sports photographer\u2014not woken him up in the early hours of that Sunday morning, he would have stayed home and watched the fiesta on TV.\n\nFootball fans on the street/ Didier Lefa.\n\n\u201cAccreditation or not, be there\u201d, she told him. He argued but finally bowed to her harsh insistence.\n\n\u201cShe took me to the stadium at 7 am\u201d, he said.\n\nHe recalled that he was wondering why she was taking him there so early in the morning. The opening ceremony was set to start only at 2.00 pm. He would soon discover why.\n\n\u201cThe stadium\u2019s gates were still closed, but the place around was already overcrowded, everyone was already in a joyful mood, the Afcon fiesta had already started. Ten hours before the game kick-off, it looked like we were late\u201d, he remembered.\n\nHe pulled his camera out of his bag and started to shoot. He and his aunt were the only photographers on the site, and being there gave him a renewed energy, Lefa said.\n\n\u201cI took pictures frantically. I captured images of football fans undergoing their covid-19 tests and being vaccinated. I posted them on Twitter, and they went viral. Every picture I was posting was going viral, it was amazing.\u201d\n\nAmid the excitement of his work going viral, Lefa was still worried about his accreditation. He still didn\u2019t know if he would finally be able to enter the stadium. Once again, his aunt came to his rescue.\n\nA Cameroonian fan at the Afcon opening ceremony. Image source: Didier Lefa.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how she managed to do that, she just said \u2018don\u2019t worry, follow me\u2019 which I did, and I found myself inside the stadium. It was an awful wait,\u201d he said.\n\nMore than 4 hours into a non-stop filming spree, he was starting to feel tired, but being near the pitch and a few meters from the players provided an energy boost. He excitedly shot joyful fans screaming in the stands, game action and players\u2019 prowess on the field, streaming to social media with a flow of powerful and vivid pictures, all of them going viral, one after another.\n\nAnd at 11 pm, totally exhausted, someone called him on the phone. \u201cYour accreditation is ready, come and collect it\u201d said the voice.\n\nFeedback on his Twitter profile showed how his pictures had struck a chord with an audience.\n\n\u201cThere is real life in his pictures, when I saw them, I really felt like I was there at Olembe enjoying with the other fans,\u201d said Bernadette, on why she became one of Lefa\u2019s more than 130,000 Twitter followers.\n\n\u201cOur country is mired in crisis, and I think his pictures are keeping hope alive and helping us believe that despite the crisis, we still have the potential to achieve big things,\u201d Onana, another Lefa fan, added.\n\nThe opening ceremony of the 33rd Afcon in Olembe stadium, Yaounde on Jan 9 2022. Image source: Didier Lefa.\n\nLefa made photography his profession just 4 years ago, resisting the demands of his father who wanted to veto his career choice. His mother, however, defended her son\u2019s decision and such was his determination that finally won his father over too. The family supported his passion and career orientation to the extent that they financed a $2,000 professional camera.\n\nIt\u2019s that very camera that is now producing memorable pictures of one of the most important moments in his country\u2019s modern history\u2014capturing the raw emotion, the life and beauty of a moment in time.\n\nHis passion for photography came at an early age, he said, when he discovered photography through his aunt.\n\n\u201cI\u2018ve always liked to take pictures\u201d.\n\nHe recalled that one day his aunt took him to an orphanage for a photo report.\n\n\u201cShe gave me a Nikon reflex camera, it was my very first experience with that kind of camera. She told me \u2018just take pictures\u2019 which I did. This is how it all started.\u201d\n\nCameroon team members celebrating their goal against Burkina Faso during the opener of the 33rd Afcon in Olembe stadium, Yaounde on Jan 9 2022. Image source: Didier Lefa\n\nLefa believes that in Cameroon photographers do not receive the social credit they deserve for their job. For example, he explained, many media organisations across Africa \u201cloot\u201d pictures on the internet and use them without the permission of the owner and without respect to copyright principles.\n\nHe had exactly that issue with a local Cameroonian newspaper that took one of his Afcon images directly off Twitter to use for content illustration, without citing him as the author. He denounced the move on his Twitter feed, sparking an online mobilisation against the media, leading the offending organisation to apologize.\n\nLefa didn\u2019t slow down after that first viral photo. Throughout the tournament, he traveled from one town to another, passionately capturing the essence of each Afcon game. He agreed to a bird interview during a short transit in Douala from Yaound\u00e9, on his way to Limbe where he was to cover the game between Ivory Coast and Algeria.\n\nWith a burning desire to embrace new challenges, Lefa was already looking ahead. His current experience has allowed him to build connections with foreign photographers and to enter partnerships with some media like RTI, the Ivory Coast public broadcaster.\n\nHis next \u201cbig thing\u201d will be the football World Cup next November in Qatar, he said.\n\nShare this article",

As more people discover the power of the internet and its multifaceted abilities, internet-driven platforms need to be more willing to build safety measures into their products. Since the internet emerged in the 1970s, it has morphed into something bigger than amusing Google searches, laughable passwords, and finstagram accounts.\n\nLike most avid Twitter users, I have had a few of my tweets end up on the wrong side of bird avenue. Before Twitter introduced the option to limit who replies to your tweets\u2014particularly tweets that garner a lot of attention (likes, retweets, etc)\u2014curtailing abusive or mean-spirited responses was an impossible feat.\n\nBut, like most social media platforms that are popular amongst young digital natives\u2014most of whom are bullish about protecting their mental health and pushing kindness online\u2014Twitter is invested in protecting its users and keeping internet bullying or contentious behaviour at bay.\n\nTo mark today\u2019s celebration of safer global internet usage, Twitter launched an emoji (which you can activate by tweeting #SaferInternetDay) to encourage people to join the conversation on the importance of internet safety. According to Statisa, Twitter reportedly recorded 206 million active users in Q2, 2021. In recent times, Twitter users have opened up about experiencing one form of internet abuse or the other. The platform has, over the past several years, marked Safer Internet Day by rolling out various initiatives such as dedicated emojis, blog posts, events, and more.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to join safety partners from all over the world to mark #SaferInternetDay2022 and to play our part in creating a safer internet for all. We want Africans on Twitter to have safe, inclusive, and authentic conversations, and we\u2019re working to give people more control over their experience on the service. We have made meaningful progress in our efforts to promote healthy conversations and to surface authoritative information on Twitter, and we remain committed to working with our partners across industry, government and civil society to help build a safer internet for all Africans.\u201c Emmanuel Lubanzadio, Head of Public Policy, Government & Philanthropy for Sub-Saharan Africa, Twitter\n\nThis year, Twitter\u2019s Africa team has some useful tips to encourage Twitter safety, to promote #goodvibes on social media.

          "text": "Paris-born Nigerian singer, Asa, was recently announced the Spotify EQUAL Global Music Programme ambassador for the month of February.\n\nIn April 2021, months after it expanded to 38 African countries, Spotify launched the Spotify EQUAL Music Programme in commemoration of International Women\u2019s Day. According to Spotify, the programme\u2014which consists of highlighted playlists created and marketed by Spotify\u2014was launched to highlight women creators on its platform and work towards equity for women in the audio industry.\n\nGlobally, charts are often dominated by male performers. From 2017 to 2019, for example, Hypebot reports that only 21% of performers on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 were women. Apple Music and Spotify, during the same period, had even less, with female performers representing only 19% of charts. In 2018, at Spotify\u2019s 10th-year anniversary, only 2 women\u2014Rihanna and Ariana Grande\u2014made the 10-year streaming charts. Critics have also commented on how the most visible and high-ranking playlists on Spotify are male-dominated. More recently, Spotify itself funded research that showed only 1 in 5 artistes on the charts are women. This research helped fuel the drive for its EQUAL Global Music Programme.\n\nSince its launch, the programme has curated 17 playlists featuring female artistes all over the globe. The EQUAL Africa playlist\u2014which has over 70,000 likes\u2014 has 50 songs from female artistes from all over the continent. This includes songs from Ghana-born singer, Gyakie, who has had over 13.5 million streams on Spotify, Nigeria\u2019s Ayra Starr who recently hit 1 million streams on the platform, Zambia\u2019s Titose, Morocco\u2019s Rhita Nattah, and Botswana\u2019s Sebina.\n\nAsa, who has over 375,000 monthly listeners on Spotify, is the latest on the list. Her recently released track, Mayana, will lead the EQUAL Africa playlist and also feature on the EQUAL Global playlist. Mayana already has over 560,000 streams on Spotify, and the addition to EQUAL playlists will boost it further.\n\nSpeaking about her selection, the singer said, \u201cI\u2019m honoured to be the Spotify EQUAL ambassador of the month. It\u2019s great to be part of something like this\u2014a movement that\u2019s new yet has always been. It\u2019s beautiful when we are celebrated and recognised for contributions to music and art over the years. In the lead-up to the release of my album \u2018V\u2019, this is awesome.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Founded in 2016 by Niklas Adalberth, one of the founders of Swedish fintech unicorn Klarna, Norrsken Foundation was set up to help entrepreneurs solve the world\u2019s biggest challenges through its Norrsken House, a Stockholm-based co-working space for over 350 impact entrepreneurs, the Norrsken Founders Fund, and Norrsken VC.\n\nIn 2019, the foundation set up a base in Rwanda, through which it planned to invest across the East and Central African region. Last year, it accepted 11 African startups into the inaugural Norrsken Impact Accelerator.\n\nNorrsken is now working with Hans Otterling, partner at Northzone, and an investment team led by Natalie Kolbe, ex global head of private equity at Actis in South Africa; Actis colleague Ngetha Waithaka in Kenya; and Lexi Novitske, founder of Acuity Venture Partners, on the new Norrsken22 Africa Tech Growth Fund.\n\nThe fund, backed by 30 unicorn founders, contributing their skills and $65 million in funding, announced its first close of $110 million on Tuesday. Olugbenga Agboola, co-founder of Flutterwave and Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m, co-founder of Skype are some of these backers. Norrsken22 is managed by a team of general partners involved in the African tech ecosystem, with decades of experience supporting entrepreneurs in Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa.\n\nTechCabal caught up with Novitske to discuss the inspiration behind Norrsken22, its investment criteria, the current venture capital landscape in Africa, and what sectors she thinks the next set of African unicorn startups will emerge from.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMichael: What inspired the move to back growth-stage startups in Africa?\n\nNovitske: Through my firm Acuity (and its predecessor Singularity Investments) we were active investors in early-stage companies across Africa. We co-invested with many other local investors. What we saw was that, as our companies scaled across the continent there was not sufficient local capital to back these growth-stage rounds. Our investee companies like Mono, Flutterwave, mPharma were pushed to take time away from their business on the ground to travel to Silicon Valley and educate international investors about the Africa growth story. These same investors have certainly seized the opportunity, but their capital can only go so far in providing the value these companies need to scale. This was the obvious missing middle to me \u2013 be the partner that these companies can leverage to lock down the best customers, identify the best local talent, and provide regulatory, cultural, and strategy expertise when scaling from one African market to another.\n\nMichael: Norrsken22 has 30 unicorn founders and a local advisory council board comprising leading African business figures. What was it like getting everyone on board?\n\nNovitske: Our Unicorn Board members are an incredible resource for our fund. These successful founders of billion-dollar-plus businesses are all committing capital as investors, but beyond that, they are committing their time and network to unlock the toughest challenges some of our partner companies might face. They\u2019ve been through the experience of scaling similar businesses in other markets, and may even end up being strategic partners for our companies. Likewise, our Advisory Council has built some of the largest businesses traversing the African continent and has insights and connections that are invaluable to our companies. Some of these individuals are excited to share their insights to create the next generation of entrepreneurs. For others, they understand that Africa tech is one of the great investment opportunities of our time and want to play an active role in building value for their investment interests. And for others it\u2019s more strategic: they see Africa as a market that they would like to expand their business into through partnerships or acquisitions, and they want to start building these relationships now.\n\nMichael: What are the investment criteria at Norrsken22? What will make you consider a startup for investment?\n\nNovitske: We have taken a narrow focus on our investment criteria. Not because we don\u2019t believe there are no other attractive investment opportunities outside of our mandate, but because we want to be absolutely the best at what we do. Our resources are dedicated to backing companies from the Series A to C rounds, with real customers, repeatable revenue, attractive unit economics, and in our primary markets and sectors. These primary markets are Nigeria, Ghana, Southern Africa, and Eastern Africa. This is also where we have a team on the ground that can really identify and support our partner companies. It\u2019s important to mention that we have set aside approximately half of our funds to support our portfolio champions throughout their lifecycle. Innovation success stories sometimes take time to unlock, and we are committed to being there for the journey.\n\nMichael: Where (what sectors) do you think the next set of Africa\u2019s unicorn startups will emerge from?\n\nNovitske: We believe the most scalable opportunities today are in fintech, market enablement, healthtech, and edutech. These are also the sectors that we believe are solving some of Africa\u2019s key societal problems. Market enablement includes software, marketplaces, and APIs [Application Programming Interface] that are unlocking more efficient trade, logistics, and customer engagement. We are especially excited about the crossover of these two sectors in areas such as embedded finance. And I do not believe everything has already been done in fintech \u2013 there are many opportunities still to be unlocked!\n\nMichael: What\u2019s your impression of the current VC landscape in Africa?\n\nNovitske: I am very excited by the transformation I have seen in the VC landscape on the continent; but even more excited by the energy of the tech entrepreneurs. There are really great teams building need-to-have products for a very large market opportunity, and frankly not enough capital to support their ambitions. Early-stage investors like Ventures Platform, 4dx, and Rabo (and some successful Africa tech angels) have done an incredible job investing and supporting early-stage companies, but there is still a dearth of capital at the growth stage on the continent. In 2021, there were only 114 deals that had larger than $5 million rounds; compared with the total 818 deals done on the continent above $100k (as per Briter Bridges). That number drops off sharply when you\u2019re looking at deals over $10 million.\n\nLexi Novitske (down-left) in the Norrsken22 team. Image credit: Supplied\n\nMichael: There is still some lethargy on the side of African and Africa-based investors. Are there any implications for the ecosystem?\n\nNovitske: Entrepreneurs are the machine that drives the growth in tech ecosystems, but investors are the oil. An investors\u2019 job is to provide resources behind the top teams to help them realise their company\u2019s potential, and resources is NOT just cash. Local investors have insights from doing businesses on the continent or networks that no international investor can have, even if they have the deepest pockets. We have started to see real exits happen and real money flowing in, and Africa-based investors are getting excited. I think the more local capital and expertise that can be deployed, the faster we will realise the evolution of sustainable ecosystems, wealth creation, and access to scalable services to empower the mass population on the continent.\n\nMichael: How can we drive even more local VC participation in the startup ecosystem?\n\nNovitske: Africa has a population of 1.2 billion, where 60% are below 25 years old. In the next decade, this young, digital-first generation will change the world. Technology is enabling the region to leapfrog legacy industries and is pivoting key sectors. I believe it\u2019s obvious that the emerging tech ecosystem in Africa offers one of the great investment opportunities of our time. If that isn\u2019t reason enough for VC participation, I\u2019m not sure what is.\n\nI also want to applaud the ecosystem builders that are working on initiatives that make doing business easier for startups, including the StartUp Bill in Nigeria, and similar initiatives in Kenya and South Africa. I should also highlight that the Norrsken Foundation will re-invest its portion of the capital generated by Norrsken22 back into supporting entrepreneurship, to further promote the growth of the African tech ecosystem and a new generation of tech founders.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

What if you could get exactly what you wanted as a wedding gift without your friends breaking the bank or getting you unnecessary items?\n\nWell, Ridwan Egbeyemi, Tolu Adesina, and Gloria Agboifoh\u2019s Unboxd provides a way out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnboxd founders. L-R: Ridwan Egbeyemi, Gloria Agboifoh, Tolu, Adesina\n\nFrom personal solution to MVP\n\nThe year is 2020. Egbeyemi is planning his wedding. He is about to marry the absolute love of his life, and everything is set for the ceremony proper. But there\u2019s just one problem: how to get the gifts he and his wife would need as they begin their marriage journey.\n\nAnd so, the search for a platform where they can share their wishlist begins. Their number one criterion is to have friends and family contribute as little or as much as they can without breaking the bank. The first stumbling block is they can\u2019t find any platform to do what they want.\n\nBut there is still a silver lining in this cloud that Egbeyemi and his friend, Adesina, take advantage of. Egbeyemi\u2019s design knowledge and Adesina\u2019s web development and product design expertise come in handy. They build a \u201cscrappy looking but functional MVP\u201d in one weekend and share a wishlist with friends.\n\nOn November 1, 2020, about one month after sharing their wishlist, Egbeyemi and his wife get married. The wedding is a success, and they raise enough money for the essentials they need.\n\nEgbeyemi and Adesina move on from their product, but friends and family keep returning.\n\n\u201c\u2018What platform did you guys use?\u2019 \u2018My birthday is coming up, and I don\u2019t want my friends to gift me something I don\u2019t want or something I already have; can I use it?\u2019 That request continued to mount, and since we had a ton of people asking to use it, we decided that we should sit down and take this thing seriously,\u201d Egbeyemi says.\n\nThey spend six months working on the product, sharing it with a closed beta group before finally launching it to the public in September 2021.\n\nWishlists for every celebration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Adesina, Unboxd is a fintech brand, \u201cbut we are currently offering a gifting solution with a crowdfunding component. We are still handling money \u2014 inflows and outflows \u2014 but our entrance into the market is people coming to crowdfund gift items.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnboxd offers a service that enables users to share a wishlist for birthdays, weddings, and other celebrations with friends and family. Contributors can pay any amount they can afford \u2014 whether part or full \u2014 without worrying about their account balance.\n\n\u201cOne major thing with gifting is that people fall under the pressure of wanting to give really expensive gifts. With Unboxd, we\u2019ve been able to simplify that. So you don\u2019t have to be the one to pay for that \u20a6400,000 TV. You can just drop your own \u20a65,000 or \u20a610,000.\u201d\n\nIt gives celebrants a single place to create a wishlist for their celebrations with sub wallets (or pockets) \u2014 available through a Flutterwave integration \u2014 for each list. Apart from this, there\u2019s also another interesting feature to attract users.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made sure that there\u2019s no deduction from the money you\u2019re going to get. If I add an item that costs \u20a6400,000 to my wishlist, we\u2019ve been able to get very creative with our engineering and business model such that, at the end of the day, by the time you are requesting payout, you get that exact \u20a6400,000 without \u20a61,000 removed from your wallet for transaction fees. This can change in the future, but for now, that\u2019s how we are handling it.\u201d\n\nAlthough there\u2019s a flat rate of \u20a6100 for each payout after your first free payout request for each wishlist, transaction costs are borne by the contributor and not the celebrant. The company also makes a 2% commission on each transaction on the platform.\n\nThe wishlist creation is also simple. All the celebrant has to do is include the name, image, and price of the gift and the item is added to the list. You can also add items from your favourite Instagram vendor. Last year, Unboxd started a test run on this feature, onboarding bCODE \u2014 Adidas\u2019s exclusive partner in Nigeria for sneakers sales \u2014 onto the platform.\n\nFor the gift-giver, apart from the ability to give what they have, they can also choose to remain anonymous.\n\nEgbeyemi believes these features help separate them from competitors like Showlove and Suregifts.\n\nFighting the fear of failure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch shows that humans are far more afraid of failure than ghosts. In 2015, Linkagoal surveyed 1,083 adults on fear. And according to the social network, 31% (338) of the respondents revealed a fear of failure over the fear of ghosts, spiders, and being home alone.\n\nHaving worked with companies like Decagon and founded Lagos-based Rewrite Agency, the trio wanted everything to be perfect.\n\n\u201cOur background has been in developing products for people, and we\u2019ve been able to do that on different successful products that are currently in the market that people are using. We\u2019ve worked with those founders and seen the different challenges they\u2019ve been through, and because of that, we\u2019ve been our own biggest critic.\n\n\u201cBefore we were able to take Unboxd to the public and open it up for people, we spent months trying to avoid problems. Trying to avoid situations where we would get into the market and people would say, \u2018Oh, this thing is not working\u2019, or \u2018That thing is not working.'\u201d\n\nEventually, the Unboxd team had to ask themselves the golden question, \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst that can happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had to learn to make failure acceptable,\u201d Egbeyemi shares.\n\nCurrently, from 40 users in September 2021, the platform has over 400 active users and 320 active wishlists. All with no marketing or PR and just word of mouth and recommendations.\n\nThere are also plans to raise pre-seed funding and leave the arduous life of bootstrapping behind.\n\n\u201cEverything we\u2019ve been able to build with Unboxd has been with our own money, and we\u2019ve had to hire on contract. But we want to move from that to being able to have designers, developers, devops on the ground, fully, working on the product.\u201d\n\nThe company also plans to expand and conduct tests in the US, UK, and Canada.\n\nFrom what Adesina shares, there are also plans to take advantage of the owambe market and give users the ability to turn a wedding wishlist into a wedding website complete with a gift registry and pictures.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of weddings going on, and we want to be that brand that event planners and intending couples would want to use. We are basically trying to create a sub-branch of our system and design it specifically for weddings.\n\nThis is backed by a flexible customer-centric approach to understanding the market and building for the market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

By this time, you\u2019ve definitely seen enough valentine packages to last you a lifetime. My sincere condolences if you have no boo. My thoughts are with you, comrade.\n\nIn today\u2019s episode of Techpoint Digest, we\u2019ll be discussing an African robotics company, handling funeral arrangements with tech, and the rise of NFT theft.\n\nSolving African problems with robotics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating the Kalibotics Chessbot\n\nEveryone and their two-year-old niece is building a fintech startup, and I can\u2019t blame them. Investors are more willing to sign cheques for these companies than any other sector in Africa. However, other startups are building exciting tech solutions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKalibotics is a Nigerian robotics startup building products for the edtech, e-waste management, and agritech industries. Founded by a sibling duo, Olugbenga and Mayowa Abejirin, some of the startup\u2019s projects include a robotic arm that can make a cup of tea and an AI Chessbot (Tunde Onakoya, come outside).\n\nSince its launch, the company has attracted funding from various organisations, including Nigerian vice president, Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s March 8TH Initiative and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC).\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole sat down to chat with the co-founders to learn what it takes to build a robotics startup in Africa. Read more here: Kalibotics is using robotics to revamp edtech, agritech, e-waste management\n\nTech for the dead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSokna team. Source: Techbuild\n\nIn Africa, the death of a loved one is a significant event. Unlike most parts of the world, where funeral services can be completed in a day, funerals in Africa are likely to last several days, especially when the deceased is quite old.\n\nWith these festivities come huge expenses, and you\u2019ll be forgiven for mistaking a funeral procession for a bridal party. We don\u2019t do small funerals here. Due to this, in addition to the emotional stress of losing a loved one, the bereaved have to deal with logistics and financial difficulties.\n\nIn the past, that help was gotten from friends and family, but a startup wants to help people give their loved ones a befitting burial. Unsurprisingly, the startup \u2013 Sokna \u2013 is based in the country that gave us the Pharaohs and mummies \u2013 Egypt.\n\nNow to the surprise: The startup has recently raised $1m from investors in a seed round. Yes, you read that right. $1 million to help people bury the dead. Some investors include senior executives from Google, Facebook, and Twitter. In addition, Mentors Fund, SBX Capital, and ACE & Company participated.\n\nThe startup, which was launched in late 2020, has reportedly tripled in size in the last year, with over 50 full-time employees performing more than 2,500 funerals. Sokna offers services like cemetery set up, body preparation, repatriation, obituaries, and transportation to its customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCan NFT theft be stopped?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpeanSea: NFT marketplace\n\nSometimes, I feel that tech creates as many problems as it solves. Take social media, for example. While it has led to a more connected world and contributed to advocacy, it has also fuelled misinformation and online bullying.\n\nNFTs are the latest casualties. In 2021, the marketplace for NFTs grew to $22 billion. With the bank-breaking amounts they are sold for, it\u2019s perhaps not such a surprise that people began to pass off other people\u2019s art as NFTs.\n\nAja Trier, a digital artist, woke up on January 4 to her art being turned into not one but nearly 86,000 NFTs. But she\u2019s not alone. Lois van Baarle, a Dutch artist, also found more than 100 pieces of her art for sale as NFTs.\n\nArtists have received help taking down these stolen art from DeviantArt, an online art platform that notifies users of copyright infringement. However, the artists have to get it done themselves. For most artists, the process can be overwhelming as NFT platforms are not very responsive. Consequently, NFTTheft \u2014 a collective of artists highlighting fraudulent listings \u2014 has resorted to publicly shaming the marketplace, hoping that the art gets taken down.\n\nWhy are we discussing NFT theft? Just like we did with cryptocurrency adoption, Africans have quickly cashed in on the opportunity to earn money from their art. Even without NFTs, copyright laws in Africa are notoriously lax or non-existent.\n\nWestern tech companies have typically taken their precious time to respond to complaints from Africans. So, how will they react when Africans start reporting NFT theft? There\u2019s a lot to unpack here, and we\u2019ll be sure to keep you abreast of developments in this space.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nPaystack is hiring.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2018, two Nigerian siblings, Olugbenga Abejirin and Mayowa Abejirin, who have technical capabilities in programming and software development, with the former armed with over a decade of experience in entrepreneurship, leveraged an opportunity to build and deploy smart classrooms to some Nigerian schools.\n\nThe early stage of the project was successful until the pandemic struck in 2020, and deployment was slowed down as access to spare parts abroad was impeded. However, the company had already covered eight Nigerian cities.\n\nPrimarily, the plan was to incorporate robotics into these smart classrooms riding on a previous project carried out in partnership with a Chinese university to build self-driving smart cars for educational purposes. However, this couldn\u2019t be deployed due to licensing challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKalibotics smart classroom\n\nThe seemingly discouraging outcomes of these two endeavours opened their eyes to something bigger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOlugbenga recounts how they made the best of a daunting situation.\n\n\u201cThat was quite disappointing. But we had a video of the project they were doing. The partners showed us what it could do as well as the assembling process. So, we thought to ourselves, \u2018We can do this! Why don\u2019t we have a company that would create these robotic kits for the smart classrooms?\u2019\u201d\n\nEncouraged by their rich backgrounds in building tech products and entrepreneurship, they decided to go beyond smart classrooms. The result was the birth of robotics startup, Kalibotics, coined from two words: Kali, a Swahili term for \u2018energetic\u2019, and Robotics. Kalibotics launched officially in December 2019.\n\nRobots for real-life challenges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKalibotics drone\n\nAlthough education is Kalibotics\u2019 strong point, the startup is motivated to build products to address tough real-life challenges, something Olugbenga refers to as \u201cgoing all out.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of the areas we\u2019re interested in and building robotic systems for are agritech, security, e-waste management, and other fields.\u201d\n\nElucidating, Mayowa lists products that the startup has been able to commercialise, including those it intends to deploy.\n\n\u201cOur first project was an obstacle avoidance car that uses ultrasonic sensors. After that, we went on to build an autonomous drone that can be easily repurposed for any artificial intelligence task like precision farming, and threat avoidance, among others.\u201d\n\nThe startup has also done other functional mini-projects like a robotic arm that can make a cup of tea and an AI Chessbot \u2014 a Chess-playing robot. In a few months, the prototype for an AI-based robot manipulator that can sort e-waste will be completed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating the Kalibotics Chessbot\n\nSolar-powered drones, autonomous rovers, and underwater drones for security and surveillance are at the ideation stage and will be developed in the coming months. This also includes other specific purpose drones for trash-picking.\n\nOlugbenga notes that most of the completed products are already commercialised while others are being trialled.\n\nBesides the hardware, the startup also has a proprietary Artificial Intelligence Robotics Coding (ARC), a curriculum it plans to get into schools soon.\n\nReacting to my scepticism about not focusing on only industry-specific products while in its early years, Olugbenga opines that the startup is maximising its capabilities with the three industries it currently specialises in and will build on this in the long-term. He believes this will take the startup to a growth phase, and once they have all been fully commercialised, the scope will increase.\n\nTo keep up with subsequent changes in the technology landscape, other projects will come up under the research and development department.\n\nLeading up to Kalibotics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore Kalibotics, the duo has come a long way in building tech products and running businesses.\n\nIn fact, one of the businesses, Deepblue Technologies, has been running for over 13 years.\n\nLooking back to his beginning, Olugbenga recalls how he founded Longhall Consulting, a consulting startup that has morphed into Learning Fortress, an e-learning platform.\n\nFollowing this, he threw his weight behind Deepblue Technologies, a company focused on application development/deployment and technical support services. Interestingly, the company has been around for 13 years.\n\nOlugbenga asserts that Kalibotics\u2019 products are targeted majorly at large businesses and the government for obvious reasons. Mass waste management, for instance, is the government\u2019s responsibility; likewise, smallholder farmers are rarely as concerned about precision farming as large farmers are.\n\nHowever, the entrepreneur clarifies that there are exemption plans for edtech and agritech products.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re beginning to have variants. We have what is called Kalibotics Project Alpha, which is B2C. This will deliver proprietary kits and an e-learning platform so that individuals can have robotic kits in their homes and then go through our e-learning and can learn to install and do lots of interesting projects. This will be launched in 2022.\u201d\n\nFor him, introducing a B2C model is inevitable, not only for inclusiveness but also to widen its approachable market and broaden revenue opportunities.\n\nGetting the right attention for funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its early days, the startup had access to a $25,000 fund in angel investment. To celebrate his birthday in 2020, Nigeria\u2019s Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, funded the March 8TH Initiative, where innovative companies were offered a \u20a61 million (~$2,400) grant. With its new and functional solutions, Kalibotics applied and ended up as one of the recipients.\n\nThanks to Kaibotics\u2019 e-waste management project, the startup was one of four finalists that won a \u20a620 million (~$48,000) grant in an innovation competition organised by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) in 2021. But this wasn\u2019t the first time Kaibotics was recognised in this manner.\n\nAlthough still at the pre-profit stage, Olugbenga claims that the startup\u2019s goal is to make a social impact while making a profit. Compared to other robotics startups, the founder believes their strength lies in infusing many high-end technologies into their products, trusted business sense, dependable team, and access to funding.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been smooth sailing all the way, and sometimes, the founders have to train people to ensure they can successfully operate their products.\n\nNigeria is not big on manufacturing, so building prototypes can be pretty tough without support from outside the country. Despite this, the startup has gotten in the face of potential buyers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

So if your blog just checked for updates minutes before an update was released, you won\u2019t see the update message until your blog checks for updates 12 hours later.\n\nIf you want your blog to check right now for updates, you can delete the update_core option name record in your wp_options table. Note that plugins and themes each have their own check and update cycle, controlled by the records update_plugins and update_themes, in wp_options.\n\nRelevant discussion thread:\n\nTop \u2191\n\nWhy did I lose custom changes to the WordPress Default Theme during the last automatic upgrade? # Why did I lose custom changes to the WordPress Default Theme during the last automatic upgrade?\n\nA core upgrade copies all the new files from the distribution over the old ones, so if you changed existing files in the WordPress default theme (e.g. wp-content/themes/twentysixteen/style.css), those changes got overwritten with the new version of that file.\n\nPlease note, a core upgrade goes through a list of \u201cold files\u201d, as defined in wp-admin/includes/update-core.php, and deletes those files. Any files not on the list, and not in the distribution, are preserved.\n\nRemember, that before upgrades, whether automatic or manual, both the WordPress Files and database should be backed-up as explained in WordPress Backups.\n\nA better way to modify the default theme is by using a child theme. It\u2019s a little more work to set up, but worth the effort because your customizations will be safe when the main theme is updated.\n\nTop \u2191\n\nHow do you repair a MySQL database table? # How do you repair a MySQL database table?\n\nEvery once in a while, it may be necessary to repair one or more MySQL database tables. According to the How to Repair MyISAM Tables at dev.mysql.com there are a number of reasons to repair a table including errors such as \u201ctbl_name.frm is locked against change\u201d, \u201cCan\u2019t find file tbl_name.MYI (Errcode: nnn)\u201d, \u201cUnexpected end of file\u201d, \u201cRecord file is crashed\u201d, or \u201cGot error nnn from table handler\u201d.\n\nHere are the steps to repair a table in a MySQL database using phpMyAdmin:\n\nLogin to hosting account. Login to phpMyAdmin. Choose the affected database. If you only have one database, it should choose it by default so you don\u2019t need to do anything. In the main panel, you should see a list of your database tables. Check the boxes by the tables that need repair. At the bottom of the window just below the list of tables, there is a drop down menu. Choose \u201cRepair Table\u201d\n\nRemember, that it is advisable to have a current backup of your database at all times.

No account information is needed. This is not generally a problem if you are using a hosting service, but if you are using your own box and do not have an SMTP server, the mail will never send. If you are using a *NIX box, you should have either postfix or sendmail on your machine; you will just need to set them up (search the Internet for how-to\u2019s). If you do not want to go through setting up a complete mail server on your *NIX box you may find msmtp useful \u2014 it provides \u201cA secure, effective and simple way of getting mail off a system to your mail hub\u201d. On a Windows machine, try a sendmail emulator like Glob SendMail.\n\nMore help can be found on this thread of the WordPress Support Forums: https://wordpress.org/support/topic.php?id=24981.\n\nWindows Host Server Specific: Check your \u201cRelay\u201d settings on the SMTP Virtual Server. Grant access to 127.0.0.1 . Then in your php.inifile, set the SMTP setting to the same IP address. Also set smtp_port to 25 .\n\nEnsure Proper Return Address is Used: By default, the WordPress mailer fills in the From: field with wordpress@yourdomain.com and the From: name as WordPress.\n\nThis is fine if this is a valid e-mail address. For example, if your real e-mail is wordpress@yourdomain.com, your host should pass the email on for delivery. It will probably send your mail as long as yourdomain.com is setup to send and receive mail, even if wordpress is not a valid mail box. But if you set you real email as the From: address and it\u2019s something like wpgod@gmail.com, the mail may not send because gmail.com is not a domain handled by the mail server.\n\nTreated as Spam: Your email message may have been routed to a spam folder or even worse, simply discarded as malicious. There are a couple measures you can use to convince recipient\u2019s mail servers that your message is legitimate and should be delivered as addressed.\n\nSPF: (Sender Policy Framework) This is the most common anti-spam measure used. If you are on a hosted system, there is a good chance your host has set this up for the mail server you are using. Have WordPress email you and check the message headers for evidence that the message passed the SPF check. You can get a message sent by following the Forgot Password link on the login page. To keep your old password, do not follow the link in the message.\n\nIf your system email failed the SPF check, you can set up the credentials if you have access to your DNS records and your mail server\u2019s domain belongs to you. Check the return path of the email your system sent. If the mail server listed there has your domain name, you can set up SPF credentials. There are several how-tos on the Internet.\n\nDKIM: (Domain Key Identified Mail) This system is also used. You can use both SPF and DKIM in the same message. Again, just as with SPF, you can check if your receiving mailserver verified your host\u2019s domain key by examining the mail header. There is a fair chance no signature key was provided, indicating your host chose to not use this protocol. Also as with SPF, if you can edit your DNS records and the mail server belongs to your domain, you can set up DKIM credentials yourself. Some how-tos exist if you search the Internet.\n\nTop \u2191\n\nWhy can\u2019t I see my posts? All I see is Sorry, no posts match your criteria? # Why can\u2019t I see my posts? All I see is Sorry, no posts match your criteria?\n\nClearing your browser cache and cookies may resolve this problem. See also I Make Changes and Nothing Happens\n\nTop \u2191\n\nHow do I solve the Headers already sent warning problem? # How do I solve the Headers already sent warning problem?\n\nDescription: You get a warning message on your browser that says:\n\nWarning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at\n\nReason and Solution:\n\nIt is usually because there are spaces, new lines, or other stuff before an opening <?php tag or after a closing ?> tag, typically in wp-config.php. This could be true about some other file too, so please check the error message, as it will list the specific file name where the error occurred (see \u201cInterpreting the Error Message\u201d below). Replacing the faulty file with one from your most recent backup or one from a fresh WordPress download is your best bet, but if neither of those are an option, please follow the steps below.\n\nJust because you cannot see anything does not mean that PHP sees the same.\n\nDownload the file mentioned in the error message via FTP or the file manager provided in your host\u2019s control panel. Open that file in a plain text editor (NOT Microsoft Word or similar. Notepad or BBEdit are fine). Check that the very first characters are with no blank lines or spaces after it. Before saving, or use the Save as dialog, ensure the file encoding is not UTF-8 BOM but plain UTF-8 or any without the BOM suffix.\n\nTo be sure about the end of the file, do this:\n\nPlace the cursor between the ? and > Now press the DELETE key on your computer Note to MAC users: The \u201cDELETE\u201d key on a PC deletes characters to the right of the cursor. That is the key noted here. Keep that key pressed For at least 15 seconds Now type > and save without pressing any other key at all. If you press another key, you will bring the problem back. DO NOT PUT CODE IN UNNECESSARY CODE BLOCKS, PUT THEM IN A SINGLE PHP BLOCK.\n\nWrong:\n\n<?php some code; ?> <?php some other codes; ?>\n\nCorrect:\n\n<?php code; some other code; ?>\n\nUpload the file back to your server after editing and saving the file.\n\nNote: Also check the encoding of the file. If the file is encoded as UTF-8 with BOM, the BOM is seen as a character which starts the output.\n\nInterpreting the Error Message:\n\nIf the error message states: Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /path/blog/wp-config.php:34) in /path/blog/wp-login.php on line 42 , then the problem is at line #34 of wp-config.php , not line #42 of wp-login.php . In this scenario, line #42 of wp-login.php is the victim. It is being affected by the excess whitespace at line #34 of wp-config.php .\n\nIf the error message states: Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /path/wp-admin/admin-header.php:8) in /path/wp-admin/post.php on line 569 , then the problem is at line #8 of admin-header.php , not line #569 of post.php . In this scenario, line #569 of post.php is the victim. It is being affected by the excess whitespace at line #8 of admin-header.php .\n\nTop \u2191\n\nTo resolve this and similar issues, disable your plugins one at a time until you find the source of the issue. Generally, this will be due to two or more plugins trying to use the same resources (for example, JQuery or other Java-based tools).\n\nIn addition, it could be that there is a problem with your browser. A common resolution is to empty the browser\u2019s cache. Please consult the documentation for your preferred browser to learn how to do this.\n\nTop \u2191\n\nIf an error 404 occurs when using the Pretty Permalink choices such as Day and Name in Administration > Settings > Settings_Permalinks_Screen it could be a result of the mod_rewrite module not being activated/installed. The solution is to activate mod_rewrite for the Apache web-server. Check the apache\\conf\\httpd.conf file for the line # LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so\n\nand delete the # in front of the line. Then stop Apache and start it again. Note: you may have to ask your host to activate mod_rewrite.\n\nSee also Using Permalinks.

          "text": "Nigeria currently ranks among the top 10 African countries offering easy visa processes to visitors. Experts say this signals a boost for foreign direct investments (FDIs) and travel in the country.\n\nAccording to Africa Visa Openness Report 2021, an annual report that measures the extent to which African countries are open to visitors from other African countries, Benin Republic, The Gambia, and Seychelles are 2021\u2019s top performers, offering visa-free access to all African visitors in 2021.\n\nNigeria ranks 7th on the list offering visa-free access to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) countries and visa on arrival to other African countries.\n\nIn February 2020, the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) launched the Nigeria Visa Policy 2020 seeking to improve ease of doing business, attract FDIs, tourists, and individuals with specialised skills without compromising national security.\n\nExperts say as the COVID-19 infection rates declined and a number of countries began to open their borders safely and securely, Nigeria will experience a surge in travel and foreign investments with the implementation of the free-visa access and visa-on-arrival policy.\n\nTayo Ojuri, managing partner, Aglow Aviation Support Services Limited, informs BusinessDay that the visa on arrival policy is working in Nigeria as his company has processed visas for people since countries started lifting travel bans.\n\n\u201cFDIs and business partners have been getting their visa-on-arrival, which is valid for 30 days and can extend their initial entry visas for a maximum of one year from the date of entry. This is quite liberal and a lot of people have taken advantage of this to get training, conduct research, and business meetings,\u201d Ojuri says.\n\nNigeria\u2019s visa-on-arrival takes an average of 10 to 15 minutes to process after visitors arrive except for a few occasions when there is a systems breakdown, he states.\n\nThe policy did not work till June 2021 when international travels picked up, but since then, the policy has been working and has been enhanced since travel restrictions were being lifted, he notes.\n\nThe Africa Visa Openness Report further shows that the countries that progressed the most in the last five years in West Africa include the Benin Republic, The Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone; in Southern Africa, includes Angola, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and in Central Africa, like Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Gabon, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, etc.\n\nIn East Africa, Rwanda and Tanzania; and in North Africa, Egypt and Tunisia topped the list.\n\nIn this new era of travel, safety and hygiene protocols have become as important as travel documentation and visa formalities. Ensuring that visitors can move through border controls smoothly and securely has taken on a new urgency.\n\nTravel experts say, one way of getting there is to streamline the visa process.\n\nTo do this, the report suggests that countries can use a range of solutions, which include reducing the documents, fees, and time necessary to obtain a visa; moving to eVisas, issuing visas on arrival, and eliminating visas altogether.\n\n\u201cFree movement is central to Africa\u2019s recovery from the crippling effects of the pandemic. Allowing businesspeople, investors, tourists, students, and workers to travel across the continent with ease will revitalise African economies and re-energise pan-African unity.\n\nRead also: US Consulate explains new visa programme, says not drop box\n\n\u201cAfrica\u2019s rising young population is poised to take charge of the continent\u2019s future. All young people need is the freedom to move around the continent and support as they develop into Africa\u2019s entrepreneurs and business leaders. Opening borders will ensure Africa\u2019s travel, tourism, and investment growpace,\u201d the report states.\n\n\u201cWe need the visa regime to be able to help people move around. We also need the right customs regime and the right border automation control and so on, to support the movement of people, goods and services for the development, growth, and sustainability of the African economy as we begin to recover from this pandemic,\u201d Adefunke Adeyemi, Africa regional director, advocacy and strategic relations, Africa, for International Air Transport Association (IATA) said.\n\nFor Wayne Godwin, senior vice president, JLL Hotels & Hospitality Group for sub-Saharan Africa, in addition to visa on arrivals, the free-trade agreement is an absolute game-changer for travel.\n\nIf 97 percent of commodities and goods are tariff-free, that is going to do a lot for regional trade. And when there is regional trade, travel will follow,\u201d Godwin states.\n\nThe report also shows that between 2016 and 2021 two-thirds of countries in all regions of the continent have improved or maintained their visa openness score over the past five years.\n\nTo facilitate access, 24 African countries now offer eVisa. The COVID-19 pandemic has given a new impetus to human mobility. Let us capitalise on this silver lining by improving connectivity and embracing technological solutions. An Africa with liberal visa regimes and open borders benefits us all, Khaled Sherif, vice president, regional development, integration, and business delivery complex at the African Development Bank, notes.",

Many vehicles transporting goods and people across the country also use diesel.\n\nRead also: Despite oil price at $90 barrel, naira may fall to N450 \u2013 RenCap\n\nMore than 70 percent of Nigerian firms rely heavily on diesel-powered generators.

The high inflation rate in the country means that people have less money to buy things, and when prices are going up and the masses have less money to buy those products, we are going to have a lot of joblessness in the country,\u201d the President, Association of Small Business Owners of Nigeria, Femi Egbesola said.\n\nNigeria, Africa\u2019s largest oil producer, relies largely on importation for petrol and other refined products as its refineries have remained in a state of disrepair for many years.",

Since then, the company has partnered with several organisations to provide the Annuity plan to their employees.\n\nAccording to the Managing Director, Niyi Onifade, these partnerships are testament to the confidence regulators and other partners have in the company\u2019s capacity to fulfil its promises and its consistent delivery of service excellence.\n\nIn his words, \u201cPensioners have every reason to live life confidently as the Annuity Plan takes care of the worries of retirement, specifically, the uncertainty of the future.

We must have a secure, peaceful and united nation before we can have candidates for political offices.\n\n\u201cThe Committee believes that what Nigeria needs today is for all patriots to come together to rescue our nation from all political, economic and security threats, and promote the unity of Nigeria. We call on all patriotic volunteers, who are willing and able, to join this collective effort to stabilise the system so we can all build a new Nigeria we can all be proud of.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "Four days after killing at least 12 persons in Daraga, residents of the village Tuesday said the terrorists have stopped them from evacuating the bodies for burial.\n\nDaraga is in Maru local government area, one of the worst hit locations in the state.\n\nIn a special report carried by BBC Hausa Tuesday morning and monitored by Premium Times, residents said they could not bury their dead because the bandits were still around the village.\n\nAn anonymous source who spoke to the BBC said his house was completely burnt down, with his brother and boss in the shop killed.\n\n\u201cAs I speak to you, there is no single person in that community because we have all fled from the place. 12 people were confirmed killed while several others were injured during the attack. Eight of my friends were killed. The bandits are still around the village and have stopped us from retrieving the dead bodies for proper burial.\n\n\u201cWe tried calling security agents but to no avail. To be honest with you, the security agents in Dan Kurmi (a larger community neighbouring Daraga) could not match the bandits. There is nothing they cannot do because they have more sophisticated weapons and are many in number,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said residents had deserted the village to various communities, including Dan Kurmi, Bena, Zargado (all in Zamfara state) and as far as Wasagu and Unashi in Kebbi state.\n\nSpokesman of Zamfara state Police Command, Mohammed Shehu did not respond to SMS and calls on the situation at Daraga.\n\nKatsina\n\nIn a related development, bandits have killed 9 people, abducted village head and unspecified number of persons in Guga village of Bakori local government area of Katsina state.\n\nSources from the village told newsmen that the terrorists attacked the village Monday night during which they also burnt cars, shops and houses.\n\nA source said most of the kidnapped victims were well-to-do people in the area, including women and children.\n\nAs at the time of compiling this report, there were no reported contacts between the terrorists and the family of the abductees.\n\nPremium Times reports that three communities of Guga, Gidan Kanawa and Dukawa, are in the Bakori and Funtua local government area, all in the southern part of the state, share boundaries with Kaduna state.\n\nKatsina state has witnessed frequent bandits\u2019 attacks since the beginning of this year.\n\nRecent attacks\n\nThe recent attacks were the killing of a village head and four others in Yan Gayya and at least 12 people in Ilela villages.\n\nThe police spokesperson in the state, Gambo Isa, had attributed recent attacks to fleeing bandits from Zamfara and Sokoto states.Speaking to Premium Times, Nafiu Muhammadu, said the village head of Guga, Alhaji Umar, was abducted while 10 people were killed in the attack.\n\n\u201cWhen they came, they started shooting sporadically and putting fire on shops in the community, which caused panic. When residents started running, some of the bandits started shooting, which led to the death of the 10 people I told you.\n\n\u201cThe village head, despite the chance for him to run because his house is a little far away from where the attack started, came towards the bandits, asking his people to run. That was when he was captured. He was taken back into his house where some money and foodstuff were also taken,\u201d Muhammadu said.\n\nHe said only the village head was abducted. Those killed have not been buried yet.\n\nLocal sources said the marauding bandits stormed Dukawa in Funtua local government Monday night and ran a house to house search.\n\nAn anonymous source, who is now seeking refuge in Funtua told this reporter that the bandits were possibly there to loot food.\n\n\u201cThey did not kill anyone in the village but eight women and six children were taken by the bandits when they couldn\u2019t get any meaningful food stuff. I was there and there was no attempt by the security agents to repel the attack despite the fact that we called the policemen stationed not far from the village,\u201d he said.\n\nThe source, however, said negotiations had started for the release of the women and children.\n\nThe attack in Gidan Kanawa came hours after the one in Dukawa, all in Funtua local government area.\n\nAttahiru Bala, another resident of Funtua, said the attack on Gidan Kanawa in which three people were killed in the village was a reprisal attack.\n\n\u201cMy sister-in-law lives there with her husband. She told us that the bandits were frustrated by vigilante members last Saturday when they attempted to attack the town. But they regrouped and came back this morning around 1 a.m. and launched the attack. If not because of the resilience of the vigilante members who still confronted them and helped residents escape, the casualties would have been more than the three killed. But I was also told that several people were abducted,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Bala said the three people were buried Tuesday morning in the area.\n\nThe command spokesperson in Katsina state, Mr Isa\u2019s phone number was not reachable but a message was sent to him for comments on the attacks.\n\nIPMA boss kidnapped\n\nAlso, the Benin Depot Chairman of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) Baba Abdul-Hamid Saliu, was Monday evening abducted by gunmen suspected to be kidnappers.\n\nHis driver, whose identity still remained unknown as at the time of filing this report, was killed in the process.\n\nThe incident occurred Monday, at about 7 pm in Jattu, his country home, in Etsako West local government area of Edo state.\n\nSaliu was elected last week Thursday.\n\nIt was gathered that the gunmen said to be about six in number, came in two vehicles with hidden number plates and laid ambush at his residence.",

The NNPC quality inspectors including GMO, SGS, GeoChem and G&G conducted tests before discharge also showed that the gasoline met Nigerian specification.\n\n6. As a standard practice for all PMS import to Nigeria, the cargoes were equally certified by inspection agent appointed by the Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority has met Nigerian specification.\n\n7. It is important to note that the usual quality inspection protocol employed in both the load port in Belgium and our discharge ports in Nigeria do not include the test for Percent methanol content and therefore the additive was not detected by our quality inspectors.\n\n8.

As we speak, the federal government has adamantly done nothing to ensure that the renegotiation agreement is signed and implemented.\n\n\u201cWe are perplexed that the states and federal government are not responding to our consistent appeal or listening to bring about genuine transformation by highly motivated human capital in the education sector for our university system.\n\n\u201cEmbarking on strike is not in our character nor is it in our nature, however, our union should not be pushed to the wall, we only go on strike as a last resort. We are in a position where the government is not doing the needful.\u201d\n\nHe expressed concern about the neglect of conditions of service of academics saying lecturers have made sacrifices over the years than any other segment of the society to ensure that universities in the country were globally competitive, \u201cbut despite that, they are poorly remunerated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are producing lecturers and manpower for other parts of the world so we must be paid remuneration that are globally competitive. We are calling on all Nigerians to prevail on the federal government to do the needful, \u201che said.\n\nEmphasising on the issue of IPPIS, Odukoya alleged that the Accountant General of the federation seemed to have made a business of it, saying that those found culpable in fraudulent practice, should be arrested by the EFCC.\n\nOn the funding of state and federal universities, the zonal coordinator said politicians are interested in creating new universities as constituency project rather than funding existing ones, adding that academics are underpaid.\n\n\u201cWe say this must stop.

          "title": "Nigeria Drags UK\u2019s Crime Agency to Court Over \u00a3150m Abacha Loot",
          "text": "The Nigerian government is locked in a court battle with Britain\u2019s National Crime Agency (NCA) over control of \u20ac180 million (\u00a3150 million) that was stashed abroad by Nigeria\u2019s former Head of State, late Gen. Sani Abacha.\n\nBy Tuesday\u2019s official exchange rate of the British Pounds Sterling at N563, as seen on the website of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the money in contention is about N84.5 billion.\n\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s The Telegraph reported that the case was again poised to spark fresh questions about dirty money flowing through the City of London.\n\nIn the latest legal tussle over the money, generally known in Nigeria as \u201cAbacha loot\u201d, the report stated that Nigeria wanted the crime-fighting agency, NCA, to release funds that it froze at the request of US authorities.\n\nIn May 2020, the federal government confirmed the receipt of $311 million looted by a late dictator, Abacha, repatriated from the United States and Island of Jersey.\n\nAccording to Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, \u201cThe amount increased significantly from over $308 million to over $311 million because of the interest that accrued from February 3, 2020, to 28th April, 2020, when the fund was transferred to the CBN.\u201d\n\nIt came after the recovery of $322 million from Switzerland in 2018.\n\nAt the time, Malami noted that the government had committed that the asset would support and assist in expediting the construction of three major infrastructure projects across Nigeria, namely, Lagos \u2013 Ibadan Expressway, Abuja \u2013 Kano Road, and Second Niger Bridge.\n\nIt was estimated that from 2007 to 2020, about $1.5 billion had been returned to Nigeria from different parts of the world.\n\nAccording to the latest report, American prosecutors said the money could be traced back to a suspected $2.2 billion (\u00a31.6 billion) or more that was plundered by Abacha and his associates during the dictator\u2019s five-year reign.\n\nIn the complex issues surrounding the repatriation of the funds, the authorities in the US sought to return the money to \u201cthe people of Nigeria\u201d, under the so-called Kleptocracy Initiative.\n\nBut the Nigerian government was said have sought to \u201csidestep\u201d the process and obtain the funds directly through an application to the High Court, in a move opposed by UK and US authorities, documents seen by The Telegraph and SourceMaterial showed.\n\nAlthough Abacha died more than 20 years ago, the piles of treasure he looted from Nigerian coffers have kept cropping up, with at least $2 billion being thought to have stolen during his five years in power.\n\nThe former dictator\u2019s spoils have been linked to dozens of offshore bank accounts over the years, as investigators unravel the intricate web he and his associates spun across the globe.\n\nBritish and American authorities have been locked in talks over tens of millions of pounds of cash that investigators say can be traced to Abacha\u2019s plundering, the investigation found.\n\nThe case, which involves a serving Nigerian politician who was one of Abacha\u2019s top henchmen, includes cash in British bank accounts that has been frozen by the National Crime Agency.\n\nHowever, the Nigerian government has brought its own legal action against the NCA in a bid to end the tussle, it has emerged.\n\nThe report stated, \u201cIt is a complicated story with many twists and turns. But the on-going struggle for \u2018Abacha\u2019s loot\u2019 reveals the difficulty in recovering stolen funds, the frustrations of law enforcement, and the way people accused of corruption have relied on respectable law firms to argue their cases in court.\u201d\n\nOn the modus operandi used by Abachi to execute the looting, the report stated that after seizing power in a 1993 coup, Abacha set about using his position as Nigeria\u2019s head of state to place himself above the law and skim vast sums of money from the oil-rich nation.\n\nIn perhaps the most brazen example, he would tell advisers to make spurious requests to him for money to deal with national \u201cemergencies\u201d, according to US court documents.\n\nSigned letters would then be sent to the CBN, which would provide cash, travellers\u2019 cheques or arrange a wire transfer.\n\nThe report added, \u201cMoney was stuffed into boxes or bags and transported to Abacha\u2019s house, before associates arranged for it to be sent abroad.\n\n\u201cAt least $2 billion is thought to have been stolen this way, using more than 60 letters to the central bank.\n\n\u201cAbacha also arranged for the government to sell bonds to a company controlled by his allies before buying them back at vastly inflated prices, generating an illicit windfall of $282 million.\u201d\n\nSeparately, the report stated that Abacha and his associates extorted French engineering firm, Dumez Group, of $97 million and used his spoils to live a luxurious lifestyle.\n\n\u201cInside his many sprawling homes, he kept piles of glittering jewellery, including gold necklaces and rings, and at one stage as much as $100 million in cash,\u201d the report noted.\n\nHowever, the money Abacha and his associates plundered became the subject of an international search after the dictator\u2019s sudden death in 1998, aged 54.\n\nThe report stated that weeks after his death, Abacha\u2019s widow was caught trying to flee the country with 38 suitcases packed with money and his family later forfeited nearly $1 billion.\n\n\u201cYet the only clues hinting at where other stashes of money could be found were a few details of secret offshore bank accounts discovered by authorities,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cSince then, the Nigerians have sought foreign help to recover as much as possible, with more than $1 billion eventually returned from Switzerland alone,\u201d it added.\n\nThe effort has been hampered by the sheer complexity of Abacha\u2019s dealings as well as marathon legal battles that have dragged on for years, some involving former associates.\n\nOne of the remaining cases, brought by US prosecutors, aims to recover more than $480 million, the report stressed. In just one example of the web of transactions criss-crossing the globe, they outlined in court filings how money was laundered by Abacha and his associates through bank accounts in Lagos, London, New York, Paris, Zurich, and Geneva.\n\nThe assets were stashed in banks, including Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and Banque SBA, according to the lawsuit, although there was no suggestion that the banks were involved in any wrongdoing.\n\nThe Telegraph stated, \u201cThis legal action eventually resulted in a 2020 deal to repatriate about $321 million, which had been laundered through the US banking system and then held in accounts in Jersey under the name of Doraville Properties Corporation, a British Virgin Islands company, and Abacha\u2019s son, Mohammed.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the new development comes as Britain fights claims that it has been very tolerant of dirty money flowing through the City of London.\n\nUS officials said last month that they were concerned that deep links between the UK and several Russian oligarchs meant that sanctions issued against Moscow if it invades Ukraine could be rendered ineffective.\n\nLast Sunday, Briish Labour MP David Lammy accused ministers of doing too little to deal with corruption in Britain.\n\nLammy said, \u201cWe have to fix the dirty money problem we have, this huge problem of money laundering in London, of corruption and fraud.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much that (ministers) are not doing. Joe Biden knows it and he\u2019s concerned.\u201d\n\nBut simultaneously, another court tussle in the UK is happening in parallel. At stake is more than \u20ac90 million, some of which came from Abacha\u2019s security votes fraud, according to a High Court judgement issued in 2014.\n\nThe money is said to be controlled by a Singapore-based trust set up for the benefit of the family of Abubakar Bagudu, the serving governor of Kebbi State, who is accused of playing an \u201cinstrumental role\u201d in many of Abacha\u2019s corrupt schemes by US prosecutors.\n\nBagudu has always denied any wrongdoing. His office did not respond to a request for comment, the report said.\n\nHis brother, Ibrahim, is a director of two companies known as Blue Holdings that are owned by the Singapore trust.\n\nAccording to the Pandora Papers, a leaked cache of documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists last year, the Bagudu brothers enlisted Farrer & Co, an elite London law firm that has advised the Queen, to help them set up these businesses.\n\nThey moved \u20ac98 million from a British Virgin Islands trust to a new structure spanning Singapore and the Cook Islands.\n\nFarrer & Co said it carried out \u201cextensive due diligence\u201d on Bagudu and that it obtained approval from the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), the precursor to the NCA, to move the funds.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the case, the amount controlled by the Singapore trust may now have grown to as much as \u20ac180 million. It is kept in accounts at Waverton Investment Management and James Hambro & Partners, both based in London.\n\nThe NCA has been working with American authorities in a bid to confiscate the funds and return them to \u201cthe people of Nigeria,\u201d the report stated.\n\nHowever, the Nigerian government wants them to be returned directly to the country and the parties, including lawyers for Bagudu, have been holding negotiations about a possible settlement, court filings in the US show.\n\nBagudu struck a deal with the Nigerian government in 2003, in which he agreed to return a sum of money but made no admission of wrongdoing, and the agreement was reaffirmed by Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in 2018. What this means, according to the report, is that almost 70 per cent of the UK money could be handed to Bagudu if returned.\n\nCourt filings showed the Nigerian government subsequently sought to unlock the funds and repatriate them in legal action against the NCA \u2013 a move that was opposed by the UK and US.\n\nThe country hired Kingsley Napley, the London law firm famed for representing a host of celebrities, including Rebekah Vardy, to represent it. The firm and the NCA both declined to comment, the report noted.\n\nThe report quoted Spotlight on Corruption, a non-profit campaign group, as saying that the case raises questions about whether, \u201claw enforcement is being paid and resourced enough to get its act together\u201d.\n\nIt accused the NCA of having effectively \u201ccleaned\u201d the money by approving the transfer to Singapore and warned against returning cash to Bagudu.\n\nHowever, Jonathan Benton, a former NCA senior detective who now runs consultancy Intelligent Sanctuary, said the case also underlined the sheer complexity of efforts to reclaim Abacha\u2019s loot.\n\nBenton stated, \u201cI care passionately about tackling corruption and it is important we hold people to account.\n\n\u201cBut it can be a challenging and drawn-out process and sometimes you have to be pragmatic. In those situations, the law allows you to negotiate. It is repugnant. But Nigeria desperately needs the money that Abacha stole.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja with agency report",

          "title": "Nigeria: Buhari Angry Over Dirty Fuel in Circulation, Orders Query of Regulatory Agency",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari was said to have on Tuesday expressed anger over the contaminated petrol in circulation across the country, a development that has disrupted the nation\u2019s fuel supply chain for several days.\n\nThe president was said to have therefore ordered that the Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), Mr. Farouk Ahmed, should be queried immediately.\n\nBuhari, who was said to be visibly worried over the situation, leading to the return of long fuel queues in parts of the country, especially in Abuja, Lagos, Ogun, Port Harcourt and others, instructed the Minister of State, Petroleum, Mr. Timipre Sylva, to ask Ahmed to explain how the product came into the country.\n\nAn impeccable presidency source told THISDAY that Buhari felt that the first point to begin to unravel how the product came into the country and invariably began circulating should be the agency, which by law acts as the \u201cpolice\u201d of the downstream and midstream sector.\n\nThe Authority was created in August 2021 in line with the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) and encompasses a merger of three defunct regulatory agencies: Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA), Petroleum Equalisation Fund (Management) Board (PEFMB), and the Midstream and Downstream Divisions of the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR).\n\nIt is responsible for the regulation of the midstream and downstream petroleum operations in Nigeria which includes technical, operational, and commercial activities.\n\nAccording to the source, who asked not be named, the minister who was at the Presidential Villa to brief the president, following the growing outrage over the issue, was directed to, in a short while, send the query to the CEO of the agency.\n\n\u201cThis matter has become an embarrassment to this government. There\u2019s no question that these cargoes of petrol were bad, so he (Ahmed) is being queried over how the fuel came into the country and the president has so instructed,\u201d the presidency source explained.\n\nWhen THISDAY sought to know why the midstream/downstream should be issued a query while the likely importer, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) was seemingly being let off the hook, the source said while investigations were ongoing, the response of the agency would determine which other government agency or private individuals would be sanctioned.\n\n\u201cThe reason the midstream/downstream authority is being queried first is that for now the bulk stops at its desk. They are the first port of call. Ordinarily, they are expected to know how it came into the country.\n\n\u201cThis is because they are the police of the industry. How did it get past them into circulation? It is their job to know. They are the police which should stop bad fuel from coming into the country.\n\n\u201cSo, the NNPC has not been queried for now. The question now is who certified the product clean enough to come into the country?\n\n\u201cWhen the investigation is done, then the federal government will know where the blame lies, but for now, the NNPC is just a company and doesn\u2019t necessarily owe allegiance to government as it were, because it\u2019s now just like every other company with a profit motive.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand the authority is the regulator, they are supposed to flag any adulterated product so that it doesn\u2019t come into the country. For now , the question the government is asking is: How did it come into the country. Who gave the permission or go-ahead? That is the question for now, then other steps will follow.\n\n\u201cIt is on the basis of that the presidency can then apportion blames and sanction other culpable operators accordingly,\u201d the presidency source added.\n\nAccording to the source, the affected volume of products in circulation was more than the 100 million litres being bandied about, adding that it came in six cargoes.\n\n\u201cThe actual figure is 317 million litres that came in six cargoes. So, the argument that it is isolated does not hold water,\u201d the source alleged.\n\nThe current problematic supply of petrol has for days grounded movement in Abuja, Lagos and some other parts of the country, made worse by the shortage of inventory released from the sole importer, the NNPC.\n\nThe prevailing condition has ensured that in Abuja, especially, a majority of filling stations were shut even as motorists spent hours in the sun struggling to buy from the few that were open, causing serious traffic jams in parts of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nThe particular cargoes with the issue were said to have high sulphur content, while marketers have been advised not to sell to consumers.\n\nIn addition, it was learnt that the queues returned partly because the gap which existed when depot owners started hoarding products before the announcement of retention of subsidy by the federal government had not smoothened.\n\nThis has challenged the lifting of products to, especially Abuja and other parts of the north from Lagos, THISDAY gathered.\n\nIn a statement on the matter yesterday, the Authority admitted that \u201climited quantity of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), commonly known as petrol, with methanol quantities above Nigeria\u2019s specification was discovered in the supply chain.\u201d\n\nWhile stressing that methanol is a regular additive in petrol and usually blended in an acceptable quantity, the NMDPRA stated that to ensure vehicular and equipment safety, the limited quantity of the impacted product has been isolated and withdrawn from the market, including the loaded trucks in transit.\n\n\u201cOur technical team in conjunction with NNPC Ltd and other industry stakeholders, will continue to monitor and ensure quality petroleum products are adequately supplied and distributed nationwide,\u201d it added.\n\nAccording to the agency, the \u201csource supplier\u201d has been identified and further commercial and appropriate actions shall be taken by the Authority and NNPC Ltd.\n\nIn addition, it noted that the NNPC Ltd and all oil marketing companies had been directed to sustain sufficient distribution of petrol in all retail outlets nationwide.\n\nSubsequently, the NDMPRA stated that the NNPC has intensified efforts at increasing the supply of the product into the market in order to bridge any unforeseen supply gap.\n\nMeanwhile, in separate interviews on Arise Television, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm, National President of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Mr. Chinedu Okoronkwo and the Vice President of the union, Mr. Abubakar Maigandi, confirmed that the bad products were being withdrawn from circulation.\n\nWhile trying to play down the seriousness of the situation, Okoronkwo who absolved his members of any complicity in the matter, noted that \u201cin any given situation, business-wise, sometimes you might have ups and downs\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThis time, we must let the world know that the Independent Marketers Association of Nigeria has never been part of any scarcity or whatever you may call it.\n\n\u201cOur own duty is to ensure that we get products and take to our station and retail to the masses. So moving forward, on the issue of this contaminated product, it is no more a hidden thing, but we have got an assurance from the NNPC that the fuel has been removed.\n\n\u201cAnd they have brought in new one now that we are now using. You know any ripples in the system for one or two days might exaggerate (extend) into one week,\u201d he posited.\n\nAccording to him, the hope was that the national oil company has now gotten its act together and had taken inventory of the contaminated product which had been withdrawn from circulation.\n\nHe argued that the complaints of vehicles breaking down had markedly subsided, meaning that good product was now in circulation, reassuring that the situation will normalise in days.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the market, you know that people are still buying now, which means the good one is coming into the system,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso in his remarks, Maigandi assured that: \u201cBy God\u2019s grace, today or tomorrow, the product will be available nationwide.\u201d\n\nOn the source of the bad fuel, he said: \u201cAll the marketers as you know, heavily depend on the NNPC. So we buy this product through the NNPC and private depots.\n\n\u201cThat is the source of our getting this product. But, you know, in every business, sometimes there must be an issue. And this issue has already been understood without much damage.\n\n\u201cAnd NNPC is working seriously to see that they get the correct product so that the marketers will continue loading. Already, we have told all our marketers to stand by and we have started receiving decontaminated products.\n\n\u201c You will see that the product will be available in most of our filling station nationwide. Normally we take precautionary measures immediately we bring the product into our filling stations,\u201d he explained.\n\nA day earlier, the South-West Zonal Chairman of IPMAN, Mr. Dele Tajudeen, had lamented that members of the association had suffered severe losses and may ask for damages from the authorities.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
