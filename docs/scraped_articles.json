          "text": "The Department of State Service has released eight of the 12 detained aides of Yoruba Nation activist, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho.\n\nThe release of the eight aides came on the heels of the 48-hours ultimatum which the lawyer to the aides, Pelumi Olajengbesi, gave the DSS on Friday.\n\nOlajengbesi told journalists during a press conference in Abuja on Monday that four of the aides had yet to be released.\n\nHe attributed the failure to release the other four aides to technical issues which \u201cwill be resolved soon.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer said, \u201cToday, they have been able to release eight persons among the 12. We are hoping that they will release the remaining four tomorrow (Tuesday) or before the end of the week.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, they should have released every single person detained as ordered by the court, but we have some technical legal issues that we think should be easily resolved and of course, we agreed with them.\u201d\n\nOlajengbesi said he would not pre-empt that the DSS was trying to manipulate or deviate from what the law said or what the court ordered.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of what has happened now is to show that in every circumstance the law must prevail,\u201d he added.\n\nThe PUNCH had earlier reported that the DSS had arrested 12 Igboho\u2019s aides from his home in Ibadan on July 1.\n\nFollowing their continued detention, their lawyer had filed an application praying the court to grant them bail.\n\nThe DSS\u2019 lawyer, I. Awo, opposed the bail of other four of the aides on the ground that the DSS was still investigating them.\n\nHowever, Justice Obiora Egwuatu of the Federal High Court had granted bail to all the 12 detainees.\n\nSeeking to further detain the four aides, the DSS had filed an appeal at the Court of Appeal challenging the bail granted to the four aides.\n\nWhen the lawyer to the detained aides was asked during the press conference if the eight persons released were the ones whose bail were not opposed by DSS. He replied that the released persons consisted of six persons from the initial eight and two persons from the other four whose bail were opposed.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "A group, Nigeria COVID Response Alliance, has condemned the pronouncement of the Edo State Government not to allow people who are yet to be vaccinated to enter places of worship or shopping malls.\n\nThe public relations officer of the group, Dr Patrick Ijewere, at a briefing in Lagos on Monday, said the pronouncement was outrageous and an excessive response to the COVID-19 situation in the state and Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe statement has no basis in law, logic, science, or ethics. To begin with, does Mr Obaseki have enough vaccines for the 3,233,336 residents of Edo State were they all to step out for the vaccine in compliance with this half-baked measure?\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, hereby call on Governor Obaseki to immediately retract the statement and rescind the decision. The vaccines which the governor is directing his citizens to mandatorily receive, (Moderna, Astra Zeneca, and Johnson & Johnson) are up to this moment all known to be experimental in nature, having been authorised only for emergency or experimental use.\n\n\u201cAlso known is the fact that virtually every party involved in administering the shots (from the manufacturers to the donors and the medics, including the Edo state government) are all indemnified from all liabilities in case of any adverse effectsattending the receipt of the vaccine. It is, therefore, not only unconscionable making the jab mandatory for free citizens, it is particularly obnoxious linking it with their fundamental right to assemble and worship in the presence of the almighty God.\u201d\n\nRecall that Obaseki had said the pronouncement would be enforced from the second week of September, adding that only the people who had been vaccinated would be allowed into worship centres, receptions, events centres and other places of large gatherings.\n\nEdo coalition protests\n\nMeanwhile, members of the civil societies group in Benin, Edo State, on Monday protest against the government pronouncement.\n\nThe protesters who marched through the streets of Benin, said the plan by the government is tantamount to trampling on the fundamental rights of the citizens.\n\nThe Interim state chairman, Edo Civil Society, Bishop Osadolor Ochei, said it is the right of the citizens to decide whether to be vaccinated or not.\n\nAlso, convener and spokesperson for the group, Chris Iyama said, \u201cYou cannot force someone to eat what he or she doesn\u2019t want. Are we in Banana Republic? We own the state not the government.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

If these activities go on unchecked, the State would be in a huge environmental and food safety crisis\u201d, Ajao quoted the GM as saying.\n\nShe said the LASEPA boss warned other illegal operators in and around the residential areas to relocate to areas earmarked for industrial and commercial activities within the State, stressing that the agency is willing to facilitate the process of movement with fair notice and due consideration for the economic requirements.\n\n\u201cBreaking into sealed properties or removing government seals or tampering with evidence are all criminal acts that attract punishment, therefore, the full wrath of the law shall be served accordingly on the trespassers,\u201d she further quoted the agency boss as saying.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".\n\n\u2026.seeks an urgent audience with CJN\n\nBy Ikechukwu Nnochiri, ABUJA\n\nThe Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, has alleged that some of its senior members are yielding themselves to politicians to be used as willing tools to wantonly abuse the judicial process.\n\nThe legal body, in a statement it issued late in the night on Monday, said it observed with dismay, the unfortunate and recurring trend of contradictory court decisions and orders, especially among courts of coordinate jurisdiction, typically arising from ex parte applications and almost always in political matters.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, we have begun to receive worrying news of recurring contradictory decisions by our courts, based on the apparently indiscriminate grant of orders and counter-orders, in a way that evokes memories of those eerie and unwanted dark days.\n\n\u201cExamples include the orders relating to the nomination of candidates by political parties for the forthcoming gubernatorial elections in Anambra State, especially by the three major political parties, All Progressives Congress (APC), All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\n\u201cAn equally embarrassing situation is also playing out in respect of the PDP leadership crisis that has seen not less than three different rulings, all by courts of coordinate jurisdiction, in circumstances that leave a lot to be desired.\n\n\u201cWhile the NBA will continue to stay away from the political ramifications and machinations involved in these matters, it is self-evident that these developments in our courts are antithetical to the actualisation of the just society and independent judiciary that we all aspire to, and they run contrary to everything we teach and hold dear as a profession.\n\n\u201cIndeed, these aberrations do nothing but bring the Judiciary and the entire system of administration of justice to ridicule, and certainly erode the authority of the hallowed offices that our judicial officers occupy.\n\n\u201cIf the society cannot trust the judiciary+ and the legal profession to safeguard our democracy, what then is the justification for the respect that the society has for us?\u201d, the NBA queried.\n\nAccording to the legal association, it has evidence that some of its senior members acted in breach of rules of professional conduct for legal practitioners, by assisting politicians to procure ex-parte orders.\n\nConsequently, the NBA leadership said it would urgently seek an audience with the Chief Justice of Nigeria, CJN, Justice Ibrahim Muhammad.\n\n\u201cTo say the least, there is, in the NBA\u2019s view, prima facie evidence of the breach of the Rules of Professional\n\nConduct for Legal Practitioners 2007 (\u201cRPC\u201d), made pursuant to the Legal Practitioners Act, by the lawyers responsible for the unrelenting embarrassment of our Judiciary in political matters.\n\n\u201cRule 1 of the RPC which requires a lawyer to uphold and observe the rule of law, promote and foster the cause of justice, maintain a high standard of professional conduct, and not engage in any conduct which is unbecoming of a legal practitioner is clearly being violated in these cases.\n\n\u201cBy the issuance of this statement, the NBA confirms unequivocally that it will not stand by and watch a ridiculing of the profession and the justice administration system by a handful of its members and will be considering its deterrence options in this regard.\n\n\u201cThe Bench, respectfully, is also not blameless. We certainly concur with the Honourable Justice Chioma Nwosu-Iheme of the Court of Appeal in her condemnation of the indulgence by some judicial officers of politicians who go round the country shopping for judgments, and who thereby bring the Judiciary to public ridicule.\n\n\u201cTo that end, the NBA will urgently seek audience with the Honourable Chief Justice of Nigeria to address this issue holistically.\n\n\u201cIn deference to the revered office of our courts, the NBA shall refrain from further comments on this matter in the meantime.\n\n\u201cI will enlist the support of the Chairman of the NBA Judiciary Committee, Dr Babatunde Ajibade, SAN as well as the Chairpersons of the NBA Section of Legal Practice (NBA-SLP) and NBA Section on Public Interest and Development Law (NBA-SPIDEL), Mr Oluwaseun Abimbola, SAN and Dr Monday Ubani for this proposed engagement.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, the NBA, as the prime defender of the integrity and independence of the Judiciary, cannot and will not be a spectator whilst our hard-earned democracy is threatened by the venal acts of a few.\n\n\u201cThis is particularly so as the nation approaches its next round of general elections. It can no longer be business as usual, further read the statement signed by NBA President, Mr Olumide Akpata.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Reconciliation team seeks withdrawal of cases\n\nNBA: conflicting rulings ridiculous\n\nCJN invites Rivers, C/River, Kebbi, Jigawa, Anambra, Imo CJs over contradictory orders\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) conflict reconciliation panel has attributed the leadership crisis tearing apart the opposition party to the battle between Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike and suspended Chairman Uche Secondus, it was learnt.\n\nThe eight-man panel headed by former Senate President David Mark has decided to meet with the two gladiators before the end of this week to press for the withdrawal of court cases in connection with the crisis.\n\nThere has been a plethora of cases since the Rivers State High Court granted an interim injunction stopping Secondus from parading himself as chairman or conducting affairs of the party. The ruling also endorsed the suspension of his membership of the party.\n\nThe suit was filed by members of the PDP in Rivers State.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe order was made following a suit filed against Secondus and the PDP by some members of the party identified as Ibeawuchi Ernest Alex, Dennis Nna Amadi, Emmanuel Stephen and Umezirike Onucha.\n\nSecondus went to a Kebbi State High Court to obtain another injunction restoring him. Following this, a set of party members obtained another injunction at a Cross River High Court restraining Secondus. All the courts are of coordinate jurisdiction.\n\nYesterday, Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) Justice Tanko Muhammad, who is also chairman of the Nigeria Judicial Council (NUJ), invited the chief judges of Rivers, Cross River, Kebbi, Jigawa, Anambra and Imo states over issuance of conflicting rulings on the PDP and the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) political crises.\n\nThe David Mark panel, it was learnt, is of the opinion that only the withdrawal of all suits in court could enable the PDP to hold a hitch-free national convention on October 31.\n\nAccording to a source, members have identified Wike and Secondus as the arrowheads of the crisis rocking the PDP.\n\nThe source said: \u201cWe have resolved to hold a frank session with Wike and Secondus within the next 48 hours. We will make the observations of party leaders known to them and seek their cooperation on the way out for the crises.\n\n\u201cOur minimum demand is immediate withdrawal of all cases in court in order to restore stability to the party. Without the withdrawal of the cases, the PDP national convention cannot hold on October 31.\n\n\u201cThe conflicting orders from different courts have not helped the nation\u2019s democracy and the image of PDP as a democratic party.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget that withdrawal of cases was a major mandate given to us by the National Caucus.\n\n\u201cWe will use the opportunity to seek their opinions on all issues that led to the crisis in order to avert a repeat. By the time we interact with them, there may be some of their backers or foot soldiers we need to reach out to.\n\n\u201cAfter they agree to withdraw the cases, we will look for internal solutions after meeting with the key actors and their supporters.\u201d\n\nThe source added: \u201cThis crisis may lead to recommendations from the panel on how to handle such whenever it occurs in future. Our report may even guide PDP to look its constitution on intra-party disputes.\u201d\n\nThe source said the panel might meet Wike and Secondus separately.\n\nThe eight-man panel was raised by the National Caucus of the party on Friday.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the end of the meeting, Tambuwal said: \u201cIn view of the fact that we are yet to receive that court order from Kebbi State High Court, we empanelled this committee (Mark committee). It is part of what this committee is going to look at, and all the parties involved accordingly.",

We tear every false prophecy apart, concerning Nigeria in Jesus name, Amen.\u201d\n\nThe PFN president, who is also the presiding bishop of the Sword of the Spirit Ministries, Ibadan, Oke, in the same vein, quoted copiously from the book of 1kings 18:1, saying: \u201cThis is the situation of Nigeria presently. There\u2019s drought because of iniquity in the land. But when rain comes, it takes care of the negative. It ushers in the positive; the weather is cold, the grass is green and there\u2019s fruitfulness. The positive begins to break forth, leading to the abundance of everything that\u2019s good.\n\nThe renowned cleric prayed for an end to the problems currently affecting the nation, saying: \u201cWe terminate corruption in Nigeria. We terminate Boko Haram insurgents; we terminate kidnapping and all manner of crimes in the land.

          "text": "\u2022Rulings for sale to highest bidder\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe increasing meddlesome interventions of the judiciary in almost every stratum of the political turf is fast threatening the nation\u2019s hard earned democracy and becoming a source of concern to stakeholders, especially, as the country moves closer to the 2023 elections.\n\nFrom Port Harcourt to Kebbi and then, Calabar as seen in the past few days in the Peoples Democratic (PDP) as well as events leading to the Anambra gubernatorial election, stakeholders are worried that the trend signposts possible dangers ahead, even as they rebuked members of the judiciary for making themselves readily available for the dirty biddings of politicians.\n\nThe courts, many well-meaning Nigerians are worried, might have become a market place for politicians to buy injunctions and exparte orders, and at the rate things are going, it may be difficult to draw the lines that Judges will not cross just to do the bidding of politicians.\n\nThe ease with which judges allow themselves to be manipulated by senior lawyers in pursuit of narrow self-interest is baffling to many, who now see the judiciary as a major threat to the nation\u2019s democracy. Some of the actions of judges defy logic and reason causing the layman on the street to ask questions and raise suspicion of underhand dealings.\n\n\u201cThe situation is now embarrassing. It is now so easy for any group to move into any court to get a judgment. All they need do is to get a pliant judge. It is unfortunate that the judges are the ones that determine, who holds political position in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere are so many interventions by the judiciary across the country. They make governors, senators; they issue injunctions and they now sell injunctions. You have case in Akwa Ibom, you go to Sokoto to get a judgment and then INEC has to obey. So, it is an abuse. With the way they are going, you can even get an injunction for marriages in Jigawa,\u201d a senior lawyer, who pleaded to remain anonymous, said.\n\nFor instance, in the PDP, early last week, a High Court in Rivers State, had issued an order of interim injunction, restraining Uche Secondus from carrying on as national chairman of the party, pending the hearing and determination of a suit challenging his continued stay in office.\n\nSecondus, according to the ruling, had been ordered to stop parading himself as a member of the PDP on grounds of his suspension from the party.\n\nJustice O. Gbasam of the Degema Division of a High Court of Rivers State, sitting in Port Harcourt, had issued the orders while delivering ruling in an exparte application by some chieftains of the PDP in Rivers State.\n\nBut two days after, Justice Nusirat. I. Umar, a vacation Judge of the Kebbi State High Court of coordinate jurisdiction with the one in Rivers State and who was clearly aware of the case already in Rivers State, not only entertained the case, she gave her own orders restoring the embattled National Chairman of the party to his position.\n\nThis was after the Deputy National Chairman (South) of the Party, Elder Yemi Akinwomi, had assumed leadership of the PDP in acting capacity.\n\nIn a suit brought before her in Birinin Kebbi, the state capital in case KB/AC/M. 170/2021, Justice Umar said she was satisfied after reading the affidavit of the respondents that an interim order should be granted on the purported suspension of Secondus pending the determination of the case.\n\n\u201cAn order of this Honourable court granting leave to the first respondent (Uche Secondus) to continue exercising all the constitutional powers of the office of Chairman of PDP (second defendant) as enshrined in both 1999 Constitution of Nigeria as amended and the Peoples Democratic Party\u2019s constitution pending the hearing and final determination of applicant\u2019s motion on notice,\u201d the order stated.\n\nRegrettably, 24-hours after the Kebbi State ruling, the crisis in the political party took a new twist as this time another court in Calabar, Cross River State, further restrained Secondus from parading himself as chairman as well as from presiding over the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the party held at the weekend.\n\nAny right thinking person will know that something was surely wrong with a system that tolerates such abuse and mockery of such a critical arm of state. But Judges and many senior lawyers appear to care less about the consequential implications of their behaviour, which had brought disrepute and dishonour to the judiciary.\n\nThe interim order was issued by the court, presided over by Justice Edem Kufre, last Friday, upon an application brought by a member of the party, Enang Wani.\n\nThe situation is not different in the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), which had also been engulfed with leadership squabble between the Jude Okeke and Victor Oye factions. This has seen leaders of the same party move from one court to the other shopping for injunction in their quest to control the party and ensure their candidates are recognised ahead of the November gubernatorial election, thus further polarising the party.\n\nIn the case of the APGA, former Cnetral Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Chukwuma Soludo is having a running battle with Chukwuma Umeoji. The litigations are tied to who is the authentic Chairman of APGA in Anambra State amongst Chief Victor Oye, Chief Njoku and Jude Okeke.\n\nMeanwhile, judges in Anambra, Jigawa, Imo and Abuja have intervened in the matter causing INEC to at various times list and delist both the names of Soludo and Umeoji as candidate of APGA.\n\nThe electoral umpire had on July 16 published the name of Umeoji as the APGA candidate following an order by the Jigawa State High Court on June 28.\n\nOn July 18 justice Charles Okaa of Anambra State High Court directed INEC to publish Soludo\u2019s name as APGA\u2019s candidate. Meanwhile justice Iheka of the Imo State High Court again ordered INEC to publish Umeoji\u2019s name.\n\nReacting to the confusion, Justice Nwosu-Iheme berated the judges for indulging politicians, who go round the country shopping for judgments to enable them be on the ballot. According to her, the judges, who indulge these politicians are bringing the legal profession to public ridicule.\n\nThe PDP in Anambra State is in a terrible position as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) presently does not recognise either the Valentine Ozigbo or Senator Ugochukwu Uba factions, because of a plethora court injunctions.\n\nA former National Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Adams Oshiomhole, was also removed after legal fireworks that saw the former labour leader and his then rivals from the Federal High Court in Kano, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court, among others, in the battle for the soul of the party.\n\nSome three weeks ago, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) warned that except the leadership of both the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) and the National Judicial Council (NJC) intervened, the seemingly endless and conflicting court orders over political parties\u2019 affairs could jeopardise preparations for the 2023 general election.\n\nINEC, which lamented the level of distraction the commission had begun to face as a result of litigations arising from the Anambra State governorship primary elections, however, restated its commitment to the use of technology in conducting elections, because it was the only way to credible and transparent polls.\n\nWhile maintaining that new and conflicting court orders from all parts of the country kept flooding its headquarters on a daily basis, the commission said it was not only frustrating but also causing it to keep recognising one candidate over the other, and changing same again in the major political parties.\n\nNational Commissioner for Voter Education, Festus Okoye, who hinted at the concerns in Awka, Anambra State, said, \u201cThis (litigations) is frustrating. What the commission does in terms of obedience to court orders is that if a judgment comes today, the commission obeys the order, because it is the latest in time.\n\n\u201cIf on the same issue, another court of coordinate jurisdiction, or from a court of another judicial division comes to us, because that one is the latest in time, the commission obeys that one.\n\n\u201cSo, what the political parties have been doing, and what they are doing is that they anticipate the commission, and the moment you\u2019re proceeding, they get court orders. This is impeding our performance and making things difficult.\n\n\u201cElections require sanctity and adherence to guidelines, the leadership of the NBA and the NJC should look at this. This is urgent and imperative, because if it persists, this can jeopardise the conduct of the 2023 general election. We are having court orders on a daily basis from courts in all parts of the country and that is not right.\u201d\n\nAlthough sections of the country\u2019s constitution and the Electoral Act allow the judiciary, (courts and election tribunals) to intervene particularly, when issues of non-compliance, manipulation, violence etc are alleged to mar the process of electing a particular representative, however, recent developments seems to portray the fact that these days, the judges rather than the people choose the leaders.\n\nA peculiar case in recent times is that of a South Eastern State where the governor was referred to as the \u201cSupreme Court\u201d governor, simply because he was declared winner of the 2019 governorship election, after coming a distant fourth in the poll.\n\nThe intervention of the courts whether at pre-election cases or election petitions are taking a worrisome dimension as their judgments to most aggrieved parties and even the people seem to be far from justice, particularly, when such courts or judges lacked the necessary jurisdiction in the first place to hear the case brought before them.\n\nThe situation, was so bad that sometime last year, former Chief Judge of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Justice Ishaq Bello had to issue a practice directive warning justice against delving into cases outside their jurisdiction as well as issuing all sorts of retraining orders in election matters.\n\nBut it seems the warning may have fallen on deaf ears as the situation rather than abating is getting worse. Only recently, a Justice of the Court of Appeal, Chioma Nwosu-Iheme, while delivering judgment called for the punishment of a Jigawa State High Court judge, Justice Ubale and his Imo State counterpart, Justice B. C. Iheka over what she described as professional misconduct by dabbling into the Anambra State gubernatorial election controversy and gave consequential judgments on it.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says Katsina already training people to defend themselves\n\n\u2022Reiterates stand on call to arm\n\n\u2022Worries state is policed by less than 3,000 officers\n\n\u2022Insists open grazing is causing trouble\n\nObinna Chima\n\nFor the umpteenth time, the Katsina State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has said if the country truly intended to get a hold of the deteriorating security situation, then, it must embrace multi-level policing otherwise called state police.\n\nThe governor, whose state has been under intense fire from bandits and insurgents, reiterated his recent call for the people of Katsina to procure arms and defend themselves, sand added his government had begun to train people to defend themselves.\n\nWhile decrying the growing insecurity in the country, Masari expressed concern that the number of policemen available to his state were less than 3,000 and therefore not enough to protect the citizens.\n\nMasari, a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who spoke in an interview monitored on national television at the weekend, therefore, reiterated his support for state police, saying there was a need for it to be accommodated in the constitution.\n\nAccording to him, working with the Nigeria Police Force, his administration had been training people to defend their villages and communities.\n\n\u201cKnowing full well how long it will take the police to improve its capacity to be able to provide the much-needed security for villages and communities, are you saying people should fold their arms?\n\n\u201cIf somebody slaps you, the natural instinct is to raise your hands up, and if he comes with a stick, you take a stick to protect yourself,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president\u2019s home state governor, disclosed that this week, his government would complete the training of 500 vigilantes, who were trained by the police and armed forces, saying in the coming week, training for another 500 would be completed.\n\nHe said the target was to have 3,000 trained vigilante working with the police and other security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe situation we have on ground is such that bandits would come to a village, kidnap and collect over N500,000 from villagers and in some cases get N5 million from them.\n\n\u201cAnd in same village, when you say come let us contribute and train these vigilantes to defend them at night, they would not give you N20,000,\u201d he said.\n\nLamenting that Katsina, which has an estimated population of between seven and eight million persons, the governor claimed presently has only 3,000 policemen.\n\nDefending his recent call for citizens to defend themselves as the way out of the the present situation, Masari argued that the efforts his administration made to achieve peace in his first two years in office could not be sustained because same wasn\u2019t made in Zamfara and some other neighboring states at that time.\n\n\u201cI have no regret in what I said (that people should defend themselves). But what is the natural instinct of every living thing? It is to protect himself against events happening around him for him to survive.\n\n\u201cLet me give you a simple scenario. Katsina State as of 2006 had a population of 5.6 million, even if we are growing at three per cent, what would be the population by 2021?\n\n\u201cWe are projecting a population of seven to eight million. Now, what is the total strength of the police in Katsina? The total strength of the police in the state is not up to 3,000. So, if you divide the number of policemen by the population, you have an average of one policeman to over 200,000 people. What form of ammunition does the policemen have?\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further, Masari explained that, in his state, a local government with 34 policemen, had over 300 villages and towns to secure.\n\n\u201cThey (police) lack logistics in terms of equipment to move around, they lack the necessary weapons and above all, they lack the technology.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the military, how many are they in Katsina? The military are in all the states of the country, what equipment and level of technology are they applying? Look, when you are faced with reality of daily killings, daily kidnappings, daily raping and daily cattle rustling, you will understand. In Katsina, we wake up every day to these realities,\u201d Masari added.\n\nLending his support for the anti-open grazing legislation, the president\u2019s governor said, his state had a ranching programme that would cost about N12.5 billion, out of which the federal government already supported it with 50 per cent, while the state would provide 50 per cent.\n\n\u201cWhen we were growing up we had community grazing areas, where you take your sheep, goat and cattle to graze, without going to other people\u2019s farm,\u201d he recalled.\n\nHe, therefore, advocated that, \u201cWe should stop open-grazing; it is causing trouble,\u201d adding that, \u201cAnybody living in the forest, for me, is a criminal.\u201d\n\nAbout a week ago, the seemingly helpless security situation in Katsina had caused two members of the state House of Assembly to publicly shed tears while deliberating on the worsening state of insecurity in the state.\n\nDuring plenary presided over by the Speaker, Alhaji Tasi\u2019u Maigari, the Deputy Speaker, Alhaji Shehu Dalhatu-Tafoki, in a motion of urgent public importance, decried how despite government and security agencies\u2019 efforts, the insecurity situation in the state seems to be increasing.\n\nDalhatu-Taofiki, urged the government in conjunction with security agencies, to adopt a new approach and also increase the number of outposts, especially, in the affected areas to tame the menace of banditry in the state.\n\n\u201cThe security operative need to increase their outposts across the state, especially, in the areas mostly disturbed by the bandits. The outposts in those areas are not enough; they cannot overpower the bandits, despite the huge amounts of money being spent on them,\u201d he lamented.\n\nAlso, reacting to the motion, Alhaji Haruna Goma, member representing Dandume Constituency, could not hold back his tears as he narrated how the cruel bandits wasted the lives of not less than 11 persons and abducted scores in Dandume recently.\n\nSimilarly, Alhaji Abubakar Mohammed, member representing Funtua constituency, equally wept why recounting how the hoodlums terrorised their communities in the last one month, killing and kidnapping scores.\n\nAccording to the lawmaker, the insecurity challenge plaguing the state was unimaginable, because about 32 out of the 34 LGAs in the state were now being threatened by the bandits.\n\nIn May, Deputy Speaker of the state, Shehu Tafoki, had also cried profusely while talking about rising insecurity in his constituency. He broke down in tears during a special sitting on insecurity by the Assembly.\n\nHe said hardly did a day go by without reported attacks across the area, adding that many had been killed, maimed and kidnapped.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "James Emejo\n\nIn a clear demonstration of its resilience, Zenith Bank Plc has announced its audited results for the half-year (HI) ended 30 June 2021, recording positive growth across key financial metrics despite a challenging macroeconomic environment exacerbated by the COVID 19 pandemic.\n\nAccording to the bank\u2019s audited half-year financial results presented to the Nigerian Exchange (NGX), the Group recorded a growth in profit before tax of three per cent, from the N114 billion reported in H1 2020, to N117 billion in H1 2021.\n\nThe Group also recorded a nine per cent growth in non-interest income from N116 billion in June 2020, to N127 billion in June 2021.\n\nOverall, the significant reduction in interest expense by 26 per cent and growth in non-interest income by nine per cent culminated in improved profitability.\n\nThe Group\u2019s retail journey continued to deliver positive results as retail deposits grew by N38.2 billion from N1.72 trillion to N1.76 trillion year-to-date (YTD).\n\nAlso, the financial institution\u2019s savings balances grew marginally by two per cent YTD to close at N1.18 trillion, from N1.16 trillion as at December 2020.\n\nThe drive for increased retail deposits and a low-interest yield environment helped reduce the cost of funding from 2.2 per cent to 1.3 per cent in the current period. Furthermore, the results showed that operating expenses grew by 10 per cent year-on-year, but growth remained below the inflation rate, while the Group improved its Earnings per Share (EPS), which grew two per cent from N3.30 to N3.38 for the half-year ended June 2021.\n\nThe Group also increased total customer deposits by eight per cent to close the period at N5.77 trillion, demonstrating growth in its market share, just as total assets grew marginally to N8.52 trillion as at June 30, 2021, from the N8.48 trillion recorded as at December 31, 2020.\n\nDespite the COVID-19 pandemic induced challenges and the challenging operating environment, the Group grew its risk assets as gross loans were up three per cent year-to-date, from N2.92 trillion to N2.99 trillion.\n\nThis was conservatively achieved at a low non-performing loans (NPLs) ratio of 4.51 per cent (FYE 2020: 4.29%) and a reduced cost of risk of 1.3 per cent (June 2020: 1.8%).\n\nIt prudential ratios such as liquidity and capital adequacy also remained above regulatory thresholds at 69.9 per cent and 22 per cent respectively.\n\nDespite the continued prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is cautious optimism that the global economy will continue to recover as vaccination programmes are intensified.\n\nOn the domestic economy, Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 5.01 per cent in the second quarter of 2021, and the inflation rate, which peaked in March 2021 at 18.17 per cent is gradually trending down and currently at 17.38 per cent as at July 2021.\n\nZenith Bank in the statement explained that it has been well-positioned to maximise the opportunities that the recovering fundamentals present while leveraging technology to expand its retail footprints to deliver improved returns to all its stakeholders.\n\nIn recognition of its track record of excellent performance, Zenith Bank was voted as Best Commercial Bank in Nigeria in the World Finance Banking Awards 2021, Bank of the Year (Nigeria) in The Banker\u2019s Bank of the Year Awards 2020, Best Bank in Nigeria in the Global Finance World\u2019s Best Banks Awards 2020 and 2021, and Best in Corporate Governance \u2018Financial Services\u2019 Africa 2020 and 2021 by the Ethical Boardroom.\n\nAlso, the bank emerged as the Most Valuable Banking Brand in Nigeria in the Banker Magazine Top 500 Banking Brands 2020 and 2021, and Number One Bank in Nigeria by Tier-1 Capital in the \u201c2021 Top 1000 World Banks\u201d Ranking by The Banker Magazine.\n\nThe bank was also recognised as Bank of the Decade (People\u2019s Choice) at the ThisDay Awards 2020, Retail Bank of the year at the 2020 BusinessDay Banks and Other Financial Institutions (BOFI) Awards, and Best Company in Promotion of Good Health and Well-Being as well as Best Company in Promotion of Gender Equality and Women Empowerment at the Sustainability, Enterprise and Responsibility (SERAS) Awards 2020.\n\n\u201cZenith Bank has grown enormously in 30 years to become Nigeria\u2019s largest and one of Africa\u2019s largest financial institutions by tier-1 capital, with shareholders\u2019 funds of NGN1.1 trillion ($2.64 billion) as at 31st December 2020.\n\n\u201cThe bank continues to distinguish itself in the Nigerian financial services industry through superior service offerings, unique customer experience and sound financial indices.\n\n\u201cZenith Bank is the clear leader in the digital space with several firsts in the deployment of innovative products, solutions and an assortment of alternative channels that ensure convenience, speed and safety of transactions,\u201d it added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Denies deposit of N9.7bn in his account, bank refutes report\n\n*Ex-minister threatens to sue online newspaper, demands N3bn compensation over defamatory publication\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nA former Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr Ibe Kachikwu, has explained how he recovered his jaguar car, which was erroneously impounded by US authorities, and maliciously described as stolen in some online reports. Kachikwu denied receiving N9.7 billion in his bank account, and threatened to sue an online publication that claimed he smuggled the jaguar car to the US and was impounded.\n\nFirst Bank also denied the publication with regard to his transaction with the bank.\n\nThe former minister made a demand of N3 billion compensation from the online publication, People\u2019s Gazette, following the false and malicious publication.\n\nThe minister, in a letter addressed to the Publisher of the People\u2019s Gazette through his counsel, Mike Ozhekome\u2019s Chambers and titled: \u201cLibelous Publications against Dr Ibe Kachikwu-Demand for Retraction and Compensation\u201d, sought the sum of N3 billion as compensation and a retraction of the said publication.\n\nIt said the online newspaper had in its August 23, 2021 edition claimed that Kachikwu purchased a stolen vehicle, which was smuggled from a United Kingdom Assembly to California in the United States. It said the publication \u201cmaliciously and falsely\u201d portrayed the former minister as a smuggler.\n\nThe letter also stated that the publication claimed the former minister received the sum of N9.7 billion in his First Bank account while he served as minister, which it said denoted his appetite for luxury goods and accommodation.\n\nThe letter said, \u201cThe aforementioned publications, which were deliberately calculated to do maximum damage to his esteemed person, image and hard-earned goodwill and integrity, falsely alleged that our client smuggled a stolen jaguar car into the United States of America.\n\n\u201cYou went further in your baseless, provocative and malicious publication to falsely allege that our client \u2018received N9.7 billion in his personal First Bank account, which denotes his appetite for luxury good and accommodation\u2019 and portrayed our client as a corrupt, dishonest, dishonourable, unscrupulous, debased and degenerated decadent public officer.\u201d\n\nKachikwu, also a former Group Managing Director of NNPC, said through his lawyers he was inundated with calls, messages, emails from friends and associates from within and outside the country, who have expressed worry and concern over the development.\n\nThe letter further explained that the former minister had procured a jaguar car from Nigeria and used it for some years after which he sent it as a gift to a relation in the United States.\n\nHe said, \u201cUS Customs erroneously impounded the car mistaking it as a stolen car and an emission control infringement as cars with European and African emission control specifications cannot be used in the USA.\u201d\n\nHe said he made the details of the purchase available to the US authorities, who reached out to the car dealer in Nigeria, and later apologised to him upon which it was released to him and he subsequently brought the car back to Nigeria.\n\nKachikwu also debunked the claim that some N9.7 billion was found in his First Bank account, insisting that while he maintained a domiciliary account, the statement put out a false transaction of N9.7 billion inside a dollar domiciliary account.\n\nThe minister, therefore, demanded that the publishers pay him N3 billion compensation, retract the story and desist from further similar, defamatory publication and tender an unreserved apology to be published in five national dailies.\n\nThe letter said failure to adhere to the demands within seven days, the former minister would be left with no other option than to seek legal redress.\n\nMeanwhile, First Bank Nigeria PlC, has faulted the accuracy of the details provided by the online publication.\n\nA letter written to the minister in response to the status of the account with regard to the publication did not emanate from the bank.\n\nThe letter obtained by THISDAY and signed by Rotimi Akinbode and Janice Aleto, said the published bank statements did not reflect the true state of the accounts.\n\nThe letter read, \u201cWe refer to your email of August 24 in which you attached court statements purportedly belonging to you that were published by an online blog and requested us to confirm whether the statements reflect the true statement of your account with our bank.\n\n\u201cHaving reviewed the statement, we wish to state that the account numbers quoted are your visa infinite card and US dollar account with First Bank. However, the statements are not in line with those issued by First Bank and did not emanate from us. They do not reflect the true state of your accounts and are therefore false.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Fellow Americans,\n\nNobody knows the joy of winning better than I do, believe me. I have always been a winner for as long as I can remember. Okay? Nobody knows the beauty of fighting to win better than I do. I am always a fighter and when I fight, I win. Everybody knows that.\n\nI have reached the very top. Absolutely. And I reached the top at a very tremendous speed. You all know it. The first time I ran for office, I ran for president. It was beautiful. Right? What usually takes great men three attempts before they get a win, I won in a landslide the very first time I ran. I heard that it has never been done anywhere else in the world.\n\nIn the last four years, I have accomplished for America things that presidents that were in office for twelve years did not accomplish. It is not even close. I made America a big-league winner again. I put billions and billions of dollars into your pockets through my amazing tax cuts. I have shown you that everything is possible if you have the right man to do the right job. Everybody is saying so.\n\nAll over the world, there is huge respect for America again, in some cases, even massive fear. Bigly! Which is good. I made it happen. Nobody messes with America because I highly insisted on it. I placed America first, which is fair. I stopped those out of control dope and overrated countries that get away with murder at the expense of America. It didn\u2019t happen again. Not on my watch! I was tough so that America would be triumphant.\n\nThe world had never seen anything like that before.\n\nBecause of me, the next generation of Americans will grow up knowing that America is the greatest nation on earth, full of courageous men like me. Thanks to me, they will grow up knowing that ours is a Christian nation where it is allowed to say Merry Christmas. Our children and grandchildren will grow up knowing that the whole world is out there for them to dominate and not bow to the sissies who think that we must worship the environment at the expense of the staggering economy that I built.\n\nFrankly, I have done everything that I set out to do \u2013 most of which were things that have never been done before. I have in place the greatest military that humans ever assembled for our incredible men and women in uniform. I assembled it in just four years by rebuilding our powerful military that they destroyed due to neglect and incompetence. I secured America from coast to coast with walls and wires, cages and visa bans. I took care of it, just as I promised I would do. I returned America under God. Before I came, they had taken America to the shrines of the devil.\n\nAmericans love me because of these outstanding accomplishments. I have seen it on the faces of fabulous Americans while I travelled around the country in the last few weeks.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I could stay around and fight. And it is a fight that I know that I will win. But I have decided not to. There is no point.\n\nI believe that I have nothing else left to prove. My achievements will be around till the end of time. I won\u2019t be surprised if, by January 20, 2021, my face would go up on Mount Rushmore to join other presidents of my calibre. It won\u2019t surprise me one bit. People think it is going to happen.\n\nTo all my special supporters, I say thank you for the unbelievable fantastic ride. Don\u2019t despair, for I will send you a brilliant comforter. Those stupid little lightweights on the other side who have no clue may taunt you. When those clowns do, remind the goofy and crooked losers that I made America great again. Tell those terrible lowlifes that they have proved themselves unworthy of Donald Trump\u2019s genius and have opted to reduce America to a Second Class nation in the world. Total Disaster!\n\nSo, my fellow American, I bide you all farewell. May God bless you, and my God bless the United States of America.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump\n\nThe 45th President of the United States.",

          "title": "The Teflon President With Nine Lives Is On His Way Out By Dr. Wumi Akintide",
          "text": "You probably know who I am talking about. The Teflon President with nine lives I have in mind is nobody else but Donald J. Trump. Can any of you reading this write-up imagine Barack Obama, who twice won the popular vote and the Electoral College tallies and who spent 8 good years in the White House without a single scandal, being described as a cat with 9 lives?\n\nNot by a long shot. The answer to the rhetorical question has to be a resounding no. Poor Obama as President of the United States would long have been skinned alive and sacrificed to the gods by the Republicans who obstructed him every step of the way during all of his 8 years in the White House all in the name of partisan politics.\n\nYou would have thought they would have left him off the hook the moment he left office, but Republicans and their Narcissist-in-Chief in the White House have not left Obama alone for one brief moment. In fact, the grossly ignorant and incompetent lunatic in the White House still finds some ways to blame Obama or Hillary even for some of his own insanity or foolishness while fraudulently claiming to be the smartest President America has ever put in office.\n\nWhat is so offensive is that the hypocrites in his Republican base are buying the garbage and defending the impossible because all they care about is supporting the man who is going to put money in their pockets because his greatest motivation for seeking the Presidency is to make money and to make his family and few friends so rich that they would kill to have him removed from office, should it come to that. America under Trump is no longer the America we used to know and the Republican Party has become a den of thieves and sexual predators that have lost their moral compass as a major political party in God\u2019s own country.\n\nIn cahoots with Trump, Republicans have not ended their campaign of calumny to humiliate, blackmail and delegitimize Barack Obama, the first black President.\n\nEven though the White House was built with slave labor, as widely documented by historians, no black man was ever expected to live in that majestic building that the arrogant Donald Trump, in one of his craziest moments, has described as a \u201cdump.\u201d\n\nThe guy is just too arrogant to admit that the Obama couple was far superior to him and his Melania in intellect and education. Barack earned his education from Columbia and Harvard while Michelle earned her own from Princeton and Harvard.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get any better than that for any American President dead or alive but the \u201cC\u201d average student from an undergraduate business program would tell you he is the smartest dude in the universe who never makes a mistake or regrets anything. He sounds to me like a reincarnated Adolf Hitler who told the Anglo-Saxons they were the most superior white race in the world who must dominate the world. Donald Trump is pretty much preaching the same doctrine today. His latest unilateral announcement to make Jerusalem the undivided capital of the Zionist Regime without consultation with any of America\u2019s traditional allies is tantamount to suicide and a move that will go down in infamy, to quote the immortal words of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nDonald Trump once boasted that he was far more experienced than all of the American generals combined. He is therefore seeking to invalidate or demolish anything the first black President had ever done during his 8 glorious years in the White House.\n\nThe one-term young Senator from Illinois was elected President in 2008 and re-elected again in 2012 with a wider margin. He turned around the American economy while reducing unemployment in America to the lowest it had ever been in 20 years. He killed Osama Bin Laden and he passed into law the Affordable Health Care Reform Law that offered medical insurance coverage to 46 million Americans with the stroke of his pen.\n\nThe Teflon outlaw with 9 lives came to town promising to undo everything Obama has done while promising to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d as if America has ever at any time lost her greatness following the end of the Second World War. Nothing could be farther from the truth, but his Republican base and some charlatans in the party are buying the cheap blackmail from a delusional outlaw in the White House.\n\nEven though Trump had lost the popular vote by 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton, he still managed to ride on the coattails of Vladimir Putin and the KGB to put himself in the White House against the better judgment of the 65 million Americans who voted for his opponent.\n\nMy point is that if Barack Obama had committed just a fraction of the crimes and violations of the norms of decency that Donald Trump has committed less than one year into his Presidency, Obama would long have been thrown out of office and sent to jail and Republicans in their hypocrisy and racism would have made that a justification to bar any colored person from ever aspiring to be President again.\n\nIi is Donald Trump that I call the Houdini of American Politics for how and why he has survived up to this moment despite all of the atrocities he has committed as a candidate and now as President for close to one year.\n\nIf Barack Obama had uttered half the statements credited to Donald Trump, he would never have secured the nomination of the Democratic Party in 2008 and would have been ostracized for life.\n\nI seek your indulgence to go back to memory lane to remind some of the fans of this column about the America we used to know before crazy Donald Trump showed up. Eagleton was dropped from nomination as running mate due to a history of mental health illness. Spiro Agnew, Vice President to Richard Nixon, was defrocked for tax evasion and fraud. Joseph Biden was forced to drop out of his Presidential bid at a point in his career because he was found guilty of plagiarism in one of his stump speeches - he lifted a quotation from Neil Kinnock, a Labour Party leader in Britain without acknowledging his source.\n\nGerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976 in large part because he pardoned Richard Nixon, an unconvicted felon, for obstruction of justice and for displaying ignorance when he stated in one of his debates with Jimmy Carter that the now-defunct Soviet Union did not dominate Eastern Europe.\n\nGeorge Bush lost to Bill Clinton for going back on his \u201cread my lips\u201d pledge not to increase taxes. The voters concluded he had told a lie even though he was one of the most honorable and dependable men of honor ever to serve as American President.\n\nI gave all of these examples to show how Donald Trump would appear to have completely changed all the rules of the game for anyone who will be President in America. Republicans nominated a man who has had more than 4000 litigations against him in the Court of Law, most of those litigations he had to settle out of Court because he was too embarrassed to let them go forward.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who falsely tried to delegitimize the man he was going to replace by claiming Obama was not born in America. Republicans nominated a man whose Trump Plaza Building in New York was already known to be the money laundering capital of the world.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who claimed he loved to sexually assault women by \u201cgrabbing their pussies\u201d because they allowed him to commit the crime because he was a star who could get away with murder. He actually gloated that his supporters would still vote for him even if he had shot and killed a man on 5th Avenue in broad daylight in Manhattan. Republicans nominated and elected a pathological liar who is never ashamed to blackmail his opponents by calling them names and insulting them and getting away with everything.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man whose financial and business record with American banks and financial houses across the board were so bad that no American Bank was willing to do business with him because he had swindled them time and again. Republicans nominated and elected a man who had been divorced three times and who has filed for Bankruptcy more than five times and a man who has bluntly refused to submit his tax returns for public scrutiny because he has managed to avoid paying taxes for more than 20 years.\n\nRepublicans nominated and elected a con artist who is not afraid to lie his way out of every problem and a man who has openly tried to undermine NATO and many of the time-honored agreements all of his predecessors in the White House had committed to for more than 70 years.\n\nThey elected a hoodlum who openly colluded or conspired with the KGB while openly casting aspersion on the credibility of the American CIA and FBI. Republicans elected a man who wants to repeat Harry Truman\u2019s mistake by becoming the second American President to deploy or detonate the nuclear bomb, this time on North Korea.\n\nRepublicans have elected a man who openly emulates and praises dictators like Vladimir Putin. He made it clear he would want to be like them if he had his way. Republicans elected a man who tweets in the early hours of the morning and who has used tweeting as an instrument of policies and presidential orders. They elected a man who on Wednesday made good on his promise destroy the last vestiges of the Camp David Accord by unilaterally moving the capital of Israel to divide Jerusalem, thereby stroking the embers of fire and fury in the Middle East. Republicans have elected a man who has made his inexperienced son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the de facto Secretary of State to the United States through the backdoor.\n\nThe list goes on and on without end but Donald Trump is still there despite an abysmal approval opinion of only 33 percent or less. Republicans elected a man who has claimed that his own opinion or decision is all that counts and who has proclaimed most institutions of the fourth estate of the realm as \u201cfake news\u201d disseminators.\n\nHe has pointed accusing fingers at networks like CNN and print media like the highly respected New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, to mention a few.\n\nWhat atrocity, in less than one year in office, has this President not already committed? The list is inexhaustible. The greatest loser in this entire saga has to be the Republican Party and the clear winner has to be Vladimir Putin who now has the American President in his pocket and dictating to him what he must do or not do. Whoever thought that the whole world is going to turn 180 degrees for America and that Donald Trump is on his way to becoming the Mikhail Gorbachev of American Politics right under our eyes, and Americans appear totally helpless and clueless to do something about it.\n\nIt is a complete outrage and totally incredible!\n\nI rest my case.\n\nDr. Wumi Akintide",

          "text": "On August 17, a court in Abuja granted an order to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to freeze bank accounts belonging to four startups, which allow Nigerians to invest in foreign securities, for 180 days.\n\nThe crackdown by the apex bank could result in severe unintended casualties for the companies; but above all, it puts at risk what is arguably their most valuable asset \u2014 customers\u2019 trust.\n\nThe global finance industry is built on the foundation of trust. And in Nigeria, where more than 80 million citizens live below the poverty line, trust is even more paramount. Most Nigerians are likely to be skeptical about storing their hard-earned Naira with a digital-only company for extended periods.\n\nAnd the fintech platforms affected by CBN\u2019s move \u2014 Trove, Risevest, Bamboo, and Chaka \u2014 know this.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBeyond offering financial products with attractive investment returns, the startups have invested in building a customer trust and loyalty bank. This has mostly been through providing consistent financial literacy and transparent communication over the years, primarily via emails and Telegram channels.\n\nEach of the fintech firms has thousands of members in its respective Telegram community \u2014 Risevest (+12,000), Chaka (+5,000), and Trove (+3,000) \u2014 where inquiries and queries are responded to in real-time with opportunities to further educate their users.\n\nNews of the embargo on their bank accounts would ordinarily have sparked a frenzy among customers and it did for a moment. Some users took to social media to express their shock and others made moves to withdraw their funds, exhibiting a natural human instinct to fight or take flight when faced with a crisis or an unexpected situation.\n\nBut the majority of users have held on, helped by their trust in the companies, which quickly communicated the suspension to customers while assuring them their funds were safe.\n\n\u201cI got an email from Risevest before I even read in the news that their accounts were barred. So I was already calm knowing that my money was safe,\u201d Motunrayo Koyejo, a software engineer and Rise Vest user, told TechCabal. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have this much confidence if I didn\u2019t get that email.\u201d\n\nRise Vest\u2019s email to users after the suspension.\n\nWhile the suspension affected four retail trading apps, there is a tendency that such clampdown can result in contagion; a situation where a crisis affecting some companies spreads to other players in the industry.\n\nStephanie Osaji, who uses Cowrywise for savings said after seeing news of the court order, she was \u201cscared, thought about my funds and was wondering what would happen to my money\u201d if the platform suddenly shut down.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I considered withdrawing my money. I remember logging into the app and checking when my next due date for withdrawal was,\u201d Osaji said. \u201cBut then I just told myself that they would figure it out. I mean Nigerian startups almost always have a way of figuring things out.\u201d\n\nAnother Cowrywise user, Mosopefoluwa Okeowo, told TechCabal she thinks fintech startups will always find a solution. \u201cI honestly believe in them totally.\u201d\n\nThis sort of consumer confidence is one that takes years to build. Communicating with customers and stakeholders at the very early stages of a mishap is crucial to reassuring their confidence.\n\nSe the money I have in risevest yh, even if it will go like that we go die there. Thats how much I believe in Eke \u2014 Sani Yusuf (@saniyusuf) August 17, 2021\n\nSem. Sem. Started investing with Eke so long ago. Before he even started coming this way and we had never met until years later.\n\n\n\nRise will survive. https://t.co/a42wEDeVAW \u2014 Gossy (@gossyomega) August 23, 2021\n\nNigerians embracing investment-tech amid economic uncertainty\n\nAfrica\u2019s bustling fintech ecosystem has been increasingly defined by payments specialists and digital banks.\n\nBut a crop of wealth management startups has emerged in recent years, the majority helping Nigerians invest in foreign stocks and assets easier than ever before.\n\nInvesting in reliable financial assets appeals to many millennials in the country who are keen on hedging their future wealth against the unstable Naira, amid broader economic uncertainty.\n\nWith \u20a61,000 (around $2), anyone with a smartphone and internet can register on Chaka and browse through over 11,000 shares publicly listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and stock exchanges in the U.S.\n\nSavings and investment apps also boast superior returns on deposits. Compared to less than 5% interest rates on fixed deposits offered by Nigerian banks, Rise Vest offers a guaranteed 10% annual return on its fixed-income offering.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safer to save money with banks but one gets little or nothing in return,\u201d Koyejo said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an option in this economy. I\u2019d rather keep my money and invest with Rise Vest. I don\u2019t plan to use the money I have invested soon anyway.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

Two years later, the company got into the 2017 Y Combinator\u2019s Winter batch, making it the first company accepted from Morocco. It subsequently raised a $3 million seed round.\n\nWaystoCap expanded its cross-border services to Ivory Coast and Togo, and at some point, was processing over $3 million worth of transactions per quarter. It later pivoted to a model similar to MaxAB\u2019s own, pulling out of Ivory Coast and Togo to focus on growing its network of over 8,000 retailers in Morocco.\n\nThe acquisition will see MaxAB accelerate its expansion into the Maghreb market \u2013 Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia \u2013 empowered by WaystoCap\u2019s expertise in the region.\n\nWaystoCap is the second African YC-backed company to exit over the past year after Paystack got acquired by Stripe for more than $200 million last October.\n\n\u201cWe are about to take the food and grocery industry to another level in North Africa,\u201d Co-Founder and CEO at MaxAB, Belal El-Megharbel, said on the company\u2019s expansion and the synergies with WaystoCap.\n\n\u201cThe creation of this new super-team, combining a powerhouse of talent, technological know-how, on the ground infrastructure, boosted supply chains and WaystoCap\u2019s phenomenal experience of the region is very exciting.\u201d\n\nMaxAB\u2019s acquisition will now see more than 70,000 retailers supplied with essential food and groceries across multiple markets.\n\nNiama El Bassunie, CEO & Founder of WaystoCap who will take on the position of the managing director at MaxAB Morocco added: \u201cWe are thrilled to play a pivotal role in the new all-star team being created and led by experienced, innovative entrepreneurs to establish a regional market leader in food and grocery supply. We are looking forward to continuing our close working relationship with our new team and taking the business to its next phase.\u201d\n\nFor MaxAB, the Maghreb market is a new territory and this new strategic acquisition will position the expanded team to be North Africa\u2019s leading business-to-business eCommerce platform for retailers and suppliers.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has said the Benin River Port project is critical and strategic to Nigeria\u2019s economy, noting that the state government is willing to partner with the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, (NIMASA) to bring the project to reality.\n\nObaseki disclosed this when he hosted the Director General of NIMASA, Dr. Bashir Jamoh, who led other members of the agency\u2019s management team on a courtesy visit to the Government House in Benin City.\n\nHe said Edo State is very unique in its ecology, which spans swamp, rain forest, and savanna planes, noting, \u201cThere is nothing we cannot grow here. With a port here, it is going to be a unique opportunity because it is not going to be moving traffic one way.\n\n\u201cFor us, agricultural activities will be further enhanced with the access this port will provide. The blue economy has always been critical to our growth as a people. I am very glad to inform you that over the last four years, a lot of work has gone on with the project.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWhy is this important to us? The economy of Nigeria must be diversified.\n\nWe don\u2019t have a choice or an option. The global economy is going to be driven by other factors outside the traditional crude oil or the fuel economy that we are used to.\n\n\u201cWe are locating this port in a place that is perhaps Nigeria\u2019s largest and richest onshore gas reserve. You can imagine that this energy exists to drive whatever amount of industrialization that needs to be.\u201d\n\nEarlier, NIMASA DG, Jamoh had stressed that with the rise of alternative energy, countries are seeking green options to fossil fuel, noting that the maritime sector has the potential to grow Nigeria\u2019s revenue base.\n\nJamoh acknowledged that the Benin River Port project is a testament that Edo understands the benefits of shipping and expressed readiness to ensure the state explores the opportunities of the blue economy.\n\nHe noted that the NIMASA was ready to sponsor indigenes of the state to Greece on fully-funded scholarship to study Maritime Science.\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nWarri \u2013 After the the unrest that trailed the Coronation of the 21st Olu of Warri, Ogiame Atuwase Ill, palpable calm indeed has returned to the ancient kingdom.\n\nHowever, expectations from sons and daughters of the kingdom and even neighbors are indeed very high as His Majesty , makes history as the youngest monarch to have ascended the throne of his forebearers.\n\nIn this interview, BETTY IDIALU speaks with Chief Brown Mene, the Ogwaolusan of Warri kingdom, who was also a member of the Olu Advisory Council . Despite his bold profession of his christian faith, he is an encyclopaedia of Itsekiri history, culture and tradition.\n\nHe bares his mind on the build-up of events leading to the Coronation of the 21st Olu.\n\nExcerpts.\n\nChief, much ado about the imbroglio that dogged the pre-olu Coronation era. How did it go and how did you win the battle?\n\nI\u2019ll give some background to enable you understand better. Our system of transition or succession is very simple and straight-forward which is why we have only one ruling house.\n\nThe transition is also from father to son; even though that is not automatic because a father may not have a son; or may have a son who is considered not suitable.\n\nSo, there\u2019s a room to have a pool to draw from aside the immediate children of the immediate past ruler.\n\nTherefore, we have the second-next and the third-next. By the time you get to that, you should be able to have enough to draw from. The responsibilities of the transition to getting to the conclusion is handled by two broad groups. The family, on one hand, and the chiefs, on the other.\n\nThe family has a responsibility to present a candidate, but following the due guidelines and when the candidate is agreed on among themselves, they will present him to the chiefs, this time, represented by seven chiefs: The Ojoye Ojisan, the same as we call The Olu Advisory Council.\n\nThey have a duty to screen the individual including taking him through the Oracle. And this is done not privately, but publicly.\n\nPublicly in the sense that all the seven chiefs will be there, members representing the family that presented him will also be there; and some other observers could be invited to be there. In the event of anyone being rejected, it will be in the full view of everyone. When such person is rejected, the chiefs will tell the family to bring somebody else. The chiefs have no responsibility, duty and privilege to have to jump into the family and pick anybody.\n\nWhat brought about the problem was that we know how long the process should take. For instance in 2015, the demise happened in September 2015, but by December 12, 2015, we had another Olu because it has been followed that way. So, the general people know how long it should take; even though they know what is happening, they would not dare say the king has joined his ancestors because they want it to be proclaimed the proper way. But if you unduly delay it, the people will now start to get restive. And what has prolonged it was that, though the family had played their role in presenting a candidate, the then Ologbotsere and chairman of the group of chiefs to handle this was then acting contrarily. When the date was set for that screening to happen, he would just wake up and leave town. He would leave and nobody knew when he\u2019d come back. This is something that happened in December. By February, March, someone had already been presented to the chiefs, but he refused to take it forward; so people were now becoming restless. And some of us chiefs, who felt whatever they were doing they were doing it on behalf of us the chiefs, so we met at the Council of Chiefs meeting, drew their attention to it, because when we heard a report from them, it dawned that it was only because Ayiri was acting unilaterally all the time and we had to say to them to go back, bearing in mind and recognizing the Ojoye Ojisan is not just one man, but seven of you. We told them to go and work together collectively.\n\nSecondly, we told them \u201cwhere you had reached, carry on from there and give to us chiefs, the timetable on the various steps that had been taken for us to get to the end of the transition.\n\nThat was necessary because there had been too much foot dragging; unfortunately this was not done. Because we met on March 19 and as we were getting to the end of March, this was still not being done. And then, again, Ayiri summoned the family together and unilaterally decided to disqualify the person who was presented. On what ground if you ask him, he will keep saying \u2018edict, edict edict.\u2019 And when you ask him, what in the \u2018edict\u2019 must be met that is not being met, he cannot tell you other than the fact that Ologbotsere has played one role or the other. But forgetting the Ologbotsere is not a unilateral figure. He is only first among equals; he is only chairman of the group and in all our 541 years of monarchy, we have had 20 Olus who had come and gone; and we are in the process of getting the 21st Olu. In all of our history, Ayiri is only \u2018number four\u2019 Ologbotsere; that is to say a lot of the time, we have been carrying on without Ologbotsere; so without him, we can carry on. We, therefore, had to take that position as the Council of Chiefs, passed a \u2018vote of no confidence\u2019 in that group and reconstituted it. And from then, things started moving forward up till the glorious conclusion you saw on Saturday.\n\nGauging the mood of the Itsekiri Nation six days after the event, what are the feedback that you\u2019ve been receiving?\n\nLet me put it this way, because there\u2019s a sense of euphoria that you can derive from the coronation event itself. But you should step backwards to the time when the rest of us chiefs had to take charge and started moving things forward. Excitement has filled everywhere among our people; they were happy and relieved that finally, we are on course. This has been a continuous build-up. By the time we were taking the next step like confirming and concluding the screening process till determining the candidate, there were jubilations. An then, when the announcement was made for the gathering of National Congregation of Itsekiri People where the news would be made, the whole place was jammed and that was on the 15th of April this year. And by the time the Omoba then had to also go to Ijala for another rite, the place was also jammed. This has been the build-up and climax of which you saw on Saturday, 21st of August during the coronation. The ripples of this has reverberated everywhere; we\u2019ve had people calling from USA, UK Germany and other places. Some Itsekiris and those who are not Itsekiris but friends of Itsekiri have called congratulating us. The excitement has been very electric, but we do not want to be carried away with that because we know that expectations are high; when people rejoice this way, it is because of what they know will be coming ahead of us. The meeting we held today was at the instance of His Majesty to look at what\u2019s on ground, where are we going, and what do we need to do.\n\nIt is not just to perpetuate ourselves in pageantry, but it is in terms of our people and our land; their needs, how do we meet them, what do we do to help them? We cannot depend on government to do everything; there are things we can do for ourselves. After all, we were a kingdom long before there ever was Nigeria and we used to look after ourselves. And we also know that in these days, if you cannot help yourself, you don\u2019t expect government to help you. Unfortunately, we also don\u2019t rely on politicians because when they get there, their songs are different from the time when they were campaigning for votes. When they get there after getting their votes, nothing tangible touches people on the ground.\n\nThose are the things we are engaging our attention right now and we are praying we will remain on course; we will not be dissuaded, lose our steam, lose our focus; we will not be diverted and like the king described it this afternoon, this is not a dash, it is a marathon. You don\u2019t expect the full result tomorrow or next week, but we want to be doing the right thing and moving at the right pace.\n\nWas the suspended Ologbotsere matter discuss at the meeting whether to bring him back or has he made any effort so far to reconcile and what is also going on about the missing crowns?\n\nThere are some things that ordinarily if they were well-handled, we wouldn\u2019t have needed to come to the public domain. This is really strictly our own internal business. However, it is unfortunate that he who is wrong, when he fails to be penitent, it becomes difficult even for you to take remedial reconciliating footsteps. That\u2019s what we have in our hands at the moment. Before the coronation, some people led him (Ologbotsere) and a few others to the then Omooba (Olu-designate) and the advice he gave to him personally was \u201cyou have offended the generality of the Itsekiri people. Because you can see the mood of anger, frustration and then the relief had come when remedial steps started to be taken. And people have been saying they don\u2019t want to see you anymore, you need to apologise to the nation. Write and publish an apology to say \u2018you\u2019re sorry,\u2019 the way you acted, you didn\u2019t know this was going to be the result. It has come out of your hands, out of your control and you need to be forgiven. When you do that, tension will come down.\u201d Next, just before the crown and the accessories were stolen, the Olu told him he\u2019s not accusing him of stealing the artifacts, but that he has a network of people he could talk to, to ensure that they were returned. \u201cDo these two things and people\u2019s tension will come down and they will be able to take another look at you.\u201d\n\nHe left the place, thankful at first, but later denied ever being told that. He said he was never told to do that. Even if you were never told to do that and if you have your own senses, should anybody teach you to do that? And if somebody has told you that, should you think about it twice? Worst still to deny ever being told and that was his position. What next did he do? He then went to court to challenge the process because he kept saying that unless he would say with his own mouth that the transition has happened, it has not happened. How can you say that to a people? A generality of whom do not joke with their Olu as an institution; if you touch their Olu, you touch their own core; they will fight you to the end. You know this, how dare you take this kind of stand? He went to court to try and stop the process and, of course, we know that going to court on a matter such as this, the court will also listen to facts and we were very confident that when the facts are laid down, there\u2019s no way he would get his way. And as we expected, the court could not stop the process.\n\nBut they had continued. The other prince, whom he was instigating, and who instigated and is suspected to be involved in the stealing of the crown, because he was here in the palace, when he got missing, the crown also got missing. You now dressed him up like Olu-designate and there was no way he was proclaimed to the nation as the Olu-designate, yet you dressed him up and put him on social media as the Olu-designate saying that you were going to use the missing crown to crown him on the 19th of August. How does this leave room for somebody to be easily forgiven and reconciled? It doesn\u2019t leave room at all. And the generality of people are even saying \u201cdon\u2019t ever bring him near,\u201d and that can be understandable. But if he were penitent, it would have been a different thing, altogether. But unfortunately, up till today, he doesn\u2019t sound penitent; he doesn\u2019t appear penitent; he is not taking any penitent move. Even God will not forgive one who refused to repent, you must repent before you\u2019re forgiven. He who fails to repent can never find forgiveness. I\u2019m praying for him that somehow, God will help him to have a penitent heart to see where he has gone wrong so that he will take the steps that will make people to forgive him.\n\nIsn\u2019t that act of stealing the crown and dressing up the wrong Olu-designate itself sacreligious and could attract penalties?\n\nDressing the prince as Olu-designate is sacrilegious; that\u2019s why we are praying for them. Because when you do this, the way that I put it, you offend Heaven, the Earth and the Nation. You see, That crown was made 1611 A.D, 410 years ago; and it has been in use since then. It was made with the cross of Jesus Christ on top of it. Those things that they have taken, they\u2019re all part of the order of Christ that is associated with the monarchy since then. That someone would have the effrontery to carry it away and intend to use it, we don\u2019t know how or where they\u2019ll handle the burden they are carrying and God will ask them. I know God will ask them that\u2019s why I pray for them that they should repent before it is too late.\n\nHas such sacrilege ever happened before in the history of the kingdom?\n\nNo! Such incident has never been recorded in history. The crown has never gone missing since it was made 410 years ago. In fact, nobody dared touch it except the king himself or the one who is crowning him and that is the only time he can touch it after that, he can\u2019t touch it, again. It\u2019s only the king that can touch it because it is sacred. And for someone to think that this is something he could toy with, what kind of a person is he? What sense of traditional value does he have?\n\nQUESTION: If the missing crowns and other artifacts were to be found and brought back to the palace, will it take some ritual sacrifice to get them restored in their prestine state spiritually?\n\nANSWER: It\u2019s value is not lost so it is not a question of doing something to restore the value. But those who are not supposed to have access to it and to handle it, have a burden; the burden is on them. How they will divest themselves off that, only God knows. And then something that the king said at his first speech on the throne on Saturday; he said what some people had done sacrilegiously, somehow there\u2019s some good from it. Because the first six Olus were crowned with Coral Beads, but from the 17th to the 20th Olu, 16 of them \u2013 were crowned with silver crown. However, this opportunity has made the 21st Olu to be crowned with a golden crown.\n\nQUESTIONS: What\u2019s the symbolic significance attached to this golden crown?\n\nANSWER: The symbolism of it is continue progression. They had thought that they would withhold the progression of the advancement of the Warri Kingdom, but the way things have turned out, it is a progression. In my lifetime, this is the first coronation I have watched; there\u2019s none as glorious as this one!\n\nI have witnessed three, there\u2019s none to be compared to this. CNN has expressed positive opinion about it; even Clarence House, which is the official abode of Prince Charles, in America, the President, they\u2019ve all turned and looked because of the Olu\u2019s address. We didn\u2019t ask for it to be so, but it was so.\n\nQUESTION: Given the king\u2019s young age, do you think he will be able to walk, talk?\n\nI don\u2019t know why you said given his age, because to some extent, his age is an added advantage. So, it shouldn\u2019t be seen as a minus but as a plus. You know, good managers don\u2019t do everything, but they get things done through people. When you recognize the talents that are there to be harnessed, you drive it , encourage it, , and things get done. He doesn\u2019t see himself as a lone ranger; he sees himself as being in the midst of talents that are available and he also sees the opportunity which are down and are around us, he sees the capacity that can be harnessed to bring together so that good can come out of it. That\u2019s what it takes.\n\nThere are criticisms against the maiden speech of the Olu, particularly his Christian worship songs intro which he rendered on an African traditional religious stool; what\u2019s your take on this?\n\nI think that whoever takes that position needs a lot, lot, lot more to learn about life and living and therefore tradition and customs practices. This is why I said so:\n\nThere\u2019s someone who has said years ago that because God created man in His image, there\u2019s something of God that is in everybody; and of course I recognize that from the the Bible as well. That is why some of his practices, you can see semblance of God and Godliness in it. It is also in his culture. But because since from Adam and Eve man has fallen into sin, disobedience against God, there are also other things that come into man in the sense of value that are ungodly. So, you have a mixture of this. Take any human group anywhere and this is what you will find. But for those who are touched by God, and who the before know Him more than the ordinary, they would also identify certain things in cultures that are Godly and promote them. Then, you will also find certain things that are not Godly and you know that it will be better for you to drop those things.\n\nDid you know, for instance, that where I come from they (the Itsekiri people) practised female circumcision? It used to be so. Do you know how long ago it was stopped? Over 400 years ago by an Olu who was a Christian; who said that was out of tune with God\u2019s creation. That it was violence against women and he stopped it. So, many people didn\u2019t know, but all those nationalities who are around us are still struggling to stop it today; but we stopped it long ago.\n\nThere are many things in our culture and tradition that are Christian based; because we were exposed to Christianity long ago. And by the way, Christianity is not a Western religion. It is a worldwide, global religion; because the whole world is for Christ. So, any tradition that will, as it were, see itself as against God is against itself. But a tradition that recognizes the Lord God Almighty and gives due honour to Him is on the way to redemption. Tradition by our own recognition and definition is not put against Godliness; tradition is bringing God to bare upon your tradition, uphold by your tradition the things that God will approve of. So God is therefore in every tradition.\n\nThe first five Olus were not Christians and, of course, they brought in practices which included certain things that are not Christian. But there are also some things that are Christian. In fact, since from the 6th Olu, the 6th Olu was a Christian and it was his son, when he was a crown Prince, who made the crown with the cross in 1611 and he became crowned in 1625. That was the first time they used that crown; his father was not crowned with that crown though he was a Christian.\n\nThere are practices that people will import and do whatever they like and also, as we understand Christainity, God does not force anybody to yield to Him. He will show you his ways and tell you this is the better way to go; if you go, the blessings that are in there, you inherit, but if you refuse to, even though God has warned and you chose another way, He won\u2019t strike down with a hammer; he will leave you to do what you want to. So, there are individuals who have brought different kinds of things into the system. In all of the period we had Christian Olus, there were also some that were mixing it up with all kinds of things that were not really pure. Whatever method that we use to praise God today is not alien to our tradition.\n\nSir, I recall that about a year before the demise of Atuwatse II in 2015, there were protests around the palace over the title \u2018Ogiame.\u2019 We were told the Olu wanted to drop the title \u2018Ogiame\u2019 because of it\u2019s perceived occultic connotations\u2026 What was the true account?\n\nI would not want to comment in details because I was also there. My understanding and which the king actually told everybody based on which those who were tensed up, was that what he was trying to do they did not understand. When God created man, He gave man dominion over all His creation. And Jesus having come, died and resurrected and seated on the right hand of God in heaven and all believers are seated there with Him and that all principalities and powers are under His feet. And by our traditional beliefs and custom, no juju can overtake the Olu. All jujus are under the feet of the Olu and every Itsekiri man and woman knows this. All jujus bow to the Olu. And if for some reason one juju arrests an individual, the Olu can declare such a person loosed and he\u2019ll be loosed and the juju will give way. What he was trying to say then was the misunderstanding, the misinterpretation as if he\u2019s the one to serve the god of the sea, No! But this is what they did not understand. To Ogiame, it means he\u2019s king over the waters, yes God has made us kings over things under the waters whether physical or spiritual. The context in which you accept things matters a lot because that\u2019s the meaning it conveys to you and that\u2019s the meaning that determines your response.\n\nWas that what probably informed his son using his authority as it were to reverse the curse his late grandfather, Olu Erejuwa II placed on the land?\n\nExactly. He has the authority to do so. So, when you call Ogiame, you\u2019re not implying that there\u2019s a bigger juju than him, somewhere.\n\nYou spoke about an Olu that halted the tradition of female circumcision. Are there remaining practices among the Itsekiris that this present Olu may also need to abolish in due time?\n\nWe don\u2019t know yet, but even the way we dress, our full regalia as chiefs, we look like Catholic Cardinals is because of how it derived from Christian culture. Even the way we conduct ancestral worship, which we call \u2018Ebora,\u2019 it is a corruption of the Holy Communion. So, there are many such things that we\u2019ve taken from our Christian background some centuries ago some of which have been distorted, taken out of contest, given a different meaning, but when you get to the Scriptures, you\u2019ll get the proper meaning and align yourself with them.\n\nPhoto of former President Olusegun Obasanjo kneeling before the Olu is still doing the round across the globe. What reactions have the palace got from the gesture?\n\nThe reaction was positive. We\u2019re deeply touched because for one thing he\u2019s not an Itsekiri man but he knows the tradition, he knows the level of that throne. He did that to the institution of the Olu of Warri. And we deeply appreciate him for that.\n\nWhat effect will that have on the entire Itsekiri Nation, I mean what\u2019s the significance?\n\nLike I said, the people were touched deeply. Because for some to do such, even though he didn\u2019t have to, someone who was an ex-president but he did it voluntarily. It\u2019s a positive for him, too as more people will respect him.\n\nWhat\u2019s the role of divine predestination in the enthronement of the current Olu?\n\nYes there are many things which confirmed that to us. There were prophecies that had come before now. And in the course of the process, you could see the hand of God in it for any discerning person.\n\nSuspended Ologbotsere, Ayirimi Emami, once said the current Olu was rejected by the Oracle in 2015, giving that as one of his grouses?\n\nYou see Ayirimi was not telling you what he knew because he was in no position to know what actually transpired. I was in the Olu Advisory Council as of then and he wasn\u2019t. The new Olu was never presented to us as a candidate at all let alone rejecting him. How would you reject somebody who has not been rejected? It is the final candidate the ruling house brings to the chiefs that we work on. And if the chiefs have a reason to reject any candidate, it will objectively done in the clear view of everyone. He was never brought to the fore in 2015 neither was he rejected. We don\u2019t interfere how the family brings up its candidate. The family never brought him then and as chiefs we have no right to ask for any particular candidate to be brought forward.\n\nThis so-called edict aspect of an Olu-designate\u2019s mother must be Itsekiri nor Edo, has it not been distorted and may boomerang in the future by the coming of the present Olu?\n\nDo you know who wrote that? Do you know if it was an edict or a declaration? What\u2019s is written there black and white is \u201cwhose mother is Itsekiri or Edo (not Benin) origin. Do you know any Itsekiri person who knows the story of Itsekiri and will tell you that no iota or trace of Yoruba in Itsekiri origin? None! Those who formed the Itsekiri nationalities include Yoruba groups, Nupe groups, Igala groups, former Dahomey groups, they all came at different times. But when they came, the base they met was first, Yoruba group and they started developing the language which is why you have the difference between Yoruba language and Itsekiri language. Of all the languages in the whole world, the nearest to us is Yoruba. It\u2019s because Yoruba is at the base of the Itsekiri language and nationality. By the time Benin came, the language had already been developed fully which is why in the main body of the Itsekiri language you don\u2019t find Benin in it. It\u2019s only in chieftaincy affairs and royal where you have Edo language and terminologies because the institution was brought from there. And when they came they didn\u2019t come to replicate Edo, the Yoruba group that came didn\u2019t come to replicate Yoruba, just like others. They all came and were assimilated into Itsekiri. And when you talk of Edo origin, you cannot also shove away Yoruba from it.\n\nSo those who wrote it could be considered a superflous since Yoruba is inherent in Itsekiri and also Edo. Why should that be a problem? This thing was first written in 1931 when we were in the process of having the 17th Olu ahead of 1936 and the colonial government needed to have something written down in their name. Every Itsekiri person who knows his worth knows that you cannot isolate Itsekiri from Yoruba and therefore should never be a problem. Why wasn\u2019t it a problem in 1936, 1952, 1987, so why now? It is because people who are mischievous in content and intent wanted to nit-pick that. That\u2019s what happened. It\u2019s a non-issue.\n\nSir, would then say that, from every indication, Ogiame Atuwase III ascension to the throne was God-ordained?\n\nYes! You know, there were many things which confirmed that to us. There were propheies that have come before now. Then, in the course of the process, you could also clearly see the hand of God. Fir any discerning person, you could see clearly that the hand of God is in this!\n\nSir, Chief Ayiri Emami has been hammering on the fact that the present Olu was rejected by the Oracle in 2015. What is then your take on that?\n\nYou see, Ayiri was not telling you what he knew. Because, he was not positioned to know that. I was a member of the Olu Advisory Council as at then, he(Ayiri) was not . And he (Olu) was never presented to us by his family at all. If somebody has not been presented,how would you have rejected the person? He was never! You see, look, can I say this to you? The family had a duty to go through their own internal process. It is the person that the family projects and brings to the chiefs ,that the chiefs will now process. It is only if the chiefs have reason(s) yo disqualify that individual that it would to us not be subjective.\n\nIt would be in the full view of others, including the view of those who bright him. It would be clear to all that the person has been rejected. All the chiefs need do is, you see now , it is not taken . So, go bring somebody else. That never happened in 2015. So, him saying that ; he manufactured that from his head because it never happened that way. Now within the family, they may have whatever way they went about it. We didn\u2019t want to interfere. Whether some of us liked it or not, we had to abide by it. That was what happened. They never brought him(Olu) the first time . As chiefs , we had no duty , no privilege, we have no responsibility to demand that they bring a particular person or particular person be presented. So, we couldn\u2019t do it.\n\n...",

          "text": "Idowu Olakunle, Abeokuta\n\nPresident of the Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, has tasked media practitioners on professionalism and high ethical standard in the discharge of their duties as watchdogs of the society.\n\nHe gave the charge in Abeokuta during a three-day training sponsored by the Pan-African conglomerate, for journalists from across the South-West geo-political zone of the country.\n\nSpeaking through the Senior General Manager, Branding and Communication, Dangote Industries Limited, Mr. Sunday Esan, Dangote said the role of journalists is very critical in the society as both the governed and the government rely solely on media for information to better the society.\n\nTherefore, he said media practitioners could not afford to be less professional and ethical to meet the yearnings of the society, pointing out that was the reason for sponsoring the training, which is aimed at fine-tuning journalists for modern day expectation in view of the evolution of the social media.\n\nMeanwhile case has been made for the journalists of today to cultivate entrepreneurial spirit and skills in the use of new technology in order to remain relevant in the media and communication.\n\nThe Media practitioners were told to always look at the business side of the practice while discharging their duties.\n\nSpeaking one after the other during the training themed \u201cThe Convergence Journalism\u201d organized by Folio Media & Creative Academy, the resource persons stated that though the ethics of the profession of journalism remained sacrosanct, the practitioners must not lose sight of the marketing side of their job.\n\nDr. Victor Ogwezzy, a Communication and Brand management expert, said marketing in the media was everybody\u2019s business without which no media organization would survive.\n\nAccording to him, media practitioners should be mindful of their own personal survival and that of the organizations in which they are working and take marketing seriously.\n\nHe mentioned some newspapers which bothered less about marketing side of the business, but which today are now off newsstand and thus throwing their workers into the unemployment market.\n\nBesides, Dr. Ogwezzy, who is the Chief Responsibility Officer of B2B Matrix Ltd., said journalists also have the responsibility to ensure contents in their newspapers, radio and television are good enough to attract quality readership and audience which will translate to income through advertisement.\n\nHe explained that gone were the days when the business of marketing was left purely for the business development executives in the media organizations, noting that journalists equally have roles to play in marketing.\n\nHe added that some media organizations\u2019 inability to pay their workers could be partly attributed to non-recognition of seriousness and importance of marketing in the media.\n\nAnother speaker, Dr. Jide Johnson, a seasoned media practitioner who is the Director, Special Programmes at the Nigerian Institute of Journalism (NIJ), underscored the importance of the media in the society, saying no one can do without the newspaper, radio, television, phone, data, airtime, which are examples of media.\n\n\u201cImaging waking up in a day and there was no more radio, television, newspaper or internet, it would look as if the world no longer exist,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Dr. Johnson, journalists should be conscious of the huge responsibility put on their shoulders by the Nigerian Constitution, which is holding government accountable for its actions and serving as the voice of the people.\n\nHe said Journalism today thrives much on technology, making a journalist a global correspondent.\n\nHe, however, warned journalists against being too emotionally attached to their present employers but learn to develop their own blogs and upload their works there, which they can later develop into books written by them.\n\nDr. Johnson spoke about the convergence media as a situation where new media platforms have all become major source information so much so that a modern day media practitioner cannot wish them away.\n\nHe explained that media practitioners should see social media as a tool to be deployed for efficiency and effectiveness as doing otherwise will impact negatively on the journalists\u2019 job.\n\nConcluding the training session was Mr. Lekan Otufodunrin, a former Managing Editor and a Media Career Development Specialist who stressed the importance of new media in journalism work and the need for all practitioners to rise to the occasion.\n\nHe regretted that some media practitioners still delude themselves by thinking they are gate keepers, arguing rhetorically that social media had since dismantled that gate and the access to information had been wide open.\n\n\u201cWithout using social media functionally, some of us will soon be irrelevant in the media profession. With social media, some of us can be bigger brands than the companies we work for. There is more to social media than social, its a professional tool for the new age journalist,\u201d he declared.\n\nMr. Otufodunrin told the participants that using social media is not an option for modern day journalists or media professionals, as it can make or mar the progress they can make in the profession, noting that publishing online without using social media will not give maximum reach for content.\n\n\u201cThere is more to social media than sharing your content, you need to engage with content of others. Social media platforms are now one of the major sources of information we need as journalists. Replacing press statements; It is complimentary; It is liberating; It makes us a global brand and It enhances our reach,\u201d he said",

          "text": "First Bank of Nigeria Limited has announced its sponsorship of \u2018A Deep Dive Into History\u2019, a theatre production from the Duke of Shomolu (DOS) Production House, spearheaded by Joseph Edgar.\n\nA deep dive into history comprises two exciting stage plays \u2013 Aremu and Awo, showing from the 22nd of August and will run every Sunday till the 12th of September 2021 at the legendary Glover Memorial Hall, Marina, Lagos.\n\nAremu is a powerful depiction of the life and times of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo GCFR. The play takes us through his birth, the errant stages of his adulthood, exploring his peasant background, his travails as a freedom and human rights crusader and other milestones. Aremu is a rich cultural play that preaches hope to the audience, that they can be whoever they want to be. The play was written by Prof. Ahmed Yerima, the former DG of the National theatre and National Troupe.\n\nAwo on the other hand is a play that seeks to reintroduce the dying values of loyalty, integrity, vision building amongst others to the modern-day audience who seem to have lost their way in the fast and seedy lifestyle of modern-day Nigeria. This play is set to be directed by Mr. Makinde Adeniran FTA \u2013 Lagos State Chairman of the National Association of Nigerian Theatre Practitioners and is bringing 26 years of local and international experience to the play.\n\nWith the sponsorship of similar socio-cultural plays in the creative arts industry such as Ayinla, Moremi, Makaliki, Duke of Shomolu Production\u2019s Play (Emotan and Oba Esugbayi), October 1st (a movie) and the Calabar Festival, FirstBank\u2019s sponsorship of \u2018Duke of Shomolu Productions\u2019 affirms the bank\u2019s continued support for the development of arts in Nigeria under its [email protected] initiative.\n\n[email protected] is FirstBank\u2019s platform for consolidating all its efforts in the arts, supporting the entire value chain of the creative arts, providing much-needed financing and advisory support, showcasing and facilitating the successes of the industry, and enabling customers to explore and access the wealth of opportunities the creative industry has to offer.\n\nAchieving these and a host of many others have been implemented through strategic partnerships with organisations like the British Council, Live Theatre Lagos, Freedom Park, Terra Kulture, and the Cross Rivers State Government (Calabar Festival), among others.\n\nExpressing her delight on the plays, Folake Ani-Mumuney, GH, Marketing & Corporate Communications, First Bank of Nigeria Limited said, \u201cFor over 127 years, FirstBank has been at the forefront of nation-building; enabling Nigeria and Nigerians through resourceful partnerships to build the Nigerian creative industry value chain, especially the arts and entertainment sub-sectors. We remain proud of this sponsorship that creates an excellent platform to showcase Nigeria to the world as being part of a collective goal to continually keep dreams and hope alive; holding strong to our commitment to reignite cultural heritage.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt, the theatre remains part of the creative and entertainment industry value-chain across the globe and indeed a powerful channel to drive our heritage and culture, which resonates with our legacy of being woven into the fabric of society.\u201d\n\nThe Duke of Shomolu Productions is a positive disruptive force that has been designed to aggressively push the agenda of \u201ctelling stories through performances\u201d. In the last three years, the platform has engineered and fostered on Nigerian theatre audiences, some of the most eponymous works attracting over 50,000 people, attending their productions. The DOS production is a leading brand in the Performing Arts sector in Nigeria and was established in 2018.\n\nAccording to research disclosed in PWC\u2019s recent Entertainment & Media Outlook report, Nigeria\u2019s entertainment market is expected to rise from $4.46 billion in 2018 to a $10.5 billion market by the end of 2023. In addition, with this initiative and other sponsored events, FirstBank is committed to strengthening its contribution to the development of the entertainment industry in the country.",

          "text": "The Edo state COVID-19 Task Force Monday said the state has recorded seven deaths from COVID-19-related pandemic.\n\nLeader of the team, Dr. Ebomwoyi Osagie, who disclosed this to journalists in Benin City, said the dead persons were not vaccinated against the virus.\n\nThe development is generating some level of anxiety among residents of the state, particularly those who are yet to present themselves forward for vaccination.\n\nJust recently, Governor Godwin Obaseki said there won\u2019t be a gathering of religious worshippers if the people refused to get vaccinated.\n\n\u201cBeginning from the second week of September 2021, large gatherings, as well as high traffic public and private places will only be accessed by persons who have proof of taking at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccination. People who have not yet been vaccinated at all will depend on remote access to these gatherings.\n\n\u201cFrom the second week of September people may not be allowed to worship in churches and mosques without showing proof of their vaccination cards at the gates,\u201d the governor had said.\n\nSpeaking on the deaths occasioned by non-vaccination, the team leader, Dr Osagie said there was need for the people to ensure compliance with all COVID-19 protocols.\n\nHe decried community transmission of the virus and urged the people to adhere to the COVID-19 protocols of wearing face mask, washing of hands and use of sanitizer amongst others.\n\n\u201cThe deaths recorded so far are unvaccinated persons. If they had been vaccinated they may have survived.\n\n\u201cWe have collected 1,624 samples in this third wave, out of which 228 are positive cases, 19 recoveries and seven deaths representing 15. 9 percent.\n\n\u201cWe have Modenna and Astrazenecca vaccines for residents. The measure taken by government was to ensure safety of the people,\u201d he stated.\n\nJournalist dies in C/River\n\nIn a related development, the first Cross River state journalist to take the AstraZeneca vaccine, Edem Edem of Daily Post, has died.\n\nHis wife, Mammy Edem, confirmed that her husband died, Wednesday, August 18, 2021.\n\nThe 60-year-old Edem hailed from Eto-Mkpe (Inameti Yellow Duke House) in Akpabuyo local government area of the state.\n\nHe had gone for the COVID-19 AstraZenneca vaccine March this year shortly after being discharged from the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital (UCTH) where he spent few weeks for an undisclosed ailment.\n\nSpeaking while taking the jab, Edem had said \u201cI became the first frontline journalist to take the vaccine in Calabar and there is nothing to be afraid of \u2013 people should come out and take the vaccine to become immunized.\n\n\u201cAs a journalist, I am a frontline worker. I pursue stories about people infected with COVID-19 who are in quarantine centres, hospitals and other areas of confinement \u2013 hoping and praying that I don\u2019t contract it myself.\u201d\n\nHowever, the journalist, who had put in more than 25 years in the profession became very ill again two months ago and was rushed to the UCTH for the second time over what was, this time, suspected to be kidney-related.\n\nBut this time around, his condition could not be managed even as the immediate cause of his death could not be ascertained as at press time.\n\nA cross section of those who spoke to Blueprint bemoaned Edem\u2019s departure.\n\nWhile many believed he may have died of kidney problem, others feared the vaccines may have contributed in worsening his existing health challenges.\n\nEdem was the Financial Secretary of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) Cross River state Council.\n\nKano\n\nMeanwhile, the Kano state Ministry of Education has extended the resumption date for all public/private primary and secondary schools in the state by one week.\n\nCommissioner for Education Malam Muhammad Sanusi Sa\u2019id Kiru said the one-week extension was aimed at normalising the state\u2019s academic calendar after series of disruptions resulting from the effect of the COVID- 19 pandemic.\n\nThis was contained in a statement issued Monday by the ministry\u2019s spokesperson, Malam Aliyu Yusuf.\n\n\u201cAll students of boarding schools are to resume on Sunday, the 12th of September, 2021 as against 5th September, while the Day Schools students are to resume on Monday, 13th of September, 2021 as against 6th September earlier announced,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe commissioner expressed appreciation to parents/guardians for the support accorded the ministry, hoping that the tempo would be sustained.\n\nThe statement urged parents and guardians to ensure their wards resume school at the stipulated dates.",

          "text": "Amidst scathing criticisms trailing Nigeria\u2019s rising debt profile, the federal government Monday explained it was borrowing \u201csensibly and responsibly\u201d because the borrowed fund would be expended on proceeds-yielding infrastructure.\n\nAvailable data from the country\u2019s Debt Management Office (DMO) reveals a debt profile of N33.107 trillion as at March 2021, a development that has consistently come under criticism from some stakeholders.\n\nContrary to the position of the critics, Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Hajiya Zainab Ahmed explained that the loans were targeted at critical infrastructure that would generate employment.\n\nShe spoke at a media parley in Abuja.\n\nAt the briefing were Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed, Minister of Budget and National Planning Clem Agba and the newly appointed Statistician-General, Dr Simon Harry.\n\nThe media briefing was to provide some insights into the recent development around the nation\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) which grew by 5.0% (year-on-year) as announced by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) for Q2 2021.\n\nAsked whether government\u2019s continued borrowing would not impact negatively on the economic growth recorded so far, the minister said the loans were targeted at critical infrastructure that would on their own yield proceeds for the country.\n\n\u201cWe are borrowing sensibly and responsibly to invest on critical infrastructures. These investments will make returns in future,\u201d the News Agency of Nigeria quoted the minister as saying.\n\nSpeaking further, Hajiya Ahmed said: \u201cWe are borrowing with a very close consideration to the sustainability of the borrowing. The borrowing level for Nigeria today is still 23 percent of the GDP.\n\n\u201cI have said it several times that the problem we have in Nigeria is that of revenue, and when you look at the country that are within the peer group with Nigeria, there are some that had 50 per cent growth that are now at about 70 per cent growth.\n\n\u201cWe are at 53 despite the escalated borrowing we had to deal with in 2020; also in 2021, to get a good grip on the economic situation that was occasioned by COVID-19 pandemic and in our case, due to the crash in crude oil price.\n\n\u201cWe are borrowing sensibly; we are also borrowing to invest in critical infrastructure like power, water, roads and rails which are investments that are required to enhance business productivity in the country today.\n\n\u201cThese businesses will grow, they will not only pay taxes, they will also employ people. If we don\u2019t do this, we will regress even from where we are today. It is a necessary investment so we are borrowing responsibly.\n\n\u201cWe are making sure what we are borrowing is applying to major infrastructure that will return revenue in the near future.\u201d\n\nOn the 2021 budget deficit, the minister said: \u201cWe have an approval in the 2021 budget to fund the budget deficit 50 per cent locally and 50 per cent externally. The 50 per cent external borrowing is 6.1 billion Euros; we are planning to use about half of that from Eurobonds and the other half using other windows such as multilateral and bilateral sources.\u201d\n\nSecurity slows down GDP\n\nThe minister further said the nation\u2019s GDP would have posted more impressive performance but for the increasing security challenge.\n\nDrawing some level of comparison, the minister said: \u201cThe 2021 second-quarter growth reflects better economic performance compared to the same quarter last year. The same quarter last year we had negative growth of -6.10 per cent. It is also better than the first quarter of 2021,\u201d Mrs. Ahmed told journalists at a press briefing where she reviewed the latest results from the NBS.\n\n\u201cThe service sector recorded a strong performance, growing by 9.27 per cent this reporting quarter \u2013 representing the fastest growth in this sector since 2010.\n\n\u201cThe second-quarter growth of 2021 would have been much stronger than the 5.01 percent, but for agriculture, that recorded a slightly lower growth. A number of bottlenecks within the system, including insecurity, negatively affected the sector. Also, the industrial sector slowed down to -1.3 percent.\u201d\n\nCAN assures on economy\n\nAlso speaking on the nation\u2019s economy, President Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Dr Supo Ayokunle assured that the nation\u2019s economy would bounce back in no distant time.\n\nDr Ayokunle stated this Sunday evening while speaking at the flag-off of the eight-day 39th Annual Holy Ghost Convention of the Sword of the Spirit Ministries Ibadan themed; \u2018Abundant Rain,\u2019 held at the PCU campus, Garden of Victory, Ibadan, Oyo state capital.\n\nHe said the Lord would fight the \u201cbeast of bandits, of Boko Haram, religious terrorists, kidnappers, and other criminals operating in Nigeria and cause them to be wiped away\u201d\n\nAyokunle also said \u201cviolence will become a thing of the past in Nigeria, and all Nigerians, from the youngest to the oldest, shall dwell in safety in Jesus name.\u201d\n\n\u201cI prophesy into you Nigeria and Nigerians that our economy is going to bounce back and Nigeria will flourish, Nigerians will flourish and people in the Diaspora will rush back home and possess their possessions. Nigerians, henceforth, you will not be fugitives anywhere, anymore\u201d, he said.\n\nThe CAN leader further stated that \u201cthe name Nigeria shall be respected everywhere. The lost glory shall be restored in full. Nigeria is not going to become Afghanistan; no Taliban is going to take over here. We tear every false prophecy apart, concerning Nigeria in Jesus name, Amen.\n\n\u201cI stand in the place of Ezekiel and I prophesy to Nigeria and Nigerians that there shall henceforth be showers of rain upon you. And the showers will bring freshness to the body. Let there be peace in Nigeria. The Lord will fight the beast of bandits, of Boko Haram, religious terrorists, kidnappers, and other criminals operating in Nigeria and caused them to be wiped away in Jesus name.\u201d\n\nAlso in his remarks, President Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) Bishop Wale Oke noted that corruption, insecurity and economic hardship had taken their toll on the existence of Nigeria and its people.\n\nQuoting from the Book of 1kings 18:1, Oke, who is the presiding Bishop of The Sword of the Spirit Ministries Ibadan, said \u201cthis is the situation of Nigeria presently. There\u2019s drought because of iniquity in the land. But when rain comes, it takes care of the negative. It ushers in the positive; the weather is cold, the grass is green and there\u2019s fruitfulness. The positive begins to break forth, leading to the abundance of everything that\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nThe PFN leader then prayed for an end to the problems currently affecting the nation, saying; \u201d we terminate corruption in Nigeria, we terminate Boko Haram insurgents; we terminate kidnapping and all manner of crimes in the land. There shall be peace in Nigeria.\u201d",

          "text": "Both the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, and the major opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, have been enmeshed in some form of worrisome leadership crises from time immemorial.\n\nOften, at the base of these crises is the monstrous problem of lack of internal democracy, absence of political ideology, promotion of individual egocentrism above collective interests buoyed by over-monetization of the democratic process.\n\nYet, these are the two prominent political parties that are being looked up to and expected to drive the wheels of Nigeria\u2019s democratic advancements by entrenching the culture of good democratic principles and values anchored on rule of law and internal democracy.\n\nThe two political parties have, however, certainly not lived by example and have not shown any semblance of institutions ready to shoulder the responsibility of being the bastion of democracy advancements in Nigeria.\n\nIn the opposition PDP for instance, the last few days and weeks have witnessed a dramatic characterization of a political lunatic of the highest order as the party\u2019s leadership lowered their guards and fought with least regards to the rule of law.\n\nLast week for the PDP saw court orders flying left and right as a Rivers State court in Degema, on Monday Barred Prince Uche Secondus from parading himself as a member or National Chairman of PDP.\n\nThe court reportedly gave the order while ruling in a suit brought before it by one Ibeawuchi Alex and three others \u2013 Dennis Amadi, Emmanuel Stephen, and Umeziriki Onucha.\n\nBut by Thursday, Secondus resumed in his office parading a counter order from a Birnin kebbi court reinstating him as the National Chairman of the party.\n\nMonday\u2019s court order appeared to be the height of a crisis that has been brewing within the party which has been hit by a gale of defections of governors elected on its platform to the APC in the past few months.\n\nGovernors David Umahi of Ebonyi State, Ben Ayade of Cross River, and Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State defected to the ruling APC in the last 10 months.\n\nAbout a month later, seven members of the National Working Committee (NWC) resigned, citing Mr. Secondus\u2019 leadership style.\n\nSome support groups within the party also recently called for Mr. Secondus\u2019 ouster. The groups under the aegis of Save PDP Group and Coalition of PDP Youth Groups made the call during a protest at the party\u2019s national secretariat in Abuja.\n\nThe leader of the groups, Tamunotonye Inioribo, while addressing the media, said the protest was organized by a coalition of different PDP support groups, that were dissatisfied with the leadership of Mr. Secondus.\n\nMr. Secondus, who has defiantly said he would not resign, held a meeting behind closed doors with former President Olusegun Obasanjo, amid efforts by various organs of the party to save the worsening situation.\n\nThe embattled chairman, who is fighting hard to retain his position, has been given the option of organizing a convention in October, instead, he had insisted on completing his tenure.\n\nSecondus was elected at the December 2017 national convention of the PDP held at the Eagle Square in Abuja, along with other NWC members, and his tenure of four years is supposed to end in December 2021.\n\nThe BoT and PDP Governors Forum had previously met separately to intervene in the crisis, especially after the resignation of seven members of the NWC.\n\nThe development came despite earlier efforts by stakeholders to resolve the leadership crisis that has rocked the party in the last few months.\n\nThe crisis had led to calls for the resignation of Secondus from different quarters.\n\nAs a way to pacify those calling for the chairman\u2019s resignation, the PDP Governors Forum and the party\u2019s Board of Trustees had recently met in Abuja, where they reached a resolution to bring forward the national convention of the party to October instead of December when the tenure of the Secondus-led National Working Committee (NWC) would expire.\n\nThis made the party on Wednesday adopt its Deputy National Chairman (South), Elder Yemi Akinwonmi, as acting Chairman.\n\nHowever, Prince Uche Secondus on Friday resumed office following an order from another court of coordinate jurisdiction in Kebbi on Thursday that reinstated him as the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Secondus resumed ahead of the party\u2019s Board of Trustees (BoT) extended meeting scheduled for 10 a.m.\n\nBased on the order of the Kebbi court, Secondus stormed the PDP headquarters in Abuja on Friday, insisting that he was the authentic chairman of the party.\n\nHowever, he was prevented from attending a stakeholders\u2019 meeting presided over by Elder Yemi Akinwonmi, Deputy Chairman (South).\n\nThe PDP had named Akinwonmi acting chairman after the court suspended Secondus.\n\nBut on Friday, Secondus told journalists that he was still in charge of the party since another court had overturned his suspension.\n\nOn Friday, another court in Calabar, Cross River State, restrained Secondus from presiding over the NEC meeting of the party, which is ongoing\n\nJustice Edem Kufre gave the order based on an application brought by a member of the party, Enang Wani.\n\nHowever, on Saturday, Secondus wrote to Akinwonmi, asking him to take charge of the meeting.\n\n\u201cI hereby request you to preside over the National Executive Committee meeting of the Party, taking place today, 28th August, [email protected] 12 noon, in my absence. Thank you,\u201d the letter read.\n\nAs for the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, the constitution and choice of Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni, as the chairman of APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, CECPC, has been a major source of dispute and legal contestations within the party.\n\nFollowing a protracted leadership crisis that almost tore the party into pieces, the National Executive Committee, NEC, presided by President Muhammadu Buhari, on June 25, 2020, dissolved the National Working Committee, NWC, led by its embattled erstwhile national chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomole and appointed a 13-man caretaker committee headed by Mai Mala Buni to oversee the affairs of the party with the mandate of reconciling aggrieved members and conducting an extraordinary elective convention to elect fresh substantive leaders of the party within the timeframe of six months.\n\nIntriguingly, the Buni-led committee, by employing some sardonic delay tactics, has refused to convene the party\u2019s convention as mandated within its stipulated six-months timeframe but has rather perpetuated itself in office for over 14 months and counting.\n\nThis prompted some aggrieved members numbering one hundred to approach a federal high court sitting in Abuja to seek the dissolution of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Co\u00f1vention Planning Committee, CECPC, headed by Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni.\n\nThe plaintiffs, through their lawyer, Barr. Samuel E. Irabor, asked the court to declare the 13-man caretaker committee illegal and to nullify all activities so far presided over by it including the recently conducted ward congresses.\n\nThey contended that the committee falls short of the statutorily required 24 members that must be spread across not less than two-thirds of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\n\nIn the suit marked, FHC/ABJ/CS/938/2021, the plaintiffs added that the headship of the caretaker committee by a sitting governor holding dual executive offices is prohibited by Section 183 of the Nigerian constitution and Article 17(4) of the APC constitution.\n\nIt is also the contention of the plaintiffs that Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General, Abubakar Malami, lacked the legal backing to administer an oath of office to Mr. Buni as caretaker chairman of the party.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that only the National Working Committee of the party could constitute a Caretaker Committee as provided under Article 13(4)(xvi) of the APC Constitution.\n\nListed as a co-defendant in the originating summon registered as Suit No: FHC/ABJ/CS/938/2021, are the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and others.\n\nThe row over the status of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has for a while threatened the fragile peace within the ruling party.\n\nWhile disgruntled factions of the APC hold that there is a flaw in having Governor Mai Mala Buni remain as Chairman of the CECPC, others argue that there is no constitutional breach in having a serving governor lead the party at the moment.\n\nIn a recent communique aimed at making clear its position on the controversy over the legality of the CECPC and that of its chairman, the APC stated that \u201con both issues, we will state the position and decision of the Supreme Court only. The decision here is the majority judgment of the Supreme Court which is now the Law.\n\n\u201cThe decision and judgment were read and concurred to by the justices who were in the majority. Any other statements in their various additional contributions by the justices complement the lead judgment.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore right to say that the issues and ratio in the lead judgment reflect the views of the majority. The minority judgment, although important as it is, is not the judgment of the court.\u201d\n\nThe statement further notes that the Supreme Court in its judgment affirmed the legality of the CECPC, adding: \u201cthe court stated that the NEC under Article 13 (3) IV of the APC constitution has the power to create, elect and appoint a committee and endow it with powers and functions. It drew a parallel with Article 33(3) of the PDP constitution (2012) with similar powers granted to its National Convention which in turn appointed a National Caretaker in 2016, which the Supreme Court ruled legal in Sheriff VS PDP.\n\n\u201cOn the status of the Acting National Chairman, His Excellency, Mai Mala Buni, the Supreme Court held that he was appointed only in an acting capacity, on a temporary basis to carry out and fill in the seat of the National Chairman, pending the election of new officers.\n\n\u201cThe Apex Court also held that Mai Mala Buni\u2019s position as Acting Chairman of the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee is not contrary to the provision of Section 183 of the CFRN because the appointment, ad-hoc, is on a temporary basis which is not akin to Executive office or paid employment as envisaged by Section 183 of the CFRN.\u201d\n\nThe latest court suit came barely three weeks after a minority judgment of the Supreme court which questioned the eligibility of Mai Mala Buni, as the CECPC chairman triggered a flurry of legal opinions, interpretations as well as implications of the judgment on the fortune of the ruling party in future elections.\n\nThese ugly developments are part of what made the former Chairman of the Independent Electoral Commission of Nigeria (INEC), Professor Attahiru Muhammad Jega, to submit that both APC and PDP have failed Nigerians.\n\nProf. Attahiru Jega, former Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), in a BBC Hausa Service interview on August 2, 2021, submitted that \u2018the two big parties had failed to engender good governance and development in the country.\u2019 Consequently, he called on Nigerians not to \u2018give their trust to the parties again.\u2019\n\nJega went ahead to call on Nigerians not to vote for the All Progressives Congress ( APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party( PDP) in the next election coming up in 2023.\n\nThis is because he alleged the two major political parties in the country were like Siamese twins of Corruption.\n\nThus, the former INEC boss said it was high time Nigerians look for a credible alternative.\n\nSpeaking in a BBC Hausa program on Monday, Jega a professor of political science noted, \u2018Nigerians should dump the two parties because of their bad antecedents over the last 20 years.\n\nHe stressed,\u2019 Looking at their inability to change the economic fortunes of Nigeria for 20 years now, it is now apparently clear that they would not do anything even if Nigerians vote for any of the two parties again,\u201d he alleged.\n\n\u2018 The bad things these parties have committed in those past years, Nigerians should never give their trust to the parties again. It is now very clear that these parties would never change, even if they are given another chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe APC and PDP have formed governments, we were all witnesses. They did not come with a good intention to make amends. If you look at the fight against corruption, all these corrupt people that were supposed to be prosecuted, sneaked into the APC.\u201d\n\nHe also alleged that those in the major political parties have destroyed everything and had made the parties so stigmatized that whichever good person joins the parties would be considered like them.\n\n\u201d Since 1979 I\u2019ve been teaching in the university, for 40 years now. So, from what I read and observed, when I was Chairman of INEC, honestly the way I see our politicians conducting elections and from the manner, they represent their people when elected, honestly, it is something to be afraid of,\u201d he said.\n\nBut in one of his academic papers titled \u201cNigerian Politics and Fallacy of PDP \u2013 APC Semblance (Part one)\u201d, the Director-General of Progressive Governors Forum, PGF, an umbrella body for governors elected under the platform of APC , Dr. Salihu Moh. Lukman argued that c oming from Prof. Jega, the claim that both the PDP and APC are the same and had failed Nigerians should not be taken lightly.\n\nHe contended that Prof. Jega wasn\u2019t just the former Chairman of INEC. He is a respected political scientist internationally. He is both a theoretician and practitioner whose commitment to Nigeria\u2019s development cannot be faulted. He grew through the ranks of radical activism to become the leader, both intellectually and in the practical field of politics, and was able to inspire and influence the emergence of generations of both activists and leaders in the country. As Chairman of INEC, it cannot be disputed that he successfully led the reform of electoral management in the country.\n\nThe APC Chieftain however faulted Jega for failing to provide facts to show that both APC and opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, have failed Nigerians.",

          "title": "Experts put Nigeria\u2019s infrastructure gap at $3trn -NigPilot",
          "text": "Research experts have estimated Nigeria\u2019s infrastructure gap at $3 trillion, about six times the size of its annual Gross Domestic Product, GDP.\n\nSpeaking during a virtual meeting on the institutionalization of R&D in Infrastructure Development thematic group of the TETFund Research and Development Standing Committee, RDSC , they stressed the importance of infrastructural development to economic growth.\n\nA lecturer at Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Prof Muhammed Usman, in a presentation, said between 2009 and 2013, Nigeria invested a paltry $664 per capita per anum in infrastructure, representing 3 percent of its GDP, compared with an average investment of $3.060, or 5 percent of GDP in developed countries.\n\nUsman noted that this has widened the country\u2019s infrastructure gap and has been a major impediment to\n\neconomic growth.\n\nHe noted that this \u201cposes a major funding challenge in the face of the current fiscal imbalances. Besides, the country is currently grappling with the hydra-headed problems of\n\ninflation (17.33%), unemployment (33.3%), and rising debt.\u201d\n\n\u201cInfrastructural development plays a pivotal role in enhancing economic growth, improving\n\nliving standards, reducing poverty, and contributing to environmental sustainability.\u201d\n\nHe said with the rapid growth of the country\u2019s population, the demand for infrastructure is outpacing its supply, adding that the country\u2019s weak infrastructures were exposed in the wake of the global pandemic in 2020.\n\nEarlier, the Chief Executive Officer, CEO, of Nigeria Economic Summit Group, NESG, Mr. Laoye Jaiyeola, who chaired the meeting, noted that infrastructure is a major hindrance to the country\u2019s competitive development.\n\nJaiyeola said one of the challenges facing the private sector was infrastructure, adding that the country needs funds annually to finance infrastructure if it must get out of the rocks.\n\n\u201cI have been involved in a lot of surveys that look at the competitiveness of nations, and each time we look at our ranking around where we are in the world competitiveness index of doing business, one thing that stands out is the poor level of our infrastructure and the extent to which it has hindered us from significant development locally.\n\n\u201cSo this thematic group comes in at a time when all of us are looking at how can we ensure that we do significant backward integration; how can we ensure that we make the environment very competitive enough that not only do we meet the needs of our people locally, but good enough for the outside market that we can export.\n\n\u201cNigeria has been a nation where we are still at a very primary level of industrialization; by this I mean we have an abundant resource of crude oil but we spend a significant amount of money importing fuel.\n\n\u201cAnd so we can\u2019t use this crude oil to get all the assorted benefits we have yet we export our raw materials in terms of cocoa and yet bring back coffee and chocolate to the country. Or export our hides and skin, and yet bring back leather to the country,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking, the Executive Secretary of TETFund Prof Suleiman Bogoro, said the fund was reviewing a report of the draft executive bill on the establishment of the National Research and Development Foundation, NRDF, earlier received from the RDSC.\n\nBogoro said he is in contact with the leadership of RDSC and other relevant stakeholders for the purpose of offering informed advice on the final document that will leave his desk, and proceed to the ministry of education, for it to be considered as a document worthy of being taken to the federal executive council.\n\n\u201cI am excited, particularly listening to the cross-cutting issues. If there is an area that has cross-cutting imperatives, across the other sectors, is infrastructure.\n\n\u201cI wonder if there is any aspect of the routine life around the economy, technology and in all human activities or livelihood in its entirety that does not require infrastructure.\n\nThat underlines the importance of this subcommittee,\u201d he said.\n\nThe TETFund boss commended the committee for traveling around the country to come up with \u201cthe information that reminds us of the gaps to, indeed, tell us what we need to do to close the gap between Nigeria and the more advanced nations.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on TETFund\u2019s interventions, he said \u201cWe have raised our interest to the level of knowing the microscopic application of our funds that have an impact on the key areas of not just the Tertiary institutions. That we are directly funding but the ancillary partners, including research institutes, the industry, the larger picture of Nigeria in the biggest of context.\u201d\n\nBogoro said for too long tertiary Institutions in the country operated as if they can survive alone, adding that the walls have to be collapsed to ensure that the institutions synergize and get assistance from those in the industry.\n\nHe expressed gratitude to the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, for proceeding to identify the institutionalisation of NRDF as part of its negotiations with the Federal Government.\n\nSpeaking on the quality of TETFund projects, he said exactly five years ago, the Nigeria Society of Engineers picked TETFund as exemplary in terms of the quality of its projects.\n\nHe disclosed that the Board of Trustees has decided that 90 percent of TETFund scholars will be in the sciences, adding however that TETFund will not suggest topics for the doctorial thesis of scholars abroad.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chairman of RDSC, Prof Njidda Gadzama, who stressed the importance of infrastructure, said whatever is done in terms of development cannot be successful without infrastructure.\n\nGadzama said if the country had sustained the Petroleum Trust Fund, PTF, intervention initiated during the military era, the country would have gone far in terms of its infrastructure.",

This is even more compelling having regard to an earlier NJC warning to judicial officers on the need to be circumspect in grating exparte applications.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
