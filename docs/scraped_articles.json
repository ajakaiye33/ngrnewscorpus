          "text": "The Academic Staff Union of Universities has said it would compile a list of errant lecturers who have continued to attend to the academic needs of students despite the ongoing industrial action by the union.\n\nThe union also threatened to sanction the lecturers found culpable.\n\nThe National President of the union, Professor Emmanuel Osodeke, disclosed this in an interview with our correspondent in Abuja.\n\nSaturday PUNCH reports that ASUU had on Monday, February 14, 2022 announced a four-week total and comprehensive warning strike following the inability of the union and the Federal Government to reach a common ground on the demands of university lecturers.\n\nSome of ASUU\u2019s demands include the release of revitalization funds for universities, renegotiation of the 2009 FGN/ASUU agreement, release of earned allowances for university lecturers, deployment of the UTAS payment platform for the payment of salaries and allowances of university lecturers.\n\nFollowing the expiration of the initial four weeks of the warning strike, the union had gone ahead to declare another eight weeks saying that it was giving the government more time to attend to its needs.\n\nBut findings by our correspondents had revealed that some lecturers in some federal universities were attending to students despite the declaration of the industrial action.\n\nIn an interview with our correspondent, Osodeke noted that the union was aware of some erring lecturers and that the union would sanction them.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that some lecturers are attending to students despite the fact that the national body declared a strike. In a union where you have over 15,000 members, it is only normal that you will have some members who will go against the laid down rules.\n\n\u201cWe are taking note of the said lecturers. We are compiling our list and they will be sanctioned at the end of the strike,\u201d he said.\n\nSSANIP threatens to shut down polytechnics next month\n\nMeanwhile, the Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Polytechnics on Friday threatened to paralyse academic activities in the polytechnics if the government failed to fulfill the promises made to them.\n\nThis is coming a few days after the Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics issued a one-month ultimatum to the government for resumption of its strike action.\n\nSSANIP in a letter dated April 1, 2022, signed by its National Secretary, Hussaini Gwandu, and addressed to the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, wondered why the Federal Government would sign an agreement it had no intention of fulfilling.\n\nThe letter, a copy of which was obtained by Saturday PUNCH, listed among others, the non-release of their schemes of service, non-release of their approved N15bn for infrastructural development and inadequate funding of the polytechnics as part of the demands the FG had yet to meet.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\nBy Juliet Umeh\n\nTo reverse the issue of brain drain to brain gain in Nigeria, the Commissioner for Health in Lagos State, Dr. Akin Abayomi, has called for more standard private facilities like Evercare Hospital in Nigeria.\n\nThe Commissioner made the appeal in Lagos on an occasion to mark one year anniversary of the facility.\n\nWhile congratulating the management and staff of the hospital, Abayomi said: \u201cEvery Nigerian abroad wants to come home and with a place like Evercare that is creating opportunities for specialists, doctors, nurses, paramedics, they will finally come home and practice the skills they have spent so many years gaining abroad. So, we will now be talking about brain gain instead of brain drain.\n\n\u201cA place like Evercare and also the facilities that the Lagos State government is developing in terms of specialist centers are going to give that attraction where Nigerians that live in the diaspora will want to come back home to work.\n\n\u201cI have seen your statistics, I have my feedback from all the people I have referred to you overtly and covertly. It has been amazing. It just shows that we need more of this facility and we need them fast,\u201d Abayomi said.\n\nThe Commissioner noted that Lagos has about 400 public health facilities and about 4000 public facilities.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere\u2019s almost a ratio of 1:10. That\u2019s an important ratio to consider and as a government, it\u2019s not possible for the government to be responsible for everyone\u2019s healthcare in Lagos State but it is our responsibility to make sure that everybody gets standard care. \u201cAnd so, the government\u2019s responsibility is always to set a regulatory framework, set a standard, policies and to enable the private sector to fill that huge gap that we as government cannot fill.\u201d\n\nSpeaking, the CEO of the facility, Mr Rajeev Bhandari, said the hospital has recorded several operational and clinical milestones in the last one year.\n\nBhandari said: \u201cWe have done over 690 surgeries, over 200 babies, advanced laparoscopic Paediatric surgery \u2013 Thoracoscopic repair in 3 day old infants.\n\n\u201cFirst spine surgery was done here in November 202, first open heart durgery was done in November 2021 and first permanent pacemaker insertion in February 2022 among others.\n\n\u201cWe just need to continue putting our best to serve the people of Nigeria and shorten that gap of health care that is here.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe look forward to working with other Nigerians in the diaspora, we want to create opportunities to get them back to the country.\n\n\u201cWe want to create those opportunities where they can learn, work and stay in their own country.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Yaro said that children\u2019s safety needed to be written into Nigeria\u2019s road safety plan.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe must agree that more needs to be done in our various communities to improve road safety for children and, more critically, that measures are put in place to prevent our children from being seriously hurt through road traffic collision.\n\n\u201cThis means that children\u2019s safety needs to be a central part of Nigeria\u2019s national road safety plan.\u201d\n\nHe continued. \u201cBut not just the national road safety plan; all Nigerian adults must be involved in children\u2019s road safety. In their early years, children require a lot of help from older ones in their use of the road.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey need specific assistance in detecting the presence of traffic and judging the speed and distance of oncoming traffic,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking to the children directly, Engr. Yaro admonished the children to listen attentively to their parents as they are being instructed on road safety.\n\nAlso speaking at the induction ceremony, FRSC Unit Commander, Ikeja Command, Mrs Emma Fekoya, said that the objectives of the command were to catch the pupils young and teach them the ethics of safety at home, school and on the road.\n\nRepresented by Mrs Ugochi Ikokwu, Fekoya said that the pupils would in turn teach their peers and relatives the importance of safety.\n\nFekoya said, \u201cYou are supposed to be a role model in all you are doing. Show that you live by example.\u201d\n\nThrowing light on the event, Mr Nsikak Isonguyo, Unit Coordinator, Special Marshal, Unit 111, Cakasa, said that the induction of the pupils was an enlightenment campaign to teach the pupils the ethics of safety on the roads and at home.\n\nThe main organisers of the event, Cakasa Ebenezer Foundation, plan to inaugurate more Cakasa Road Safety Clubs around the country.\n\nAccording to the Executive Director of the foundation, Mrs Helen Egbe, this was to ensure that the road safety culture was deeply instilled in children to prevent the many traffic accidents involving children, which have been mainly unreported around the country.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that every child must have that road safety consciousness. The more consciousness that exists in the children, the safer they will conduct themselves.\u201d\n\nQuoting statistics, she said that traffic collisions were the number one cause of death among children aged five to 19 around the world and more than 500 children were killed every day because of road traffic collisions, while tens of thousands were injured, often suffering lifelong disabilities.\n\nThe pupils inducted were drawn from New City Primary School, Palm Avenue Primary School and Oduduwa Primary School, all in Mushin Local Government Area.\n\nThe highlight of the ceremony was the induction which saw the pupils pledge allegiance to the country and the FRSC and to be of good behaviour in all their endeavours.\n\nAlso in attendance was the State Coordinator, Lagos State Special Marshalls, Pastor Olusegun Akintan, who was represented by Pastor Jimmy Amosun.\n\nVanguard News",

          "text": "Ogun State governor, Dapo Abiodun, on Friday, officially flagged off women empowerment scheme with disbursement of individual livelihood grants to 2,094 women across the state.\n\nThe governor, who performed the flag-off ceremony at the relaunching of Oko\u2019wo Dapo scheme in collaboration with Nigeria For Women Project (NFWP) at the MKO Abiola Int\u2019l Stadium, Abeokuta, Ogun State capital, said women empowerment and emancipation would continue to be at the front burner of his administration.\n\nThe event had the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari; Minister of Women Affairs and Social Development; Mrs. Pauline Tallen, wives of the Kwara and Osun State governors, the World Bank Country Director, Mr. Shubham Chaudhuri, among other dignitaries in attendance.\n\nAbiodun noted that in the economic architecture of his government, the womenfolk form a vital economic bloc, hence, the emplacement of various schemes to empower them, not only financially but economically.\n\nHe said out of estimated 7,535,007 2021 population projection by the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS), for Ogun State, females are put at 3,788,932, which is 50.28%, saying the significant number of women cannot be overlooked, if the state truly desires sustainable development.\n\nAbiodun, who added that his administration had observed women as mostly involved in Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) but always find difficult to access financial resources for the growth of their businesses from conventional financial institutions, said his government had since devised other approaches to empower the womenfolk.\n\nThese, according to him, include \u201ccapacity building of 500 female entrepreneurs across the state to enable them access financing and scale up their businesses; empowerment of 2,500 rural women across the state through provision of products worth \u20a6100m; empowerment of over 600 youths through vocational training while 400 women and youths are still undergoing training at the V\n\nvocation training centre under the Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development; empowerment of 95 Women across the three\n\nsenatorial districts and more than 100 widows were also empowered during the commemoration of year 2021 International Widows Day\u201d.\n\nHe emphasised that the empowerment programmes are targeted at alleviating poverty and increasing prosperity of women.\n\n\u201cOur womenfolk are integral part of our financial inclusiveness agenda. We are committed to providing avenues for our women to gain power and control over their own lives and acquire requisite skills and technical know-how to make strategic choices. It is a critical aspect of achieving the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development (SDG) Goal 5 \u2013 Gender Equality. On its own, Gender Equality provides more socioeconomic and political wherewithal for our women.\n\n\u201cAt the macro level, it will go a long way in reducing poverty in the family; reduce gender-based violence and abuse in the society; and, further strengthen the economy. Therefore, empowering our women is not a favour to their gender, it is, in fact, one of the most viable approaches towards achieving sustainable economic development\u201d, the governor added.\n\nWhile commending the Federal Government for the initiative of the Nigeria for Women Projects (NFWP), the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development and the World Bank, Abiodun said the choice of Ogun as\n\none of the six states in each of the six geo-political zones of Nigeria for the implementation of the NFWP programme is commendable.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the NFWP programme would be extended to other local government areas in Ogun, saying the FG\u2019s scheme is in tandem with Oko\u2019wo Dapo Scheme.\n\nAbiodun stated further that after disbursing the individual grants to women beneficiaries across the three implementing Local Government Areas of Odeda; Ijebu North-East; and, Yewa North, his administration would soon re-launch Oko\u2019wo Dapo scheme in the remaining 17 LGAs of the state.\n\nThe governor, however, disclosed that some of the beneficiaries of the first phase of Oko\u2019wo Dapo in Odeda LG were at an advanced stage of floating a micro finance bank, which according to him, would further provide for financial inclusiveness for more people and easier access to financial resources to boost their enterprises.\n\nWhile saying the disbursement would be in phases, he enjoined the beneficiaries not to see the financial assistance as their own share of the national cake, but \u201csee it as an avenue for economic empowerment through which they will be gainfully employed, improve their productivity and increase your income-earning capacities, and, expectedly become net employers of labour\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe see the sustainability of this programme as a bilateral responsibility. Government has played its own part by providing the funding, beneficiaries should reciprocate by ensuring that they utilize the funds for the intended purposes, so that it will bring the desired results. Fidelity to this public trust will encourage other Development Partners to collaborate with us on this venture.\n\n\u201cLet me also use this opportunity to call on well-meaning individuals and corporate bodies to come and partner with us and join us in this journey to take Ogun State to a greater and more prosperous heights\u201d, Abiodun submitted.",

He expressed optimism to succeed Governor Lalong come 2023. Excerpts:\n\nYou are a retired Customs Officer. Why are you delving into politics?\n\nThe discipline and result-oriented outlook, proactive problem-solving strategy, with meticulous modern management methods of the Nigeria Customs, groomed me to not only be a chain-value multiplier, but a prudent product of transparent economy and security expert that humbly served and solved the problems of my dear country. With that vast experience, the summative policy thrust of my political aspiration is to purposefully fashion a united, peaceful and prosperous Plateau state, anchored on the fear of God.\n\nThe slogan of my political party is Progress. As such, we intend to consolidate on the legacies of our beloved Governor, His Excellency, Rt. Hon. Dr. Barr. Simon Bako Lalong and make significant progress in ensuring: sustainable Sensible Security; good governance, based on accountable, accessible, equitable, frugal, and all-inclusive governance.\n\nMy team is also ready to ensure economic expansion and revolutionary reforms in the area of agriculture, education, health Care delivery, housing, tourism, environment, ICT, science, transportation and the Reformation of the civil service. We are also mindful of capital and human development through meaningful empowerment, employment of the youths, women and the vulnerable in our state. We are ready to improve upon massive modernization of urban infrastructure, industrial expansion and rural development.\n\nThe solid minerals will be positioned into tangible economic exploration. Through massive employment, we would be able to conquer the menace of youth restiveness and security challenges facing the state. When all these are done, Plateau state will take its position as one of the state sitting on the front pew of peaceful co-existence, unity, prosperity and dignity of man irrespective of your tribe and religious background. All persons on the Plateau shall live under the fear of God.\n\nYou are aware of the socio-economic and security challenges facing Plateau State. As a first-timer in politics, do you think you have all it takes to govern a complex state like Plateau?\n\nI believe I have answered this question. However, to the glory of God, I am a Fellow of the renowned Security Institute of Nigeria. I understand the rudiments of law enforcement and keenly have studied the dynamics of the security problems facing Plateau State. I am running for Governor to offer and implement security solutions that are pro-people, post-modern and permanent in nature. Our Plateau security plan will be a template for the country to emulate. We will make Plateau a Home of Peace and Tourism, indeed.\n\nHow strong is your structure within the All Progressive Congress (APC) here in Plateau?\n\nThe APC, our great party, is completely in control of the state as evidenced in the last Local Government elections during which we convincingly swept the 17 Councils in the state. My contributions to the development of the APC in Plateau are well noted. The party is fair to all aspirants vying for political offices. Accordingly, I am optimistic that the party will produce a credible aspirant like me to be the flag bearers in all the political offices to be contested. Party stalwarts know that I am a very popular, thoroughbred politician and man of the people that will lead APC to a resounding victory at the next gubernatorial election in the state.\n\nIn today\u2019s politics in Nigeria, people like you who are stepping in for the first time must have a godfather. Who is your godfather and how truly have you been assured of the gubernatorial ticket?\n\nIt is most unfortunate that \u201cgodfatherism\u201d has taken a strong hold on our politics in Nigeria today. As a devout Christian, I do absolutely believe that all power belongs to God and He chooses to entrust power to whosoever He so wishes. On that note, I confidently will say that God is my God Father. Hence, this explains why my policy thrust is anchored on the fear of God.\n\nHow is your relationship with Governor Simon Lalong?\n\nGovernor Lalong is an amiable leader that has made tremendous achievements particularly in entrenching peace and progress on the Plateau. I share with majority of Plateau people in admiring his relentless developmental strides and leadership legacy. My relationship with my Governor is cordial and I hope to continually consolidate on the positive gains he has made when given the opportunity to serve.\n\nThe governorship ticket has been zoned to Plateau Central. And from all indications, it has been further micro-zoned to the two major ethnic groups in the Zone, which are the Ngas and the Mwaghavul where you hail from. But in your area, there are quite a lot of aspirants. What are the elders doing to avoid bickering?\n\nPlease, permit me to reset the premise of this question on zoning to the effect that there is gen eral tacit consensus on zoning on the basis of senatorial zones but not on tribal leanings. As such, Plateau Central Senatorial Zone to which I belong is largely most favored to produce the next Governor. The Mwaghavul and Ngas tribes are predominantly the major tribes in the Senatorial zone but they or the Party have not precluded other tribes from contesting. Consensus as an instrument of political negotiation has earned its place of pride in this dispensation in dispersing bickering. Consequently, our elders have been playing crucial roles in ensuring that the game is played according to the rules.\n\nThe trajectory of past performances of aspirants are clearly recalled, capacity to win elections of an aspirant is measured and capability to deliver on governance is reckoned with. The elders, men, women and youths constituting the good people of Plateau vastly see the opportunity in the DVD Movement for: Qualitative and Frugal Good Governance; Improved Internally Generated Revenues tied to Capital Projects with yielding back capacities; Massive Infrastructural Development and Expansion through Public Private Partnership Schemes and BOT Arrangements; Transparency and Accountability in Financial Dealings; Opportunity to Create Government Apparatus for comprehensive administrative coordination at an institutional level with through pragmatic policies and concrete internal controls; adequate supervision and meticulous oversight; enforced transparency and accountability; responsibility and resourcefulness.",

Warri South LGA, consisting majorly of the Urhobo, Ijaw and Itsekiri ethnic nationalities, has 12 electoral Wards. But the protesting Urhobo leaders alleged that the Itsekiris are plotting to return the Warri South Council Area to 10 electoral Wards, which it was before it was increased to 12 in 1998.\n\nIn their position paper jointly signed by the Chairman and Secretary General, Chief Westham Adehor and Olorogun Victor Okumagba, respectively, the group maintained that, \u201cthe recent call by the Itsekiri people for a return to the pre-1998 era is a call for anarchy, inequity and social/political injustice which we urge INEC to reject.\n\n\u201cIn recognition of the vast and dominance of the Urhobo people in Warri South, the predecessor of INEC, National Electoral Commission of Nigeria (NECON) deemed it fit in its delineation of 1998, to delineate the entire Warri South LGA into 12 Wards as it was its duty to do. These 12 Wards had been gazetted and given legal recognition by successive governments and electoral bodies.\n\n\u201cIt is worthy of note that all successive general elections in Warri South LGA of Delta State have been conducted on the basis of these 12 Wards. The 1998 delineation was effected by means of legal instrument. If the Itsekiri people feel unhappy about the state of affairs, as it is, they can approach the necessary legislature or appropriate quarters to effect an amendment in the law. In that case we\u2019re ready to stage them on a public debate on the propriety of the need to maintain status quo.\n\n\u201cOn the absence of this, we state that no amount of pressure from the Itsekiri people or from any other quarters should sway or swerve INEC from the present course of justice and equity that is prevalent on account of these 12 Wards.\n\nAlso, and more importantly, we wish to bring to your notice that as law abiding and peaceful people, we have approached the Federal High Court, sitting in Warri in Suit No. FHC/WR/CS/70/2020, for a proper interpretation of the relevant laws and to determine the agitation of these Itsekiri people.\n\n\u201cIt is against the backdrop of the foregoing that we are protesting that INEC should not deviate from 12 electoral Wards structure in Warri South LGA and to ignore the agitation and pressure of the Itsekiri people on INEC, as an attempt to do otherwise will make INEC liable in contempt of Court and thereby throw Warri into a state of anarchy.",

That is why in collaboration with the NNPC, the Nigerian Navy has engaged in this operation.\u201d\n\nOperation Dakarta Da Barawo is a Hausa language meaning \u2018stop the thief.\u2019\n\nIt is aimed at checkmating the rising trend in crude oil theft in the Nigerian Maritime domain, particularly in the Gulf of Guinea.\n\nThe CNS further disclosed that no fewer than 40 Naval ships, over 150 boats, five helicopters among others would be involved in the operation, adding that it would last for three months.\n\n\u201cIn these three months, we will intensify all efforts, we will bring to bear all our assets, we will bring all our special forces, we will bring all our helicopters, to make sure that the impact of the operation is felt across the nation with proven results and Nigeria will come back to a steady platform.\n\n\u201cWe are bringing not at least 40 ships, between 100 and 200 Navy boats, also we\u2019re deploying between four and five helicopters, some of which will be coming and going throughout the period and all Navy special forces and units will also be involved,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking earlier, Abbas said the illegal activities have affected crude oil production below OPEC approved local price as well as benchmark of Nigeria\u2019s 2022 budget.\n\nHe urged officers drafted to the campaign to maintain professionalism, remain focused and resilient while executing the task of ridding the nation of illegal oil bunkering.\n\nExplaining reasons for partnering with the Navy, the Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mele Abba Kyiari, said the huge loss the country has suffered as a result of oil criminals\u2019 activities is drastically affecting the economy of the nation, and can no longer be tolerated.\n\nRepresented by the Managing Director, Port Harcourt refining Company, Ahmed Dikko,, Kyari expressed commitments in supporting the Navy to rid the country of all forms of maritime crimes and criminality to save the country from bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cThe situation we have today with the crude oil theft, and illegal activities of maritime criminals is impacting seriously on NNPC operations.\n\n\u201cSo NNPC is really worried and reached out to the Nigerian Navy and we are ready to support the Nigerian Navy anyway we can so we can conduct special operations and make sure that we bring this menace to the barest minimum,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Why Kwara APC is in crisis \u2013 Oyabambi",
          "text": "Otunba Adetunji Oyabambi was a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara State up till last week. The former gubernatorial candidate, after months of urging the various gladiators in the ruling party to end the crisis currently bedeviling the party, jumped ship and joined the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) with his supporters.\n\nIn this interview with \u2018DARE ODUFOWOKAN, Assistant Editor, the youthful politician who is aspiring to represent the people of Oyun/Offa/Ifelodun Federal Constituency in the national assembly, insisted that APC as a party in Kwara state has lost focus and currently lacks any form of ideology. Excerpts.\n\nYou were a chieftain of the APC in Kwara State; but you along with other members of the party joined the PDP last week. What informed your defection?\n\nThank you very much. Firstly, you will understand that every individual has a threshold of patience up to which he or she can condone irregularities. This is what prompted our defection. APC has wallowed deep in irregularities as a ruling party so much that some of us decided that we do not want our names to be associated with all of that disappointment, all in the name of politics.\n\nThe APC in Kwara State has been in crisis since the last general election. Can you shed light on the happenings within the party?\n\nRemember I said it earlier that some of us in this political arena cannot afford to allow our names to be tarnished. Saying that APC is not in crisis would be living in denial. This is because at every level, the party has indulged in a number of actions that one would not consider democratic at all. Even within the APC, members are not happy with the way things are going in the party. Leadership crises, tussles for hierarchy among party ExCos, selections and impositions of preferred candidates, betrayal, and so many other crises have eaten deep into the party.\n\nDo you share the view that the crisis has made the ruling party unpopular in the state and may affect its chances at the next election?\n\nYes indeed it will. Even as small as a family is, if crisis is rocking that family, it will affect their progress and level. APC has reduced itself to a party that the masses no longer want to associate with. At the Local Government, State and across the country, everyone is looking forward to voting them out in the next election.\n\nPointedly, who will you blame for the inability of party leaders to reconcile these differences?\n\nIt is not a one-sided blame, really. The leadership and followers alike are responsible. Some leaders are not interested in carrying members along in decision making processes, while others are totally deaf to the yearnings of their constituencies.\n\nOn the part of the members and followers, some are so obstinate and never follow instructions from the leadership. Others deliberately peddle falsehoods and fuel crises to satisfy stomach infrastructure. And on and on like that. So really, the blame is for both the leaders and followers. After all, if there are no followers there can be no leaders.\n\nDo you sincerely see PDP as a better alternative or you merely left due to the crisis?\n\nOf course, PDP shows prospects of being a better and credible alternative. No one will see a better abode and not move to such a place. Aside from the crises, decamping to PDP was also motivated by the party ideologies which are mostly in tandem with the people-oriented programs we have in our blueprint.\n\nIn addition, we are also pleased with the cordial leadership-cum-followership relationship and structure that exist in PDP.\n\nHow comfortable are you in your new party? Are you sure you will be fully accepted by leaders and members?\n\nThe answer to that question has already been demonstrated to us as we joined the PDP. We were received in a very welcoming and hospitable manner at all levels. From the time of our consultations with our Leaders, we knew that we were coming to a welcoming place where family is cherished. Nothing really feels like being around people with like minds politically.\n\nYour aspiration to seek the House of Rep seat, Is it still on course?\n\nI can tell you yes. However, I cannot say yes in totality because I do not intend to work against the decision of the party and my esteemed leaders. As you are aware, I am under the political tutelage of political titans like His Excellency, Dr. Bukola Saraki, Sen. Rafiu Adebayo, party Excos and stakeholders. We cannot go against decisions that will make our party better and greater.\n\nWhy do you think you are the right man for the job?\n\nIf an individual is in school and doing well, he doesn\u2019t need to be told. If otherwise too, he still doesn\u2019t need to be told. So many things that I have done in antecedence have qualified me to be eligible to contest. Aside this, my acceptability, popularity and direct bond with my people are among the things I consider as making me eligible.\n\nI stand a chance to pick the party ticket, if given the opportunity to pick the party to pick the party ticket (laughing). All I know is that when the game begins, I won\u2019t be found wanting. As regards defeating APC, that will be easy by the special grace of God. In PDP, we believe power belongs to God and to the people. And that is why we are confident we will be victorious.\n\nWhat will you say about the performance of Governor Abdulrasaq in Kwara State\n\nHe has tried his best. But wait and see the best of performances when our party, PDP win elections and deliver a government that is second to none.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on the unending debate over the new Electoral Act? Do you think the Court was right on its latest order?\n\nI believe the judiciary has done the best they could to see that the Electoral Act comes out without blemish. I know each time an amendment is made it is for the benefit of all. So I can say the latest Court Order was in the best interest of the common man.\n\nTell us about yourself and how you got involved in politics.\n\nMy name is Otunba Adetunji Oyabambi an indigene of Ijagbo in Oyun local government area of Kwara State. Though I was born in Zaria, Kaduna state, I grew up in Ilorin Kwara State. My family and I relocated to Ilorin Kwara State when I was 10 years old. It was in Ilorin that I completed both my primary and secondary schools. I proceeded to Kwara State Polytechnic, Ilorin Kwara State for both of my Ordinary and Higher National Diplomas. Then, I was deployed to serve our fathers\u2019 land in Akure Ondo State as a Youth Corper in 2006. I relocated to the United States of America in 2009. While working full-time, I went back to school to further my studies in Criminal Justice and I came out with an Associate Degree.\n\nPrior to leaving the shores of Nigeria I have been involved in politics even as a youth. You know, involving myself in grassroots youth forums of couple of political parties back then. I have always be a proponent of a Better Nigeria. I believe that youths are the answers to our county\u2019s problem. So, by the time I settle down in the US, I knew I have to go back home equipped with whatever I have learned here in the US.\n\nI have been in the United State for over 12 years and my desire for a better Nigeria has always wax stronger. I believe we cannot all sit back and just fold our hands believing for a change without action. I know that even though it is called dirty, politics is important in the change we clamour for in Nigeria. So, I would not say I am new to politic, and as you know now the rest of my story is what we are seeing now.",

          "text": "By Jide Orintunsin, Abuja and Joel Duku, Damaturu\n\nThe new National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) may soon commence a probe of the party\u2019s National Secretariat, National Chairman Abdullahi Adamu hinted yesterday.\n\nAdamu also said his team has a clear mandate from President Muhammadu Buhari to deliver victory to the party in next year\u2019s elections.\n\nThe ex-Nasarawa State governor, who spoke after receiving his certificate of returns from the National Convention Election Committee led by Jigawa State Governor Abubakar Badaru, said there would be no room for failure during his tenure.\n\nHe said clean employees at the APC national secretariat had nothing to fear about the impending probe, insisting that the party could not continue with the way things were.\n\n\u201cIt is in God\u2019s pleasure that we are here at the helm of affairs of this party. We have come with a very open mind, but you have to reciprocate in the same spirit,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe will definitely, by the will of God Almighty, need to look at you. But I am not saying anything today until the Transition Committee submits its report.\n\n\u201cI hope that by the time the report is submitted, you have what they call a clean bill of the ledger. That\u2019s my prayer. Right?\n\n\u201cWe have zero tolerance for failure in this new dispensation of our great party.\u201d\n\nThe chairman also asked party leaders and members to buckle up ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe cannot move the way we are to the elections. We have a marching order from the leader of this party, President Muhammadu Buhari. We have to deliver. There will be no excuses whatsoever and we will need everybody\u2019s hands on the deck for this to happen.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Badaru urged the Adamu-led NWC to carry along all those who stepped down for them at the national convention.\n\nHe said: \u201cSo, we thank all the contestants for really behaving in a mature and understanding manner for the interest and progress of our party.\n\n\u201cThey are heroes of our party.

But the gunmen have not shown any sign of collecting ransom,\u201d he added..\n\nEl-Rufai emphasised that the gunmen are not kidnappers but members of the Boko Haram terrorists group working in collaboration with bandits.\n\n\u201cThese ones are not the usual kidnappers but members of Boko who are collaborating with bandits.\n\n\u201dSo we were thinking they will ask for a huge ransom from the state government, not the families of their victims.\n\n\u201dSo far, they have asked for ransom from just one of the families that were contacted.\n\n\u201cAs far as the Kaduna state government is concerned, we have not changed our stand on payment of ransom, so, even if they seek for that from us, we will not pay because we are not ready to do so,\u201d he maintained.\n\nEl-Rufa\u2019i revealed that the state government had received intelligence report that the gunmen were going to strike on the rail line and had intimated the Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) on the matter, but no action was taken.\n\n\u201cWe think this thing happened because we have written twice to the NRC, advising that trains on the Kaduna route should not embark on night trips because we have reports that Boko Haram were in town and they plan to attack the train at night using explosive devices,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stressed the need for massive bombing of all bandit-infected enclaves including forest areas in the North West and North Central parts of the country.\n\nNAN recalls that the Kaduna-bound train, which left Abuja at 6 p.m. on Monday, was attacked by suspected terrorists at about 7.45 p.m., just about 15 minutes\u2019 drive before Kaduna.\n\nEight persons had been officially confirmed dead, 46 hospitalised and several others kidnapped following the attack.

The lawmakers demanded the sack of the National Security Adviser, Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd). They accused the security agencies of profiting from the increasing insecurity in the country.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, House Majority Leader, Hon. Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, accused the government of failing to live up to expectations. Ado-Doguwa suggested that citizens should be allowed to bear arms in self-defence.\n\nBut the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, decried some of the public words of the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, and Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi. The main opposition party said such words tended to confirm its position that the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration knew the whereabouts as well as plans of the terrorists, and deliberately refused to act.\n\n\n\nThe air interdiction came as troops of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) killed scores of insurgents during a clash in the Lake Chad area.\n\nNigerian Air Force sought collaboration with the Office of the Surveyor-General of the Federation in the area of mapping and geo-spatial deliveries, to aid the fight against terrorism.\n\n\n\nA military update issued in Abuja, yesterday, said 34 terrorists were decimated in waves of air strikes.\n\nThe update said, \u201cIn receiving credible information that at about 2.pm on 30 March 2022, about 70 terrorists on 40 motorcycles and some on foot were sighted moving towards the Akilibu-Sarkin Pawa Road, near Mangoro Village, the Air Component of Operation Thunder Strike swiftly scrambled an aircraft to intercept and neutralise the terrorists.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs the aircraft approached the scene, several terrorist were seen running in disarray on sighting the aircraft, abandoning their motorcycles to take cover within nearby bushes.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe terrorists were subsequently engaged in different waves with rockets while those fleeing were mopped up with canons decisively. Feedback from local sources around Mangoro Village, disclosed that 17 motorcycles including 34 dead bodies as well as 14 locally fabricated guns belonging to the terrorist were recovered.\u201d\n\nA source said some of the terrorists fled with multiple gunshot wounds during the encounter, but it was still unclear what roles they played in the attack that killed eight passengers onboard the Kaduna-bound train, with many injured and undetermined number abducted.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, an emergency intelligence meeting coordinated by the Defence Intelligence Agency after the train attack identified three locations as \u201cdestinations\u201d of bandits after most attacks within the axis.\n\nThe meeting, according to PRNigeria, also considered immediate deployment of integrated security surveillance and monitoring solutions for the rail line.\n\n\n\nThe locations identified by the intelligence service as bandit dens are in Rijana, Katari and Kasarami.\n\nThe places have proximity to the Kaduna-Abuja highway and rail lines.\n\n\u201cThese locations are abodes to kidnappers, armed bandits, drug addicts, gun runners, prostitutes and fleeing Boko Haram terrorists,\u201d a senior intelligence source revealed.\n\nThe officer further disclosed that a \u201cmassive joint security operation\u201d would commence in the areas, simultaneously with the support of recently acquired drones.\n\n\n\nThe source added, \u201cSome of the services have recently acquired sophisticated Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, the drones to improve surveillance and ensure precisions on attacks on targets.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate collateral damages in the initial stages of the operation, even though we will ensure maximum protection of innocent citizens.\n\n\n\n\u201cProper identification exercises of people in the areas would be conducted.\u201d\n\nThe meeting of the intelligence operatives was on the heels of a security parley between President Muhammadu Buhari and the service chiefs.\n\n\n\nBuhari had given the service chiefs the marching order to find lasting solutions to the incessant attacks on motorists and train passengers by bandits and kidnappers.\n\nPrior to their meeting with Buhari, the duo of Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, and Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Faruq Yahaya, undertook an assessment visit to the scene of the attack.\n\n\n\nIn another development, troops of the MNJTF, Operation Hadin Kai, eliminated scores of fighters of terror groups, Boko Haram and the Islamic States West Africa Province (ISWAP), in the on-going clearance operations around Lake Chad region.\n\nSecurity sources said troops successfully cleared Cemente, Bagadaza, Zanari and Wulgo in Gamborun Ngala Local Government Area of Borno State.\n\n\n\nA source said, \u201cThere were two encounters with the Boko Haram/ISWAP insurgents at Zanari and also at the harbour area. Troops were decisive in both attacks.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that the troops also rescued 21 women, 11 male children and nine female children in the operations, which commenced on March 28, 2022.\n\n\n\nSome of the items recovered in the aftermath of the encounter included two gun trucks, 22 bicycles, 18 motorcycles (destroyed in situ), two Rockets Propelled Grenade (RPG) tubes, three Rockets Propelled Grenade Bombs, one NBST Gun, two General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMGs), three GPMG belts, 600 rounds of 7.62 MM NATO, and one FN Rifle magazine, among others.\n\nThe Nigerian Air Force sought collaboration with the Office of the Surveyor-General of the Federation in the area of mapping and geo-spatial delivery.\n\n\n\nSpeaking during a courtesy visit to the Surveyor General of the Federation (OSGoF), Surv. Abudulganiyu Adeyemi Adebomehin, the Chief of Intelligence of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF), Air Vice Marshal (AVM) Abubakar Liman, said the purpose of his visit was to seek areas of further collaboration with OSGoF, because of its expertise, skills and data required to aid NAF in its operations.\n\n\n\nHe solicited synergy with relevant authorities especially, in the war against insecurity, stating that, \u201csecurity is everyone\u2019s business. War is a national assignment,\u201d which required the support of every citizen.\n\nThe intelligence chief reiterated the significance of the role of OSGoF in the war against criminality in the country.\n\n\n\nIn his response, Adebomehin said OSGoF, an extra-ministerial establishment of the federal government as the apex mapping arm and responsible for implementing the survey coordination act of the country, was ready to provide all resources at its disposal for the success of the operations of NAF and other arms of the Nigerian Armed Forces. He disclosed that his office produced navigational charts for the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT), which was certified by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). He added that OSGoF had acquired more sophisticated equipment and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as well as a digital printing outfit.\n\n\n\nAdebomehin stressed that the surveyors and other staff were already undergoing series of training and retraining in readiness to provide geo-spatial needs of the government, its MDAs, and other sectors of the economy.\n\nOutraged Lawmakers Say Nowhere is Safe in Nigeria\n\nMembers of the House of Representatives, yesterday, expressed concerns over the worsening insecurity in the country, lamenting that nowhere is safe in the country anymore. Reacting to the recent attacks by terrorists on Kaduna airport and train, the lawmakers, while debating a motion of urgent national importance on the killings in Giwa, took turns to fault the security agencies and the federal government for their failure to end killings by terrorists and other criminal elements.\n\n\n\nHon. Shehu Balarabe (APC, Kaduna), while moving his motion, lamented that his local government had been ravaged by the series of attacks by bandits, who indulged in killings, kidnapping, raping, robbery and destruction of property. He said between 24 and 28 of March, bandits had unleashed attacks on those communities, killing over 117 people, while some corpses were yet to be recovered.\n\nThe lawmaker also claimed that more than 136 people were abducted, while over 10, 463 others had been displaced from their homes.\n\n\n\nContributing, Hon. Dachung Bagos (PDP, Plateau) called for suspension of funds appropriated for security agencies until they showed what they had achieved with what had been released to them over the years.\n\nMajority Leader, Hon. Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, suggested that citizens should be allowed to bear arms to defend themselves. He said, \u201cI arise to speak in the capacity of the Majority Leader, who of course, is the ambassador of government on this floor. When you have a government in place, the major responsibility of that government, especially, a democratic one which was elected by the people is to ensure safety of lives and property of the innocent citizens.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr Speaker, when things like this continue on daily basis, those of us who are representatives of the government become speechless. We become speechless here to defend actions by government. This is an elected government, under a popular democracy but we continue day in, day out \u2013 killings, massacre, armed robbery all over \u2013 left, right and centre. Government in this case has to rise up to its responsibility, call a spade, a spade.\n\n\u201cOn account of this institutional failure, regimental failure on the part of our security agencies, because you have just no cause to raise excuse, funding is provided, here we are now as an institution, we have now sent invitation, come and meet with the people of Nigeria, come and interface with us.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith all sense of responsibility, I think Nigerians should this moment be allowed to also take arms. Nigerians must be allowed to take up arms in defence of their innocent souls, defend their hard earned properties, because it is like a monumental failure, if the agencies of security have failed, then Nigerians should not be seen as failure.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet Nigerian organise themselves in the way of civil defence. Let\u2019s organise defence for their innocent souls, because if the responsibility of the government cannot be carried out democratically, then, everyone has the cause to defend himself. Nigerians should no longer be running away from attacks, unnecessary bandits.\u201d\n\nAhmed Jaha (APC, Borno) was of the view that security matter in Nigeria has become a cash cow business, accusing security agencies of profiting from it.\n\n\n\nJaha said, \u201cIn 2021, we budgeted N460 billion for the Nigerian army alone, only N29 billion was for capital expenditure, the remaining was for recurrent expenditure. In 2022, we budgeted N571 billion for the Nigerian army alone, only 37 billion is capital expenditure, the remaining were recurrent expenditure.\n\n\n\n\u201cMr speaker the truth of the matter is security in Nigeria has become a cash cow business. I am not willing to go without taking my own and he is not willing to go without taking his own and the other person is not willing to leave until when he got his own.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is a cash cow business. They don\u2019t want it to finish, because they will realise that everybody\u2019s attention was diverted towards north-east. Okay, let them release north-east to some extent and go to north-west, after north-west, they move to south-west. Before you realise what is happening, the whole country is gutted with security challenges.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, after being chided by Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase, he withdrew his comment and said he was not going to deal with him.\n\nBut Hon. Nasiru Ali Ahmed (APC, Kano) called for the sack or resignation of the National Security Adviser (NSA), Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd), for failing to curb insecurity in the country. Ahmed recalled when the service chiefs were sacked and IG of Police changed, adding that no one was indispensable.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSince 2015, the inspector general of police, service chiefs have been changed. But the NSA has not been changed. The Army, Navy, Police, DSS all of these agencies are accountable to the National Security Adviser. From what I heard, most of these criminals were 16, 18 years old boys. Are we saying that the Nigerian Army, police, DSS, Air Force with all the training that they have had, all the international training, they have gone for peacekeeping.\n\n\n\n\u201cAre they now saying these 18 years old boys are more powerful than them? You travel by road, you are kidnapped; you go by train, you are kidnapped; you sit at home, you\u2019re kidnapped. So, where are we going to stay. You can be kidnapped right in this chamber. I\u2019m calling for the resignation of National Security Adviser, he must be removed. He has been there for seven years, what has happened?\u201d\n\nWase, who presided over the session, however, disagreed with Ahmed, saying, calling for the sack of NSA might not be the solution to the issue. He noted that despite President Muhammadu Buhari changing the service chiefs, nothing has changed to stem the tide of insecurity in the country.\n\n\n\nWhile blaming the judiciary for not prosecuting arrested culprits, he assured the people that the parliament would continue their investigative duties and anyone found wanting would not be spared, suggesting that activities for the day be suspended and prayers offered in solidarity with the lives lost to insecurity across the country.\n\nThe lawmakers, therefore, urged the federal government to implement recommendations contained in the House security summit, held last year.\n\n\n\nIn a related development, Chairman, House Committee on Defence, Hon. Babajimi Benson (APC, Lagos), told THISDAY that his committee and other security committees of the House would engage with the heads of the various services with a view to thoroughly and effectively analysing the incident (and other similar occurrences), proffering and implementing lasting and sustainable solutions.\n\n\n\nBenson said, \u201cThe recent attack on an Abuja-Kaduna train is yet another sad and regrettable security breach. As a committee, we are saddened and highly disturbed by the incident and the brazen audacity of the bandits. We believe that Nigerians should enjoy adequate security everywhere they go. We, therefore, see this as a major setback that must be addressed immediately, especially, considering the current fear of traveling by road along that route.\u201d\n\nHouse Beams Searchlight on Own Security Committees\n\nThe House of Representatives resolved to look into the activities of its standing committees on security, to see how effectively they were carrying out their oversight functions on the security agencies.\n\n\n\nThe committees included Navy, Army, Air Force, Defence, Interior and National Security and Intelligence.\n\nContributing to a motion on the recent killings in Giwa Local Government Area of Kaduna State, the Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase, noted that a lot needed to be done to stem the tide of insecurity. He wondered if one report had ever been turned in by the Committee on National Security and Intelligence.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cI don\u2019t know one report that has been turned in by Committee on National Security and Intelligence. I don\u2019t know,\u201d mandating the relevant security committees of the House to step up their oversight functions as well as conclude the reports of their investigations.\n\n\n\nChief Whip of the House, Hon. Tahir Monguno, frowned on the slow pace with which the Committee on National Security and Intelligence carried out assignments.\n\n\n\nMonguno said, \u201cWith regard to the committee, I can also recall that the first bill that was passed for second reading is my bill, which is the bill on small arms and light weapons. That bill was referred to the national security committee, but up till now, there is no report. Up to the extent that they had to go and appeal to Mr Speaker, which he had to set up an ad hoc committee. That is the extent the committee has not performed.\u201d\n\nPDP: El-Rufai, Amaechi\u2019s Confessions Confirm APC\u2019s Complicity\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, said the public utterances by Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, confirmed its position that the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration knew the whereabouts and plans of the terrorists ravaging the nation but deliberately refused to act.\n\nPDP also said the comments by the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, that some members of the APC-led Federal Executive Council (FEC) frustrated his request to install security surveillance equipment to avert terrorist attack on the Kaduna-Abuja rail track, confirmed that the APC administration had been creating safety nets for terrorists to freely operate in our country.\n\n\n\nPDP, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said in exposing the APC government, which he was a part of, el-Rufai said, \u201cWe know where their camps are, we know where they are, the SSS has their phone numbers, they listen to them and they give me report\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nThe PDP said that in his own confession, the Minister of Transportation said, \u201cWe knew what the problems would be. We knew we needed to have digital security equipment\u2026I warned that lives will be lost and now lives are lost\u2026 When you come with sincerity to government and your colleagues are stopping you, it is annoying\u201d.\n\n\n\nPDP, therefore, said, \u201cThese revelation from high-ranking APC public officials, who are in the position to know, is troubling as they are unequivocal confirmation that APC leaders are in league with terrorists.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, not surprising that President Muhammadu Buhari insists on retaining a self-confessed terrorist apologist, Dr. Isa Pantami, to continue to head the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy, which is indispensable in any meaningful fight against terrorism in the country.\u201d\n\nPolice Defuse Another IED in Kaduna\n\nAnother Improvised Explosive Device (IED) planted in Rigasa area of Kaduna was defused by the Nigeria Police yesterday.\n\nThe bomb, the police said, was planted a few kilometres to the Train Station.\n\nOn March 26, 2022, four people were injured in an explosion planted in Danmani community in Rigasa area.\n\nA statement by the spokesman of the state police command, Mohammed Jalige, said the latest IED was planted in the area by yet to be identified persons.\n\nHe said the IED was sighted by residents of the area about 07:50 hours and they promptly reported to the police.\n\n\u201cIn a swift response, the Command\u2019s Explosive Ordinance Department (EOD) swung into action and successful defused the IED, without any loss of lives or property.\n\n\u201cThe acting Commissioner of Police DCP Maiyaki Baba, thanks the residents of the area for their vigilance and prompt reporting of the incidence and assures them that the command will always prioritise the safety of the public,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe statement advised members of the public to always report suspicious movement or persons in their communities, noting that such information would be treated in full confidentiality.\n\nHe, however, said normalcy had since been restored in the area and residents were going about their normal business.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kaduna State government has debunked reports that motorists were stranded along the Kaduna-Abuja highway, when terrorists barricaded the road.\n\nIn a statement, the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said the reports were not true.\n\nAruwan stated, \u201cA few hours ago, some panic was spread on social media over bandits barricading the Kaduna-Abuja Road and kidnapping citizens plying the route. The buzz in circulation is false and was presented by a group of social media enthusiasts, who celebrate negative news.\n\n\u201cThe preliminary operational feedback showed that fleeing bandits escaping a military onslaught attempted to pass through a narrow corridor around Kasarami general area of Kaduna-Abuja road. The troops, on receiving this intelligence, hurriedly moved to the location and engaged them in the adjoining forest.\u201d\n\nThe statement further said the government would update members of the public whenever more detailed feedback was received.\n\n\u201cThe Kaduna State Government does not deny the existence of security challenges and continues to work assiduously with relevant military and security agencies,\u201d Aruwan said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Kayode Tokede\n\nThe market capitalisation of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) gained N3.02 trillion in the first quarter (Q1) of 2022, notwithstanding the growing insecurity concerns in the country.\n\n\n\nThe market performance was buoyed by impressive corporate earnings by major listed companies that saw some of them delivering robust dividend payout to shareholders.\n\n\n\nPrecisely, the market capitalisation gained N3.02 trillion to close on March 31, 2022, at N25.312 trillion, higher than the N22.297 trillion it opened for trading activities on January 4, 2021.\n\n\n\nThe NGX All-Share Index (ASI), which tracks the general market movement of all listed companies on the Exchange, also rose by 9.95 per cent to close at 46,965.48 basis points in the first Q1 2022.\n\nData compiled by THISDAY revealed that the sectoral performance of the NGX was bullish, as most indices closed the period on uptrend as at March 25, 2022.\n\n\n\nFor instance, the NGX Oil & Gas Index appreciated the most by 28.12 per cent. It was closely followed by the NGX Banking Index, which recorded a gain of 8.55 per cent, while the NGX Premium Board Index rose by 6.34 per cent.\n\nOthers were the NGX Pension, NGX Industrial Goods, NGX 30, and NGX Lotus II that went up by 6.34 per cent, 5.63 per cent, 5.39 per cent, 4.37 per cent, and 1.18 per cent, respectively.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the NGX Insurance and NGX Consumer Goods recorded year-to-date decline of 6.35 per cent and 4.21 per cent respectively, as at March 25, 2022.\n\n\n\nOn a monthly review, the Nigerian bourse witnessed positive price movements leading to a bull-run throughout January 2020, during which it closed with a 9.1 per cent month-on-month growth in the All-Share Index, and extended the gains by 1.7 per cent in February. During the period, BUA Foods got listed, boosting the market capitalisation by N720 billion.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the market performance in Q1 2022, Chief Operating Officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Ambrose Omordion, said the stock market sustained positive sentiment and uptrend due to the influx of corporate actions and 2021 audited financials, as players reacted to the released numbers and dividend declared for year-end 2021 earnings.\n\n\n\nOmordion said that was expected to support an uptrend during the earnings season, amid the oscillating oil prices, just as the market continues to interpret economic data in relationship with crude oil price and other factors, in the midst of profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis resulted in market players targeting fundamentally sound and dividend-paying stocks, as 2021 Q4 GDP was up at 3.98 per cent, while the International Monetary Fund called for a hike in the interest rate and further devaluation of the naira,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nOn the market outlook, Omordion projected mixed sentiment trading by investors in April and beyond, saying all eyes would be on the performance of the economy and how the country\u2019s economic managers would navigate challenges, which included insecurity and activities externally.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, investors would also be concerned about on-going war in Ukraine, energy supply chain distortion that had been one of the major factors driving inflation, insecurity, among other factors that have pushed cost of production, goods and services higher.\n\n\n\nHe added, \u201cTo invest profitably in this changing environment, you need investment education, trading plans and trading tools/software. These will help manage risk associated with volatility and unstable markets.\u201d\n\nAn analyst at PAC Holdings, Mr. Wole Adeyeye, said investors priced in the dividend payout out by the listed companies, which according to him drove market performance.\n\n\n\nAdeyeye said, \u201cInvestors have already priced in the dividend in January and February and that is why the market maintained positive growth during the period. However, there was profit-taking in March as most investors did not bother to wait for the dividend payment date.\u201d\n\nHe predicted that in April, the stock market might witness cautious investors\u2019 trading due to the uncertainties surrounding the economy.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nDeji Elumoye and James Emejo in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday commended the board and management of the Bank of Industry (BoI) for contributing to the growth and industrialisation of Nigeria.\n\n\n\nBuhari made the commendation when he unveiled the bank\u2019s second edifice in Abuja. He said the structure would boost BoI\u2019s Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) potential.\n\n\n\nThat came as BoI said it had raised about $4 billion from over 100 international banks/investors in over 20 countries within the past four years. The bank revealed that it was also working to increase the figure to about $10 billion within the next few years.\n\n\n\nBuhari pointed out that the development finance institution had disbursed over N1.4 trillion to micro, small and medium sized enterprises (MSMEs) at single-digit interest rate. This helped in making access to credit easier and affordable for Nigerians as well as supporting the diversification agenda.\n\n\n\nBuhari addressed the gathering via a video conferencing. Dignitaries physically present at the unveiling of the BoI edifice included Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Mr. Adeniyi Adebayo; Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele; Chairman of BoI, Mallam Aliyu AbdulRahman Dikko; and the bank\u2019s Managing Director/Chief Executive, Mr. Olukayode Pitan, as well as development partners.\n\n\n\nThe president expressed optimism that with the raising of a \u20ac700 million Eurobond, the BoI would be able to provide more funding for the growth of businesses in the country.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cI am particularly impressed that this world-class building will finance internally generated revenue of the bank. The BoI has continued to successfully execute its mandate as a policy institution of the federal government. Through the Bank of Industry, this government extended the single-digit interest rate loans.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs part of this mandate, the Bank of Industry disbursed over N1.4 trillion to micro, SMEs, and large enterprises, creating over nine million jobs from its inception.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdebayo said BoI had added significant value to the federal government\u2019s industrialisation agenda over the past 62 years and thanked the president and other arms of government for their confidence in the bank.\n\n\n\nBuhari said the DFI had been appointed as the implementation partner for several laudable projects towards alleviating poverty, job creation as well as ensuring affordable financing opportunities for Nigerian enterprises.\n\n\n\nEmefiele, in his remarks, said all the credit must be given to Buhari for setting the pace for the country\u2019s development and economic diversification as well as the restructuring of the base of the Nigerian economy.\n\nHe noted BoI was jointly owned by the CBN and the Federal Ministry of Finance, stressing that the central bank has been working closely with the DFI to ensure that it achieves its mandate.\n\n\n\nThe CBN governor said, \u201cSince 2014 when I assumed leadership at the CBN, we have ensured that we work closely with BoI to ensure that their core mandate, which is to provide finance for the development of not just the Small and Medium Enterprises but also our large corporate.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat they are able to complement our efforts in achieving the vision that has been set by President Muhammadu Buhari that says that we should work together to make sure we make finance available to Nigerians and not just make finance available to Nigerians but also make this finance available at affordable interest rates.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added, \u201cI will continue to give the credit to the president for setting the vision for the development and diversification of the Nigerian economy. Not just development and diversification but also ensuring that we really work hard to restructure the base of the Nigerian economy.\n\n\n\n\u201cFrom being an import-dependent economy to an economy that is self-sufficient and economy that develops itself and ensures that we reduce imports and begin to export and produce.\u201d\n\n\n\nEmefiele said Nigeria has the potential to grow not just its economy but also the economy of other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\n\nThe BoI managing director disclosed that the bank had raised about $4 billion from over 100 international banks/investors in over 20 countries within the past four years, adding that most of the funds ended up as part of the country\u2019s foreign reserve.\n\n\n\nWhile thanking Buhari for the renewal of his tenure and that of the chairman for another five years, Pitan assured that the board would work harder and, \u201ccomplete our succession planning project, which is on-going with our consultants, Price Waterhouse.\u201d\n\n\n\nPitan said through the president\u2019s support, BoI had been able to approach the international capital market and conclude various funding transactions, including a $750 million syndicated medium-term loan in 2018, which had now been fully paid; \u20ac1billion syndicated loan in March 2020; $1billion syndicated loan in December 2020; and recently the \u20ac750million Senior Eurobond (the first by any African national DFI) in February 2022, whose sovereign guarantee was also approved by the National Assembly.\n\n\n\nThe BoI MD added that these funds had significantly improved the bank\u2019s capacity to continually support Nigeria\u2019s real sector.\n\nOn his part, Dikko said the commissioning was an important milestone for the bank, as it signifies the culmination of many years of tenacity and determination to ensure that the edifice was completed and put to judicious use.\n\nHe said judging by the increasing profile of the bank and its operations, the new building should open new business frontiers for the country in general.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, for decades, BoI has delivered appreciable results on its mandate towards transforming the country\u2019s industrial sector by providing affordable and long-term financing across key segments and sectors of the economy.\n\n\n\nThe BoI chairman said in the last five years alone, working with strategic partners, the bank had supported over 3.2 million MSMEs as well as large enterprises, and created over 7.1 million direct and indirect jobs in the process.\n\nHe added that the bank\u2019s total assets also grew from N683 billion in 2016 to N1.7 trillion in 2021.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cBOI has consistently aligned its corporate strategy with the strategic objectives of the federal government, especially as it relates to industrialisation and job creation; from Nigeria Industrial Revolution Plan, to Economic Recovery and Growth Plan; and now to the newly introduced National Development Plan.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo that end, the bank has been a reliable partner in managing several intervention projects and funds targeted towards entrepreneurship, economic rehabilitation and poverty eradication on behalf of the federal government.\u201d\n\nThe BoI Tower 2 is a state-of-the-art innovative building with 12 lettable floors with unique features, which include energy-conserving smart lighting system that is motion activated, back-up power system with special panels that are synchronised to deliver power according to demand and high diesel efficiency.\n\n\n\nThe facility is also built with a building management system, which monitors, supervises, controls and reports on smart building technology systems, including generators, CCTVs, and other gadgets.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal is set to launch a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time.

          "title": "Two years on, what has #YouTubeBlack Voices done for African creators?",
          "text": "When TNC Africa, a Nigerian television production company, wanted to launch long-form video content that tells original African stories to the world, it chose YouTube as its medium. It was evident that YouTube could provide a platform that would connect it to the world and provide sufficient data for analytics on its audience. \u201cBeing an early-stage startup where data is super important, and one that does a lot of data analytics, we needed a platform where we could get access to that data, and YouTube offered that, \u201c Olawale Adetula, co-founder of TNC Africa said.\n\nAdetula explained that YouTube has the largest share of the video-watching audience it is targeting in Africa, such that even android phones have the app pre-installed.\n\nWhile YouTube aims to provide a platform for creators globally to explore their creativity, in 2020, it shined a special focus on Africa when it launched the #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund. The $100 million Fund\u2014created by YouTube as a response to the racial injustice that characterised 2020\u2014is a 3-year initiative dedicated to spotlighting and growing black creators on YouTube, from across the world, by providing them with funding, resources, and mentorship that will help them thrive on the platform.\n\nThe Fund, in the past 2 years, has worked closely with African content creators, musical artists, and, recently, producers and songwriters, offering them seed funding to develop their channels, training focused on upgrading their production, community engagement and wellbeing skills as well as workshops and networking programmes to help them grow their channels.\n\nAdetula\u2019s biggest takeaway from the Fund is the opportunity to network with and form relationships with over 135 other top creators around the world. The Fund\u2019s structure, which encourages every creator to work with another creator, plays a role in ensuring that these relationships are formed; and has translated into upcoming collaborations for TNC Africa, too.\n\nTNC Africa\u2019s target audience has also broadened beyond Africa as a result of the programme. \u201cWe were creating content and targeting viewers within Africa or with African interest because we never thought our content could be appealing to non-Africans. Today, the number of viewers we are getting from the UK, US, Ireland, and South America is steadily increasing since we implemented some of the things we learnt from the YouTube Black Voices Fund.\u201d More people outside Nigeria are getting interested in content created by Nigerian YouTubers.According to data made available to TechCabal by YouTube, over 75% of watch time on content produced by channels in Nigeria comes from outside Nigeria.\n\nThe Fund\u2019s inaugural cohort last year featured a Creator Class of 20 content creators, from Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya. Its Artist Class featured 3 African artists: Kenya\u2019s Sauti Sol, South Africa\u2019s Soma Jozi, and Nigeria\u2019s Fireboy\u2014who have gone on to use the platform to connect with their fans.\n\nFireboy\u2019s \u201cPeru\u201d remix with pop star, Ed Sheeran, has gone global, with the song topping music charts across the world. During his time on the programme, on YouTube, he performed a live stream concert to over 83,000 fans who watched the virtual performance, to celebrate Africa Month.\n\n#YouTubeBlackVoices helped award-winning Kenyan Afro-pop group Sauti Sol become the first Kenyan act to be included on a Times Square billboard in New York.\n\nKenyan Afro-pop band, Sauti Sol, perform their Midnight Train album in a virtual concert that has raked over a million views on YouTube. Addy Awofisayo, Head of Music, Sub-Saharan Africa, YouTube, spoke about Sauti Sol\u2019s excitement when the Fund put their pictures on billboards in New York, Los Angeles and London. \u201cIt was a great Kenya-to-the-world story. They were already celebrated in Kenya; it was amazing to be a part of their success and help them break out of Kenya.\u201d\n\nAccording to figures made available to TechCabal by YouTube, in Kenya, the percentage of YouTube channels making 7 figures or more in revenue (in Kenyan shillings) has increased by over 60%, year over year. While over 400 channels have at least 100 thousand subscribers\u2014an increase of over 70%, year over year\u20146 channels have over 1 million subscribers; and 1 channel has over 1 billion views. Over 45% of watch time on content produced by channels in Kenya comes from outside of Kenya.\n\nWhile the inaugural class had 20 creators and 3 artists from Africa, for the 2022 class, YouTube increased the number to 26 content creators and 4 artists; while creating a new class, for producers and songwriters, a development the Fund said demonstrates its continued support for artists on the platform.\n\n#YouTubeBlackVoices placed Nigerian artist CKay on a billboard in Los Angeles\n\nA member of the newly-created songwriters and producers class is Nigeria\u2019s brilliant 20-year-old producer, P.Priime, who has produced hits for some of the biggest names in Nigeria\u2019s music industry, including Wizkid, Fireboy, and Olamide. He further blew up this year after it became known that he produced Nigerian artist Asa\u2019s album (except for one song).\n\nP.Priime had heard about the Artist Class but originally didn\u2019t know there was going to be a category for producers, so he was excited when he heard about the newly introduced class. \u201cI was excited that people were starting to recognise the work producers do. I feel we are finally getting our flowers, and people are starting to see our importance beyond working with artists,\u201d P.Priime told TechCabal.\n\nWhen P.Priime joined the programme, they helped him organise his channel, and he started sharing his process\u2014with his video where he took his fans through the making of Nigerian artist Reekado Bank\u2019s hit \u201cOzumba Mbadiwe\u201d raking 63,000 views.\n\nThe Fund helped him get new equipment and has provided him with an opportunity to connect with artists across the world. Although his YouTube channel is monetised, he said he is not all about the money: \u201cIt is giving a piece of P.Priime to my audience, documenting my work process and using the opportunity to reach new audiences even when I am not dropping new music.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the challenges that African YouTubers face, Awofisayo blamed the late delivery of Personal Identification Numbers (PIN)\u2014which allows them to monetise their YouTube channel\u2014on African YouTube creators\u2019 countries\u2019 bad postal services. Awofisayo further explained that the reason YouTube sends the PIN via postal service is to prevent identity theft and circumvent fraud.\n\nAwofisayo said that the #YouTubeBlackVoices Fund was created to encourage black creators and artists to get on YouTube, amplify their voices, and create an opportunity for them to be successful on the platform. But she revealed that beneficiaries of the Fund do not get preferential treatment or get prioritised on the platform.\n\nAwofisayo revealed that the selection of newer and early-stage creators\u2014creators that have been on the platform for a few years\u2014is a shift from last year when most beneficiaries were established content creators. Awofisayo said YouTube wants to also empower more creators like Nigeria\u2019s Mark Angel, who has built a production company out of his YouTube channel. \u201cIn the long run, we want to make sure that black creators, not just those in the fund, are able to be successful on our platform, and that our platform is an enabler to their creative success,\u201d she said.\n\nNigerian content creator, Tomike Adeoye, a member of the 2022 class of creators made an Instagram post where she expressed gratitude to YouTube for its support and the BlackVoices Fund for providing funds. \u201cThank you for #YouTubeBlack. Thank you for being a great source of income! Just seeing us and doing what we love, we see the dollars flow in our account monthly,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIn Nigeria, the percentage of YouTube channels making 7 figures or more in revenue (in naira) is also up by over 60%, year over year, with over 650 channels having over 100 thousand subscribers, an increase of over 50%, year over year. Still in Nigeria, 35 channels have over 1 million subscribers, an increase of 50%, year over year.\n\nIn South Africa, the percentage of YouTube channels making 6 figures or more in revenue (in rands) is up over 40%, year over year, with over 300 channels having over 100 thousand subscribers, an increase of over 60%, year over year. Still, in South Africa, 25 channels have over 1 million subscribers, an increase of over 30%, year over year. Over 65% of watch time on content produced by channels in South Africa comes from outside of South Africa.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Will B2B ecommerce capture Africa\u2019s informal markets?",
          "text": "As online retail marketplaces flounder in Africa, entrepreneurial hopes for ecommerce turn towards selling to businesses online. Business-to-business (B2B) ecommerce may be a promising route to digitising Africa\u2019s huge informal and offline commerce, but it is not without challenges.\n\nPer data from research consultancy, Briter, B2B ecommerce ventures in Africa secured more than $256 million in disclosed funding last year. Olumide Olusanya, CEO of PayMente Limited, and an experienced ecommerce builder, says B2B ecommerce is now a \u201cvector of choice\u201d startups in Africa leverage \u201cfor the primary purpose of financial inclusion of its mostly informal sectors\u201d.\n\nAs B2B companies like TradeDepot, Wasoko (formerly Sokowatch), and even Jabu prove, B2B ecommerce has become the darling of digital commerce funding venture capitalists in Africa. Entrepreneurs see B2B commerce as the road to Africa\u2019s informal markets, and VCs are placing bigger bets on those hopes. But, the road\u2014literally and figuratively\u2014to tapping ecommerce\u2019s potential, by doing business with the African street retailer, is almost as bumpy as the road to the consumer\u2019s door.\n\nA path of least resistance\n\nInvestors and entrepreneurs are becoming increasingly interested in B2B ecommerce as they realise that the montage of colourful roadside vendors with bustling street businesses are more reliable clients than the occasional online shopper.\n\nThe harsh economic realities that continue to influence earning and spending also guarantee that buying consumer goods will remain largely offline in the near future. Consequently, the centralised Jumia version of ecommerce is losing to a model that emphasises selling to the vendors who retail to end consumers.\n\nIt is easier to persuade retailers to use digital channels to manage inventory than to convince consumers to buy every other achet of milk from a website. Retailers are also likely to be familiar with simple digital platforms like WhatsApp. As they are already exposed to digitisation at the communication level, ordering and receiving retail goods in bulk by tapping the Wasoko app on your Transsion phone is easy. It does not require learning new skills.\n\nFurthermore, the International Trade Centre (ITC) claims that the global size of B2B ecommerce is 5 times larger than that of B2C ecommerce. Put simply, small businesses buy more stuff online compared to consumer purchases. In Africa, where offline retail reigns and household consumption may reach $2.5 trillion by 2030, it is easy to see why entrepreneurs believe that B2B marketplaces are a better ecommerce fit.\n\nBut even this low-hanging market opportunity is not a walkover.\n\nA bumpy ride to the street shop\n\nDistribution or \u201croute-to-market\u201d is the core business of B2B marketplaces. They are, in essence, little more than an order-made-easy frontend welded around distribution and warehousing.\n\nSince this is both an aggregation and a distribution service that stops just one level above the direct consumer, it creates better delivery-value density (DVD) and helps marketplaces and manufacturers gather important data about informal retail flows.\n\nBut the advantage of a higher DVD\u2014how startups measure the cost and efficiency of a delivery route\u2014is slim when informal retailers are scattered all over the street. Supplying these informal retailers means that B2B ecommerce platforms are still exposed to so many infrastructure gaps that make selling directly to the consumer difficult.\n\nOne way of solving this challenge is to build more distribution points. The downside to that is that it is expensive and adds to the fragmentation at the wholesale layer of consumer goods distribution. To put it another way, each additional distribution point a MaxAB, for example, creates will eat into the density of orders they have to deliver and, hence, their margins.\n\n2/3 of Africa\u2019s $1.4 trillion retail spending in 2016 was on FMCG goods. Photo/Mary on Unsplash\n\nAs Olusanya (quoted earlier) noted, B2B marketplaces want to digitise informal retailing. But more than simply digitising the inventory and stocking process for street retailers, B2B ecommerce, in many cases, directly competes with wholesale distribution networks with a long history of serving informal retailers.\n\nReplacing the wholesale operators who form the backbone of consumer goods distribution across Africa is not a light challenge. It is even conceivable that some of these non-tech wholesalers have exclusive business relationships with manufacturers. Ignatius Akpabio, TradeDepot\u2019s Director of Growth and Strategy, agrees. \u201cBecause of how big they are, you can\u2019t fight the system,\u201d he says. Instead of competing with wholesalers, TradeDepot says it works with established wholesalers to get supplies and as distribution partners. \u201cWe are in a suppliers market in Nigeria, and, because of this, demand always outweighs supply. There is not enough supply for any one distributor, especially for an aggregator like us who are looking to be more pan-Nigerian and have a more expansive reach. If you don\u2019t have these people as your partners, you will struggle from a supply standpoint,\u201d Akpabio adds.\n\nHe disagrees, though, that TradeDepot will replace wholesalers. According to him, wholesalers are how TradeDepot gets supplies in very few cases.\n\nIt makes sense. The market is huge, and capturing a fraction of it, especially in key urban locations, sounds like a winning strategy. Although good numbers are hard to come by, a 2013 survey of micro-small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Nigeria, conducted by the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics and the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria put the number of MSMEs in the country at more than 37 million. Small consumer goods shops make up a good percentage of that figure.\n\nSo, while B2B ecommerce may not be a threat to offline wholesale networks today, managing the complex relationships that underpin a B2B business is a conversation startups in this space will have to have sooner than later. Any business that simultaneously deals with wholesalers and African street shops has to.\n\nTaming the streets\n\nIn 2020, Joseph Aito, a former Pernod Ricard sales manager, shared the story of Chinedu Okoroafor, a Nigerian whom he claimed netted \u20a61 million monthly from hawking edibles in Lagos traffic.\n\nWithin 4 years of living in Lagos and selling snacks in Lagos traffic, Okoroafor went from making \u20a640,000 a month to earning around \u20a61 million a month from hawking and operating a loose network of hawkers whom he supplied with both credit and products.\n\nAito\u2019s story highlights the lucrative and eccentric relationship between FMCG manufacturers, wholesalers, and street retailers.\n\nAs Olusanya told TechCabal in a call, one feature of the retail scape is how retailers, and even a few big supermarket chains, prefer revenue over efficient inventory management. One may dismiss this as senseless irony because being more efficient may translate to better revenue. But, again, as Aito\u2019s story shows, consumer goods distribution in Africa can be irrational. Aito wrote: \u201cManagers from multinational companies started to seek him [Okoroafor] out. He provided a unique service to them. When they need a quick sales spurt to end the month on a high, they visit him, offering a larger discount than is typical. In a similar vein, when consumables are close to expiry, these companies offer him ridiculous discounts, sometimes as high as 60%, to sell off the stock.\u201d\n\nWhat is more? The bulk of Okoroafor\u2019s sales came from reselling these products to other retailers in his network.\n\nInventory management is met with a blank expression for \u201cretailers\u201d like this\u2014and they are not only roadside hawkers. In this type of environment, where turnover is the primary concern, a B2B marketplace selling \u201cefficiency\u201d to retailers may be talking to a wrong, or, at best, limited market.\n\nOrdering new inventory from a smartphone is easier and cheaper for retailers, but the real party benefiting from efficiency are the makers of consumer goods. Instead of sending a sales representative to drive around blindly with supplies, they simply pass on the headache to B2B intermediaries like TradeDepot.\n\nBecause B2B ecommerce startups are primarily regional and operating in relatively new territory, the competitive bloodbath is not apparent. However, as the space becomes more defined and more local competition arises, retailers will be spoiled for choice in a low-margin business. On the positive side, this may lead to interesting mergers and acquisitions (M&A). We already see some of that. Last year, TradeDepot, Nigeria\u2019s leading B2B ecommerce startup, alone raised $110 million. By February 2022, it acquired GreenLion, a Ghanaian B2B ecommerce startup and launched buy-now-pay-later schemes for its retail partners as it plotted an ambitious expansion programme.\n\nThis competition and M&A may even touch startups like Kippa and Oze, who are working on digitising informal retail records.\n\nThe jury is still out on how much digitisation B2B ecommerce can drive. What is clear is that digitising African commerce will not take the \u201cdigital-mostly\u201d shape found in China because B2B infrastructure relies on and even enables Africa\u2019s dukas, spazas, and provision kiosks to sort out the last leg of commerce.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor African football fans, the weekend is not just a time to take a break from the hustle; it is also time for battle. They watch TV screens intently, fuming, cheering, and cajoling as their teams in the various European leagues battle on the pitch.\n\nHowever, some fans now look forward to the footballing weekend for more than just the love of their teams. The love for the game is now shared with the passion for fantasy football or football betting.\n\nFantasy sports in Africa isn\u2019t much of a thing. Sports betting, however, is quite popular. In a survey conducted by GeoPoll in Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, and Uganda, 72% of respondents had participated in betting, 53% of which was football betting.\n\nWhile fantasy sports in Africa might be a fantasy (pun intended), compared to sports betting, it is big in other regions. And though they might appear similar because they involve gambling, they are done differently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of betting on real-life football teams, fantasy football involves gambling on virtual teams created by the player-manager. The teams created will include virtual forms of real-life footballers.\n\nThe virtual team manager earns points in the game based on the actual performances of their players.\n\nIn the English Premier League\u2019s Fantasy Football League (FPL), the managers get \u00a3100 million ($130.8 million) to buy 15 players from different clubs. They are only allowed to buy three players from a single club. As in real-life, players differ in price based on their performances.\n\nSome other European leagues have a fantasy version of their leagues, with the Fantasy Liga and Fantasy Bundesliga owned by the Spanish and German leagues, respectively.\n\nAccording to football magazine FourFourTwo, FPL has eight million players globally who compete to be the Jose Mourinho of fantasy football.\n\n$3 million to make fantasy football mainstream\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Eksab team. Source: Supplied\n\nOn Monday, March 28, 2022, Eksab, an Egyptian fantasy football startup, announced that it had raised $3 million from investors to scale its platform. The round was led by 4DX Ventures, with participation from Golden Palm Investments, Darwazah Capital, P1 Ventures, and angel investors.\n\nFounded in 2018, the startup\u2019s first offering is a prediction game where users create a fantasy lineup with a leaderboard showing their progress. Users who predict correctly are eligible for prizes.\n\nWith over 700,000 users on its platform, the startup reports that its paying users have increased 60% month on month. Although the startup\u2019s current focus is on football, it plans to get into other sports soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiving betting companies a run for their money\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross the world, startups are capitalising on the almost religious following that sports enjoys with fantasy football offerings. Investors are also not holding back, as seen in French startup, Sorare\u2019s $680 million Series B round.\n\nIn Africa, though, betting companies are capitalising on the following that sports, particularly football, enjoys on the continent. According to Business Day, Africa\u2019s most populous country, Nigeria, spends \u20a62 billion ($4.9 million) on sports betting daily.\n\nIntervals between games are frequently littered with ads from betting companies. And some of the biggest platforms have signed up former players as ambassadors in Nigeria. However, Eksab\u2019s raise could be the beginning of fierce competition between sports betting companies and fantasy football platforms.\n\nA few factors have contributed to fantasy sports\u2019 growth. The first is that players compete against each other rather than against the bookie. Consequently, a player\u2019s result largely depends on their skill level. On the face of it, this looks positive, but it also means that unskilled players do not stand a chance against top players.\n\nThe second is the low entry barrier. Most fantasy sports sites do not require players to pay before playing. On the other hand, users need money to participate in sports betting. As a result, more people can easily join fantasy sports platforms.\n\nWhile fantasy sports seems like an evenly matched competitor for sports betting platforms, the market share of betting companies could see them add fantasy sports to their products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

This week has been a mixed one for Nigerians, especially for residents of Kaduna. First, terrorists attacked the state\u2019s lone airport; then, a train carrying over 900 passengers was attacked, with some passengers killed or kidnapped.\n\nThe Super Eagles, Nigeria\u2019s men\u2019s team, drew a World Cup qualifying game in the same week, ensuring that the country will be absent when football\u2019s biggest tournament kicks off in November.\n\nFortunately, it wasn\u2019t all sad. 18 of the 24 countries that made up Y Combinator\u2019s W22 batch are based in Nigeria, proving that investors and founders see massive potential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere were appearances from countries like Sudan, Namibia, and Uganda, and we discussed all that on the Techpoint Africa podcast. You can listen using your preferred podcast providers.\n\nToday\u2019s Techpoint Digest discusses waste management in Africa, Tushop\u2019s pre-seed, Khazna\u2019s Series A, and Techpoint Pitch Friday. We also have a roundup of opportunities in African tech.\n\nLet\u2019s get to it.\n\nManaging waste with tech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, while on a work break, I went to get some food with Ogheneruemu. Like many eateries in Nigeria, our food was packed in plastic plates. After eating, she remarked, \u201cthese guys need a recycling plan ASAP.\u201d\n\nWaste landfills are a common sight in many African countries, but you would also find waste dumped into gutters and canals. About 2.1 billion tonnes of waste is produced each year globally, with reports stating Africa had about 125 million tonnes in 2012 and is expected to grow to 244 million tonnes by 2025.\n\nShe spoke to Damilola Kadiri, Founder of Wura, and Victor Boyle-Komolafe, GIVO\u2019s Founder, about their experiences building businesses that tackle waste management in Africa using tech.\n\nMeet two Nigerian companies using technology to change how we reuse waste\n\nGrocery shopping with the community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbraham Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs is one of the most common explanations for human motivation. At the lowest level are physiological needs, including food, shelter, and clothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFood is probably the most critical physiological need in Africa, and not just because we need it to stay alive. Its importance can be seen during elections when politicians frequently share food during campaigns.\n\nAs food costs rise worldwide, Africa is one of the hardest-hit regions with high food inflation, meaning that its residents spend as much as 40% of their income on food alone. That figure is 56.65% in Nigeria, while Kenyans spend 36% of their income on food.\n\nWhile the best way to mitigate these problems would be to produce and preserve more food, that requires significant investments. However, Kenyan startup, Tushop, uses community group buying to help Kenyans save on food.\n\nHow does community group buying work? Someone \u2014 usually called a community leader \u2014 aggregates orders from individuals who live close to each other. It is then relayed to the vendor, farmer, or distributor, after which it is delivered to the community leader. This community leader then unpacks the orders and delivers them to those who made them.\n\nMost Africans are familiar with this, and some offices in Nigeria even operate a similar model where they buy groceries for the Christmas holidays. Now, Tushop wants to use technology to make this available to more people and has announced a $3 million pre-seed round.\n\nAided by the coronavirus pandemic, group buying has grown in popularity in China and India. In this round, Tushop has received backing from 4DX Ventures, JAM Fund, Breyer Capital, Chandaria Capital, TO Ventures, Golden Palm Investments, FirstCheck Africa, DFS Lab, Wasoko. Other investors include Raja Kaul, President Sundial Group; Olugbenga Agboola, Flutterwave CEO; Eli Pollak, Apollo Agriculture CEO; and Ida Mannoh, Director of Growth, Chipper Cash.\n\nThe startup plans to use the funds raised to grow its team, improve its tech while expanding across Nairobi with its sights set on expanding to other Kenyan cities. Last week on the Techpoint Africa Podcast, we spoke about white founders in Kenya, so it\u2019s interesting to see a black female founder from Kenya today.\n\nKhazna\u2019s plans for financial inclusion in Egypt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I had a dollar for every time I\u2019ve come across an African fintech startup, I would have enough to take three months off and watch my favourite football team play. I promise I\u2019m not complaining. I\u2019m not.\n\nSo who\u2019s in the news today? Khazna, an Egyptian super app. The Cairo-based startup has announced a $38 million Series A split between debt and equity.\n\nSome of the investors involved in this round include Speedinvest, Algebra Ventures, Accion Venture Lab, Disruptech, Khawarizmi Ventures, and Nclude \u2014 the VC fund launched by some Egyptian banks. By the way, I\u2019ve observed that many African startups are increasingly favouring debt financing.\n\nWhat does Khazna do? Putting Khazna in a box might be difficult. While the startup offers financial services, it also has other non-financial services.\n\nHowever, the startup launched with Khazna HR, a salary-on-demand service that enables partner employers to offer partial discounts to their employees before payday.\n\nThe startup is not the only one playing in that field, with Earnipay and Cadana as some of its competitors in the African market. While these startups offer it as a standalone service, it is just one of several services that Khazna offers.\n\nThe startup also offers a buy now, pay later service, available in 1,000 merchant stores in Egypt. With 150,000 users, the startup is dreaming big and plans to increase that number to 1 million by the end of 2022.\n\nApril\u2019s Techpoint Pitch Friday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a man has good corn or wood, or boards, or pigs, to sell, or can make better chairs or knives, crucibles or church organs, than anybody else, you will find a broad hard-beaten road to his house, though it be in the woods.\n\nThe quote above attributed to Ralph Waldo Emerson suggests that the man with a better product will always have the most customers.\n\nHowever, with numerous (identical) brands competing for our attention, it\u2019s not enough to have a good product. It would help if you told your story clearly and compellingly.\n\nNot everyone loves to speak before a crowd or even knows how to do it right, but you can get better with practice and feedback.\n\nAt Techpoint Pitch Friday, entrepreneurs not only get to pitch their startups before an enthusiastic crowd but get feedback that helps with product development or refining their pitch.\n\nIn March\u2019s edition, Dayo Oyekanmi and Oluwafemi Adeleke pitched Harmony and Siara, respectively, and it could be your turn this month.\n\nREGISTER for a chance to pitch your startup or be a part of the audience on Friday, April 8, 2022.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nOpportunities\n\nFluidcoins is looking for a business development and sales manager.

          "title": "Why did Nigeria waste $137m on unutilized gas?",
          "text": "Two weeks ago, the federal government apologised for the worsening power supply in the country, blaming the breakdown of most of the generating plants and lack of gas supply for the current electricity challenges.\n\nTo relieve the pain, President Muhammadu Buhari says the government is ramping up the underutilised capacity at the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC), with a $50 million Gas Supply agreement which is being finalized to secure the sustainability of up to 800MW of underutilized NIPP assets.\n\nBut this is not a new thing in the sector.\n\nFrom 2018-2019, Nigeria paid $137 million in two years for gas and electricity that were never used under a Gas Sale and Aggregation Agreement (GSAA).\n\n\u201cThe gas supply agreement is based on 80percent gas take-or-pay; meaning that whether or not gas is utilised, payment of 80percent of contracted gas quantity will have to be made. As a result, NBET had paid a total of $105 million and $32 million in 2018 and 2019 for unused electricity and gas respectively,\u201d Nigeria\u2019s ministry of finance to President Muhammadu Buhari in a letter dated November 19, 2021.\n\nIssues with gas supply agreements\n\nOver time, gas producers have been cautious of investing in gas infrastructure in the country as a result of low gas prices and a lack of assurance or guarantee of payment from GenCos. Hence, the processes for gas supply agreements have been fraught with challenges.\n\nA Gas Sale and Aggregation Agreement (GSAA), which is typically between the GenCo, gas supplier and the gas aggregation company, stipulates contractual framework, rights, obligations and risk allocation for gas supply to the GenCo.\n\nThe most prominent case was the sloppy gas supply deal between Calabar GenCo and Accugas Ltd, forcing the federal government to keep paying over $10 million monthly with or without gas supply to the plant.\n\nRead also: Reps order probe into $12bn trans-saharan gas pipeline project\n\nThe perennial liquidity challenge\n\nOne of the major -possibly the biggest \u2014 challenges bedevilling the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) is the liquidity challenge; hence the sector is not financially viable.\n\nThe electricity distribution companies (DisCos) are finding it hard to collect significant revenue for energy distributed to customers. This also affects the Discos\u2019 remittance to the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company (NBET) and market operators. Most of the DisCos do not offset up to 50 percent of the market invoice for energy received.\n\nNBET is the body that buys power from the GenCos through power purchase agreements (PPAs) and sells to the DisCos through vesting contracts.\n\nAs a result of low remittances by the DisCos, NBET too has been unable to meet its obligations to GenCos. The ripple effect means GenCos too will be unable to pay gas suppliers.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Association of Power Generation Companies (APGC), an association of electricity generation companies, issued their own release, refusing to accept responsibility.\n\n\u201cIlliquidity, caused by the huge sums owed GenCos by the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET), has more than ever before continued to frustrate the GenCos and kept them incapable of meeting their obligations which are extremely necessary to keep their power plants running and make capacities available,\u201d said Joy Ogaji, executive secretary of APGC.\n\nThe GenCos said the cash crunch had disrupted such obligations including operations and maintenance as and when due, procurement of critical capital, spare parts and accessories, payment, and servicing of existing loans from lenders and financiers, and employee obligations.\n\nGenCos added that issues including the inability to source foreign exchange, issues of gas volume, gas quality, gas pressure and gas transportation had consistently curtailed capacity utilisation by GenCos, thereby affecting generation.\n\n\u201cWhile the owners of the GenCos invested committedly and increased generation capacity up to 13,000MW across the country, no corresponding investment and improvement were made at the transmission and distribution ends. The result was the significant stranded capacity of GenCos, which ironically, Nigerians are in dire need of but cannot get,\u201d Ogaji said.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the blame game, the Nigerian consumers who saw their electricity tariff rise over 35 percent in 2020 upon the introduction of the service-based tariff plan, are complaining of being short-changed.\n\nWay forward\n\nThe federal ministry of finance says it has come up with an unprecedented proposal to market the makeup gas (MUG) to potential off-takers such as the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) for off-take by Vitol, an international trader, through a swap agreement to generate revenue in dollars.\n\n\u201cJust like crude, this will constitute a major (additional) source of income that will be more stable considering its stability and predictability,\u201d the ministry of finance says.\n\n\u201cThe proceeds from volumes accrued from the gas supply agreements is approximately 5113mmsef (25.7 mmBTU) and a potential market value estimated at USD84.5 million (as of March 2021) from one source alone. The proceeds from the sale of the MUG will be redeployed to address the financial challenge of the Power Purchase Agreements and override the Partial Risk Guarantee of Azura, service the Genco legacy debt, the PPI projects and other FGN liabilities,\u201d it added.\n\nTo accelerate the above development, the Federal Ministry of Finance recommended a direct involvement of VITOL, a reputable gas company that already has a long term LNG off-take contract with Nigeria LNG Limited (NLNG) and provides financing to Savannah Energy, while Ahmed Zakari and co, an indigenous accounting and audit firm, will engage as transaction advisor.\n\nThe finance minister added that the implementation of the programme will shore up the gas supply capacity of NLNG and eliminate its feed gas challenges.",

          "title": "NIN server glitches frustrate electronic passport applicants, others",
          "text": "A server problem, which the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) said it had rectified in February, is frustrating many Nigerians as they are unable to use their National Identification Numbers for electronic passport application and other things, BusinessDay has learnt.\n\nExperts say the glitches may have also been due to the current fuel scarcity and the rising cost of diesel, which are affecting many government offices including the NIMC, an agency under the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy. The deadline for the National Identification Number (NIN) registration has been repeatedly postponed by the government.\n\nMany Nigerians have complained that despite having obtained NIN, they could not carry out the renewal of their international passports, driver\u2019s licence, and bank account opening, among other services.\n\nIn many cases, people said they had completed the registration at NIMC registration centres only to get to the passport office or the bank to be told their NIN is yet to \u201cdrop\u201d into the national system.\n\nAn applicant who has been attempting to renew his passport said he has been trying to complete his verification process in the last three days but has failed to despite imputing his NIN.\n\nHe said the last email he got from the passport office was \u201cThe reasons for the failed verification are given below: There is an error with NIMC, please contact support.\u201d\n\nAccording to the applicant, the system breakdown has been that way in the last three days.\n\n\u201cThe situation is affecting everyone and everything here. The situation is the same in Abuja. Since this week, whether you are for the first issuance or renewal of a passport, when it gets to NIN verification, the process stops. The work piles up; the production also halts,\u201d the applicant told BusinessDay.\n\nAs of March 2022, the NIMC has issued 77.1 million unique NIN. This will mean that the number of Nigerians without NIN now stand at 126.7 million. Should the authorities not extend the registration, this could mean millions of Nigeria will not be able to get a new passport or renew their old passports, among other things.\n\nSeveral calls by BusinessDay to NIMC\u2019s public relations executives were not answered. In February, following several days of glitches and poor services, the commission admitted in a statement that its server was temporarily unavailable \u201cdue to maintenance service being carried out by one of the commission\u2019s network service providers.\u201d\n\nAfter more than a week, the commission claimed the service was restored which allowed people to continue their registrations. But a lot of people have also told BusinessDay that despite successfully registering, they were still not able to complete their passport issuance process because the identification numbers were yet to drop in their profile. This is also affecting people attempting to activate new SIMs or get a driver\u2019s licence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve registered for NIN and I\u2019ve been given NIN but my network service providers are claiming that my NIN failed NIMC verification,\u201d said Wale Babalola.\n\nTosin Olugbenga, CEO of Afridex Finance, said the glitches also affected students who are preparing for JAMB examinations.\n\n\u201cMany students who registered for NIN weeks ago, got their slips printed but when they want to register for JAMB, the NIN is invalid. NIMC always complaining that the server is down. Why are you making NIN compulsory when you people are not ready to put the right system in place?\u201d Olugbenga tweeted.\n\nJoy Eze, another applicant who is affected by the development, told BusinessDay that she had completed all other processes and was only waiting to get a verification message from NIM but that had lingered for the last two days, halting her travel plans.\n\n\u201cI had planned to travel out in three days\u2019 time since all other processes towards renewing my passport have been completed, only to be delayed by the NIMC verification. This will really affect my travel plans as there are no signs the system glitch would be resolved anytime soon,\u201d Eze said.\n\nA staff member at the Ikoyi passport office who pleaded anonymity confirmed the delay in the NIN synchronisation process across Nigeria had been on for a while.\n\nThe worker said, \u201cNIMC has been having problems and this has continued to linger. I believe they are having some challenges and it is affecting our operations in the office at the moment. We really feel for applicants this period because they are not able to process their passports.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing we at the passport office can do to help the situation. We have been trying to reach out to NIMC to know what is actually happening. There is a limit to what we at NIS can do. We only gave the NIMC office space here at Ikoyi to ease our operations. The issue at hand can only be resolved by NIMC. We cannot get involved.\u201d\n\nSome experts said on condition of anonymity said the NIMC might not have adequately prepared its systems for the millions of people registering for the NIN.\n\nWith 77.1 million Nigerians registered so far, the experts said the NIMC servers might be overworked, hence the repeated postponement of the registration exercise which is aimed at giving the commission the opportunity to improve its capacity.\n\nRead also: U.S Embassy waives interview for some visa renewal applicants\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2022 that the Federal Government increased the budget of the NIMC. Prior to 2022, the commission\u2019s budget was between N400 million to N500 million, which largely went to recurrent expenditure rather than upgrading its systems to meet up with the new mandate of registering all Nigerians within the age of 18.\n\nAs a result of the inadequate financial resources, the commission intermittently down tools from workers protesting lack of payment or inadequate remuneration.\n\nIn 2022, the government jerked up the commission\u2019s budget to N5 billion to enable the NIMC to meet up with its needs and mandate in line with the present reality in the sector.\n\nFor Nigerians looking to get new or renew their passports, the situation is also compounded by the continual passport scarcity across Nigeria.\n\nIn Lagos and Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory, many applicants have been waiting for months for their passports, which they had applied for, paid for and had also been captured in the database, but are unable to obtain their passports because booklets are scarce.\n\nSome people have missed out on opportunities such as scholarships, study, medicals, child delivery, business engagements and investment opportunities, while waiting to obtain their passports.\n\nBusinessDay gathered that passports are currently scarce because the government owes its technical partners abroad huge debts running into millions of dollars\n\nThe Ministry of Interior has a public-private partnership agreement with a foreign company, Irish Technologies, which produces the enhanced e-passport, but it has refused to supply the product due to the alleged huge debts.\n\nBusinessDay, during a recent visit to the Ikoyi passport office, the busiest passport office in Lagos, observed a long queue of angry and worried applicants waiting to obtain their passports.",

          "title": "Growing insecurity poses risks to Nigeria\u2019s energy projects",
          "text": "The growing insecurity in Nigeria is seen as posing risks to oil and gas projects, including the $2.6 billion Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) gas pipeline project and the rehabilitation of the Kaduna refinery.\n\nOn Monday, gunmen attacked a busy train between Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja, and Kaduna, carrying 970 passengers, with many killed and many injured.\n\nGunmen had last Saturday attacked the Kaduna airport, killing the guard at the site of Very High Frequency Omni-directional Range, a navigational aids equipment belonging to the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency.\n\n\u201cOil and gas projects, which are often fixed field assets located in remote areas are now prime targets for armed bandits because of the high-profile kidnappings of foreign workers involved in those projects,\u201d said Caleb Adebayo, energy and environmental lawyer at New York University School of Law.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest economy is struggling with rising kidnapping, killings and social disorder defacing the country\u2019s investment outlook. The country attracted Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflow of $698 million in 2021, the lowest since 2005.\n\n\u201cThe recent attack on the train station has shown no one is safe. The development has raised security alert on all the ongoing projects with expatriates, especially the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) pipeline project and refineries rehabilitation,\u201d Luqman Agboola, head of energy and infrastructure at Sofidam Capital, said.\n\nThe AKK pipeline is a 614-kilometre (381.5-miles) pipeline project developed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) to transport natural gas from southern Nigeria to central Nigeria.\n\nThe project represents phase one of the 1,300-km (808-mi) Trans-Nigerian Gas Pipeline project, which is being developed as part of Nigeria\u2019s gas master plan to utilise the country\u2019s surplus gas resources for power generation, as well as for consumption by domestic customers, according to NS Energy.\n\nBusinessDay gathered that the challenge of insecurity, especially kidnapping and banditry, had instilled fears in the project camp, which is located about 5 kilometres away from the Anyigba-Adogo-Okene highway.\n\nRead also: Seven things to note from Seplat Energy\u2019s 2021 financials\n\n\u201cThe menace of kidnappers on the prowl in the areas had always instilled fear into workers; however, security personnel have been drafted to keep vigil to ward off the activities of hoodlums,\u201d one of the contractors working on the project told BusinessDay.\n\nOther experts say the continuous cost of insecurity on Nigeria\u2019s energy sector has exposed the sorry state of the industry, the main revenue earner of the country, and worsened the growth prospects of the economy.\n\nThe Lagos Police Command announced this week that it had tightened security around the Dangote Refinery, nearing completion in the Lekki Free Trade Zone area of Lagos State, after it was attacked by armed hoodlums on Monday.\n\n\u201cArmed hoodlums numbering about 20 who gained access to the refinery through the lagoon side were repelled while attempting to cart away already-installed armoured cables in the refinery,\u201d the spokesperson for the command, Benjamin Hundeyin, said in a statement on Monday titled \u2018Police foil attack on Dangote Refinery\u2019.\n\nIndustry players believe the wave of kidnappings sweeping Nigeria is not isolated to the Niger Delta \u2014 as it was 15 years ago, where militant groups target oil and gas sector infrastructure, sometimes in protest over poverty and environmental degradation, at others in order to steal oil.\n\nAlthough the level of violence fluctuates, workers have been kidnapped and pipelines blown up or illegally tapped to siphon off oil for years, costing billions of dollars in revenues.\n\nThe government had hoped that the passage of the long-awaited Petroleum Investment Act (PIA) could help to ease tensions in the Delta.\n\nYet while campaigners had hoped that the PIA would require oil companies to pay 10 percent of oil revenues to host communities, the new law includes a provision for just 3 percent, a disappointment to many campaigners.\n\n\u201cCivil unrest and insecurities are a disincentive to oil and gas investment because they hamper the future of business operations, while infrastructure decay increases the cost of production, affects competition, and erodes companies\u2019 profitability,\u201d Agboola said.\n\nThe Nigeria Security Tracker (NST), a project of the Council on Foreign Relations Africa programme, also paints a gloomy picture.\n\n\u2018\u2019Different groups in Nigeria resort to violence. The militant Islamist movement, Boko Haram, is active in Northern Nigeria. Violence among ethnic groups, farmers, and herdsmen sometimes acquire religious overtones. A new generation of Niger Delta militants threatens war against the state. Government soldiers kill civilians indiscriminately. Police are notorious for extrajudicial murder,\u2019\u2019 NST experts said in a report.\n\nAt present, Nigeria is regarded as one of the most dangerous places to live in. The 2020 Global Terrorism Index described it as the third most affected by terrorism.\n\nAlso, the NST documented 2,769 violent deaths recorded between February 2020 and February 2021 in just one Northern state.\n\nKidnappings carried out by various armed groups have also increased in the past five years. A recent report by SBM Intelligence said over $18 million was paid as ransoms for victims abducted between 2011 and 2020.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nChief Dr. Billy Osawaru is a financial expert and consummate entrepreneur. A very well traveled financial Analyst that doubles as financial Adviser and senior marketing Director with World financial Group, Trans-America financial Advisers in Atlanta Georgia, U.S.A.\n\nDr. Billy Osawaru is a consistent politician and a loyal party man who believes in the collective development of the people of Orhionmwon / Uhunmwode Federal constituency, hence his desire to seek their mandate to represent his constituency at the Federal House of Representatives.\n\nThe ebullient Chief Obazuwa of Benin Kingdom bares his mind to the trio of Tunde Eigboremolen, Oboh Sylvester, Editors, Special project and Ken Abu in Benin City.\n\nExerpts:-\n\nKindly introduce yourself to our readers.\n\nI am Chief Dr. Billy Osawaru, the Obazuwa of Benin Kingdom. I am a Financial Experts, you can call me financial analyst or Financial Adviser.\n\nI am a Senior Marketing Director with World Financial Group, Trans American Financial Advisers in Atlanta, Georgia U.S.A.\n\nI am aspiring for the office of the House of Representatives to represent the people of Orhionmwon/Uhunmwode Federal Constituency. Yes, I am aspiring for this office because I believe strongly that no nation can stand without good laws. And I believe we should send responsible men and women to handle and make laws in a sane society. Yes, you will agree with me that Nigeria is not where it supposed to be because, even though we might have some good laws in the books, but we really need to use oversight functions to see that those laws are being executed by the executive.\n\nSo, I decided to throw my hat in the ring because I can deliver for the good people of Orhionmwon and Uhunmwode in particular and the good people of Nigeria in general. Like I said before, going there to make good laws is not something every single person is able to do. It is something you should have a passion for, first of all, and it is something may be you should have done one or two things in that aspect.\n\nWhen I was in college, I was a student union president. When I was doing my masters in Ashyla International University in the U.S, I was the Head Delegate to the United Nations on the Model United Club. And part of what we used to do there was making laws. At that time you could call it the youth making the laws. Yes we used to do a lot of role play at the UN building in New York. And I led a lot of delegations while I was Student Union President. It is something I have done in the past. And it is something I have developed passion for, because, I see how good laws can transform a nation. Having said that, because a lot of our people might come up with some good laws but we still lack in the oversight function of it.\n\nWell, my people just make laws and they walk away that is one aspect. I want to make sure you actually put the executive feet to the fire because, when you set up good laws you want to make sure those laws are carried out. Moreover in our system here in Nigeria, the legislators actually have a provisions where they are able to execute certain projects they call constituency projects. So I don\u2019t\u2019 think I want to be a lawmaker with this kind of responsibility and I be able to attract those projects to my Federal constituency. So I want to be able to do that as well because my Federal Constituency, Orhionmwon is the second largest producer of gas in Nigeria; so I don\u2019t see why Orhionmwon should not be compensated when it comes to what is being gotten from Orhionmwon and Uhunmwode. As we speak right now, it is so close to the seat of power called Benin City, but it is still far from development. We still have communities today in Uhunmwode and Orhionmwon not electrified and that is very unacceptable because from the bye-pass in Benin \u2013 City to Ehor which is the capital of Uhunmwode is just about 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nSo it is a shame to find out big communities there where we still don\u2019t have electricity. They have never been electrified before and no good roads. A place like Abudu that is the headquarters of Orhionmwon still cannot be elevated to the status of a city. T to me that is a shame!\n\nSo, I should be able to attract capital and infrastructural development to those kind of places. Because I believe whatever you are able to attract to those places will attract markets to those places in form of bringing people.\n\nFrom the way we spoke, from the insight about your background, it is clear that you are an elitist politician. How close are you to your people? You have been away from home for a long time. How connected are you to your people?\n\nAm not the type of politician you want to term a Diaspora politician, because I am fully grounded. I am in Nigeria every other month. And to be frank with you, this is my fourth journey. This is not the first time I am journeying for elections. Twelve years ago, I ran for the State House of Assembly, and I was stepped down for Hon. Mrs. Elizabeth Ativie which I obliged because in politics you have to be a party man. When the leaders see that 2 or 3 people are running for a particular office, yes you should be magnanimous to respect the leaders when they take those kind of decisions. The second time I was equally stepped down again because at that time, Governor Oshiomhole said that they had some issues where APC members who left for PDP and Hon. Ativie did not leave, that we should allow her finish her second term. Which, painfully I had to comply again, coming over time trying to do all this even though I was promised that the next time, those same people will allow me but it was not like that. When it got to that time and we saw how some leaders came and said they have the candidate and that they will not let me scale through.\n\nBut again this is my fourth time and there is nothing, and I repeat, nothing for the past 12 years politically that is happening here in Benin City, Edo State or Nigeria that I have not participate physically or financially or otherwise. So I am not somebody you want to say is far from his people.\n\nAm sure if you have seen my declaration of my intentions to run this time, you will agree with me that I am on ground because my people are there to always support me. They are very excited because, all the time I was stepped down, they were so scared and worried that I will leave and never to come back. But they have seen that I have always been consistent and persistent. That is the kind of person they want to represent. So this time they actually came to me, pleaded with me to go to the House of Representatives to represent them because I have been doing a lot of things at my level on my capacity for my own people. Talking about who is grounded, I can tell you, I might have my job outside the country, but it really does not stop me from playing politics in Nigeria, because my business is such that it can run itself with or without me. And I am always here to deliver and to serve my people.\n\nAnd that brings to the level of consultation. How was it when you declared your intentions to run based on your level of acceptability?\n\nThe Consultation actually started from them. They consulted me to know if its something I would accept and I told them that I am always ready to serve them. They invited me to come talk to the people at home which I did and before I started anything I had to reach out to some apex leaders at the two local governments. They all encouraged me that I have sacrificed for the party and they believe it is my time to come serve the people. And the leaders found out that they feel like they owe me and that they are indebted to me because of my sacrifice all these years. So far, I can tell you almost 80 to 90 percent it has always been the same story. They know I am capable, they know I am qualified, they know I have all it takes to deliver. Now they just feel this is the right time for me. So up to the local government level, I have done consultation. As a matter of fact, last Saturday which was about 4 days ago that was when I declared my intention in the Local Government. Sunday was Orhionmwon and Saturday was Uhunmwode. So everything is looking good so far because I am getting overwhelming support from everybody.\n\nWith good laws, a nation can develop. As a lawmaker, do you think you will be able to bring dividends of democracy to the doorstep of your people?\n\nYes, you can, like I said before, I just enumerated some of the responsibilities of a lawmaker as it pertains to Nigeria as a country. Firstly, you are going to be making good laws right. Again whether it is a town, village or city, good laws can transform any of these. What are the good laws? Good laws that are pro-business, good laws that will be pro-employment, good laws that will be pro-women, doing all the stuff that they need to do.\n\nWhen I say \u201cpro\u201d I mean creating conducive environment for these different categories of people to actually survive and flourish. Once the good laws are there you take it to the level of oversight function. When they know that there is a lawmaker that put the executive feet to the fire, trust me, something will be done. It is always going to be better than where you don\u2019t have this kind of oversight function. A lot of things can be taken for granted especially by the executive. Right? So if as a lawmaker I am always making sure those laws are being carried out by the executive and if they don\u2019t, we are going to get the judiciary that will interpret those laws for them.\n\nYou see, a lot of things don\u2019t work because of little or no resistance from the quarters those resistance are supposed to come from. So, if I am a lawmaker, that is my job. That is my duty to make sure those laws are carried out. So when they are doing anything, trust they want to get me off their back by just doing the right thing. But again, wherever they can take things for granted, they will always do, yes that is one.\n\nThen two, I talked about constituency projects. Constituency projects, the way I understand is more like the executive portion of the lawmaker. Wherever they are going to give him some allocations maybe to providing clean water for your people, providing good roads for your people, providing electricity which is basically what the executive primarily should do; but again it they providing those options for us as lawmakers of course, we have to take advantage of it. Do you think I want to connect all the villages in my constituency? Of course, I want to. So what do I do? Because a provision where I can put roads construction on the budget? Of course, I will be glad to do that. Do you think my people will be happy to see that there is no village that is electrified in Uhunmwode and Orhionmwon? Of course, they will not be happy. What do you think I will do? At that point I need to actually build a relationship with whoever is the minister, Federal Minister of Power to see that we bring this home. Same thing with Federal Ministry of Water Resources. So those kind of relationship is what I am talking about. Being able to attract the facilities that will attract businesses to your people. That is how you can transform a village, a city and a town or country.\n\nDevelopments all over the world are driven by technology. Do you think your party is disposed to bringing all these technology into actualizing these goals you have enumerated?\n\nI am going to take your question talking about how technology savvy my party is. You see as a lawmaker going to the Federal Capital Territory (F.C.T) the National Assembly to make laws, I am sure this has gone beyond a political party. Going there, I am going to be making laws with 359 others.\n\nAgain, it now depends on some of us that are widely traveled, that really understand. We really understand and we believe in it. So it is now the convincing power that we have to actually get some of our colleagues whether you are APC or PDP to believe some of those things that we believe in. That is what really matters here. You as somebody that has really went far and wide trust me, I live in one of the greatest country in the world, which is the United States of America, number one in technology. So I am living it as well. So you think if I want to come down here to make laws for my people, it is not something I want to embrace.\n\nYeah, it is something I want to embrace because I have already embraced it over there. And these are some of the things that will make people like us, assets to our party and the country because we have seen it and we have live it somewhere else because we really believe this is where to go. This is the 21st century, the world is seen over there as global, why because of technology. So this is one of those things somebody like me am going to be pushing for through bills. I will sponsor such in form of bills because, I want to use my Federal Constituency as a pilot project to see that I am creating a technological hub in Uhunmwode and Orhionmwon that can actually become a model for other Federal Constituencies. Why because, I know it is the way to go. I can tell you we are already 10 years behind in Nigeria behind other developed societies.\n\nSo we are trying to catch up so that it becomes a priority of mine to make sure whatever we are doing right now, let us start from the elementary. You have to catch them young with technology. So whatever we are going to be doing everything will start from the nursery, making all those gadgets available to those kids. Making it a priority for our kids to be able to use technology to solve problems, to do critical thinking and so many other things.\n\nYou know showing interest in anything technology, I will be willing to sponsor people from constituency on international programmes that have to do with technology and I will be willing to invite technological experts to Nigeria too when we are having events that has to do with technology so that our people should always be exposed to the benefits of technology so that they can embrace it.\n\nAny plans for youths of Orhionmwon and Uhunmwode?\n\nI believe in a country like Nigeria where you have 60 percent population are youths. You can not do a whole lot without carrying the youths along. Most of the things are pro \u2013 youths. Like you talk about employments and all that. A case in point is the National Directorates of employment.\n\nI have been sponsoring that program for the past 6 years and what I do is make some money available for these people to get/or receive training of youths in my local government.\n\nThey are able to do that successfully up to a point of being able to secure soft loans from Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). I received a call last week that one of my participants received a loan of 3 million naira. I think that is what we supposed to be doing more. If a youth cannot be gainfully employed, then he can be the employer.\n\nPart of how you do that is giving them those opportunities. Another thing we are doing right now is that we actually came together, you an call it the who- is-who in Uhunmwode Local Government Area not really the old ones but the young ones like us too. And part of what we are doing for our youth is to help them source for opportunities everywhere both in Corporate and government, and we get those opportunities. We can go back home and get some of those youths. Bringing those information to those youth is one way to help them out. As a matter of fact, I just collaborated with the lady mechanic that has a very huge program and is able to get a lot of grants from German, Italian and U.S.A governments all over. We just collaborated, and I have just been able to secure some slots for Uhunmwode and Orhionmwon youths to be able to embark on trainings even abroad. There is one currently going on now, they are taking them to Cyprus.\n\nIt is a four years program where everything is going to be paid for and that student get some stipend and by the time that student comes back, he or she is gainfully employed by BMW or COSCHARIS or other. Again those are things I will continue to do because some of the youths if they begin to see how others youths are taking advantage of opportunities we are bringing that I am part of; I think a lot of them would want to key into these kinds of things. And that is how countries get better.\n\nWithout putting any numbers to it, I am just one man, am not part of government mind you. But again, I just believe this is how we start. If I am able to empower one youth, I have achieved. Putting a number to it, may be I can still tell you we have not empowered up to one percent of the population of youths. We still have a lot of work to do because all I am doing now is reaching out to other notable bodies and successful Uhunmwode and Orhionmwon men and women to join to support this kind of gesture.\n\nWhen I get to NASS, my goal is am able in 4 years to empower 40 or 50 percent of out youths.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Idowu Olakunle\n\nOgun State governor, Dapo Abiodun, on Friday, officially flagged off women empowerment scheme with disbursement of individual livelihood grants to 2,094 women across the state.\n\nThe governor, who performed the flag-off ceremony at the relaunching of Oko\u2019wo Dapo scheme in collaboration with Nigeria For Women Project (NFWP) at the MKO Abiola Int\u2019l Stadium, Abeokuta, Ogun State capital, said women empowerment and emancipation would continue to be at the front burner of his administration.\n\nThe event had the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari; Minister of Women Affairs and Social Development; Mrs. Pauline Tallen, wives of the Kwara and Osun State governors, the World Bank Country Director, Mr. Shubham Chaudhuri, among other dignitaries in attendance.\n\nAbiodun noted that in the economic architecture of his government, the womenfolk form a vital economic bloc, hence, the emplacement of various schemes to empower them, not only financially but economically.\n\nHe said out of estimated 7,535,007 2021 population projection by the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS), for Ogun State, females are put at 3,788,932, which is 50.28%, saying the significant number of women cannot be overlooked, if the state truly desires sustainable development.\n\nAbiodun, who added that his administration had observed women as mostly involved in Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) but always find difficult to access financial resources for the growth of their businesses from conventional financial institutions, said his government had since devised other approaches to empower the womenfolk.\n\nThese, according to him, include \u201ccapacity building of 500 female entrepreneurs across the state to enable them access financing and scale up their businesses; empowerment of 2,500 rural women across the state through provision of products worth \u20a6100m; empowerment of over 600 youths through vocational training while 400 women and youths are still undergoing training at the V\n\nvocation training centre under the Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development; empowerment of 95 Women across the three\n\nsenatorial districts and more than 100 widows were also empowered during the commemoration of year 2021 International Widows Day\u201d.\n\nHe emphasised that the empowerment programmes are targeted at alleviating poverty and increasing prosperity of women.\n\n\u201cOur womenfolk are integral part of our financial inclusiveness agenda. We are committed to providing avenues for our women to gain power and control over their own lives and acquire requisite skills and technical know-how to make strategic choices. It is a critical aspect of achieving the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development (SDG) Goal 5 \u2013 Gender Equality. On its own, Gender Equality provides more socioeconomic and political wherewithal for our women.\n\n\u201cAt the macro level, it will go a long way in reducing poverty in the family; reduce gender-based violence and abuse in the society; and, further strengthen the economy. Therefore, empowering our women is not a favour to their gender, it is, in fact, one of the most viable approaches towards achieving sustainable economic development\u201d, the governor added.\n\nWhile commending the Federal Government for the initiative of the Nigeria for Women Projects (NFWP), the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development and the World Bank, Abiodun said the choice of Ogun as\n\none of the six states in each of the six geo-political zones of Nigeria for the implementation of the NFWP programme is commendable.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the NFWP programme would be extended to other local government areas in Ogun, saying the FG\u2019s scheme is in tandem with Oko\u2019wo Dapo Scheme.\n\nAbiodun stated further that after disbursing the individual grants to women beneficiaries across the three implementing Local Government Areas of Odeda; Ijebu North-East; and, Yewa North, his administration would soon re-launch Oko\u2019wo Dapo scheme in the remaining 17 LGAs of the state.\n\nThe governor, however, disclosed that some of the beneficiaries of the first phase of Oko\u2019wo Dapo in Odeda LG were at an advanced stage of floating a micro finance bank, which according to him, would further provide for financial inclusiveness for more people and easier access to financial resources to boost their enterprises.\n\nWhile saying the disbursement would be in phases, he enjoined the beneficiaries not to see the financial assistance as their own share of the national cake, but \u201csee it as an avenue for economic empowerment through which they will be gainfully employed, improve their productivity and increase your income-earning capacities, and, expectedly become net employers of labour\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe see the sustainability of this programme as a bilateral responsibility. Government has played its own part by providing the funding, beneficiaries should reciprocate by ensuring that they utilize the funds for the intended purposes, so that it will bring the desired results. Fidelity to this public trust will encourage other Development Partners to collaborate with us on this venture.\n\n\u201cLet me also use this opportunity to call on well-meaning individuals and corporate bodies to come and partner with us and join us in this journey to take Ogun State to a greater and more prosperous heights\u201d, Abiodun submitted.",

          "title": "2023 PRESIDENCY: Northern PDP Aspirants Intensify Plan To Produce Next President",
          "text": "Seeking a consensus PDP presidential candidate for the 2023 general elections, four northern aspirants, Aminu Tambuwal, Bala Mohammed, Bukola Saraki and Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, visited former military President Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (IBB) to seek his support.\n\nApart from Hayatu-Deen, the others had individually visited IBB in the past to seek his endorsement. Almost everyone who aspires to be president has visited IBB for political patronage.\n\nOut of the 14 PDP presidential aspirants that have picked nomination forms, five are from the North; Tambuwal (North West); Saraki (North Central); Atiku, Bal Mohammed and Hayatu-Deen (North East).\n\nThe aspirants are engaged in intense consultations ahead of the June 4 INEC deadline for parties to produce their presidential flag bearers, amid the raging debate about zoning.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNorthern presidential aspirants on the platform of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have continued with their quest to ensure that the next president of Nigeria comes from their region.\n\nThe four aspirants, former Senate President Bukola Saraki, Bauch State Governor Bala Mohammed, his Sokoto State counterpart, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, and renowned banking guru, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen \u2013 are proceeding with their mission in spite of Southern governors\u2019 insistence that the next president should come from the South since the present president comes from the North.\n\nYesterday, the four Northern presidential hopefuls were at the hilltop home of former head of state, Gen Ibrahim Babangida (retd) in pursuit of their quest to have at a consensus aspirant from the North.\n\nTellingly, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar was not in attendance. Atiku was the PDP presidential candidate in the last general election and this is his sixth declaration for president.\n\nIn an earlier comment, the presidential aspirants said when they arrive at a consensus candidate, they would communicate their position to Atiku. They, however, had a closed-door meeting with Atiku earlier this week on the consensus issue.\n\nApart from Hayatu-Deen who recently joined the presidential race, the other four aspirants, Atiku, Saraki, Tambuwal and Bala Mohammed, had individually visited Babangida for endorsement.\n\nDuring their visit yesterday, Saraki explained their mission to the former military leader.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is that desire to make a better Nigeria that those of us who are aspiring to be president put our heads together that we must have a consensus so that we can reduce the number to ensure that a candidate that is most competent, who has the support of everybody else, emerges.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t do that just among us. We need leaders like Gen. Babangida here to also give us their own advice and bless the process. That\u2019s why we are here. We would be doing further consultations.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn his reply, General Babangida gave a tacit approval to the idea of consensus and praised them for putting the country first in their quest.\n\nHe told the delegation: \u201cI enjoyed meeting with you because I like what I heard. Your belief in the unity of this country is most paramount. Your belief in having a better Nigeria featured prominently in the course of your discussion. And You have made my day, that all you talked about was Nigeria, Nigeria, Nigeria,\u201d he declared.\n\n\u201cI want you to keep that one up for the benefit of this country and for the generations yet unborn. What you are doing is good. This is how the country should develop \u2013 consultations, compromises and so on. This is what will make the country go on. And, this is what you are trying to do. You will have our support as long as you will stay the course of promoting Nigeria all the time, making it a secure country.\u201d\n\nYoung Professionals Pick PDP Forms For Obi\n\nMeanwhile, vice presidential candidate of the PDP and former Anambra State governor, Peter Obi, has picked the PDP presidential forms for the 2023 election.\n\nThe expression of interest and nomination forms were purchased on his behalf by a group of his supporters under the aegis of Likeminds for Peter Obi, at the PDP national secretariat in Abuja yesterday.\n\nSpeaking for the group, Ekene Nwakuche, who said the group\u2019s members do not belong to any political party, added that Obi has what it takes to manage a country like Nigeria.\n\nNwakuche said the country needs a seasoned technocrat who can steer the affairs of the country in the right direction and cut down the cost of governance, explaining that the group was made up of professionals, businessmen, public servants, contractors, artisans and so on.\n\n\u201cWe have members from everywhere in Nigeria, we\u2019re fully represented. So, we want the country to move forward. We think Peter Obi can steer it forward and we believe in him because we\u2019ve seen what he did in Anambra when he was a governor,\u201d he said, adding that Obi has the wealth of experience to lead Nigeria to the promised land.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in this thing because of any gain. We\u2019re doing it because of our children to come, because if we don\u2019t get it right this time around, this 2023, I don\u2019t know where we\u2019ll be.\n\n\u201cEach of us here know how the country is and we want a better Nigeria. And I believe that if you\u2019re from Nigeria, be it from the north, south, east, west, and you know, you want a better Nigeria, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other person that you\u2019ll support than Peter Obi.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUrging the PDP to allow Obi to fly the flag of the party in the coming election, he pointed out that another non-partisan group, Take Back Nigeria, had earlier pledged to deliver 10 million youth votes to Obi if he emerges the PDP flag bearer.\n\nSaraki Visits Delta, Seeks Support of Delta PDP Delegates\n\nThe Abubakar Bukola Saraki Contact and Advocacy Council has declared that Dr Bukola Saraki will provide the right leadership for Nigeria especially at this point in time that the country is confronted with numerous challenges.\n\nSpeaking in Asaba, the Delta State capital, yesterday, the leader of the Council, Prof Iyorwuese Hagher, said the group was in Delta State to canvass support of the PDP delegates for actualisation of Saraki\u2019s presidential ambition in 2023.\n\nHagher, a former presidential aspirant himself, and high commissioner to Canada, said Saraki\u2019s ambition was a direct manifestation of a failed government occasioned by the ineptitude of the Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nHe said, \u201cAs governor of Kwara State, he has a track record; as Senate president, he has a track record, a record of doing the right thing. As president of this country, Saraki has the political will to implement the much-needed change Nigeria desires.\u201d\n\nIn his response, the chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Delta state, Chief Kingsley Esiso, said he had no doubt that Saraki was well-equipped to make a good president.\n\n\u201cHe (Saraki) is a man of intelligence and capacity. As the chairman of our party\u2019s reconciliatory committee, he has done very well to unite the party\u201d, the Delta PDP chairman said, adding that he would \u201crelate the message of the council to the leaders of the party and the governor of Delta State.\u201d",
          "summary": "Out of the 14 PDP presidential aspirants that have picked nomination forms, five are from the North; Tambuwal (North West); Saraki (North Central); Atiku, Bal Mohammed and Hayatu-Deen (North East).\nADVERTISEMENTNorthern presidential aspirants on the platform of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have continued with their quest to ensure that the next president of Nigeria comes from their region.\nAtiku was the PDP presidential candidate in the last general election and this is his sixth declaration for president.\nIn an earlier comment, the presidential aspirants said when they arrive at a consensus candidate, they would communicate their position to Atiku.\nAnd You have made my day, that all you talked about was Nigeria, Nigeria, Nigeria,\u201d he declared.",

          "text": "The federal government has made a policy volte face on the Ajaokuta steel rolling mill, saying the Buhari administration can no longer complete the project in 2022 as earlier promised.\n\nMinister of mines and steel development, Olamilekan Adegbite, disclosed this yesterday while addressing State House correspondents during the special weekly briefing coordinated by the presidential media team at the presidential villa.\n\nAccording to him, the Russia-Ukraine war and the COVID-19 pandemic have frustrated the project on several fronts despite the fact that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved $2 million for the project.\n\nThe minister who regretted that the company may not be fully revived under the current administration as earlier promised said, \u201cWhere we are today, we may not be able to get Ajaokuta to work but I pray that we can start something permanent. I\u2019ve said it before when we came back from Russia. Yes, I went to the public and said \u2018look, we will deliver Ajaokuta before the end of this tenure\u2019.\n\n\u201cAnd I pray that I\u2019ll have a chance to go back and apologise and explain what happened to the people before I leave office. It is due to no fault of ours. Everybody was ready to go, but unfortunately, COVID came in. So, it is a force majeure\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAdegbite further explained that the government moved to continue negotiations with Russia after the lockdown, but progress was again stalled due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn October 2019, Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari and Russia\u2019s Vladmir Putin met at the Russia-Africa Summit in Sochi and agreed to revive the uncompleted Ajaokuta steel mill but the project suffered force majeure due to COVID-19\u201d\n\nThough he did not name the British firm, the minister however stated that the arrangements with the Russian firm failed as the contract was awarded to a company with both Russians and Ukrainian interests.\n\nHe disclosed that the $2 million is safe in the federal government account, adding that \u201cthe money has not even been given to anybody.\n\n\u201cThe Russians can\u2019t get any payment now with the way things are happening in the world. All their accounts are blocked.\n\n\u201cSo, the $2 million is still with the federal government; it\u2019s just that the president has given the money for that purpose. We had started the process of procurement, then with this war; we can no longer go that way\u201d, he added.\n\nThe minister revealed that the British firm is offering to do it for Nigeria free now, noting that \u201cby the grace of God, we have started an irreversible process.\n\n\u201cThe problem with Ajaokuta is actually what we call force majeure. Nobody thought of the COVID, because the plan was to deliver Ajaokuta this year 2022,\u201d he added.\n\nOn his achievements in office, Adegbite said his ministry is currently working on projects across the six geopolitical zones which would be commissioned by July this year,\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe listed some of the projects to include the launch of made in Nigeria barite, establishment of mining-related clusters in the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria and Jewellery Making Training Center in Abuja where 45 students recruited from all the 36 States and FCT are being trained on Jewellery Making.\n\nAdegbite also revealed that the country had attained self-sufficiency in Barite production and would no longer need to import from October 2022.\n\nThe minister explained that the Buhari administration was doing everything within its powers to upgrade the sector.\n\nHe stated: \u201cWe are going to auction bitumen in June; this will bring a lot of money. A lot of foreign companies are showing interest in our bitumen. This is even better than bitumen is found in Canada.\n\n\u201cSo, we have a lot of Canadian companies who have shown interest, because Canada supplies the largest volume of bitumen to the world now. We have a lot of companies coming from Canada. They want to participate in our bitumen project that will create jobs, give value to the government, and of course, also help when it comes to our projects and road construction.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe are about to conclude the bitumen auction; we have completed the automation of the Mining Cadastre System to meet international full standards for online mining title and license applications and approvals.\u201d\n\nHe said the ministry also has a large scale gold production platform through the Segilola Gold project and proposed refining through Dukia Gold and Kian Smith.\n\n\u201cThe famous Ladi Kwali Pottery Center is being remodeled and resuscitated to train Nigerians in Modern pottery and ceramic works.\u201d\n\nAdegbite noted that the Nigeria Mining Development Company (NMDC) had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria (DICON) to produce alloys hitherto imported from China.\n\n\u201cUnder the MoU, Brass will be processed for Armament and Lead for Ammunition. We have repositioned the SMDF and we are finalizing an amendment to the act to further institutionalize the fund along global best practices\u201d, he noted.\n\nAdegbite revealed that Nigeria has commenced gold exports through the Segilola resource development, which is expected to export 100, 000 ounces of gold annually.\n\n\u201cTheir production capacity is 100,000 ounces per annum. You can plan on that. We know how much we are charging per ounce of gold at that rate. So you know that in a year, this is what we are expecting. We charge at 3 per cent but the price will vary because our price is based on the cost that is going at the international market, the New York exchange will quote the price of gold at any particular point in time.\n\n\u201cGold went as high as $2,500 per ounce at one point. And I think it is worth about $2,200 now on the stock exchange. So this is the price as used to calculate that,\u201d he said\n\nOn gold mining in Zamfara State, the minister said the government had halted mining activities in the area because the conflict went beyond mining.\n\nOn the government\u2019s effort against illegal mining, he said, \u201cWe try to nip them in the bud wherever they rear their heads. With the community reporting to us, we have a quick intervention force. We can\u2019t be proactive; it is too expensive to maintain. But we have a quick intervention force.\n\n\u201cIf we hear any mining happening in any nook and cranny, we move in there and dislodge them. Those that are arrested, we confiscate their equipment and they are prosecuted,\u201d the minister noted.\n\nThe minister disclosed that the government was reviewing the Mining Act, 2007 to bring it up to date, saying 44 solid minerals have been found in over 500 locations in Nigeria with many in commercial quantities.\n\nAccording to him, the mineral deposits are broadly categorized according to their uses into five groups.",

          "text": "House of Representatives yesterday abruptly adjourned plenary and suspended all legislative activities till next week to register displeasure over the recent killings in Kaduna State.\n\nThe House adjourned the plenary after intensive debate on the security situation in the country following a motion of urgent public importance moved by Shehu Balarabe, a member representing Birnin Gwari/Giwa federal constituency of Kaduna State.\n\nBalarabe lamented that armed bandits had in the last one week invaded the two local government areas he represents and killed scores, raped, maimed, displaced many and destroyed property worth millions of naira.\n\nWhile contributing to the motion, leader of the House, Alhassan Ado Doguwa, said Nigerians should be allowed to take up arms and defend themselves against gunmen attacks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDoguwa said there is a \u201cmonumental failure\u201d in the security architecture in the country.\n\n\u201cMr Speaker, I rise to speak in the capacity of the majority leader who of course is the ambassador of the government on this floor,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a government in place, the major responsibility of that government especially a democratic one that was elected by the people is to ensure the safety of lives and property of the innocent citizens. Mr Speaker, when things like this continue on daily basis those of us who are representatives of the government become speechless. We become speechless here to defend actions by the government. This is an elected government, under a popular democracy but day in, day out, there are killings, massacre, armed robbery all over. Left, right and centre.\n\n\u201cThis is a report from just one local government out of 774. Giwa local government and the case of Giwa is not just a new case, he (mover of the motion) is only giving us the most recent happening. Giwa has been engulfed by banditry and killings in the last two to three years.\n\n\u201cGiwa has coincidentally fallen in a state (Kaduna) where you have the representation of the Nigerian military and other security agencies \u2013 the highest place you can count is in the northern part of the country. Why should this thing continue to happen?\n\n\u201cThe government in this case has to rise to its responsibility. Call a spade, a spade.\n\nIf it is about funding, each of us here knows we have never had any cause to contemplate not funding our security agencies.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI believe our relevant committees are following up in terms of implementation of such funding through our budget, their oversight processes. Why should things continue this way? We are here for the Nigerian people and we must speak for Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said they cannot sit down and fold their arms, while the electorates that voted them into offices are being killed. He lamented the institutional and regimental failures, saying that the security agencies have no excuse for their failures. He noted that the House had always made sure that they got the funding they needed and wondered the reason why they have failed to protect the people.\n\n\u201cWith all sense of responsibility, with all sense of commitment, with the fact that yes, even after this world we shall all rise to answer our fathers\u2019 name in the next world to account for actions. I think Nigerians should at this moment be allowed to also take arms.\n\n\u201cNigerians must be allowed to take up arms in defence of their innocent souls, defend their hard-earned resources and properties because it is like a monumental failure.\n\n\u201cIf the agencies of security have failed, then Nigerians should not be seen as failures. Let Nigerians organise themselves in the way of civil defence. Let them organise and raise a defence for their innocent souls because if the responsibility of the government and the security agencies cannot be carried out democratically, then let\u2019s go to the jungle,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a member of the House, Hon Nasir Ahmed also called for the sack of the National Security Adviser (NSA), Maj-Gen. Babagana Monguno (rtd). Ahmed said, \u201cDo we have a national security adviser?\n\n\u201cAre we saying the army, the Nigerian navy, air force, police and DSS with all the training that they have had, with all the international training that they have gone to \u2014 they have gone to peacekeeping. That a ragtag army of 16 to 17 year-old-boys (bandits) is more powerful than them?\n\n\u201cMr Speaker this madness has to stop. It simply has to stop. You travel by road you\u2019re kidnapped; you go by train, you\u2019re kidnapped, last week the airport was attacked by bandits; you sit at home you\u2019re kidnapped, you send your children to school they are kidnapped. Mr Speaker a few weeks ago somebody was kidnapped in a hospital. Where are you going to stay? You can be kidnapped right in this chamber.\n\n\u201cWhat do we tell our people that elected us? Do we just fold our arms? I want to use this opportunity again and I am calling on the national security adviser \u2014 he must be removed.\u201d",

In addition, I have directed the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission to carry out an upward review of police salaries and benefits.\u201d\n\nHowever, 10 months after, the promise seems like a mirage and the junior officers are not taking it lightly as they have vowed to ensure that it\u2019s not another unfulfilled promise.\n\nThe leadership of the Force has consistently denied that conditions were as bad as were being presented by the junior officers, they have warned against a resort to any form of strike because of the dangerous implications.\n\nNPF\u2019s reaction\n\nReacting to the latest development via a telephone conversation with our correspondent, the NPF through the Deputy Force Public Relations Officer, CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, first denied any such proposal, saying, \u201cIt is stale news. There is no such plan by any police personnel from any quarters.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the salary increment is a federal government project. You should go to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Police Affairs to find out when the package will be implemented. It is not the IGP that is responsible for that.\u201d\n\nIn the beginning\n\nAt first, the police authorities denied any proposed strike by the rank and file, describing it as another fake news championed by the social media.\n\nHowever, in a document referenced 4001/AJR/NPF/ABJ/0l 7/188 addressed to the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali, the disenchanted policemen said, \u201cWe are not happy at all. Strike is the only language the Nigerian government understands. We, the junior officers, would stop going to our duty posts including those who are attached to politicians on and from the said date.\n\n\u201cOur demands include poor salaries, removal of police personnel from the devilish contributory pension scheme, and non-issuance of kits.\n\n\u201cWe also want the government to address non-payment of duty tour allowances, non-payment of course allowances, poor barracks accommodation, non-promotion as at when due.\n\n\u201cAlso, the National Housing Fund scheme has been deducting N3, 000 from our salaries for a long time now.\u201d\n\nIGP\u2019s reaction\n\nDespite earlier denying that the Force\u2019s personnel were planning to embark on strike over non-implementation of the new salary package, the IGP warned that any strike or disruption of law enforcement services would be treated as mutiny. He consequently issued a signal to respective police Commands via a wireless message dated March 15, 2022, with reference number, CB: 4001/DOPS/FHQ/ABJ/Vol, which urged heads of departments and state commissioners of police directing them to sensitise their officers on the dire consequences of going on strike as steps had been taken to address their concerns.\n\nThe signal read: \u201cIntelligence reports available to the Inspector General of Police indicate that some members of the rank and file are intending to embark on strike over non-payment of the new Police salary structure, and failure in providing sophisticated weapons to fight crime and poor general welfare of policemen.\n\n\u201cNote that the Inspector General of Police has directed the immediate computation of salary, under the new salary structure, tax relief/exemption for officers and men for immediate implementation.\n\nThe signal read: \u201cIntelligence reports available to the Inspector General of Police indicate that some members of the rank and file are intending to embark on strike over non-payment of the new Police salary structure, and failure in providing sophisticated weapons to fight crime and poor general welfare of policemen.\n\n\u201cNote that the Inspector General of Police has directed the immediate computation of salary, under the new salary structure, tax relief/exemption for officers and men for immediate implementation.\n\n\u201cDistribution of kits and other accoutrements have been initiated with Force Headquarters already concluded.\u201d\n\nAlso, Adejobi, who signed that signal, said: \u201cIt is pertinent to restate that the Nigeria Police Force is a regimented and disciplined organisation with laid down rules and guidelines for addressing grievances and in no circumstance is a strike action one of such means.\n\n\u201cThe men and women of the Nigeria Police Force are fully aware that a strike action or other deliberate disruption of law enforcement services by any security organisation is mutinous and the personnel of the Force would not degenerate at any point to that level of disloyalty and indiscipline, as policing services are paramount and essential in the maintenance of orderliness and peace in the nation.\u201d\n\nFour arrow heads summoned, detained, one on the run\n\nWeekend Blueprint can authoritatively report that the four officers including two Inspectors and Sergeants that spearheaded the threat to embark on strike have been arrested and detained for questioning for using a whatsApp group to incite public disorder. But one of the four is alleged to be at large.\n\nSpecifically, the charge said Inspector Raji Ibrahim and his colleagues were alleged to have used social media to incite members of the Force and the general public to public disorder and insubordination to constituted authorities. The summons said he and the other three were defaulted for the offence of discredited conduct, mutiny and disobedience to lawful order. Ibrahim, who serves in Osogbo and three others are those currently facing the music for using the social media to allegedly commit the aforementioned immoralities.\n\nOsun police PRO\u2019s declaration\n\nWhen contacted, the Osun Police Public Relations Officer, Yemisi Opalola, said investigation had begun on the allegation that led to the arrest of the officers.\n\nIt was gathered that the second key officer, an inspector that was fingered in the strike plan, had not been arrested and plans were still on to get him arrested.\n\nThe strike remains\n\nDespite the proactive actions taken to starve off the strike, a middle-level officer, who prefers not to be named, insisted that the strike was inevitable, but would take a form other than what was initially intended.\n\nThe DSP said: \u201cThere is no going back. It will hold no matter what the IGP does. He is only trying to save his job. The rank and file are ready to adopt the \u20182002 approach\u2019 that simply means some selected officers could be targeted and dealt with.\n\n\u201cYes, we shall be at our duty posts, but without doing any concrete work. The plan is to adopt the 2002 approach whereby the rank and file were seen at their duty posts, but without lifting a finger to do anything. Even then, some senior officers, who usually are lackadaisical on the matter of welfare for the rank and file, became sitting ducks and, therefore, were picked and dealt with at will. Don\u2019t be surprised if a similar method is adopted for effect.\n\n\u201cThose to effect the strike know they are being victimised, but are ready for the consequences. The members of the rank and file will not prevent anyone from going to work. No, they will go to work, but will do no actual work. Besides, by the time there are a few casualties among the senior ranks nobody will tell those concerned to act quickly. That is the language that our leaders understand.\n\n\u201cThe strike may not be strong in Abuja, but it wouldn\u2019t be so in other Commands. What happened in Zamfara where some rank and file silently carried out the strike last Saturday was to test the waters. When the signal to formally commence the no-work action is given it shall be smoothly done.\u201d\n\nThe source insisted that it is a matter of days before the reality of the threat would dawn on those concerned.\n\n\u201cWe are waiting for this month\u2019s salaries to be paid. Though they sometimes delay payment, we are hoping that between April 4 and 6, it should be paid. If not then those concerned would hear from us. Notwithstanding the threat to accuse anyone who engages in the strike of mutiny, there are determined ones among us who are willing and ready for any state craft that may be deployed to attempt to deny them of their rights.\n\n\u201cSince Ibrahim and others had the courage to speak up using social media, those who have hitherto been suffering in silence are now more determined not to keep quiet anymore. The situation is such that whether one speaks or keeps quiet the rank and file will be victimised and unless the supreme price is paid the maltreatment and injustice in the Nigerian Police will remain unabated.\n\nIGP\u2019s moves\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that NASS summoned the IGP and discussed what needed to be done, but it\u2019s all talk and no action \u2013 motion without movement. Whether the IGP issues a threat or not we are certain that those that will carry out the no-work action are ready despite the consequences.\n\n\u201cThe IGP, like his predecessor in 2002, is only trying to save his head. Well, since the government prefers the \u20182002 approach\u2019 we shall ensure a repeat of that episode where some officers were selected and dealt with. Maybe that\u2019s the language that the government understands.\n\n\u201cThe other ranks and file in the South-east, South-south, South-west, North-west and other Commands across the other geo-political divides are ready. I am sure you heard what happened silently in Zamfara state on Saturday, March 26, when some of our members quietly carried out the no-work exercise.\n\nGovt\u2019s threat\n\nThe DSP dismissed the threat as a lame-dog approach to solving serious security matters, stressing that the alleged plan by the government to charge anyone found to have been involved in the plan and the actual eventual execution of the strike for mutiny is an action with the potential to further weaken the feeble security in the country.\n\nOn red alert\n\nDespite denying knowledge of any planned strike, our correspondents gathered that all DPOs have been directed to ensure strict compliance.\n\nIt was further learnt that some administrators of groups of social media within the police stations, divisions and units have been warned against any mention of issues in connection with the planned strike.\n\nSome were queried, while others in order to avoid trouble with the police authorities have opted to exit the groups.\n\nAlso, all use of social media \u2013 whatsApp, facebook, Instagram, snapchat, Tik-tok and tweeter \u2013 for the purpose of sharing any information with respect to the proposed strike has been banned.\n\nAlso, the IGP has directed that a register be kept for the rank and file to mark their presence at their respective duty posts from 8.00m daily until the close of work.\n\nThis was particularly observed on the 26 and 27th of March 26 and 27, even though it was subsequently relaxed even as the rank and file are required to inform their superiors every hour about their whereabouts in addition to obtaining official permission if there is any reason to be absent at one\u2019s duty post.\n\nCommands\u2019 denials\n\nOur correspondents across some states sought to know what preparations the various Commands were making to starve off the strike, but the Commands denied knowledge of any plan to embark on no-work action by the rank and file.\n\nThe FCT Police Public Relations Officer, PSP Josephine Adeh, denied that there was any such arrangement to carry a work-to-rule action within the Command.\n\nAccording to her, the Command has not received any public notice to that effect and, therefore, cannot say such a rumoured plan is in the making.\n\n\u201cWe are not aware of any plan by the police to go on strike. The FCT Command is not aware of such a proposal. We have neither any public document nor heard about any such plan within the command. Again, we are not aware and therefore cannot make plans for what is not real,\u201d she said confidently.\n\nSimilarly, the spokesman of the Lagos state Command, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, said, \u201cI am just hearing that from you for the first time; I am not aware, whether you call it mutiny, protest or whatever name it is being called, I am not aware.\u201d\n\nLikewise, the Osun Police Public Relations Officer, Yemisi Opalola, gave the assurance that the officers would not go on strike.\n\nShe said, \u201cThere will not be any strike because the DIG has conveyed the plan of the Inspector General of Police to address the issue raised to the officers when he came to Osun recently.\n\n\u201cThey are seriously working to attend to the request of the police officers and I can assure you that the plan to embark on strike has been shelved.\u201d",
          "summary": "\u201cNote that the Inspector General of Police has directed the immediate computation of salary, under the new salary structure, tax relief/exemption for officers and men for immediate implementation.\n\u201cNote that the Inspector General of Police has directed the immediate computation of salary, under the new salary structure, tax relief/exemption for officers and men for immediate implementation.\nSpecifically, the charge said Inspector Raji Ibrahim and his colleagues were alleged to have used social media to incite members of the Force and the general public to public disorder and insubordination to constituted authorities.\nIt was gathered that the second key officer, an inspector that was fingered in the strike plan, had not been arrested and plans were still on to get him arrested.\nWhat happened in Zamfara where some rank and file silently carried out the strike last Saturday was to test the waters.",

These initiatives are commendable and I urge you to expand them and continue to prioritize Nigeria as you roll out your global initiatives,\u201d President Buhari was quoted as saying in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina.\n\nHe told the visiting Microsoft team that as the largest economy and most populous country in Africa, Nigeria was positioned to play a strategic role in the global technology ecosystem and seek the right partnerships to harness the potentials.\n\nThe President added that one of such key partnerships was in the area of capacity building.\n\nAccording to him, his administration has shown great commitment in providing a conducive environment for investors and the massive jump in the Global Ease of Doing Business Ranking was proof that the efforts were yielding positive results.\n\n\u201cOur emphasis on the development of our Digital Economy has also positioned the sector as a prominent factor in the Nigerian economy. As the fastest growing sector of the Nigerian economy in 2020, the Information and Communications Technology sector played a very important role in supporting our country to exit the recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe are keen to build on the momentum as we continue to implement our National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy, along with other related policies.\u201d\n\nApart from partnerships in the area of skills building, President Buhari said he looked forward to further partnerships that will support the digital infrastructure and innovation ecosystem, with regard to emerging technologies.\n\n\u201cI believe that this meeting will provide an opportunity to discuss how the Nigerian government can support the growth of your business here and how Microsoft can contribute to the growth of our economy through the active support of our policies and programmes,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nPresident Buhari said he launched the Nigerian National Broadband Plan on the 19th of March 2020, with the aim of expanding broadband access across Nigeria and Microsoft\u2019s connectivity initiative aligns with the plan.\n\n\u201cI believe it would be very useful and mutually beneficial to both Microsoft and Nigeria if your connectivity project is expanded beyond the current four locations in this country.\n\n\u201cEmerging technologies play a key role in digital transformation in the Fourth Industrial Revolution and a number of indigenous companies have developed very useful solutions. We are willing to partner with Microsoft to make Nigeria the epicenter for innovative emerging technology in Africa.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe President commended the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy and all industry stakeholders for their support for the sector.\n\n\u201cIn order to sustain the momentum, I further direct that you and other stakeholders in the technology ecosystem keep government fully informed of your ongoing and proposed activities that support the growth of our digital economy.\n\n\u201cWe have the potential of becoming your most lucrative market in Africa. As such, we urge you to continue to support the development of our digital economy. We also urge you to step up your Corporate Social Responsibility programmes and support for Research and Development that will enhance your services in Nigeria and on the African continent,\u2019\u2019 the President said.\n\nIn his remarks, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy said he represented President Buhari at the commissioning of the African Development Centre, adding that Microsoft had over 200 Nigerians working for them in the country, and Seattle.\n\nProf. Pantami noted that 320,000 Nigerians have also been trained on digital skills by the technology company.\n\nThe President of Microsoft and Vice Executive Chairman said the company will keep creating jobs to help build technology that will change the world, noting that the \u201cmulti-tasking approach\u2019\u2019 also stretches to digital infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe pledge to train five million people in Nigeria in the future,\u2019\u2019 Smith said, noting \u201c60,000 people had already enrolled for courses while 300,000 had completed various courses.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe President of Microsoft said the company had gone into partnership with other companies to increase Internet and broadband penetration, while efforts have been advanced in innovating technology that will fight corruption and preserve cultural heritages, like languages.",

Saheed Popoola Adekeye from APC to SDP is deemed to have been automatically vacated by him since there is no division in the party on which platform he won the election in 2019,\u201d the Speaker wrote.\n\nThe letter has been acknowledged by the INEC.\n\nThe declaration of the seat as vacant joins several of such developments across the country, including recent court judgments on the issue.\n\nThe Supreme Court had held in several judgments that a political party can only be said to be divided where there are multiple national leaderships within the same party as a result of intractable crisis, brushing aside arguments that contentions at state or level levels could constitute such divisions on which elected office holders could base their defection.",
