          "text": "The Nigerian Hunters Council says the National Assembly is considering a bill that will transform local hunters into law enforcement officers like the police and the NSCDC.\n\nOn Monday, Commander-General of the council, Joshua Osatimehin, urged the parliament to speed up the process of ensuring that the Nigerian Hunters Council bill 2020 becomes a law.\n\n\u201cThis bill will give the council a legal backing critical in combating crime. What we are doing here today is our personal efforts. We have our headquarters and offices in the 36 states of the federation. What we want the government to do is to recognise hunters as a security agency in Nigeria,\u201d he stated at the end of a five-day capacity training for over 7,000 personnel of the NHC on corporate safety and conservation.\n\nSpeaking further, he noted, \u201cIf this can be recognised by an enabling law, crimes and criminality will be drastically reduced in Nigeria. The bill has passed first and second reading and the public hearing at the senate. Any moment from now, we expect it to be passed into law, and we will not relax until government gives us the enabling law.\u201d\n\nMr Osatimehin urged the government, given the current security challenges in Nigeria, \u201cthere is an urgent reason why Nigeria should incorporate the hunters\u2019 council into the security architecture of the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have had series of training from the Nigerian police force, under inter-agency collaboration, and we have also had lectures from the Department of State Security (DSS) on discipline and understanding national security,\u201d he disclosed. \u201cAlso, the Nigerian Army was here too to lecture us on how hunters can play their role in tackling insecurity, especially in the forests.\u201d\n\nGovernor Babagana Zulum of Borno underscored the importance of having local hunters in tackling insecurity.\n\nRepresented by his senior special adviser on security, Bello Matawalle, Mr Zulum pledged the support of the Borno government to the hunters to advance their cause. According to him, they know the terrain and can provide the required information to surmount the challenges posed by insecurity, especially in Borno.\n\n(NAN)",

A phone app specific for folks that are unbanked will be rolling out very soon, considering the fast follow-up from us.\n\n\u201cSo that is how we see the financial inclusion question coming through. As far as interest goes, it is hard to say this early what the interest is. I imagine that the concept has a newness to it; people want to understand the inner workings of it and what to use it for.\u201d\n\nAccording to the CEO, launching the eNaira app was challenging, but the company relied on its past digital currency experience in Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean.\n\nPopelka added, \u201cIt is a sort of methodological rollout. We like the idea that there are stages. Nigeria has a very foursome rollout for all of the users for which we hope to get to over the course of many years, which means that they and we, of course, are in it for the long haul.\n\n\u201cPost-launch though, as you can imagine, as the initial rollouts, it is really just sign-ups. Well, the central bank has minted and disbursed digital currencies to several key financial institutions. And therefore, there are merchants and consumers that are really just getting into the app store, downloading the app, and moving their traditional currencies into digital format at this stage.\u201d\n\nPopelka said the government would not be able to access the individual purchase histories of individuals using the eNaira app but would able to access bulk transaction histories.\n\nHe added that banks would have access to individual transactions in order to track fraud.\n\nAccording to the CEO, financial institutions have a role to play in ensuring more people trust and use the digital currency.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Lucky Irabor\n\n*Hails improved synergies among Nigerian Army,Air Force, Navy, others\n\n*To launch Troops Support Initiative for Army\n\nBy Joseph Erunke\n\nABUJA\u2013THE Global Peace and Life Rescue Initiative,GOPRI,a civil society group with vested interest in peace building in Nigeria,has commended the Chief of Defence Staff,Lt. General Lucky Irabor, for effectively leading the policy and operational initiative in the counterterrorism warfare.\n\nThe group also hailed the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Farouq Yahaya, for \u201cliving up to expectations of Nigerians within the few months of his appointment by President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO:Reps call for probe of raid on Justice Mary Odili\u2019s residence\n\nGOPRI,in a statement, Tuesday, however regretted that \u201cin spite of the tremendous achievements being recorded by the Nigerian Military, saboteurs were busy instigating the public with the view of painting negative pictures about the Nigerian Military,especially the Army.\u201d\n\nTo this end,the group,in the statement by its Executive Director,Amb. Melvin Ejeh, has vowed to support the military with initiative aimed at not only boosting its morale in the counterterrorism war but also change public perception about it.\n\nGOPRI\u2019s statement came ahead of its launch of a support project,tagged: \u201cTroop Support Initiative.\u201d\n\nThe group noted that \u201cLt. General Farouq Yahaya,within few months of being on the saddle as Chief of Army Staff,has recorded commendable successes in the fight against terrorism, banditry and other forms of criminality across the country.\u201d\n\nGOPRI explained that the initiative was aimed at rallying support for the Nigerian Military, \u201cparticularly the Nigerian Army in their continuous selfless roles to keep our dear and beloved country united.\u201d\n\nEjeh described GOPR as \u201ca registered indigenous Non-Governmental Organisation, with focus on peace-building, de-radicalization and community resilience architecture in North Central, North East, South East communities in particular and Nigeria at large.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince inception, GOPRI with over 22 members of staff and over 5000 volunteers across the country and the Sahel, has according to its mandate, continued to promote lasting peace through advocacy, medical outreaches and capacity building workshops as well as economic empowerment touching over 36,060 ( thirty-six thousand and sixty) persons,\u201dhe said.\n\nThe statement explained:\u201dAs a civil society group with vested interest in peace building in Nigeria, we wish to commend the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Farouq Yahaya ,over the achievements recorded by the Army, the military and other security agencies against terrorism, banditry and criminality in the country so far.\n\n\u201cGOPRI, in line with the revolutionary vision of the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Farouk Yahaya, which is building \u201cA professional Nigerian Army Ready To Accomplish Assigned Missions Within A Joint Environment In Defence of Nigeria\u201d,wishes to inform you of our support initiative,tagged, Troops Support Initiative.\n\n\u201cThis programme is the first phase of a civil society initiative to attract unbiased supports for the Nigeria Army and our military who are working tirelessly and sacrificially in the defence of our dear nation. This initiative becomes not only imperative but also expedient because of continuous, deliberate malicious,cyber,physical and emotional coordinated attacks on our Army.\u201d\n\nDescribing the Nigerian Army as \u201cone that has earned its place in the enviable rank of world\u2019s bests in terms of professionalism, courage, resilience and combat efficiency, with glowing tributes from her regional and global peace- keeping outings, as well as the management of the hydra-headed monster of insecurity within her borders\u201d, the group noted that:\u201d The Army deserves every accolade, encomium and support.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, factors such as misguided social media reports, activities of desperate politicians\u2019 inadequate media coverage, to ethnic, religious, political sentiment, some international media conspiracies have contributed immensely in giving the Army an unfair outlook.\n\n\u201cThis is despite the unquantifiable sacrifice of our gallant officers and soldiers in the discharge of their sworn duties of protecting the nation\u2019s territorial integrity,\u201dit regretted.\n\n\u201cOwing to the negative public perceptions about the Nigerian Army which has been orchestrated by false narratives in some quarters, we are today, launching a programme tagged: \u201cTroops Support Initiative\u201d to project the service in good light, with a view to changing the long-held negative perception about the Nigeria Army,\u201dit said.\n\nThe statement read:\u201dIt has become worrisome to us that some international organisations and local news media agencies have deliberately targeted the Army in their blackmails aimed at setting the Nigerian public in particular and the outside world in general against the Nigerian Army despite their successes and sacrifices for the unity of the country.\n\n\u201cWe are, therefore, calling on all Nigerians, home and in the diaspora,to come together irrespective of their political, religious and ethnic differences to support our Army and other security agencies in the fight against crimes and insurgents in the interest of national unity. This is most important given that we have not just one country but also one Army.\n\n\u201cThe proposed initiative will deepen civil-military relationship and foster a positive and more balanced public perception of the Army.\n\n\u201cSome Nigerians have constituted themselves as the mouthpieces of the criminals,insurgents and bandits, hence the urgent need for this self-sponsored efforts through troop support programme to tell the untold story of our Army with a view to galvanizing well-meaning Nigerians to support our Army.\n\nWe do not have another Army and country.\n\n\u201cThese deliberate attempts by these adversaries and their agents to discredit the Nigerian military in the fight against insurgency, terrorism and criminality in the country should and must be resisted.\n\n\u201cWe urge the Nigerian Army not to be deterred in its ongoing efforts to rid the country of terrorism and other forms of criminal acts in the country.\n\n\u201cit is high time the negative perceptions about the Nigerian Army and its troops was stopped in view of \u201cthe giant strides of the Nigerian Army in the direction of peace.\u201d\n\nIt further read:\u201dThe Global Peace and Life Rescue Initiative (GOPRI), strongly commends the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Farouk Yahaya, over the Nigerian Army success so far under his dynamic leadership.\n\n\u201cGeneral Farouq Yahaya\u2019s evolutionary vision to work towards building professional Nigerian Army ready to accomplish assigned missions within a joint environment in defence of Nigeria, is both apt and timely.\n\n\u201cThe Troops Support Project, we believe, will help in the realization of the above mandate.\n\n\u201cIn this 21st Century service delivery, public image and perception are key ingredients. Today\u2019s Nigeria is witnessing the colossal sacrifice of the Nigerian Army being gradually swallowed up by wrong perception, as false narratives are constantly sponsored in the media and general conversations by agents of disunity and some uninformed Nigeria\u2019s hence this programme intends to bridge that gap.\n\n\u201cThe project will involve radio programmes, community sensitization via town hall and village meetings, campus tours, world class movie that will be aired on notable national, Africa and world class television channels, documentaries and music videos, social media campaigns as well as an annual Nigerian Army Troops Celebration Day Programme.\n\n\u201d This, we believe, will boost the morale of service men and re-engineer community support and collaboration towards sustainable peace and national unity in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe wish to use this medium to further commend the Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor for his visionary leadership which is seeing the Armed Forces of Nigeria and other security agencies working in closer synergy than ever before. We also commend him for his initiative to reaching out to the retired veterans who are now part of the scheme in peace building within their communities.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we wish to express our gratitude to the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Isiaka Oladayo Amao as well as the Chief of Naval Staff, Rear Admiral Awwal Zubairu Gambo, for their synergies in dealing decisively with trouble makers and proving nay-sayers and enemies of our dear nation wrong by downgrading the Boko Haram/ISWAP insurgency and rooting out banditry.\n\n\u201cTo our troops, we cannot thank you enough for your sacrifices. This is why we must support you in your selfless efforts to rid out the nation of insecurity. We cannot wait for you to finish your mission in the frontline and return to your families in the barracks.\u201d\n\nHe called on \u201cNigerians to demonstrate love for our troops bearing in mind the fact that without our troops, we are finished. We must do away with every form of negativities and change our mind-set in other to have a more peaceful and safe country.\u201d",

We know exactly what we are in at the moment; there is so much crisis in everything; crisis in security, crisis in the economy and a lot of people are truly very hungry.\n\n\u201cThe number of the poor people is growing by the day and the youths are becoming very restive and they are no longer comfortable with the country they call their own.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at all these things, with the fact that the economy is nose-diving everyday and when you look at the kind of budget that is being presented to Nigerians, there is cause to worry that it is not something that can actually take us in the right direction.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of issues and most practically, the insecurity issue in the land which is growing worse by the day, and that is beginning to impact negatively on production, in terms of agricultural produce and that is not good enough for our country.\n\n\u201cFrom real insecurity we may find ourselves in the next few years going into food insecurity and that will probably be the worse of everything we can have as a nation.\n\n\u201cSo, looking at the totality of all these, you will definitely agree with me on the need to re-jig the pathway that we are toeing at the moment.\n\n\u201cIt is not the best for us and I think it\u2019s agreeable by all Nigerians that something needs to be done; that\u2019s why we have presented ourselves as a credible alternative to take Nigeria back to the path of progress; to take Nigeria back to a situation where people can begin to build hope for tomorrow,\u201d he said.\n\nOn why former President Goodluck Jonathan was absent at convention, Okowa explained that the former president was duly invited but was unavoidably absent because of prior engagements outside the country.\n\nHe said the PDP remained cohesive and united, adding that \u201cwe are working together with the leaders and founders of the party, and we agreed that we will continue to keep ourselves together for the huge task ahead.\u201d\n\nOn alleged dominance of the party by the Governors and why the leaders chose Senator Iyorchia Ayu as National Chairman, Okowa said that the party looked for someone with a command structure and reasonability of enough administrative capacity which Ayu possessed.\n\n\u201cIn the North, there was a lot of consultation with different leaders where the name of Senator Ayu was presented and finally accepted.\n\n\u201cThe person of the national chairman comes with a very high level of integrity, high level of experience, with the necessary command structure and a reasonable administrative background that can truly help to keep the party united on the rescue mission.\n\n\u201cGovernors as leaders of the party in their various states have the right to stick together and provide guidance for the party and I believe that we are doing our best to provide leadership and guidance to the party in the absence of a president.\n\n\u201cI still think that the governors tried their best to give guidance since we don\u2019t have a president somebody must lead and we have been trying to lead; it had to be collective leadership to get to where we are. If we left it loose it will be a ship without a captain,\u201d he said.\n\nOn why PDP will win the APC in 2023, Okowa said: \u201cWe are not competing with them anymore because looking through the years of the PDP and that of the APC of about six years plus the difference is clear; Nigerians are able to see for themselves.\n\n\u201cThough things were very difficult, we were able to build a foundation during Obasanjo\u2019s administration. The reverse is the case in this present administration in such a manner that is not good for our nation.\n\n\u201cThe level of insecurity, the economy today, the naira-to-dollar situation, indeed, there are too many issues.\n\nWe are getting to a stage now where there is shortage of food for the middle class, not to talk of the low class.\n\n\u201cThe high level of unemployment has become unbearable. Farmers cannot even access their farms. We have gotten it all wrong in this current administration, and I believe that Nigerians know the truth.\n\n\u201cNigerians know that PDP will do a lot better than APC; there is no competition, no comparing, it is quite clear that we are not moving in the right direction under the APC government.\u201d",

It started as conflicts between farmers and cattle herders but has snowballed into terrorism.\n\n\u201cAccording to an American Security Project Report (2021), 200,000 people have fled their communities in Northern Nigeria this year, with 77,000 of them crossing the border in search of safer abodes outside the country.\n\n\u201cIn November 2020, bandits reportedly stormed Asaba, the Delta State Capital killing two persons who were praying in their homes, but did not take anything from them. It was learned that the bandits also abducted a 10-year-old boy identified as Chimerezie Izu, when his mother could not meet their demands.\n\n\u201cIn May 2021, suspected armed bandits ambushed the Umutu Police Station, Ukwani LGA of Delta State, killing up to three security force members.\n\n\u201cIn September 2021, it was reported, some bandits who allegedly kidnapped and killed two people in the Isoko community in Delta State have been apprehended and subsequently burnt alive by aggrieved youths in the locality.\n\n\u201cIn April 2019, armed bandits reportedly inflicted machete injuries on three police officers attached to Delta State Police Command, State Headquarters Asaba, dispossessing them of two rifles.\n\n\u201cIn January 2020, some bandits attacked some personnel of the Delta State Police Command, who were on a stop-and-search duty in Asaba and left about three Policemen with varying degrees of injury amongst others,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is our submission that these bandits are predominantly foreigners who penetrate the porous Nigerian borders with Niger Republic and the Chad basin, fuels attacks in the north-west, north-East of Nigeria before migrating to the South including Delta State to perpetuate more havoc.\n\n\u201cIt is frustrating that the Federal Government cannot boldly identify all persons living in Nigeria, this is where the lacuna is being created and fully capitalized upon by these foreign criminals.\n\n\u201cThe Police is left floating in the air with no database to explore, hence, we are by this press statement urging the C-G NIS to do the needful by ensuring that all foreign nationals living in Delta State, in particular, are properly documented with a residence permit.\u201d",

Several people were trapped in the ill-fated building.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nAs at press time, four persons were rescued sustaining varying degrees of injuries.\n\nSympathisers trooped to the scene to catch a glimpse or to have first-hand information of the tragedy, while others rushed down to render one assistance or the other.\n\nMany people, particularly women, betrayed their emotion and wept openly seeing the dead bodies being pulled out from the rubble.\n\nCoordinator, Lagos Territorial Office of National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Mr. Ibrahim Farinloye, confirming the casualties, said that the bodies were moved to the state government hospital\u2019s morgue, while rescue operation continued.\n\nAll the deceased were pulled out from the rubble with the help of first-hand responders and voluntary workers.\n\n\u201cWe are deploying Disaster Response Unit of the Nigerian Army and the Nigertian Air Force to assist in the rescue operation,\u201d Farinloye said.\n\nHe also disclosed that the four victims who were trapped were rescued and taken to the hospital for medical attention.\n\nSpokesperson of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Mr. Nosa Okunbor, also confirmed the incident.\n\nHe assured residents that the agency in collaboration with other rescue agencies was on top of the situation.\n\nAccording to some residents of the area, there were tens of construction workers in the building before it collapsed.\n\nResidents and other eyewitnesses accused the emergency responders for not storming the scene on time. The concerned Nigerians argued that if help had come the way of the trapped victims, many of them could have remained alive.\n\nDirector-General, LASEMA, Dr Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, supervised the rescue operation. He insisted that the agency rushed to the scene and heavy-duty equipment and life detection equipment were swiftly deployed for thorough rescue operation.\n\nHe said: \u201cCollapsed Building at Gerard Road, Ikoyi: The agency has activated its emergency response plan to the above incident.\n\n\u201cAll first responders are en route to secure the scene while the heavy-duty equipment and life detection equipment have been dispatched.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Babafemi Hamzat, the Commissioner for Special Duties and Intergovernmental Relations, its counterpart, Commissioner for Physical Planning visited the scene of the incident.\n\nThe DG of LASEMA was ground to oversee the rescue operation of his\n\nMeanwhile, it was also confirmed that one of Nigeria\u2019s celebrated developers, Mr. Femi Osibona, died in the rubble of the building collapse.\n\nOsibona, the MD of Fourscore, was the brain behind 360 Degrees Towers in Ikoyi. He was reportedly on a visit to the site when it collapsed.\n\nThe impact of the collapse caused pandemonium in the area, which forced people to scamper for safety.\n\nOther first responders, including policemen, officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Lagos State Traffic Management Agency (LATSMA), Lagos Fire Service, Nigeria Red Cross Society, and others were at the scene to render different assistance. Medics from the State Ambulance Service, (LASEMBUS) were also on the ground.\n\nAll the agencies took over the scene to avoid clashes between street urchins who were making the place rowdy preventing emergency organizations who were on rescue and recovery operation from discharging their duties.\n\n\u201cRescue operation has commenced. Four persons have been rescued and they are being treated by the medical crew of the Lagos State Emergency Ambulance Service (LASEMBUS). We are on ground and we must finish the work today because we don\u2019t want the repeat of what happened in Synagogue Church where it took emergency agencies eight days to finish the recovery,\u201d Farinloye.\n\nPolicemen from the Area A Command and Ikoyi Police Station, were said to have arrived the scene early but they were overwhelmed by the surging crowd which forced the police to call for reinforcement from other formation.\n\nThe rescued victims were rushed to an undisclosed hospital for medical attention.\n\nA witness, Emmanuel Sanda, told Daily Sun that: \u201cthere is strong indication that the owner of the building is among many of the construction workers trapped under the rubble. Some people said he is the owner, others said he is fronting for someone, but we know him as the owner. We saw him few minutes before the building collapsed, so we are suspecting that he is under the place\u201d.\n\nSanda said that the police clashed with some people who claimed that they were Journalists who came to cover the story and some street urchins,\u201d when the clash was becoming so tensed, the police had to call in the military, who have cordoned off the area to ward off attacks.\n\n\u201cIn fact, when the building collapsed, we first scampered for safety because we thought it was bomb explosion. We later came back and started calling all the emergency numbers that we had. We were lucky to get the police who arrived and started calling emergency agencies\u201d.\n\nAn unconfirmed letter that went viral yesterday by Prowess Engineering Limited dated February 20, 2020 and signed by the Managing Director of the company, Muritala Olawale, addressed to Fourscore Heights Limited, revealed how the former withdrew its structural consultancy service from the building project that came crashing yesterday.\n\nIt read in part: \u201cWe can guarantee the integrity of the first two buildings and also works done up to the fourth floor of the third building supervised by us provided specifications have been met in terms of the required concrete strength.\n\n\u201cAlso note that we are not taking responsibilities of any other construction errors that may have occurred over time on the project.\u201d\n\nTelephone calls made by the reporters to the phone numbers on the letter could not connect, as they were switched off as at the time of filing this report.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

One of the member confirmed to journalists that they were dropped off at \u201ca certain location\u201d within the Jos metropolis.\n\nThe security team led by the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ebuka and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps Commandant, Alexander Barunde had profiled the lawmakers before leading them into police vehicles.\n\nThose whisked away were minority leader, Peter Gyendeng; deputy minority leader, Philip Dasun; Dalyop Fom; Daniel Nanbolistic; Pirglfa Tyem; Sochang Zintim; Musa Aga; Bala Fwangji and Henry Longs.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nLast week, six members of the House had allegedly impeached Abok and replaced him with Yakubu Sanda while 14 members of the House reconvened and suspended the new speaker with the six members. They also declared Abok as authentic speaker.\n\nHowever, residents of Plateau, woke up yesterday to be greeted with news of pandemonium at the Assembly, as Abok and lawmakers loyal to him had entered the complex and held an executive session in his office preparatory for a sitting. As this was going on, some youths staged a protest in front of the Assembly complex in support of Abok.\n\nEbuka, the police boss, told journalists after picking up the lawmakers that that they were going to another venue to continue with discussions they started in the speaker\u2019s office. The police officer said the lawmakers were not under arrest and assured of their safety. He said they would address the press when the discussions were concluded.\n\nThe embattled speaker said he would also address journalists at the end of the meeting.\n\nThe youths who were protesting in front of the complex in his support were later dispersed with tear-gas by security personnel.\n\nA source told Daily Sun that Governor Lalong had intervened in the crisis by requesting both Abok and Sanda to step down for the House to elect a new leader.\n\nAbok and members behind him have, however, resisted plots to have him vacate the position saying the governor had no right to interfere in matters affecting the House.\n\nFollowing the arrest of Abok and his loyalists, the new Speaker, Sanda, reconvened with 11 members.\n\n\u201cWe had a sitting last week where Abok was impeach by 16 out of 24 members of the House.\n\n\u201cThirteen members were present during the sitting contrary to the stories going round that we were six while three members signed the impeachment notice to get the require two-third majority. The former Speaker, Nuhu Abok, has congratulated me and I want to inform Plateau people that I am the new Speaker.\u201d\n\nHowever, a source told our reporter that Governor Lalong has intervened in the leadership crisis and had requested that both Abok and Sanda step aside and allow the House to elect a new speaker.\n\nMeanwhile, the lawmakers in a video recorded in the chamber of the House and made available to journalists, have appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari and Plateau elders to end what they call \u201cthe impunity and the siege on the Assembly by security personnel.\u201d\n\nDeputy Majority Leader of the House, Philip Dasun, said Abok remained the speaker.\n\n\u201cWe the 12 members are supporting Abok Ayuba, the Speaker, Plateau State House of Assembly, that was duly elected by constitutional provision. As you can see his picture is still on the wall not tampered with, his name tag is still intact, the mace is still here to tell you that there was only an attempted impeachment, our speaker was not impeached, whatsoever. We are only calling for attention from the governor of this state to disregard any illegal speaker presented to him and authorise the legitimacy of the speaker unanimously voted by 24 members of this Assembly. We are calling on government to reinstate our speaker, he has been firm, he has been dogged and he stood for the people of Plateau.\u201d\n\nDasun, who is also the Chairman, House Committee on Information and Communication, called on all well meaning Nigerians to intervene in the situation.\n\nHe thanked civil society organisations, youths, the Christian Association of Nigeria(CAN) and the Jama\u2019atul Nasri Islam(JNI) for their support.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

I was trying to plug my phone and not up to five seconds that I left the spot, I saw the building coming down and I ran to safety. We have a lot of people trapped in the rubble, who we need to bring out.\n\n\u201cWhen the incident happened, we brought out six dead bodies and we still have like 30 Togolese and Nigerian bricklayers and four engineers and other workers. My boss, Mr Femi, is still trapped in the building. He was on the 18th floor with some of his clients, who wanted to buy the building, when the incident happened.\u201d\n\nA resident, Morris Ashiobi, said the building did not show any sign before it caved in.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhen the incident happened, I was the first person to climb the building to the last floor and I saw corpses. I started calling people to come and rescue others. We recovered six dead bodies, rescued one, while the rest are still under the rubble.\n\n\u201cThe building didn\u2019t give any sign, it just came down. We were still working on it. It took an hour before the emergency agencies came and we had brought out the dead bodies and rescued one person before they came. If I\u2019m not mistaken, about 40 persons were on site, because we were working at the time. Some people came from Abuja today (Monday) to work. I have many friends still trapped in the building.\n\n\u201cWhen the police came, they chased us out and didn\u2019t allow us to rescue anyone again; if they had allowed us, we would still have rescued more people.\u201d\n\nLagos State Police boss, Mr.Hakeem Odumosu, confirmed the death of five persons as at Monday while three others were rescued.\n\nHowever, the South-West Coordinator of the National Emergency Management Agency, Ibrahim Farinloye, said four corpses were recovered from the building, adding that four were rescued.\n\nEmergency responders at the scene include the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, National Emergency Management Agency, Lagos State Traffic Management Authority, Lagos State Fire Service, Federal Road Safety Corps, police, army and paramedics.\n\nSee Photos\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Chief Executive officer Nigeria Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), Engr. Gbenga Komolafe, has approved the immediate promotion of 195 members of staff of the new commission, as a first step to stave off any industrial action and boost the dwindling revenue from the oil sector.\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday following the approval of the promotion exercise, Komolafe said, \u201chuman capital is critical and essential element of factors of production staff need to be happy before they can work and we had assured them of the determination of the Federal Government to look after their welfare. It is only when staff are happy that we can talk of improving our crude oil production quota, which is presently below what we should be producing\u201d.\n\nThe NUPRC boss said, \u201cI have ensured immediate approval for promotion of 195 union staff that have been stagnated in the defunct Department of Petoleum Resoirces (DPR) to stave off industrial crisis that could further harm the low daily oil production in Nigeria and worsen the nations federation generated oil revenue.\u201d\n\nKomolafe noted that the decision to promote the staff followed \u201cmy engagements and assurances to the agitated staff\u201d, adding that the measure \u201cwas also to boost staff morale and to ensure that the staff are not short changed in the unfolding transition and manpower reorganisations in line with the PIA\u201d.\n\nHe noted that \u201cthere is positive correlation between boosting nations crude production for optimised federation revenue and elevated staff morale in NUPRC\u201d.\n\nRe-emphasizing the critical and significant moment in the oil and gas sector of the economy, especially the call for divestments in the sector by key global stakeholders, Komolafe added that \u201cthe best and only option opened to us to maximize the benefits from fossil fuels is to improve the welfare of those who are saddled with the responsibilities of managing the sector. So what we have done is by extension to improve the nation\u2019s revenue by increasing crude oil production from the current level of 1.4 mbbls/d to 2.4 mbbls/d\u201d.\n\nHe urged the staff to reciprocate the gesture with enhanced service delivery in their determination to leave a legacy of 21st century regulator business enabler commission.\n\nKomolafe had last week during a podcast to staff across the country said, \u201cwe shall be fair to all and sundry in our leadership approach, we shall do all in our capacity to address issues of worker\u2019s welfare and give priority to good industrial relations.

          "title": "At Arise News Debate, Soludo, Uba, Ozigbo Spar on Agenda for Anambra",
          "text": "\u2022How candidates played up cards on security, environment and economy\n\nEmmanuel Addeh, Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Vanessa Obioha\n\nThe three frontrunners in next Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Anambra State, yesterday, faced off at a debate organised by Arise Television, sparring over their agenda for the state.\n\nIt was an initiative supported by a pro-rights group, \u201cEnough is Enough.\u201d\n\nCandidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Professor Charles Soludo, his rival in the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Andy Uba, and their counterpart in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Valentine Ozigbo, spoke on how they intended to improve the deteriorating security situation as well as revamp the education, environment and the health sectors in the state.\n\nSoludo, a former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), given his background, was expectedly big on data, while Uba leveraged his experience as a politician, and Ozigbo, a chartered accountant, sold himself as the most youthful and untainted of the trio, having never been in government.\n\nOn the regional agitation by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), all the candidates declined to take sides or condemn the proscribed group.\n\nSoludo, who restated his position as a pan-Nigerian Igbo, however, insisted that the reasons for the agitation by the group needed to be discussed, rather than the deployment of force. He noted that he was on record as having visited Nnamdi Kanu at Kuje prison to dialogue with him and asked for his release, adding that he believes in a democracy, everything should be put on the table.\n\n\u201cThere is a consensus that we need to have a dialogue on IPOB,\u201d Soludo declared.\n\nUba noted that the secessionists had become very vocal because of growing unemployment, while Ozigbo held the view that the popularity of IPOB was clearly due to leadership failure.\n\nDuring the debate anchored by former Presidential Adviser, Dr. Reuben Abati, and Ngozi Alaegbu, both of Arise TV, Soludo maintained that what Anambra needed at the moment was a transformational leader, with an unblemished record of public service.\n\nDescribing himself as a village boy, Soludo recalled that in his 30s, he accomplished virtually everything he needed to accomplish, including consulting for over 20 international institutions, serving three governors, and being bestowed with the third highest national honour in the country due to his track record in public service. He explained that following his global and national experiences, it was time to come home and give back to the Anambra people the kind of modern, 21st century life, they deserved.\n\nWhile blaming Uba, partly, for the insecurity in the state, Soludo said insecurity was a recent phenomenon in the state and that all the security agencies were under the federal government\u2019s control. He argued that the upsurge in crime and killings were partly politically motivated to create fear in the state.\n\nAccording to Soludo, \u201cAnd in terms of how we go, I see three buckets; the first bucket is really the formal cum the local security architecture, the intelligence gathering, the equipment, the military, the police, the DSS, and so on and so forth.\n\n\u201cAnd then you add the local vigilante and that has to happen. The next bucket is dialogue and reaching some harmonious agreement with the non-state actors. The third is in our manifesto, which is prosperity through jobs.\u201d\n\nUnder the APGA government, Soludo stated that Anambra currently had the lowest unemployment rate in Nigeria, and lowest underemployment, quoting figures from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). He admitted that there was a \u201croad challenge\u201d that needed to be fixed in the state, adding, however, that APGA\u2019s Dr. Willy Obiano had done a lot in that respect. He vowed to continue from where the governor stopped.\n\nSoludo said his agenda was to separate the roads into tiers 1,2,3, look at those for concession and those for direct government financing, emphasising that even the state\u2019s entire budget cannot fully fund road construction and maintenance.\n\nOn the state\u2019s Internally Generated Revenue (IGR), he pledged to block all leakages with the technology and set up the Anambra Development Fund with a seed amount of $200 million.\n\nTo attract investment, Soludo promised to enhance the ease of doing business, leverage information technology, human capital development, create industrial parks, build captive power to encourage industrial clusters, fix road infrastructure and establish a venture capital fund of N5 billion as well as create 1,000 millionaires.\n\nSoludo promised to promote \u201cMade in Anambra\u201d agenda, make it a digital tribe, make the state a cheap cost of production area, ensure 72-hour business registration as well as fast settlement of industrial disputes.\n\nHe identified the environmental issues, including flooding, as an existential threat, pledging to build embarkations and form partnerships among all the tiers of government to deal with the menace.\n\nOn health, the former CBN governor said he would embark on a lifestyle change campaign, fix public health infrastructure, working with private sector in the diaspora, promote health insurance system, and carry out training and proper remuneration of health workers.\n\nIn the area of education, he noted that his government, if elected, would fund scholarships, review the school curricula to bring them in tune with the digital age, regulate private schools more effectively, and make public schools more competitive.\n\n\u201cI offer to you my life. I want to serve you with my excellent health, to use what is left of me to serve you. God has blessed me; I do not want your penny. I am a great reformer, I am prepared to give you my best,\u201d he concluded.\n\nUba, while detailing his own plan, stressed that voter apathy had always been an issue in Anambra. He alleged that Obiano had refused to engage anybody on the insecurity in the state.\n\n\u201cThe governor is the chief security officer of the state. Let me tell you, in this case, the governor has not done what he is supposed to do,\u201d Uba said.\n\nHe expressed belief in dialogue, adding that if he wins the poll, he would set up a security response team and have a public phone number that people can call instantly to report cases.\n\nUba explained that instead of condemning or supporting IPOB, Nigeria needed to sit down with the agitators to know what they wanted.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t support or condemn IPOB,\u201d he said.\n\nHe pledged to declare a state of emergency on Anambra roads, get the airport to operate, set up industrial parks and ensure people made money from there.\n\nHe described Soludo as a manager and not a leader, saying the economy collapsed immediately he left the CBN.\n\nTo attaract investors, Uba said he would improve security and give tax incentives to allow them invest in the state. He vowed to conduct local government elections within six months of his government and ensure that whatever accrued to the third tier of government got to them.\n\nUba described the issue of erosion in Anambra State as catastrophic, saying he would solve the problem by planting trees and building public drainage systems.\n\nFor his plan on health, Uba explained that there would be three clusters, adding that his government would not build new health institutions, but upgrade existing ones and attract the diaspora to invest.\n\nWhile alleging that education had collapsed in the state, Uba promised free basic education and employment of more teachers.\n\nOzigbo, in his submission, argued that what Anambra State required was a young vibrant, trendy person, who was passionate about the state. He said he had served in the private sector and grown businesses all over the world.\n\nOzigbo stated that the security agencies needed more intelligence to tackle the worsening insecurity in the state, regretting that nobody is being brought to book for committing crimes.\n\nHe said, \u201cBut above security, there is a lot we can do. There is, indeed, a lot we can do. Just even go back to when Peter Obi left it. Just providing money monthly to these vigilantes, paying them, providing vehicles and making sure that they are well empowered, because there is no community that doesn\u2019t know the criminals around them.\u201d\n\nHe stated that both the APC and the APGA had failed the state, and promised to provide resources for vigilante groups, create employment and engage agitators.\n\nOzigbo maintained that there was a better PDP now, which he said was moving away from the dysfunctional party of the past. He described Anambra as a broken state that needed to be fixed.\n\nThe PDP candidate stated that the reasons for agitation by IPOB were not unfounded and demanded the release of Kanu as well as the de-proscription of the group.\n\nHe described Soludo as a theorist, who had held high positions without solving problems. Ozigbo said he would leverage on the private sector and allow competition.\n\nThe former Transcorp president promised to cut waste, run a people government, curb touting, make Nnewi an industrial hub, and make Awka a true capital city.\n\nOzigbo said the state under him would attract aid from multilateral institutions to curb erosion, embark on recycling, and ensure process improvement.\n\nHe said people would be rewarded, when they do the right thing, and would be punished when they do wrong. He said his government, if elected, would partner communities, reduce brain drain, build mega diagnosis systems, provide access for the vulnerable, and improve mortality rate, while disease prevention would be a major campaign in the state.\n\nOzigbo claimed APGA had done nothing to improve education, promising to embark on training of teachers, partner private sector, solve the affordability problem, pay bursaries, and build an ecosystem, where there would be educational support even for those in the Igbo apprenticeship system.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Osinowo, made the trip and was surprised on arrival in Turkey to discover no official meeting or visit to Turkish parliament happened except private trips to the tile company by Obasa and his business partners,\u201d the source had said.\n\nSaharaReporters also on October 30 reported that Obasa had conducted private and lucrative businesses since he was elected to the post in 2015.\n\nSee Also Corruption Bank Documents Expose How Lagos Speaker Obasa Received N51.7 Million 11 Times On Same Day\n\nFinancial records of Obasa showed that the politician executed a number of suspicious transactions using several companies linked to him.\n\nOn October 30, 2018, Obasa received exactly N51,680,672.91 each in his company, De Kingrun Multipurpose Limited account in a string of eleven transactions exactly the same day, bank documents showed.\n\nSahara Reporters had published other series of corruption claims against the Speaker since March, when the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission called him in for questioning as part of its investigation into some charges.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: How Speaker Of Lagos Assembly, Obasa, Collected N45m For Christmas Party That Never Held\n\nIn 2016, Mr. Obasa received four transactions each from the ministry of environment and Universal Basic Education in Lagos. Each of the four transactions from the environment office was N56,332,500.00 \u2014 all paid on April 21, totalling N225,330,000.\n\nEfforts made by SaharaReporters to reach Obasa were not successful as he did not answer calls to his mobile phone line nor reply a text message sent to him.\n\nSee Also Corruption Lagos Assembly Speaker, Obasa, Pays N60m To Social Media Influencers To Attack SaharaReporters",

He has since been detained in a Beninese prison.\n\nHowever, the viral video and audio tape said Omolewu, also known as Janbele, led the secret police to burgle Igboho\u2019s house.\n\nThe male voice on the viral audio tape, speaking mainly in Yoruba, said the person who linked the security agents to capture Igboho was very close to him.\n\n\"We used his ribs to fight him (we used what is close to him). You know despite how mighty a person is, if something happens to their ribs (what is close to them), they will bend,\" the audio tape said.\n\nBREAKING!\n\nThe Babalawo/Herbalist That Went With The DSS And The Nigerian Soldiers To Invade Chief Sunday Igboho\u00e2\u0080\u0099s House On The 1st Of July Speaks Out.

Today one of them is out! pic.twitter.com/ACfu6YLQbJ \u2014 Simon Ekpa (@simon_ekpa) November 1, 2021\n\nIn another audio tape, it was revealed that Omolewu was behind how DSS officers successfully raided his house.\n\nThe voice said, \"The person that hinted the DSS on the in and out of Sunday Igboho is his close associate. He is a very trusted friend in his agitation and movement.\n\n\"He was the one that gave them (security agents) the time to attack his house. He told them Sunday Igboho was very powerful but they could storm his house at midnight.\n\n\"This person I'm talking about is called Janbele. He was the informant who told the DSS officers how to raid Sunday Igboho\u2019s house. If he wasn't responsible, let him come and deny it. He betrayed Igboho because of money.\"",

          "text": "Facebook on Thursday, October 28 announced that it has changed its company name to Meta. This change of name was announced by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook\u2019s annual Connect augmented and virtual reality conference.\n\nThe company said it chose the name \u201cMeta\u201d to serve as a reminder that there is always more to build. The rebrand is part of the company\u2019s efforts to shift gears away from being known as just a social media company and focus on building the metaverse \u2014 a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users.\n\n\u201cRight now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can\u2019t possibly represent everything that we\u2019re doing today, let alone in the future,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cOver time, I hope that we are seen as a metaverse company, and I want to anchor our work and identity on what we\u2019re building toward.\u201d\n\nPer The Verge, \u201cZuckerberg owns the Twitter handle @meta and meta.com, which now redirects to a welcome page on Facebook outlining the changes. The site previously redirected to meta.org, a biomedical research discovery tool that was a project of the Chan Zuckerberg Science Initiative. That\u2019s part of the philanthropic arm Zuckerberg co-founded with his physician wife, Priscilla Chan, in 2015. In a Medium post on Thursday, the group says it\u2019s sunsetting Meta.org on March 31st, 2022.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s going to change?\n\nAs expected, the new name implies that some things about the way Facebook operates would change. Facebook said its corporate structure is not changing, however, how the company reports its financials will. Starting with results for the fourth quarter of 2021, Facebook plans to report on two operating segments: Family of Apps and Reality Labs. The company also said that it will change its stock ticker from FB to MVRS, effective December 1. In addition, Facebook assured users that the announcement does not affect how the company uses or shares data.\n\nAt the Connect conference, Facebook also announced new tools to help people build for the metaverse, including Presence Platform, which will enable new mixed reality experiences on Quest 2, and a $150-million investment in immersive learning to train the next generation of creators.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that within the next decade, the metaverse will reach a billion people, host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce, and support jobs for millions of creators and developers,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in a letter on Thursday.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "Buycoins\u2019 journey to powering Africa\u2019s financial and digital economy",
          "text": "Buycoins is celebrating its history and the milestone of transitioning to Helicarrier, its new parent company, and is holding an event titled \u201cState of The Union\u201d on October 30 to mark it. While the discussions at the event would have far-reaching consequences on the state of cryptocurrency in the country, the event is exclusive and invite-only.\n\nBut before Buycoins, the company was called Bitkoin\u2014a website for peer-to-peer (P2P) Bitcoin trading.\n\nBuycoins was founded in 2017 by Timi Ajiboye, Ire Aderinokun and Tomiwa Lasebikan to afford Nigerians a safe and easy way to buy, sell and store cryptocurrencies. After being called Buycoins for the past three years, the exchange and all the products created by its team will now be housed under the new parent company, Helicarrier.\n\nThe Buycoins team expressed that it made the change because its former name didn\u2019t do a good job of capturing all they do and have become. Similar to the name of the fictitious versatile super-machines that are capable of sustained flight via four massive turbine engines, Helicarrier currently houses over five which will power its efforts to disrupt remittance payment in Nigeria and, by extension, Africa.\n\nHelicarrier\u2019s five products are Buycoins, a platform for buying, selling and storing cryptocurrencies; Buycoins Pro, a platform for advanced crypto traders, featuring an order book, many more currency pairs and other tools for super-fast trading on the go; Sendcash, a platform for crypto-powered remittance; Sendcash Pay, a suite of developer tools that let you add borderless payment experiences to your digital products; and NGNT (Nigerian Naira Token), a naira-backed digital currency.\n\nAll the products will retain their names and normal operations, the Buycoins team explained.\n\nTo further understand Buycoins\u2019 work over the past three years, the challenging, fulfilling and exciting parts, and the rationale behind the change to a new name, I spoke with Tomiwa Lasebikan, co-founder and Chief Product Officer; Teju Adeyinka, Head of Growth, Sendcash; and Zino Asamaige, Head of Growth, Buycoins Pro.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSultan Quadri: What inspired you to build Buycoins, and what problems were you trying to solve with this product?\n\nTomiwa Lasebikan: So, I guess it was the challenge of getting started with crypto in Nigeria. There were times Timi and Ire would want to buy something from the US and want to send me Bitcoin as a means of payment for that. But being able to get Bitcoin in Nigeria was a pain. Back then, we had something called \u201clocal Bitcoins\u201d, but it was fraud-prone and the user experience was really bad. We all had conversations and thought, \u201cOh, how difficult would it be to build a crypto exchange?\u201d It was supposed to be a little project that enabled people to trade Bitcoin without stress. So, that was the start of the journey.\n\nSQ: What challenges did you encounter during the building process?\n\nTL: There have been a lot of things. One has been the challenge of hiring, especially because we are building something in a very new and rapidly-evolving space. So, we need people with the ability to keep up with the fast pace of the industry. That can be very challenging.\n\nWe\u2019ve also had issues with educating our users about cryptocurrency and the crypto space to protect them from scams. To get people on board, we\u2019ve had to change the dominant narrative that crypto was for geeky computer scientists and whatnot. Making people think of crypto as something they can use for moving money across borders or hedging against inflation has been an important aspect of our (re)orientation campaign.\n\nAnother challenge we faced was interfacing with regulatory systems\u2014although that\u2019s a global problem: big exchanges like Coinbase face regulatory challenges too.\n\nSQ: What are the challenges of building new products?\n\nTeju Adeyinka: Getting people who are willing to even try out the products is challenging. For instance, with Sendcash, people who have never used Bitcoin before might feel intimidated to try it out because of the interface. So, we had to figure out a way to craft our messages and build experiences that make sense for people who don\u2019t care about all the technicalities of using crypto.\n\nWe also had to deal with platforms\u2019 regulations. For instance, MailChimp reached out to say we can\u2019t use them anymore because we are a crypto exchange company and they don\u2019t support crypto exchange companies at the moment.\n\nWe constantly have to find alternatives for a lot of different things because people and platforms do not want to work with a crypto exchange company.\n\nZino Asamaige: When we launched, a bulk of the work had to do with educating customers. There were so many questions we didn\u2019t have answers to, but we couldn\u2019t just send them away. So, we learned more about the space or used Google when asked questions, all to ensure that our customers are satisfied.\n\nSQ: What were some of the most rewarding aspects of the building process and your earliest memorable milestone?\n\nTL: Back in November 2018, when we got our first dozen high-volume users, it was nice to see. Subsequently, there was a spike in trading volume and we knew we were building something useful. There were times we got comments like, \u201cSendcash is the best way for me to send money back home to my mum.\u201d During the lockdown, not everyone could stand in queues at Western Union, so using Sendcash to send money was easier. Providing a service that changes dollars or crypto to naira in a few minutes is satisfying.\n\nTL: Another early milestone was when we hit a million dollars in volume of transactions processed in a month, in the fall of 2018, just after YC Demo Day. Before Buycoins\u2014the app with a standard exchange interface, we had Bitkoin Africa, a website for P2P crypto trading, So, when in one day, we did more volume at Buycoins than in all of Bitkoin Africa\u2019s history, we were elated.\n\nAlso, in December last year, the last month we had publicly shared, we added $20 million in monthly volume.\n\nZA: We created a crypto course at Buycoins in 2019, and it has been one of the best things I\u2019ve ever done in my life. It was an introduction to Bitcoin for beginners. We spent a lot of time simplifying the language, making it easy for anyone to read and understand. Right now, we have over 3,000 people taking the course, and the feedback we get from people is particularly about the course is easy to understand.\n\nSQ: What influenced the change of name to Helicarrier?\n\nTL: Being able to define what we do is critical for us because a lot of times, with crypto, it\u2019s not very obvious the full range of things that people can do to be able to solve their problems. And so, it became increasingly clear to us that we were in danger of people narrowly defining what it is that we did. Some just think of us as a crypto exchange or platform for sending cash. It was something we wanted to fix. One day, it became clear to us that we\u2019re the sum of this box and more. So, we had to turn all of these things into a consistent story and define the set of tools that we think of as the infrastructure for growing crypto adoption on the continent.\n\nSo, fundamentally, we think of ourselves as sort of building out the infrastructure for the rapid adoption of crypto. Each of the things that we build as a part of Helicarrier serves a purpose, but we have to ensure that is clear.\n\nSo, there are four major things we do: the crypto exchange, Sendcash, Sendcash Pay, and the OTC desk, which is a way for businesses to effectively move money across borders. There\u2019s also one more exciting thing, still in the pipeline.\n\nSQ: How have you gone about communicating the changes that have occurred in the business this year?\n\nZA: Our users know that nothing has changed. From the point of view of using our products, they haven\u2019t had to do anything extra. All these products were not added in just one day; we gradually built them with the users. So, when we develop anything, the first thing we do is talk to customers about it.\n\nSQ: How are you making Buycoins safer for users?\n\nTL: Security is important to us because we are managing people\u2019s assets. There are many risk factors we always have to address, but one big thing is recognising that the problems we face are global challenges. So, what we do is, lean into the expertise of big exchanges like Binance, learn from their experience battling these problems and just replicate solutions where necessary.\n\nOne good example is asset custody, where we don\u2019t worry about building the infrastructure ourselves because there are crypto custody companies that have already solved this problem. We also ensure we take our own security measures: everyone who uses our platform is verified.\n\nSQ: What is the hardest part of your role in customer service?\n\nZA: The hardest part has been hiring. One thing that Helicarrier takes very seriously is customer service. We try to make sure that anybody that works with us is as obsessed with it as we are. A large part of customer support work is telling customers that their money is not missing. Customers that have their money on any app open the app every second to check. If they notice any unusual changes, they\u2019ll hit you up with \u201cWhere\u2019s my money?\u201d\n\nSQ: How were you able to manage customers during CBN\u2019s crackdown on crypto exchanges?\n\nTL: It\u2019s been one of the obvious challenging points in the company\u2019s lifecycle. We had to understand regulatory communication and ensure that we framed that effectively for our users and explained their implications to them. We let them know that their assets were completely safe.\n\nThe next thing was to figure out the shortest time for us to get back on our mission and ensure that users could do the things they want to do and extract the value they had always been able to extract from us.\n\nBehind the scenes, we were able to process how we arrived at the problem in the first place, which involved figuring out which regulators or stakeholders to talk to, helping them understand the importance of crypto, and letting them know we are good-faith actors and that there wasn\u2019t anything fishy going on in the space. We let them know that we have the same goal, which is to empower Nigerians.\n\nSQ: How would you describe the Buycoins users?\n\nZA: That would be somebody who doesn\u2019t want stress but wants to make cryptocurrency transactions. Or somebody who wants to be able to send money to Nigeria easily. Or somebody who wants to use cryptocurrencies to join a world of possibilities.\n\nTA: A Buycoins user is a global African, living on the continent or elsewhere, trying to connect to the world financially. A Helicarrier customer would be an African or a business that is traditionally shut out of the financial system but wants to access the global finance infrastructure easily.\n\nShare this article\n\nSultan Quadri | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Nigeria to the world: Why it took Affiong Williams 9 years to raise $3m for ReelFruit",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the first step you take when you want to launch a new business idea? Tell a mentor? Save up some capital? Find an investor?\n\nFor Affiong Williams, founder and CEO of ReelFruit, it was leaving her comfortable job in South Africa to start a (almost unheard of) dried fruits company in Nigeria, hawking prototype products around Lagos, and somewhat building the entire business model on the hope of winning a UN grant that never happened.\n\nWas that such a good approach? Well, on the one hand, her tech-enabled agribusiness recently raised a $3m Series A round to help accelerate global expansion. That\u2019s plenty validation. But then, it took her five years to build her first factory, and nine years in total to the Series A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiong Williams, founder and CEO, ReelFruit.\n\nBut how did someone who had dreams of becoming a medical doctor end up as an entrepreneur? And what would motivate them to leave their comfort zone, in a bid to singlehandedly pioneer a sub-industry that never existed?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese and many more I sought to find out during a recent interview with Affiong Williams at the ReelFruit HQ in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this inspiring interview, Affiong Williams shares her motivations, inspirations, ambitions, entrepreneurial lessons, and tips on how to achieve a work-life balance while running a global company.\n\nWatch full interview or continue below for summarised text version\n\nNB: Below is a paraphrased (for clarity) and summarised version of the interview. For the best experience, we recommend watching the video above.\n\nM\u00fay\u00ecw\u00e1 M\u00e1t\u00f9l\u00fak\u00f2 of Techpoint Africa (MM): It took you nine years to raise $3m. Was that deliberate?\n\nAffiong Williams of ReelFruit (AW): No, it wasn\u2019t. Because we pioneered the dried fruits market in Nigeria, it took the first five years of our business to prove that this was not a flash-in-the-pan product. When you couple that with all the other challenges of raising funding in Nigeria, it\u2019s easy to see why it took so long. But I\u2019m delighted with the outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMM: I read an interview you gave about how you resorted to raising capital in small amounts as a proof of concept. How did that work out?\n\nAW: Because we were so unsuccessful at raising a large round, it became apparent that people didn\u2019t believe the big picture. So when we claimed we were going to expand by x amount, they found it easier to believe that we could, say, double our sales, hire more people, open new locations, or launch more products. That story was a lot more relatable with investors.\n\nWe found that it was easier and quicker for us to raise smaller amounts tied to realisable milestones, as opposed to a broader unknown that may not yield immediate returns. That helped us get to the point where lead investors then felt confident about backing the big idea because we\u2019d proven ourselves in smaller milestones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI recommend that strategy because it helps entrepreneurs allocate capital.\n\nMM: Let\u2019s take a step back to your origins. Why dried fruit in the first place?\n\nAW: My initial idea was actually to produce juice. But I knew I couldn\u2019t afford to build a fruit juice factory. Dried fruit came about by the process of elimination along the value chain of fruit processing. I was living in South Africa at the time, and dried fruit was very popular there. I figured I could be the first to bring it to Nigeria and make it big.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMM: That was a bold move. What gave you the conviction to pursue such an untested market in Nigeria?\n\nAW: Yes, it was bold, but I didn\u2019t know much. If I had done just a bit more research, I probably would have shelved the idea.\n\nI was simply convinced that Nigerians were a lot more open to different tastes, judging by the variety of things that were being imported at the time. I believed all I needed to do was create awareness and demand.\n\nMM: I noticed that not long after completing your first degree, in Physiology and Psychology, in 2006, you proceeded to do a post-graduate diploma in Business Administration. I\u2019m guessing this is around the time you caught the entrepreneurial bug?\n\nAW: Not at all. Actually, the reason I did my undergrad in the Sciences was to get into medical school. But after my undergrad, which I found extremely difficult, I knew medical school wasn\u2019t for me. I switched to a diploma in business for an opportunity to work elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was actually my first job that unleashed my passion for entrepreneurship. I worked at Endeavour South Africa, which is an entrepreneurship support organisation. I loved working with entrepreneurs. I loved that they created jobs, the values they stood for, the idea that they took risks, and that the reward was outsized. So after four years, I decided to become an entrepreneur myself.\n\nMM: So you left South Africa and moved back to Nigeria, solely to start the business?\n\nAW: Yes. However, my entire immediate family expected me to move to the US, where most of them lived at the time. But I\u2019d be coming to Nigeria to every year and I still felt connected to home. It felt like a familiar domain to start a business.\n\nAnother major driver for my moving back was a \u20a610 million UN grant that was available at the time. I applied and got selected for the first round, which further motivated me to move back. But barely three days after moving back, I got a rejection letter. It was disappointing, but obviously, I had to restrategise.\n\nI had brought back a lot of dried fruits from South Africa, which I crudely packaged and started hawking around. This was basically my market research. It was an extremely challenging time because not only was I doing something new, I was also filled with a lot of self-doubt. I thought I had made the biggest mistake of my life, but, of course, I couldn\u2019t quit so early.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThankfully, the feedback was good and people, especially my family and friends, were beginning to appreciate my commitment. After I ran out of personal savings, they were the first set of people to invest in ReelFruit.\n\nWe were operating out of my apartment, so, of course, we eventually ran out of space and struggled to meet increasing demand. Thankfully my then friend \u2014 now husband \u2014 stepped in with an investment, which enabled us to rent an office space, buy a small van, and hire more people. That was my first angel check, and it really took us far.\n\nMM: Did you have a factory at the time?\n\nAW: We were doing a little bit of processing and packaging from our new location. But we didn\u2019t have enough capacity to scale up as quickly as demand required, and raising extra funds for more factory machinery was difficult.\n\nOur solution was to engage contract manufacturers, people who were processing locally and as far away as Ghana. So it was a mix of third-party producers and us doing small processing.\n\nI believe that in doing business in Nigeria, you should be deliberate about the battles you fight. We thought it was more productive, at the time, to focus more on growing the market and then, further down the line, backwards-integrating into real processing at scale. This is what our Series A is going to enable us to do now.\n\nI think that early decision was a key factor in unlocking our business and demonstrating demand in record time.\n\nMM: Speaking of early days, what were the hardest things you had to learn as a CEO?\n\nAW: I think in the early days, I struggled with sharing my vision with the team. I felt that if I kept sharing my vision about becoming an end-to-end business with huge manufacturing and global exports, while we were still working from a one-bedroom in Yaba, they would think I was out of touch with reality. So I usually kept a lot of that stuff to myself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReelFruit\u2019s first office space\n\nBut I found that when I started sharing more, being open about my ambitions, the team rallied behind to help me reach them.\n\nI think the other thing I\u2019ve learnt is being more audacious. Of course, I\u2019m typically a bold person personally, but in business, I was very timid, always expecting the worst. And it sometimes showed in the way we did business. But I\u2019ve gotten bolder about what we can and can\u2019t do. I think that boldness has caught on with the team, so I\u2019m proud of myself.\n\nMM: Riding on that, what are some significant challenges you had to surmount, running a business like this in Nigeria?\n\nAW: Oh God, we could talk about challenges forever.\n\nFor example, we source our materials from as far as Burkina Faso and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, which can be challenging. I\u2019m in awe of what my production manager has had to do to get them sometimes. It all falls back to the infectious idea that we can do anything we set our minds to.\n\nWe had challenges with setting up 24-hour cold storage. It was expensive, but my team figured out a cost-effective solution online and built it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, we\u2019ve faced so many devaluations doing business in Nigeria over the last nine years. But we\u2019ve managed them, staying focused on growth and efficiency. Macroeconomic instability is a big challenge. I would say that\u2019s been one thing that we\u2019ve tried as much as possible to solve.\n\nMM: What lessons can you share with budding entrepreneurs?\n\nAW: One key advantage, which has played in our favour is knowledge; the sheer amount of time we\u2019ve spent, and how much we\u2019ve gone around the world to get information.\n\nI think that is the hallmark of a successful venture. You need to understand the intricacies of your sector more than the next person so that market trends, macroeconomic windfalls and gains, etc., don\u2019t take you by surprise.\n\nSo I would encourage people to be committed to learning. There are many ways to go about that \u2014 first working in the industry, talking to other entrepreneurs in the field, and researching to understand what has happened to companies in your sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second thing I would say is leverage networks because they run the world. In Nigeria, especially, you need to know people to get things. I think it\u2019s worthwhile to invest in creating very strong networks , especially around your industry. That\u2019s been very valuable for me, and it continues to be.\n\nI think it\u2019s also important to acknowledge the time it will take and be ready to commit that time. If someone told me in advance that it would take five years from ideation to having our first factory, I would have said, \u201cNo way.\u201d\n\nFinally, entrepreneurship can really consume your life and everything you do. Having things that I do outside of work, I think, has also helped me along the way. I\u2019m a runner, and I play recreational football. I\u2019ve been deliberate about doing things that are outside of my business just to give me that sense of separation and create different facets of my life. Because, otherwise, you can think about work 24 hours a day, and then your life becomes very one-dimensional.\n\nMM: Interestingly, you recommend working in an industry before building a business around it. That obviously wasn\u2019t your path; would you advise others to follow you?\n\nAW: No, I wouldn\u2019t. In hindsight, there are so many things I could have done differently. The first was not to be a first mover. That took me a lot of time.\n\nI started ReelFruit when I was pretty young. Yes, I had the advantage of time, but I was 26 and didn\u2019t have much liquidity or resource networks. Statistics show that the average entrepreneur is actually in their 40s; when they have somewhat more liquidity and better networks from the work they\u2019ve done. So you actually can move a venture much faster later in life. I know it sounds counterintuitive because people say, \u201cHustle now because you\u2019re young.\u201d\n\nBut then again, I like that I started early because I needed a lot of time to build the industry.\n\nMM: Finally, tell me about future plans on the backdrop of your fundraise.\n\nAW: This fundraise has unlocked a lot for us.\n\nWith our new factory, which we are setting up in Abeokuta, we will grow our monthly capacity 5x. That means that we will be working with a lot more farmers, procuring a lot more raw materials, helping them improve their yields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will also introduce new varieties of fruit into the Nigerian market. And that\u2019s exciting because we get to, again, pioneer innovation and positive change at the farmer level.\n\nAt the processing level, we\u2019re going to be adding new product lines for different customer segments. So we\u2019re very excited about being able to own that and do it very quickly. Not just selling branded products, but selling products as inputs to other customers, etc.\n\nAnd on the market side, one of my big goals was to create in Nigeria for the world. I wanted our Nigerian-made products to be good enough to sit on every shelf in the world. And we\u2019ve made some strides there. We just exported our products to the UK, and now we have our own direct to consumer e-commerce store in the US.\n\nWe want to further expand into those markets, selling larger volumes of different types of products to various customers around the world.\n\nWe want to dominate this space and take it as far as possible. In doing so, we hope to demonstrate a path for Nigerian-founded FMCG companies looking to be end-to-end while also serving customers around the world.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

When we consider currency fluctuations (reported currency), the increase is 20.1%, a 2.6% difference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVoice remains king, but data isn\u2019t doing too badly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirtel\u2019s Q3 2021 revenue breakdown. (in millions)\n\nAs usual, voice brought in the most revenue at $578 million, while data and mobile money brought in $377 and $135 million, respectively.\n\nAlthough voice remains king, it only rose by 11.6% \u2014 $60 million \u2014 (reported currency) from Q3 2020\u2019s $518 million. Data went from $283 million to $377 million within the same period, signifying a 33.0% \u2014 $94 million \u2014 increase.\n\nMobile money increased by 34.6%, going from $100 million to $135 million in the same period.\n\nThe same trend was recorded in Q2 2021. Voice trumped other revenue sources at $562 million, followed by data and mobile money with $356 and $124 million, respectively.\n\nHowever, voice isn\u2019t only king at Airtel. According to MTN Nigeria\u2019s financials for Q3 2021, voice also led with a revenue of $234.3 million; data came in second at $137.68 million. The telecom company also recorded a similar revenue trend in Q3 2020.\n\nAirtel says it is focusing on increasing smartphone ownership, thereby increasing data usage. It will do this via its Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) partnerships and expanding its network of outlets selling smartphone devices.\n\nAccording to the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA), 4G connections in sub-Saharan Africa could reach 28% by 2025. This could increase data consumption, making data the new revenue king.\n\nAirtel\u2019s data subscribers increased to 43.9 million, a 10.9% jump from 39.6 million in Q3 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMobile money customer base experienced a 19% increase, rising from 20.1 million to 23.9 million when comparing Q3 2020 and Q3 2021.\n\nGenerally, Airtel has increased its customer base by 5.4% \u2014 116.4 million to 122.7 million \u2014 in the 14 African countries where it is present.\n\nFun fact: Data subscribers represent 35.8% of Airtel\u2019s customer base of 122.7 million\n\nProfits\n\nAirtel\u2019s profit before tax in the period in question was $308 million, an 81% increase from $170 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nProfit after tax, on the other hand, was $192 million, which is an impressive 118.6% increase from last year\u2019s $88 million.\n\nHowever, the year-on-year (YoY) growth rate falls short compared to Q2 2021\u2019s 148.7%. Its YoY revenue growth rate of 22.7% also pales in comparison to last quarter\u2019s 33.1%, figures it still attributes to the COVID-19 restrictions of 2020.\n\nIt says it is due to \u201ca weakened performance in the first quarter of the prior year during the peak period of Covid-19 related restrictions across the region.\u201d\n\nNigeria remains cash cow, and data revenues are rising\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirtel\u2019s Q3 2021 revenue per region\n\nIn Nigeria, the telecom company recorded significant revenue growth compared to the preceding period. At constant currency, the revenue growth rate was 27.1%.\n\nHowever, the telecom giant recorded a 38.2% revenue growth rate in the previous quarter.\n\nAs always, Nigeria recorded the highest revenue of the 14 countries where Airtel is present. The country\u2019s Q3 2021 revenue stood at $450 million, a $73 million increase from $377 million in Q3 2020\n\nThe country\u2019s revenue surpassed the $428 million recorded in all the East African countries combined by $22 million.\n\nIn Francophone Africa, the company generated $285 million in revenue, $165 million behind Nigeria.\n\nInterestingly, Nigeria\u2019s data revenue growth rate was 41.5% \u2014 from $139 million to $179 million \u2014 in constant currency compared to the period before. However, in reported currency, the growth rate was 33.1%.\n\nWhile voice revenue had the lion\u2019s share, its growth rate was 14.6% at constant currency and 7.7% at reported currency. It rose from $216 million in Q3 2020 to $233 million in Q3 2021.\n\nAirtel attributes its data revenue growth to an increase in data usage per customer. It went from 2.7GB to 3.9GB per month.\n\nThe total customer base in Nigeria now stands at 40.4 million, unlike 44.1 million in Q3 2020. The customer base also dropped compared to the 40.9 million in Q2 2021. The discontinuation of customer acquisition led to the reduction in the country\u2019s total customer base.\n\nAirtel, however, maintained that the drop in customer base did not have a significant impact on its revenue.\n\nThe company says its Q3 2021 financials signify a well-executed and effective strategy. According to Airtel Africa CEO, Segun Ogunsanya, \u201cAll our service segments are ahead of our FY\u201921 revenue growth trends, and in reported terms, these are all in strong double digits.\u201d\n\n*Airtel\u2019s East African countries include Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.\n\n**Airtel\u2019s Francophone contingent includes Niger, Chad, Gabon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, and Seychelles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In what seems to be a customary ritual, appeals by the Mobile Network Operators and other industry stakeholders were heeded in making this decision.\n\nLike the last extension, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) says the government\u2019s focus is still to foster registration of Nigerians in remote areas, diaspora, schools, hospitals, worship centres, foreigners, and diplomatic missions.\n\nA smattering of progress: In July 2021, the NCC said there were 59.8 million unique NIN enrolments. Per the Commission\u2019s latest statement, the number has grown to 66 million.\n\nAlso, as of October 30, 2021, there were over 9,500 enrolment systems and over 8,000 NIN enrolment centres within and outside the country. An increase from the 5,500 enrollment systems announced in July.\n\nConsidering the government\u2019s shift in focus to remote areas, among others, the drastic increase in enrollment systems seems a welcome development. But, with only a 10% increase in unique NIN enrollments from July to October, it appears the government still has its work cut out for it.\n\nNot surprising, if you\u2019ve read this: Inside Nigeria\u2019s 13-year-old quest for widespread digital identification.\n\nShould we give the government the benefit of the doubt?\n\nBoko Haram\u2019s school children abductions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn April 15, 2014, scores of Nigerians woke up to some disturbing news; at around 11 p.m. on April 14, 2014, 276 girls were kidnapped from their boarding school in Chibok, Northeastern Nigeria, by Boko Haram\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeven years later and more than a hundred Chibok girls are said to still be in captivity.\n\nSince then, at least 1,800 school children have been abducted.\n\nAccording to Intelligence by Techpoint, with 11 abductions this year, more school children were kidnapped in 2021 than in previous years.\n\nAirtel Africa\u2019s H1 results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: <a href=\u201dhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/27998473@N02/11982286343/\u201d>jbdodane</a> Flickr via <a href=\u201dhttp://compfight.com\u201d>Compfight</a> <a href=\u201dhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/\u201d>cc</a>\n\nSome money news: On Thursday, October 28, 2021, Airtel Africa, a subsidiary of India\u2019s Bharti-Airtel, released its results for the half-year ended 30 September 2021.\n\nAccording to Segun Ogunsaya, Airtel Africa\u2019s new CEO, \u201cOur first-half financial performance has been strong.\n\n\u201cThe first half of last year, and especially Q1, was impacted by the start of Covid, but even after adjusting for these effects, our revenue growth rates for the half-year for the Group and all our service segments are ahead of our FY\u201921 revenue growth trends, and in reported terms these are all in strong double digits.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, revenue brought in by voice still sits at the top of the pile, raking in $1.14 trillion in comparison to $972 million in September 2020.\n\nData comes in a close second with $733 million, in comparison to $548 million in the same period last year.\n\nAll of these numbers, of course, have to be looked at in the light of certain intricacies like currency change \u2014 reported and constant.\n\nIf you have a head for numbers or are just naturally curious, then you\u2019d definitely want to read our Reporter, Bolu Abiodun\u2019s careful analysis of this report.\n\nSpoiler alert: I\u2019ve gotten a sneak peek, and there are a lot of numbers.\n\nA little more context from Intelligence by Techpoint\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, October 26, 2021, President Muhammadu Buhari said the fear and trauma of abduction are forcing children out of school.\n\nAccording to UNICEF, Nigeria currently has more than 10 million out-of-school children, mostly due to insecurity in the North, where school enrollment and literacy levels are very low.\n\nFlowing from our earlier discussion on the number of kidnapped children, the graph above shows the reported number of abducted school children in Nigeria by state since 2014.\n\nFor more insights like this, kindly follow @TechpointIntel on Twitter.\n\nTechpoint Africa headlines\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nHow banks can play in the booming crypto space.

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s food vendor industry shrinks 16% on pandemic impact",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s food vendor industry shrinks 16percent as Covid-19 lockdown brought activity to a near standstill in Africa\u2019s biggest economy, a new report by Euromonitor International, a London-based market research company says.\n\nThe report states that the industry declined to $12.3 million in 2020 from $14.6 million in 2019 as lockdown measures used to curb the spread of the virus halted eat-in food services.\n\n\u201cEven after it was eased, many consumers significantly reduced their discretionary spending as a result of the economic shock of the pandemic. Some remained reluctant to eat in restaurants due to the perceived risk of contagion,\u201d the report says.\n\nThe report also states that the virus triggered a shift from eat-in consumer foodservice to takeaway.\n\n\u201cThis was particularly the case for limited-service consumer foodservice, as many of these outlets are located in residential areas and thus more accessible to consumers.\u201d\n\nThe consumer foodservice industry comprises caf\u00e9s/bars, full-service restaurants, limited-service restaurants, self-service cafeterias, and street stalls/kiosks.\n\nLast year, BusinessDay investigated how restaurants were faring from the impact of the pandemic. Results from the findings showed that for the past five months (March-July), they had seen up to 60 percent drop in sales as they were not generating enough take-outs (prepared food packaged to be consumed away from its place of sale) and food deliveries services.\n\nRead also: FG to launch Integrated Export Control Plan for food safety requirement\n\nAccording to Wale Abioye, a manager at Sweet Sensation, a Lagos-based Fast food restaurant, operators generates more revenue from dine-in services than take-outs, because the more people that stay in their restaurants, the more purchases they make, unlike one-time purchases from take-outs.\n\n\u201cGovernment regulations and the fear of COVID-19 is a challenge because there is no continuous purchase. A lot of people that do repeated purchases through deliveries which cost money, don\u2019t get the full value of their money for what they are spending on because they pay that part of the value for deliveries,\u201d says Abioye.\n\nSimilarly, Stephine Emeruwa, a manager at Ketchup, an Abuja-based restaurant noted that it was a struggle for them as sales had dropped below 50 percent and as a result that they had to lay off half of their staff.\n\nIn March 2020, when the number of new cases of COVID-19 started to increase, restaurants limited dine-in table service to only 20 people, while others who were more than 20, were offered take-outs instead.\n\nWhen there was a full lockdown in April, some restaurants were not opened, while others that opened only offered limited menus. After the lockdown was partially eased on May 4, the government directed them to offer only take-out services to their customers.\n\nThen on August 14, they were now allowed to operate dine-in services, on the condition that they maintain 50 percent capacity.\n\n\u201cThere was a decline in the number of consumer foodservice outlets in Nigeria during 2020 due to the economic shock of the pandemic. In general, there were more closures among independent restaurants than their chained counterparts in 2020.\u201d\n\nBy December, foodservice outlets were allowed to fully open to the public and operate at full capacity.\n\nThe report further highlighted that chained outlets were better able to weather the pandemic than their independent counterparts due to economies of scale.\n\nFor example, Eat \u2018n\u2019 Go Ltd utilised the Jumia Food on-demand delivery app to offer discounted prices and promotions to consumers. Despite the pandemic, they continued to expand the number of restaurants it operates under the Domino\u2019s Pizza, Coldstone Creamery and Pinkberry banners, the report further highlighted.\n\nAyorinde Akinloye, an analyst at United Capital Plc said the year 2020 eroded consumers\u2019 income and purchasing power, making them switch from some premium outlets to cheaper ones.\n\n\u201cAnd it will be difficult for the consumer food service industry to get to the pre-COVID level until consumers\u2019 incomes improve and they have that confidence to spend more,\u201d He further states.\n\nFor the industry to get to pre-COVID levels or exceed it, Uchenna Uzo, consumer expert and the faculty director at the Lagos Business School said that it will require thinking through their retail model again to ensure that they have a strong service capacity that is built based on technical analysis and training the staff to know what it means to deliver top-notch service to customers.",

          "text": "Eight in 10 Nigerian manufacturers do not plan to hire more employees in the nearest future, the result of FBNQuest\u2019s Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) survey has shown.\n\nThis means there is no relief in sight for Nigeria\u2019s unemployment rate that ranked the world\u2019s second-highest in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe are not surprised that over 80 percent of our respondents are cautious to hire more people because the economy has not grown in per capita terms in six years,\u201d research analysts at FBNQuest said.\n\nWhile the economy of Africa\u2019s most populous nation expanded by the most since 2014 in the three months ending June (Q2\u201921), data by the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) shows that Nigeria\u2019s real economy declined between the first and second quarter of this year.\n\nThe data suggest that real GDP reported a 0.79 percent decline in Q2 2021 to N16.7 trillion in the quarter to June from N16.8 trillion reported in the first three months of 2021.\n\nNESG projects a lower GDP growth for Nigeria in the third and fourth quarters of 2021 as it expects the base effect to fade out.\n\nAccording to the private sector-led think-tank and policy advocacy group, Nigeria needs to fix stalling policies like the FX crisis, petrol subsidy, insecurity and among others to see the much-needed growth that can boost employment.\n\nEconomic growth in Africa\u2019s top crude producing nation averaged 1.2 percent between 2015 and 2020. The problem with that is the population grew two times faster at an average of 2.6 percent per year.\n\nSince 2017, when oil-dependent Nigeria emerged from its first economic recession in five years (exited its second in 2020), not only has the country\u2019s economic growth been sluggish but only a few sectors triggered the expansion, further undermining the country\u2019s capacity to create enough jobs to meet the growing number of labour market entrants.\n\nUnemployment in Africa\u2019s most populous nation rose to its highest in over a decade at 33.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020, a mirror of the fragile state of Nigeria\u2019s economic progress.\n\nThe weak per capita income of Africa\u2019s largest economy means that the economy is not creating more opportunities to accommodate a fast-rising population, a factor that has continued to drive the number of jobless people.\n\nNigeria\u2019s unemployment rate is projected to increase to 40 percent by the end of 2021, according to Doyin Salami, chairman of the Presidential Economic Advisory Council.\n\n\u201cThe sectors with significant growth use very little labour,\u201d the Presidential Economic Advisory Council said at the sixth Regular Meeting.\n\nWhile the sectors of the Nigerian economy that require less labour have been growing at a pace faster than their peers, the labour-intensive sectors with the potential to reduce the country\u2019s 33.3 percent unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2020 have either been in recession or growing at a sluggish rate.\n\nA high unemployment rate in a country like Nigeria whose economy is described as one that is stagflated (a blend of high inflation rate and slow economic growth) means poor Nigerians will become poorer in real terms, and the middle class will get thinned out.\n\nBefore COVID-19, about 80 million of Nigeria\u2019s 200 million people were living on less than the equivalent of $1.90 a day. The pandemic and population growth could see that figure rise to almost 100 million by 2023, notes the World Bank.\n\nDue to its labour-intensive nature, Nigeria\u2019s manufacturing sector has been described as one that could help ease the country\u2019s rising unemployment but due to the harsh operating environment; the sector has continually performed below its potential.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s power sector stuck at 4000mw 8yrs after privatisation\n\nNigeria retains a long list of economic reforms that can unlock economic growth and reduce poverty but have been stuck. Decrepit infrastructure and the lack of a functional rail system means Apapa, which houses Nigeria\u2019s main post, remains a crying shame.\n\nWhen transporting imported goods from the warehouse in Nigeria\u2019s busiest seaport, businesses spend an average cost of $2,050, according to a research firm, SBM Intelligence. This is nearly ten times the $208 it cost to transport containers from Durban Harbour to the South African warehouse. In Ghana, it cost $285 to transport containers to a local warehouse.\n\nNigeria\u2019s PMI, a gauge for manufacturing sentiments, declined by 0.7 points in October on FX volatility and social unrest in the eastern and northern parts of the country, according to data compiled by FBN Quest and NOI.\n\nThe index which declined from 50.3 to 49.6 points was mirrored across three of the five sub-indices, according to the data.\n\nTo reduce unemployment, the FGN has launched several initiatives, one of which is its special public works programme which was flagged off in January. The N52bn initiative seeks to employ\n\n774,000 Nigerians (ie 1,000 for each local government area).\n\n\u201cWhat is currently missing from the mix is the robust GDP growth including the creation of jobs and wealth through manufacturing that helped to lift eight million people out of poverty in Bangladesh between 2010 and 2016.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s beleaguered electricity sector passed the milestone of eight years under private ownership this month, but the dream of constant power supply to customers still remains just \u2013 a dream.\n\nThe sector was privatised in November 2013 in a blaze of celebration and raised expectation, but power generated and made available on the national grid, which clocked between 3500MW and 3834MW then, has remained stuck at an average of 4089MW eight years after.\n\nData from the Nigeria Electricity System Operator put generation sent on the grid on November 1 at 3844.3MW.\n\nEight years after privatisation, generation is yet to match the installed capacity of 13,014.14MW. Thermal plants with four turbines can only turn one on due to gas shortages. Gas producers prioritise selling to industries because their invoices stand a better chance of being settled.\n\nThe creaking grid with a transmission wheeling capacity of 8,100MW cannot move more than 5,000MW without the entire system cranking up. This year alone, the grid has collapsed half a dozen times.\n\nRead Also: Nigeria\u2019s power sector reforms yielding more cash than electricity\n\nThe reliability of the national grid has fallen significantly in the years that have passed, and today Nigeria experiences wild swings in the amount of power passing through the grid.\n\nApart from the landmark of eight years in private hands, several other rules underpinning the electricity sector are also expiring or coming for review.\n\nThe licence of the Nigeria Bulk Electricity Trading company (NBET) is up for review, yet the organisation still lacks the capacity to muster the requisite capitalisation to guarantee big ticket transactions that is its core mandate.\n\nEight years after operations, it has yet to even publish an audited account statement as its role has been reduced to setting invoices for which it struggles to pay half to generation companies.\n\nBy next year, the 15-year multi-year tariff order (MYTO) will be due for review, providing a perfect opportunity for an overhaul of the sector that has continued to under-perform but the shadow of labour-induced strike action hangs over any discussion to charge tariffs that guarantee commercial returns.\n\nIn addition, all commissioners of the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), the sector regulator except one, will have their tenure expire in February next year. The Distribution Companies (DisCos) have a new deadline of next year to meet all their monthly bills, but experts say the distribution firms are nowhere near meeting this requirement.\n\nAccording to energy economist, Ifie Okafor, \u201cNigeria\u2019s electricity sector remains bedevilled by under capitalisation and the failure to ramp up the amount of power put on the national grid.\n\n\u201cThe DisCos are failing in putting in the required capital to cover working capital and the badly needed capex for the nation\u2019s power distribution network. Take out the CBN and its innovative intervention; the power sector would have long collapsed completely.\n\n\u201cAnd we still have to rely on private generators producing as much as 20,000MW of power and about 8,000MW of that is from high capacity industrial generators polluting the environment massively in a country where only 25 percent of its power generation comes from hydro-related sources. That is totally unacceptable.\u201d\n\nBesides changing ownership, not much has changed in the sector since its privatisation, experts say.\n\n\u201cThe power sector in Nigeria may have been liberated from state bureaucracy. However, the power sector still has to contend with a number of legacy challenges. These include but are not limited to gas supply, liquidity issues, need for adequate metering, unpaid electricity bills, and an ailing transmission network that limits the power sector players,\u201d Olufola Wusu, partner/head of Oil and Gas Desk at Megathos Law Practice, states.\n\nOwners of the DisCos are holding onto the assets that have continued to decay. There has been one transaction involving Jos Electric and the long awaited transaction involving Abuja Electric has yet to happen.\n\n\u201cToday, after the DisCos manage to pay the monthly salaries of staff, there is usually no other money to invest in improvement of network,\u201d notes Kunle Kola Olubiyo, president, Nigeria Consumer Protection Network.\n\nOlubiyo says after eight years, Nigeria does not have accurate customer data and is conservatively put at between 8 million and 12 million, which could have moderated tariff rates if all customers were captured.\n\nHalf of electricity customers are yet to get prepaid meters despite several metering programmes by the sector regulator, the NERC, and millions of naira support from the government.\n\nSince 2013, the Nigerian government through the Central Bank has provided intervention funding for the power sector up to the tune of N1.6 trillion, and the lack of adequate returns has compelled the Central Bank to demand a line of sight to bills paid by customers.\n\nNigeria is now banking on support of multilateral organisations like the World Bank and the recent deal the country signed with German electricity company Siemens to increase generation and raise distribution capacity three-fold to 11,000MW by 2023 at the cost of over $3 billion.\n\n\u201cIt has been 8 years of ups and downs, learning and unlearning,\u201d notes Adetayo Adegbemle, founder of PowerUp, a consumer rights advocacy group.\n\nThe Nigerian government is on the verge of amending the Electricity Sector Power Reform Act, the law upon which the privatisation was based, and the Ministry of Power has said it would train its focus on commercialising the sector moving away from paying subsidies, developments could yet redeem the creaking privatisation programme.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n1. \u201cCome unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light\u201d. Mt. 11:28-30\n\nWhen an emperor, or a monarch or a head of state or president of a nation or the governor is holding any inaugural ceremony in any designated place, admission is often strictly by invitation! Before you enter the hall, you have to present your invitation card or else you would be turned back. The invitation is strictly meant for those that matter in the societies, for the very important persons. It is not so with our Lord Jesus. He cares for the salvation of the rich and the poor. In the scriptures he says \u2018come onto me all ye\u2019. It is for everybody. It is not an invitation whereby the rich would tell the poor: Hold on first I want to see him first. \u2018or stand outside first, I would see him first.\u2019 It is not the case of the gateman saying \u2018you cannot see him now, he is very busy, he is holding a meeting, or he has travelled.\u2019 Jesus does not travel; he has the whole world in his hands.\n\n2. Amazingly, Jesus is calling those who labour and are heavy laden. It is only people who labour and are heavy laden that need rest.\n\nWhat are your labours? Are your labours on how to get food for the children or on how to get the school fees for your children? Are your labours on how to get rid of that sickness that has been disturbing you for years or on how to overcome that sin that easily besets you? Or your labour has been on how to overcome the insurgents and the kidnappers and the Boko Harams or how to keep off the herdsmen who destroy farm crops and kill farmers? Could your labour be on how you can get a child after marriage?\n\nThere are indeed numerous things that people labour on to achieve which indeed bring great burdens to their hearts.\n\nWhat are the things that bring the greatest burdens to our weary souls? Sins are the things that cause the heaviest burden to people\u2019s souls. Sins keep people from seeing the face of God. Sins cause untold punishments to people who remain in sins. Sins make souls to be weary. Sins separate people from God, from Christ. Sin does not allow any rest of mind to people.\n\nTruly, there are many who have gone for confessions of their sins every week and they are still in those sins causing pain to their weary souls.\n\n3. Jesus never told any weary soul that came to him to come back later.\n\nHe gave pardon to all that asked for pardon and caused perfect rest to such turbulent hearts.\n\nWhen king David realized his sin he pleaded in the book of Psalm: \u201cHave mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving kindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions: Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.\u201d Psalm 51:1-2.\n\nThis is exactly what Jesus Christ came to do: \u201cI must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.\u201d Jn. 9:4\n\nSo Jesus Christ actually came to set people free from all the problems that confront them and from sins that easily beset them.\n\nWhen that woman from Samaria received pardon from Jesus Christ she went to preach Christ to people bringing them to Christ: \u201cCome, see a man which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? And many of the Samaritans of that City believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, he told me all that ever I did.\u201d Jn. 4:29,39.\n\nJesus still tells people today all they ever did through the Holy Spirit who brings them to their memories so that they can confess and repent. You also can tell Christ all you ever did and repent from them and also obtain pardon. Then you have rest.\n\n4. Except you are meek and lowly in heart like Jesus you cannot come to Christ to give you rest. Pride and arrogance block the way of humility in one\u2019s life and thus keeps one far away from Christ.\n\nAre we all ready to learn of Christ? Are people in their pride and in their religious fundamentalism still not proving that they did not need Christ?\n\nSuch people that refuse to come to Christ so that their yoke could be removed, keep on delaying in their ignorance till the Judgment day with their yoke of sin, yoke of hardness of heart, yoke of unbelief would stand against them.\n\nUntold number of people all over the world still do not know that the yoke of Christ is easy and that his burden is light. Look at this: \u201cSirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.\u201d Act 16:30-31.\n\nJust that! Not more than that! You are not given any additional yoke or burden to go and sacrifice oxen, or any animal, nor in the ten commandments which you have not been able to fulfill because any time you fail in any of the ten, you have failed in all!\n\nJust come to Christ, and he gives you a new life that perfects your righteousness which is the righteousness of Christ in you: \u201c\u2026for if righteousness come by the Law, then Christ is dead in vain.\u201d Gal. 2:21\n\nSo in humility accept the invitation of Christ today. It is for the poor and the rich. It is for the rulers and kings he will give you rest, eternal rest and salvation.\n\n...",

          "text": "A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja on Monday adjourned the suit filed by the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) seeking referendum to determine the fate of Biafra and other self-determination agitations.\n\nCNG had in June sued the National Assembly, and the Attorney General of the Federation, asking the court to compel the defendants to halt the ongoing constitutional review exercise and in its place, conduct a referendum to determine what determines Nigeria and who populates it.\n\nSpeaking after the adjournment, the spokesperson of the CNG, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, told journalists that the court could not seat and the suit was subsequently adjourned to January 20, 2022.\n\nThe suit, filed by the CNG and its leaders namely, Nastura Ashir Shariff, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, Balarabe Rufa\u2019i and Aminu Adam as plaintiffs, joined the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami; Senate President, Ahmad Lawan; Speaker, House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, and the National Assembly as defendants.\n\nThe CNG said instead of the ongoing constitution review exercise, the defendants should immediately provide a framework for the actualisation of the agitators\u2019 demand on self-determination.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cOne of the issues for determination in the substantive suit has to do with the legal obligation of the 2nd \u2013 4th Defendants/Respondents to provide a framework that will pave the way for the self-determination of the South-eastern states and any other enclave that wants to go so as to leave the geographical entity called Nigeria before any further step is taken to review the Constitution,\u201d Suleiman said.\n\nAlso speaking, the lead counsel to the CNG, Barrister S. G. Idris said, \u201cThe court did not sit because the Judge is out on official assignment, hence the matter was adjourned to 20th of January 2022, we have already filed our originating summons, it contains our arguments and our points of view.\n\n\u201cAnd in the wisdom of the court, we believe if it listens to the provisions of the African Charter, particularly Article 20, which provides the right to self determination, and Nigeria being a signatory to that charter, having ratified provisions of the charter under our laws by the National Assembly, it becomes law, also operative in Nigeria by the member States,\u201d he explained.\n\nSpeaking further he said, \u201cWe have a Motion on Notice, we decided it does not become ex-parte, because we want all parties to respond to the motion on notice seeking injunction to restrain the National Assembly from taking further steps with respect to the issue of constitution amendments, because the argument is simple;\n\n\u201cSome people are saying they are not interested in the country, you are amending the constitution to even create states in territories that are trying to say \u2018we are not interested in the marriage\u2019.\n\n\u201cSo, we felt the right thing to do is to ask the National Assembly to stop the constitution amendment in the overriding interest of the country to address this issue. The issue of self-determination is not an issue of opinion, it\u2019s the general view of the people concerned.\n\n\u201cEveryone is a stakeholder, most especially in the areas that are interested in self-determination, having their own country. Each and every adult member has a right to vote. As to where his opinion lies because we keep having counter arguments, some saying \u2018we want to go\u2019 some saying \u2018we need presidency\u2019, some saying \u2018we want to stay we are not part of this\u2019.\n\n\u201cSo the best way to get a general view on the matter is to allow people express their right under the law,\u201d he stated.\n\nMeanwhile some lawyers from the South-East region of Nigeria have applied to the Federal High Court in Abuja to be joined as defendants in the suit by the CNG, praying for the exit of the region from Nigeria.\n\nThe application they said was based on the agitations of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its leader, Nnamdi Kanul\n\nThe legal practitioners led by a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Chief Chuks Muoma, include Ukpai Ukairo, Ebere Uzoatu and Hon Obi Emuka. They sought an order of the court to allow them join in the suit as representatives of the people of the South-East region.\n\nIn an application for joinder filed by Victor Onweremadu on Monday in Abuja, the applicants claimed that the case of the northern group seeking the exit of South-East from Nigeria had the capability to shape the life of generations of the Igbo people.",

Abdullahi Halims gave the directive following a walkout staged by Premium Steel and Mine Company Limited\u2019s representatives, leading to a rowdy session at a public hearing Monday in Abuja.\n\nHe said the investigation was being carried out in accordance with the provisions of sections 88, 89 and 62 of the 1999 Constitution, which empowered the parliament to conduct inquest into any matter of public interest.\n\nConfusion\n\nBut confusion started when the committee sought the view of Premium Steel and Mine Company Limited.\n\nThis followed the outcry by the host community over alleged mismanagement of the steel firm by the supposed new owner, after it was handed over to it by Assets Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON).\n\nWhile the committee asked for some clarifications from the company\u2019s representative, its counsel, Essien Andrew (SAN) rose on its feet to speak, but was shut down by the committee.\n\nThis was based on the rule of the committee that only the managing director or a person in similar capacity would be allowed to speak at such events.\n\nHost community\n\nEarlier in a submission, chairman, Udu local government area of Delta state, Jite Brown, had told the committee that the present management had run down the outfit, alleging that officials were also selling off items belonging to the company.\n\nSimilarly, a representative of chiefs from the area, Bernard Okiete Nafaga, also testified that the company had failed to live up to expectations, and that the government should take over and resuscitate it.\n\n\u201cI want FG to resuscitate the plant by revoking the agreement given to Premium Steel to run the plant,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the firm representatives walked out on the committee, the host community warned that if they were not called to order, they would shut down the facility.\n\nBPE\n\nIn his presentation, Director General Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) Alex Okoh, who was represented by Acting Director, Industries, Laila Bode, said the company was sold due to unresolved issues.\n\nBut the Corporate Affairs Commission disclosed that the company was registered March 2, 2004, and had undergone several changes in terms of ownership structure and assets.\n\nThe BPE representative said the outfit was privatised in 2005.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government privatised 80 percent of DSC equity to Global Infrastructure. It was privatised in 2005 to Global Infrastructure. Before the privatization process, it underwent two processes. The first advertisement did not yield much desired results, then it was advertised a second time where BUA emerged as the preferred bidder, but due to unresolved issues with BUA, the FG resolved to engage the willing-seller-willing-buyer strategy\u201d, she told the committee.\n\nIn a related development, Speaker House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila had assured stakeholders in the iron and steel sector of the lawmakers\u2019 commitment to reposition the Metallurgical Training Institute, Onitsha to serve as the hub for training and retraining of needed manpower to drive steel sector in Nigeria.\n\nThe speaker spoke at a public hearing on Bill seeking the reconstitution of the institute in Abuja.\n\n\n\nRepresented by Chief Whip, Hon. Tahir Monguno, the Speaker said the proposed law would reposition the institute, adding that the motion to investigate the sale of the steel company was timely, coming at a point when the nation was the quest to find solution to many of its challenges.\n\n\n\nHe further said the needed low and middle level manpower for national development could be found if the institute was made functional.",

Also, note that we are not taking responsibility for any other construction errors that may have occurred overtime on the project.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we request that our company\u2019s name and logo be removed from the project board and also kindly notify all necessary approving authorities of our withdrawal from the project,\u201d the company said in the letter.\n\n4 dead, 4 rescued \u2015 NEMA\n\nMeanwhile, indications emerged last night that no fewer than four persons had so far been rescued while four others were brought out dead from the rubbles of the collapsed building.\n\nSouth West Zonal Coordinator of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) Ibrahim Farinloye disclosed this to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos Monday.\n\nNAN reports that many were feared trapped as the storey building under construction collapsed in Ikoyi.\n\nNEMA team and that of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) were still on ground trying to rescue trapped workers as at the time of this report.\n\nBlueprint gathered that despite the rescue efforts, many were still trapped in the rubbles.\n\nThis latest building collapse is coming barely a month after three persons were reportedly trapped and another killed when a building collapsed in Ikorodu area of Lagos state last month.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the possible cause for collapse and number of persons feared trapped in the latest incident, could not be ascertained as at the time of this report.\n\nHowever, unconfirmed report indicates that aside the destruction to cars and other properties and construction materials, about 50 persons were said to have been trapped.\n\nLASEMA spokesman, Nosa Okunbo, confirmed the incident in a terse electronic statement which said: \u201cA 25-storey building collapsed by Musliu Junction, Ikoyi, Lagos. LASEMA is on top of the situation.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the agency\u2019s Director-General, Dr Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, in a brief response said LASEMA\u2019s heavy-duty equipment and life detection equipment were already mobilised and deployed to the accident scene.\n\nOsanyintolu said: \u201cCollapsed Building at Gerard Road, Ikoyi: The agency has activated its emergency response plan to the above incident.\n\n\u201cAll first responders are en route to secure the scene while the heavy-duty equipment and life detection equipment have been dispatched.\u201d\n\nThe state deputy governor, Femi Hamza, Commissioner for Special Duties & Intergovernmental Relations, Seye Oladejo, his physical planning counterpart, Dr Idris Salako and LASEMA boss were all at the site of the incident.\n\nAn eyewitnesses in the neighbourhood said, \u201cat least about 50 people are reportedly trapped under the rubble, including construction workers and other people who provided ancillary services for the workers.\u201d\n\nTimeline on Lagos building collapse\n\nBuilding collapses are common sights in Lagos. Hardly does a year pass by without cases with some resulting in the loss of many lives.\n\nFor instance, it was reported that 115 buildings, mostly residential, collapsed in Lagos between 2005 and 2016. And about 4,000 families have been left homeless and traumatised.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Lagos state government is yet to issue any statement on the incident, but a reliable source within the state\u2019s ministry of work informed one of our correspondents that the ministry was still waiting to be briefed on the situation.\n\nBlueprint further gathered that scores of construction workers, including the owner of the building were reportedly trapped under the rubbles.",

Isaac David, have commended a 25-year northern youth Hon Mohammed Kadade Suleiman that emerged as national youth leader of the People Democratic Party PDP.\n\nThe Coordinator who made this commendation during an interaction with journalists on Monday in Abuja said, the emergence of Suleiman as a party youths leader has become a plus to all the Arewa youth and also a motivating factor to the youths of this country, \u201cthat there\u2019s still hope that a day will come when a youth will take over the affairs of the nation at the highest level\u201d,.\n\nAmb. David also called on other political parties and institutions to emulate the PDP in terms of trusting the youth with sensitive positions capable of changing the narrative of the country.\n\n\u201cIt a clear fact that the energy and brightness of the minds of youths act as torchbearer for national development. The countries which utilize their youth in a positive direction are more developed. The youth of the nation is the trustees of posterity. Good education prepares one to impact positively on self and society.\n\n\u201cYouths in the Nigeria Constitution refer to persons between ages 18 and 35. So, how come the youth leader of the most political party in Africa is above 50 years? This question and many more are part of the problems facing the youth that has incapacitated him to fully partake in issues of nation-building. But now that the case has started changing starting from the PDP\u2019s decision we be believe that others will follow suit\u201d,.\n\n\u201cWe also hope that one day a youth will become the president of this country and while we equally advice the youth that have been given an opportunity as a leader, not to disappoint the the Northern youths and the Nigeria youths at large.\n\n\u201cRemember that youth are refers to people who have energy, vigour and enthusiasm to get things done. It is a state of mind not a function of Age, a quality of imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity and an insatiable appetite for progressive reasoning.\n\n\u201cThe youths are agents of change and the change we desire in others must start from us. We must use all of our talent to serve country and fatherland\u201d he said.",

The Justice Haroon-led committee recommended the regulation of Arabic and Islamic schools in the state and the reconstitution of the Arabic Education Board\n\n\u201cMURIC commends the committee for treating the matter with military dispatch and for addressing the core issues involved. Inaugurated on the 15th day of October, 2021, the committee commenced sitting immediately up till the 24th day of October, 2021 and submitted its report the next day. This is record time.\n\n\u201cWe implore the state government to speedily and steadily implement the committee\u2019s recommendations. The state government should also note that the success of its implementation depends on its sincerity and commitment to the cause of Arabic education.\n\n\u201cIt is equally important to point out the immense benefits which the state government stands to reap from paying adequate attention to Arabic and Islamic education. In the kitty are a steady fall in crime rate, reduction of corrupt practices in both public and private sectors and stability in family affairs as a result of the infusion of moral guidelines in young Muslims in the Arabic schools.\n\n\u201cArabic and Islamic studies as a twin discipline is the bedrock of morality in any society and any government that undermines any of the two does so at the risk of moral degeneration, unbridled chaos and criminality ad infinitum.\n\n\u201cWe invite the Kwara State government to ponder over the cassu belli for the preponderance of high moral value in scholars of Islam and other Muslims who passed through Arabic schools.\n\n\u201cWe glow with pride that President Muhammadu Buhari who sits on Nigeria\u2019s humongous wealth but who refuses to steal one kobo is a product of the Arabic school and he is Qur\u2019an-literate. The secret behind the uncommon, unequalled and jet-age performance of the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Professor Isa Ali Pantami, can be traced to the fact that he is a Shaykh and a cerebral Islamic scholar.\n\n\u201cThere is also no gainsaying the fact that Professor Ishaq Oloyede, a professor of Islamic studies who is making waves at the Joint Admissions Matriculation Board, JAMB, has proved beyond reasonable doubt the stuff Islamic scholars are made of as ambassadors of integrity, credibility, probity and accountability.\n\n\u201cIndeed, in those three Muslim public officials alone the Kwara State Government stands a good chance of setting up stainless models for young Muslims in Kwara State.\u201d",

          "text": "A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, and Director-General of Progressive Governors Forum, PGF, Dr. Salihu Moh. Lukman has challenged the newly elected leadership of Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, under Dr. Iyorchia Ayu to launch a probe into the management of funds mobilized for the construction of the 12-story PDP National Secretariat located on Muhammadu Buhari Way, Central Business District, Abuja, which is now abandoned as a demonstration of commitment to rescue Nigeria.\n\nDr. Ayu had vowed to rescue Nigeria from the maladministration of the ruling APC in 2023 while giving a remark shortly after being elected national chairman at the just concluded PDP national convention in Abuja.\n\nBut Lukman, a Chieftain of APC who would have none of that, stated Monday in a statement issued and titled, \u201cOpposition Politics and Campaign for New Nigeria\u201d, that having mobilized close to N30 billion and expended over N16 billion, a born-again PDP leadership committed to rescuing Nigeria should be able to fix its internal problems first.\n\nHe said, \u201d Like it is often said, charity begins at home. A party that is committed to rescuing Nigeria should first and foremost rescue itself from its internal adversaries.\n\n\u201cPDP leaders must always remember the saying in law, he who comes to equity must come with clean hands. Having presided over the affairs of Nigeria for sixteen years between 1999 and 2015, what were the specific achievements of the PDP? How many times for instance was the contract for Second Niger Bridge awarded before 2015? How much was disbursed? And what was the level of work done before 2015? These questions can also be asked in respect of the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan Road project and many other abandoned projects, which were inherited by the APC government of President Buhari. Today, the Second Niger Bridge is more than 50% completed with guaranteed funding and scheduled to be commissioned in 2022. So far, progress has been made by APC led government of President Buhari on abandoned or stalled projects that were inherited, like the Loko-Oweto Bridge, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Sagamu-Benin Expressway, the Enugu-Port Harcourt Expressway, Onitsha-Enugu Expressway, Kano-Maiduguri Expressway, Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Expressway, Obajana-Kabba Road, Ilorin-Jebba Road, Apapa-Oshodi-Oworonshoki Road, and several others are in progress, with some already close to completion.\u201d\n\nThe apparently furious PGF DG continued saying, \u201cThere are over 900 active road contracts, covering the construction, reconstruction or rehabilitation of more than 13,000km of Federal roads and highways across the country. In addition, the Federal Executive Council meeting of Wednesday, October 27, 2021, approved another set of road projects covering 1,804.6 kilometres across the country, estimated to cost N621.2 billion to be executed by the NNPC. Outside road projects, the railways have returned. Acknowledging that both the 168km Abuja-Kaduna Rail and the 42.5km Abuja Light Rail commissioned by President Buhari in 2016 and 2018 respectively were inherited from the PDP, the 156km Lagos-Ibadan Standard Gauge Rail, the first double-track Standard Gauge Rail project in West Africa was started and completed by APC led government of President Buhari and has been commissioned. In addition, the 327km Itakpe-Warri Standard Gauge Rail, was completed by President Buhari\u2019s administration 33 years after construction began. This means all the different administrations of PDP between 1999 and 2015 met the project and left it uncompleted but APC government of President Buhari completed it. Other Rail projects commissioned by President Buhari include Ibadan \u2013 Kano, Port Harcourt \u2013 Maiduguri, Port Harcourt \u2013 Calabar and Kano \u2013 Maradi standard gauge lines, all with guaranteed funding.\u201d\n\nLukman maintained that, \u201cOnce the attitude of PDP leaders is to mobilise Nigerians without acknowledging this reality, it means nothing has changed in PDP. It should therefore be expected that PDP campaigns for 2023 will be oriented to mislead Nigerians into voting them into power. To achieve that every problem of the country will continue to be politicised and leaders of PDP such as Governor Ortom would continue to propagate hatred against APC and President Buhari based on so-called \u2018fulanisation\u2019 and \u2018islamisation\u2019 agenda. This is a variant of ultra-right-wing politics campaign, which is neo-fascist and neo-Nazist, which is being gradually adopted by PDP. Once PDP allowed its politics to oriented based on ultra-right-wing politics, its capacity to regulate the conduct of its elected leaders will be further weakened.\u201d",

          "text": "World leaders meeting at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow will on Tuesday issue a multibillion-dollar pledge to end deforestation by 2030 but that date is too distant for campaigners who want action sooner to save the planet\u2019s lungs.\n\nAccording to summit hosts the British government, the pledge is backed by almost $20 billion in public and private funding and is endorsed by more than 100 leaders representing over 85 percent of the world\u2019s forests, including the Amazon rainforest, Canada\u2019s northern boreal forest, and the Congo Basin rainforest.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the agreement on deforestation was pivotal to the overarching ambition of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\n\u201cThese great teeming ecosystems \u2013- these cathedrals of nature \u2014 are the lungs of our planet,\u201d he was expected to say in Glasgow, according to Downing Street.\n\n\u201cForests support communities, livelihoods, and food supply, and absorb the carbon we pump into the atmosphere. They are essential to our very survival,\u201d said Johnson, who is chairing the summit.\n\n\u201cWith today\u2019s (Tuesday\u2019s) unprecedented pledges, we will have a chance to end humanity\u2019s long history as nature\u2019s conqueror, and instead become its custodian.\u201d\n\nThe signatories include Brazil and Russia, which have been singled out for accelerating deforestation in their territories, as well as the United States, China, Australia, and France.\n\nThe government of Brazil, much criticised for its environmental policies, announced Monday at the summit that it would cut 2005-level greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 \u2014 up from a previous pledge of 43 percent.\n\n\u201cWe are presenting a new, more ambitious climate goal,\u201d Environment Minister Joaquim Leite announced in a message transmitted from Brasilia to Glasgow.\n\nLeite also said Brazil would aim to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nIndia Targets Net-Zero 2070\n\nFor his part, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a target of net-zero emissions by 2070.\n\nIndia\u2019s commitment was eagerly awaited, as the South Asian giant is the fourth biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, behind China, the United States, and the European Union.\n\nSwedish activist Greta Thunberg urged the leaders gathered for COP26 to act and stop their \u201cblah blah blah\u201d during a demonstration in Glasgow.\n\nAlmost a quarter of all man-made emissions of carbon dioxide can be attributed to land use activity such as logging, deforestation, and farming.\n\nPresident Joko Widodo of resource-rich Indonesia said his own archipelago\u2019s rainforests, mangroves, seas, and peatlands were key to restricting climate change.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to protecting these critical carbon sinks and our natural capital for future generations,\u201d he said in a UK government statement.\n\n10 More Years\n\nThe summit pledge to \u201chalt and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030\u201d encompasses promises to secure the rights of indigenous peoples, and recognise \u201ctheir role as forest guardians\u201d.\n\nWhile Johnson described the pledge as \u201cunprecedented\u201d, a UN climate gathering in New York in 2014 issued a similar declaration to halve the rate of deforestation by 2020, and end it by 2030.\n\nHowever, trees continue to be cut down on an industrial scale, not least in the Amazon under the far-right government of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nHumans have already cut down half of Earth\u2019s forests, a practice doubly harmful for the climate when CO2-sucking trees are replaced with livestock or monoculture crops.\n\nGreenpeace criticised the Glasgow initiative for effectively giving the green light to \u201canother decade of deforestation\u201d.\n\n\u201cIndigenous peoples are calling for 80 percent of the Amazon to be protected by 2025, and they\u2019re right, that\u2019s what\u2019s needed,\u201d said Greenpeace Brazil executive director Carolina Pasquali.\n\n\u201cThe climate and the natural world can\u2019t afford this deal,\u201d she said.\n\nMany studies have shown that the best way of protecting forests worldwide is to keep them under the management of locals with generations of preservation knowledge.\n\nThe commitment comes a day after UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres harangued the gathered leaders to act to save humanity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to say: enough,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEnough of brutalising biodiversity. Enough of killing ourselves with carbon. Enough of burning and drilling and mining our way deeper. We are digging our own graves.\u201d\n\nSummit host Johnson warned of the \u201cuncontainable\u201d anger of the younger generations if the leaders failed to act decisively on climate change.\n\nThe UN COP26 conference will continue for another two weeks to try to craft national plans to forestall the most devastating impacts of global warming.",

          "text": "The Chief Defence Staff (CDS), Gen. Lucky Irabor, on Monday, said military operations in the 36 states of the federation have constituted a drain on the finances of the military.\n\nThe defence chief spoke as he inaugurated the maiden Joint Operations Planning Exercise (JOPEX) codenamed \u201cExercise Sky Lock\u201d for participants of Army, Naval and Air Force War Colleges in Abuja.\n\nAt the same time, the Nigerian Army has said the ongoing military operations in parts of the country did not amount to an occupation of the South-east region.\n\nHowever, speaking on the impact of the operation on Army\u2019s finances, Irabor said the military was engaged in internal security operations in all the 36 states of the nation as well as the FCT.\n\n\u201cThis has put a strain on our available resources committed to the ongoing counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations in the North-east\u201d, he said.\n\nAccording to him, the exercise was built around contemporary, realistic, and real-time security event in Nigeria and also marked the culmination of several moments of significant efforts towards developing the skills of participants of the three colleges in operational arts, design and decision-making process amongst others.\n\nAccording to the CDS, the exercise was another milestone in the professional military education and profile of the Nigerian military in its quest to properly equip its officers for present and future assignments.\n\n\u201cAs think tanks of the armed forces of Nigeria, our war colleges are indeed laboratories and incubation centres for the production of military operational level plans as well as measurement of performance and effectiveness of subsisting plans with a view to reviewing them for enhanced effectiveness.\n\n\u201cTo this end, the product of this joint operations planning exercise will form part of the military decision making cycle for some ongoing and future operations. This further underscores the significance of this science and the resources committed to each actualisation.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s event, therefore, provides an opportunity to kick start an enduring tradition for the colleges that will enshrine joint planning culture at the military operational leadership level,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, speaking at a briefing in Abuja, the Director, Army Public Relations, Brig. Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, said the ongoing Nigeria Army Exercises Still Water, Golden Dawn and Enduring Peace led to the arrest of 76 suspected criminals nationwide and rescue of 37 kidnapped victims.\n\n\u201cIt is crucial to dispel the unfounded narrative that the ongoing exercises are aimed at military occupation of the South-east. Contrary to this insinuation, the deployment of troops of the Nigerian Army is not only in the South-east Nigeria but also in the troubled parts of the country, particularly, in the North-west and North-eastern Nigeria, where troops are conducting major operations to tackle more threatening national security challenges,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, said the exercise covered 20 states and the FCT, adding: \u201cNote that the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya on 4 October flagged off Exercises Still Waters Enduring Peace and Golden Dawn in the South-South, South-west, North-central and South-east zones respectively.\n\n\u201cOn the whole, these exercises cover 20 states and the FCT. Furthermore, these exercises are traditionally scheduled to hold in the last quarter of the year to checkmate all forms of crimes as the yuletide season approaches.\n\n\u201cAs it stands today, troops have maintained an offensive posture, conducting several kinetic operations in the forms of raids on criminal hideouts and patrols amongst others. So far, all the exercises have recorded significant successes. I will go through each subsequently by way of reporting,\u201d he said.",
