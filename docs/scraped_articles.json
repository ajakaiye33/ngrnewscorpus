          "text": "Aformer Pro-Chancellor and chairman, Governing Council of University of Lagos, Dr Wale Babalakin, has advised the Federal Government to set up a judicial panel to look into the finances of UNILAG and other universities across Nigeria.\n\nBabalakin who spoke on Arise TV on Wednesday during the \u2018Morning Show,\u2019 noted that there was the need for the Federal Government to allow international accounting firm to look into the financial affairs of universities in the country.\n\nHe added, \u201cI am happy that the visitation panel recommended that an international accounting firm should look at the affairs of UNILAG.\n\n\u201cI will not stop at that, I will say a judicial panel with a judge knowledgeable in finance should look at all universities and it will be discovered that the Federal Government is just pumping money into these universities without getting commensurate return.\u201d\n\nThe immediate past Governing Council, led by Babalakin removed the Vice-Chancellor of UNILAG, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe in August, 2020 after a long face-off between both parties.\n\nBabalakin-led Governing Council accused Ogundipe of misappropriation of funds and a panel was setup by the FG to investigate the allegations.\n\nHowever, while the panel was about completing his report, Babalakin resigned in September 2020, while Ogundipe was reinstated in November 2020.\n\nBut another presidential Visitation Panel was constituted on 29th March, 2021 and was requested to look into the affairs of UNILAG between 2016 and 2020 which indicted university management.\n\nOn Wednesday, Babalakin raised concern that universities had become another government\u2019s parastatal where activities just happened with disregard to guidelines and rules, saying the Nigeria education system had collapse.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am here because of the collapse in the education system in Nigeria; the incident of UNILAG is simply a manifestation of the decay going on for long. The university system has completely collapsed; and I refused to be one of the boys.\n\n\u201cThe President of Nigeria, (Muhammadu) Buhari struggles to get money to fund the universities, but the money is not spent appropriately because a substantial part of was not spent for the purpose for which it was raised. In UNILAG, I discovered that a substantial part of it was misappropriated.\u201d\n\nHe lamented that the office of the VC in the country had become a coveted position where scholars struggled to attain.\n\n\u201cIt is like that because today, universities have simply become another Federal Government parastatal where so many things just happen there. The position of VC now has become a coveted position because it givs a lot of advantage to you.\n\n\u201cThe professors are earning about N450,000, but if you are friends of the VC, you can be made a director, you get a car, you can travel regularly and get allowances.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking on how to turn UNILAG in to a world-class university, Babalakin said, \u201cYou have to change the mindset of the workers; this is not another civil service job. Take the university out of the full control of the ministry. The Permanent Secretary wield a lot of power; all the things done in UNILAG cannot survive any legal test.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\n\n\nBy Chioma Obinna\n\nHealth workers under the aegis of the Joint Health Sector Unions, JOHESU, has urged the Federal Government to ensure fairness in addressing the welfare demands of its members.\n\nA letter made available to Vanguard dated September 10, 2021, addressed to the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, JOHESU alleged that the best welfare conditions were only enjoyed by physicians in the civil service.\n\nThe letter, entitled: \u2018Re: Notice of 15-Day Ultimatum and Commencement of an Indefinite Strike Action by JOHESU: Matters Arising,\u2019, and signed by JOHESU Chairman, Comrade Bio Josiah, partly reads: \u201cThe National Secretariat of JOHESU has been inundated with a recent memo of the NMA to the office of the Minister of Labour and Employment with regards to some welfare challenges of our members.\n\n\u201cAs usual, the childish tirades of the NMA were laden with evil chicanery and antagonism in a scenario that epitomises unwholesome meddlesomeness of the idle, ignorant and very inexperienced crop of representatives who lead the NMA.\n\n\u201cAfter a careful analysis of the submissions of the NMA, we wish to submit that in a most sympathetic display of emotive theatricalisation, the NMA decided to stand the truth on the head by claiming that JOHESU attempted to seek pay parity at the NICN but failed in 2018. In reality however, the representatives of NMA failed because they are too consumed in vengeance to appreciate that JOHESU was simply minding her business albeit lawfully by requesting the FG to respect the spirit of its CBA with JOHESU in 2014 which compels the FG to adjust its wages anytime government adjusts the wages of the beneficiaries of the CONMESS scale. This was sequel to understandings at the heart of the rules of engagement the FG and JOHESU had in 2009 which the 2014 CBA simply amplified.\n\n\u201cThe NMA often suggests that the golden rule in health care in Nigeria remains that anything it does not endorse does not exist. If the NMA suddenly says it is not aware of Residency Training which it has tried to frustrate in the FHIs exist, then JOHESU wishes to educate them that as far back as July, 2015, the FMOH issued a Residency training circular for Pharmacists undergoing post-graduate training at the West Africa Post-Graduate College of Pharmacists.\n\n\u201cWe at JOHESU openly challenge the clueless NMA hierarchy to show the world evidence based data that we do not have Consultants in Pharmacy, Nursing, Radiography, Physiotherapy, Medical Laboratory Science and other callings from those climes where international best practices evolved from. For the umpteenth time we say this is the norm from the UK, USA, Australia, France and even Ghana.\u201d\n\nContinuing, they noted that current events and attitude of the NMA would be a test case to see what the Federal government was prepared to do as it tackles JOHESU demands.\n\n\u201cMany of our members believe that we were short changed in 2018 because the ministers-in-charge of health are kith and kin with the NMA dynasty as they share the same professional DNA. JOHESU leadership will give your Ministry another opportunity to clean this stinking Augean stable in public interest,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe NICN in a landmark judgement of July 22, 2021 held \u201cconsidering the nature and structure of the NICN, the rules and statutory provisions governing the exercise of the court\u2019s jurisdiction particularly with regard to section 273(3) 1999 CFRN (as amended) and in view of the fact that a consent judgement had been duly entered in this case. I am satisfied that this court is functus officio and lacks the vires to entertain the application of the applicants or any of the applications before this court at this time. The applicant\u2019s motion is hereby dismissed.\n\n\u201cSince it has been obvious that the mischievous people who lead the NMA rely on unreliable utopia in their methodologies to manipulate every system, they will need the counsel of their attorneys to teach them how the legal system works particularly the principle of functus officio. These NMA leaders who do not understand many things apart from probably core medical practice need tutelage in basic human relationship management, routine administration and the principle of legal systems so that their expert pontification as itinerant quacks can be terminated.\n\n\u201cToday as it stands, JOHESU and the FG are forced to go back to the negotiating table because of the rulings of the NICN.\u201d\n\nFurther, he argued that the NMA was not the employer of JOHESU therefore urged the Minister to dismiss the tendencies of what ihe described as \u201cdespots and tyrants because of the nuisance value it constitutes.\u201d\n\nHe decried the discrimination in favour of doctors in terms of emoluments.\n\n\u201cIn the core civil service which was the object of reference of JOHESU, the physician has been elevated to king status because his entry point is GL 10 for housemanship and GL 13 after Youth Service. For any graduate outside the realm of a health professional to make GL 13 in the civil service, it will take at least 12 years after Youth Service, so we stand by our claims.\n\n\u201cMedical elders and patriots need to help the persons who style themselves as the brain-box of NMA that they are positioning this once upon a time famous and noble body to an emerging body of liars and charlatans who specialise in dabbling into other peoples business.\u201d\n\nAccording to JOHESU, there is also inequities in Residency Training for Health Professionals.\n\n\u201cAs far back as July, 2015, the FMOH issued a Residency training circular for Pharmacists undergoing post-graduate training at the West Africa Post-Graduate College of Pharmacists (WAPCP).\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Tony Akowe and Nicholas Kalu, Abuja\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nSecession agitators are not different from Boko Haram and Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP) members, House of Representatives Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila has said.\n\nHe described them as criminals masquerading as secession activists to unleash mayhem on innocent Nigerians and engage in economic sabotage.\n\nThe Speaker warned that if given time and space, the agitators would use their groups to put the nation on the path of destruction, Gbajabiamila stated this in Abuja while addressing members of the House on resumption from their summer vacation.\n\nHe used the opportunity to read a letter by President Muhammadu Buhari seeking approval to borrow $4 billion and \u20ac710 million loans to fund the 2021 budget.\n\nGbajabiamila, who assured that the House would no longer fold its arms and watch the agitators cause disunity in the country, stated that now was the time for statesmen to act beyond the petty considerations of politics for Nigeria to achieve greatness.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet it be apparent to those who have made themselves enemies of Nigeria that this 9th House of Representatives will respond to the audacity of their evil with every tool and resource at our disposal, and we will not be deterred.\n\n\u201cThus far, we have rightly focused our national security concerns on the machinations of extremist insurgents who seek to remake our world in the image of their discredited theocracy and bandits who maraud and terrorise whole regions for profit.\n\n\u201cWe must now add to these concerns an emerging threat that presents the same clear and present danger.\n\n\u201cIn the South of Nigeria, East and West, miscreants, and criminals masquerading as separationist activists have emerged to wreak havoc, take lives and commit economic sabotage against fellow Nigerians and against the state.\n\n\u201cThese people, in their inclination for devastating violence against fellow citizens, their appetite for the destruction of private property, their disruption of academic activities, commerce, and industry, their propensity for defiling institutions of the state, society, and community, their refusal to engage in debate, or to consider the possibility of dissenting opinions and alternative viewpoints are no different from Boko Haram and ISWAP.\n\n\u201cGiven space and time, they will take our nation down the same path of destruction. We know from experience that neither appeasement nor overwhelming violence alone will work.\n\n\u201cWe have been down this road before; we know what the consequences of inaction can be. We also know that we cannot afford to be reactionary in our approach.\n\n\u201cThis is the time to convene our best efforts to articulate a political, economic, military, and policing strategy to address both the manifestations and root causes of this emerging threat.\n\n\u201cLet nobody be under the impression that there is a political opportunity in exploiting this moment. This is a time for statesmen to act beyond the petty considerations of politics, to do the hard things and achieve greatness\u201d.\n\nHe assured that the 9th House of Representatives will continue to take action as required to address statutory deficiencies that limit the ability of the nation\u2019s security apparatus to respond effectively to the insecurity in the country.\n\nThe Speaker said the House would prioritise national security bills that seek to implement the recommendations of the security summit organised by the House during the new legislative session.\n\nHe later read the letter in which Buhari also sought approval for a $125 million grant.\n\nLike his letter to the Senate, the President explained that the loans and grant were an addendum to the 2018-2021 Federal Government External Borrowing Rolling Plan.\n\nHe said the need to borrow more funds was to meet the emerging needs of some critical projects.\n\n\u201cThe projects listed in the addendum to the 2018-2021 Federal Government External Borrowing Rolling Plan are to be financed through sovereign loans from the World Bank, French Development Agency, China Exim Bank, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and Credit Suisse Group and Standard Chartered/China Export and Credit (SINOSURE), in the total sum of $4,054,476,863 plus Euro 710,000,000. and grant component of $125,000,000.00,\u201d the letter read.\n\nThe National Assembly had in July approved $8,325,526,537 and \u20ac490 million loan requests by Buhari.",

          "text": "By Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja\n\n\u2022 UN should ignore demands\n\n\u2022 Speaker: secession agitators not different from Boko Haram\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe Presidency on Wednesday warned Yoruba Nation agitators against an alliance with the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nIt argued that their romance with IPOB has put a question mark on their claim to being rights promoters.\n\nThe Presidency asked the United Nations to ignore the demands made by the Yoruba Nation agitators, IPOB members in the Diaspora and Middle Belt activists for not being in line with the global body\u2019s values.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, House of Representatives Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila flayed secession agitators, saying there are not different from the Islamic State of West Africa (ISWAP) and Boko Haram members.\n\nThe Yoruba Nation agitators, in collaboration with IPOB members in the Diaspora on Tuesday, stage a protest at the UN headquarters in New York, United States.\n\nDuring the protest coordinated by the Nigerian Indigenous Nationalities Alliance for Self-Determination (NINAS), the agitators urged the UN to supervise a referendums in the Southern parts of Nigeria and the Middle Belt.\n\nThey also demanded an end to the killings allegedly being perpetrated by suspected herdsmen.\n\nBut in a statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, the Presidency said it was stunned to see \u201cYoruba Nation\u201d advocates throwing their weight behind IPOB.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cFor Nigerian diaspora groups to use the world\u2019s largest platform \u2013 the United Nations General Assembly \u2013 to garner attention to their causes are not unexpected.\n\n\u201cIt was, however shocking, to see \u201cYoruba Nation\u201d advocates yesterday (Tuesday) unequivocally throw their lot in with IPOB.\n\n\u201dIPOB has now publicly revealed a 50,000 strong paramilitary organisation.\n\n\u201cIt (IPOB) regularly murders security services and innocent civilians, with a significant uptick of violent attacks this year. And it is currently attempting to hold Nigerian states hostage with orders to stay at home under threat of terror.\n\n\u201cWithout doubt, Nigerians and the entire world will judge Yoruba Nation by the company it keeps.\n\n\u201cNo one can take seriously this organisation if it continues its IPOB association. When their allies systematically trample human rights, it raises sober questions about their claims to uphold the values of the UN.\n\n\u201cThe cooperation is a worrying development, once parsed with Yoruba Nation\u2019s increasingly violent rallies in Nigeria.\n\n\u201dActions and associations speak louder than words. Yoruba Nation\u2019s talk of human rights promotion must therefore be ignored.\u201d.\n\nThe Presidency also restated its commitment to the fight against corruption and illicit financial flows, adding that it would continue building and joining global alliances in the battle.\n\nIt said the Muhammadu Buhari Administration was steadfast in its fight against terrorism, particularly in the Sahel region.\n\nThe Presidency added: \u201cThe Nigerian government will continue its work at the UN- to fight against corruption and illicit financial flows, and international cooperation.\n\n\u201cIf we want to see stolen funds returned to their rightful home in Nigeria, the government must continue to campaign for and coordinate global action on asset recovery.\n\n\u201cThe government will remain the leading regional actor in the fight against global terror \u2013 particularly against threats emanating from the Sahel. Through the Nigerian Technical Aid Corps programme, the country also shares technical expertise with countries from the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, the administration is implementing a programme of environmental sustainability to combat developments, which destroy Nigerian communities in vulnerable regions.\n\n\u201cOnly through the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development can we secure a prosperous future for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs the largest country in Africa, the government takes seriously its leadership role and will continue to strive for continental unity, cooperation, and shared prosperity\u201d, the statement said.\n\nIt, however, sought the media\u2019s support in projecting the programme of the administration, saying \u201cour expectation is therefore for the media to work with the government to focus attention on the core issues the President, the leader of the country has on his programme.\u201d",

However, in the Southeast, only Enugu State has a law against open grazing.\n\nIgbo youths on Wednesday urged the Southern governors to prevail on Southest governors to legalise the ban on open grazing in the region.\n\nThey urged the governors of Anambra, Imo, Ebonyi and Abia states to emulate their Enugu counterpart Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, who had signed the state\u2019s anti-open grazing bill into law.\n\nRead Also; Battle for VAT collection shifts to Supreme Court\n\nOn Wednesday, Akwa Ibom State Governor Udom Emmanuel and his Osun State counterpart Gboyega Oyetola, signed the anti-open grazing bill into law.\n\nApart from Enugu, no other state in the Southeast has initiated any legislative move towards legalising the ban on open grazing.\n\nIn a statement in Enugu, the President-General of Ohanaeze Youth Congress (OYC), Okwu Nnabuike, urged the Southern governors, who are meeting in Enugu today to prevail on other Southeast governors to legalise the ban.\n\nHe lamented that Southeast governors were only paying lip service to their resolutions.\n\nNnabuike said: \u201cWe heartily welcome them to Enugu, a very peaceful state and urge them to ensure that resolutions they make during these meetings are implemented by all the member-states\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe are not pleased with other states in Southeast which are paying lip service to the open-grazing ban.\n\n\u201cThis is unacceptable, and we have said before that should anything happen to any Igbo community, those governors would be held accountable. They cannot sacrifice the lives of our people on the altar of politics.\u201d\n\nAkwa Ibom\u2019s Bill to Prohibit Open Rearing and Grazing of Livestock also made provision for the establishment of ranches.\n\nEmmanuel assented to the bill after it was presented to him by the House of Assembly Speaker, Aniekan Bassey, and the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr Uko Udom (SAN).\n\nEmmanuel said that the law is no respecter of persons, irrespective of status or caliber.\n\nHe directed relevant authorities to ensure that the law is enforced, stressing that culprits must be brought to book.\n\nEmmanuel said: \u201cThe law will promote modern techniques in animal husbandry, prevent the destruction of farms by wandering cattles, while reducing clashes and killings between herders and farmers in the state.\n\n\u201cIt will also promote international best practices in livestock administration, regulation and control in the state.\u201d\n\nSpeaker of Osun State House of Assembly, Timothy Owoeye, at the plenary, noted that the law will prevent the destruction of farms and crops by open grazing of livestock.\n\nOyetola\u2019s Chief Press Secretary Ismail Omipidan, told reporters in Osogbo, that his boss has signed the bill into law.\n\nHe said: \u201cMr Governor has signed the anti-open grazing bill into law immediately the bill was transmitted from the House of Assembly to the office of his excellency. We have notified the security agencies that will enforce the law in every part of the state, so, it is a crime to practice open grazing in Osun state.\n\n\u201cOsun State is one of the most peaceful states in the country. We have fewer challenges of herders invading farms to destroy the crop or attacking farmers because we had in place a Committee on Peaceful Co-Existence between Fulani/Bororo and Crop Farmers, led by Mudasiru Toogun, to foster peace between these communities.\n\n\u201cBefore enacting this law, we have summoned stakeholder meeting to deliberate on the matter and we have enlightened the herders in the state on the benefit of embracing ranching system. We have made provisions for the practice of ranching through the ministry of agriculture.\u201d\n\nHe added that the law will prevent killings, sexual molestation, and protect the environment from degradation and pollution caused by open grazing.\n\nOmipidan added: \u201cAny person or group who contravenes the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) of this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable to terms of imprisonment of not less than 3 years without the option of fine as well as forfeiture of the herds of Cattle or livestock under his or her control to the State Government.\n\n\u201cA minor is prohibited from grazing, rearing or herding of livestock except under the supervision of an adult.\n\n\u201cA minor who contravenes the provision of Section 3 (4) committed an offence, and the guardian or parent of the minor or owner of the livestock as the case may be, shall be vicariously liable on conviction to a fine of N300,000.00 only.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the conveyance of livestock on foot from one destination to another in the State is prohibited, except such movement is by Rail Wagon or Truck or pick-up wagon and is within 7:00 am to 6:00 pm.",

          "text": "Three months after the unfortunate incident that claimed the lives of 11 military personnel, including former Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, the Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB), Nigeria has submitted its interim report to the Nigerian Air Force.\n\nThe investigator was said to have listed 27 initial findings and eight safety recommendations for immediate implementation.\n\nIbrahim Attahiru.\n\nThis was made known in a joint statement signed on Wednesday by NAF spokesman, Edward Gabkwet; and his AIB counterpart, Tunji Oketunbi.\n\nRecall that on May 21, 2021 the NAF Beechcraft 350 jet crashed near the Kaduna International Airport, killing all officers on board.\n\nFollowing the crash, AIB was directed by NAF to break away from protocol and investigate the crash.\n\nAIB only investigates crashes involving civil airlines.\n\nThe Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer of AIB, Engr Akin Olateru noted that although the accident involved a military aircraft and crew, it happened at a civil airport, which may explain why it was willing to break away from the norm and investigate the crash.\n\nThe statement was titled, \u2018Accident Investigation Bureau Submits Interim Report On Aircraft Accident Involving Nigerian Air Force King Air-350 Aircraft To The Chief Of Air Staff\u2019.\n\nIt read, \u201cFollowing the unfortunate incident involving a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) King Air -350 aircraft at the vicinity of Kaduna Civil Airport on 31 May 2021, the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao directed that a joint investigative body consisting of experienced NAF safety officers and the Accident Investigative Bureau (AIB) be constituted to investigate the circumstances surrounding the air crash.\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter about three months of painstaking joint investigation, the Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer of AIB, Engr Akin Olateru FNSE, today 15 September 2021 submitted an interim report on the sad incident to the Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Amao, at his office at NAF Headquarters, Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe submitted report is organized into three sections namely; the information obtained in the course of the investigation; analysis of data collected in view of the Board\u2019s Terms of Reference; and the conclusion, which covers the initial findings and immediate recommendations.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that at this interim stage, a total of 27 initial findings and 8 immediate safety recommendations were made for the convening authority as well as other aviation-related agencies for immediate implementation. It is expected that the final report will contain the flight data recorder readout, the reviewed operator\u2019s and service provider\u2019s standard operating procedures as well as other detailed analyses.\n\n\u201cWhile receiving the report, the CAS reiterated the main essence of activating the \u2018joint investigative\u2019 clause contained in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed between the NAF and the AIB on 1 July, 2020. According to him, the successful collaboration is a clear indication of the potency of collaboration in aircraft accident investigation, which must be encouraged.\n\n\u201cAir Marshal Amao also noted that such collaborative efforts make accident investigations more transparent and open while also stating that the outcome of the investigation is not necessarily aimed at punitive measures but essentially at generally improving safety in the aviation industry.\n\n\u201cOn his part, the Chief Executive Officer of AIB, Engr Akin Olateru stated that the joint investigation with the NAF was its first direct involvement in military air crash investigation in Nigeria and second investigation outside its mandate having also assisted Sao Tome and Principe in the past. He also stated that copies of the report, with the endorsement of the CAS, will also be submitted to the Hon. Minister of Aviation and Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) to ensure that the recommendations addressed to aviation agencies are implemented.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner also stated that although the accident involved a military aircraft and crew, it happened at a civil airport adding that the involvement of AIB in the investigation by the Nigerian Air Force would help in closing the gaps on the civil aviation side.\u201d",

          "text": "Tragedy struck in the fight against terror group, Boko Haram, on Wednesday, when a fighter jet involved in the counter-insurgency operation in the North-East bombed a village in Yunusari Local Government Area of Yobe State, killing at least 10 villagers.\n\nYunusari is in the Northern part of Yobe State, sharing international border with Niger Republic.\n\nFile Photo\n\nAccording to residents, the fighter jet belonging to the military approached from the Eastern part of the town around 8:30am and started firing sporadically.\n\nHowever, a military source who confirmed the story told SaharaReporters that the Air Force \u201caccidentally\u201d hit the wrong coordinates while targeting a camp belonging to Boko Haram insurgents in the area.\n\nThe Chairman of Yunusari Local Government Area, Alhaji Bukar Gaji also confirmed the incident.\n\n\u201cYes, it happened; we received the sad news today and the victims are currently in the hospital receiving treatment,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, Edward Gabkwet, Air Force spokesman denied the incident.\n\nSpeaking to SaharaReporters, Gabkwet said, \u201cThis tweet is false in its entirety. The NAF last conducted a mission into Yobe State (Not Yunusari LGA) on 5 September 2021 and it was an armed recce. No bomb or missile was even expended. Thanks.\u201d\n\nHe was reacting to a tweet by a media organisation.\n\nVillagers in the past have reported some civilian casualties in near-daily bombardments in Northeastern Nigeria.\n\nRecently, a military jet that came to repel an attack by Boko Haram dropped a bomb that landed in a compound where civilians were having child christening.\n\nA fighter jet also on a mission against Boko Haram extremists in April 2021 mistakenly bombed men of the Nigerian Army, killing over 20 officers.\n\nThe soldiers who were reinforced from Ngandu village were said to be on their way to Mainok, headquarters of the Kaga Local Government Area of Borno state which was under attack by militants from the Islamic State-backed faction of Boko Haram, the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), formerly known as Jam\u0101'at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da'wah wa'l-Jih\u0101d.\n\nSome of the Chibok schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram in 2014 and freed last year also said three of their classmates were killed by Air Force bombardments.\n\nIn June 2021, an offensive aerial bombardment the NAF Alpha jet carried out around Genu town in Niger State resulted in the killing of some wedding guests.",

          "text": "A few months ago, Udoma Nseobong took a \u20a630,000 ($60) loan from CashLion Credit. He repaid the weekly interest consistently for six weeks until his final payment.\n\nUnfortunately, he defaulted on his final payment by a day due to unforeseen circumstances. This short period was enough time for Nseobong to be declared by CashLion credit as a fraudster on the run with his entire family to his contacts (OP: ICIR Nigeria).\n\nThis incident is one out of many which indicate that digital lenders will go the extra mile, sometimes using unethical methods, to get their loans back.\n\nNotably, despite the criticism against unethical practices by lenders, some still justify this method of debt collection.\n\n\u201cThere is no defamation of character involved when we trust people we\u2019ve never seen by giving them money and when it\u2019s time to pay they don\u2019t pay,\u201d Titilayo Adetonya, a customer representative for digital lender CashLion told The ICIR.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lawful to send those messages to their contacts because we warn them before we send those messages to their contacts and that\u2019s how we get our money,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter many years of unending complaints, on August 17, the National Information and Technology Development Agency (NITDA), slammed Soko Loan Company Limited, a Nigerian digital lending platform, with a fine of \u20a610 million for privacy invasion. Soko Loan was found guilty of unilaterally sending privacy-invading messages to the loan defaulters\u2019 contacts.\n\nThis sanction, although a mere warning shot, is the first public attempt by NITDA to address this prevalent issue. The sanction served as a clarion call for digital lenders to use ethical alternative methods to collect loans.\n\nBut what does an ethical alternative look like and how effective is it?\n\nAn alternative approach\n\nJulian Flosbach knows what it\u2019s like to look for better alternatives, as he experienced it first hand when he was the general manager at FairMoney, a Nigeria-based digital lender turned digital bank. He helped grow the company from 8 employees to over 120 employees; and in that same period, Julian also supervised doling out loans to over a million customers.\n\n\u201cIn the early days when giving out a few loans, it\u2019s easy to have a team of five in charge of collections but as things scale up and you have to manage over one million borrowers you start reconsidering a few things,\u201d Julian said. \u201cWhen you have 100,000 defaulters [10% default rate], you have to ask yourself, \u2018Do I want to be a fintech lender or do I want to be a collection company?\u2019\n\nAt one point, FairMoney had as many as 80 employees managing collections in-house; but it quickly became clear that running in-house collections moved the company\u2019s focus away from its business model: giving out loans.\n\nSo the company decided to search for an external solution, and found themselves with the best available option at that time: business process outsourcing (BPO) firms who do customer service for big banks and telcos. But it didn\u2019t take long to see that there were some cracks in the collection process.\n\n\u201cIf you want to do collections with operational excellence then just calling customers actually doesn\u2019t always work. These BPOs don\u2019t have customised computer systems for collections, rather they have generic customer relationship management tools (CRMs) or predictive dialers. So for instance they call customers once a week, instead of when the customer actually should or wants to be called. It\u2019s not very efficient.\u201d\n\nThis harrowing experience led him to team up with Moses Nmor (Chief Product Officer), and Chukwudi Enyi (Chief Operations Officer) to start BFree, Africa\u2019s first digital credit collection company. All three co-founders worked together at FairMoney.\n\nThe company saw an opportunity to be one of the less than ten digital credit collection companies grappling for a slice of a $14.4b credit collection market in emerging markets. In emerging markets, BFree\u2019s competitors are India\u2019s Credgenics (recently raised $25m Series A) and CreditMate (backed by Paytm), FLOW in Singapore and Blu365 in Brazil.\n\nIn the space of over a year since it launched, BFree has grown to nearly 460,000 active customers from over 20 lenders in Nigeria and Kenya.\n\nWhat does Ethical credit management look like?\n\nLooking away from the approach of other debt collection solutions, most of which thrive on humiliating customers, BFree focuses on ethics and technology in debt recovery.\n\nBFree helps lenders collect loans from their borrowers for a fee. The company charges a commission on the repayments that a lender receives. This commission depends on the lender\u2019s portfolio size and quality amongst other factors.\n\nBFree\u2019s ethical approach to loan recovery is guided by a data-backed belief that the majority of customers take a loan with the intention to repay. Of course, with the exception of isolated cases of fraudsters and fraud victims.\n\nThis approach is validated by the fact that the average 90 days default rate of Nigeria\u2019s top digital lending companies is 10% \u2014 FairMoney (10%), Carbon (11%), Branch (<10%). This means that only about 10% of Nigerians (there\u2019s no central register, but Flosbach estimates about 10-15 million people) default on loans.\n\n\u201cThe majority of the customers (70-75%) fall into the category of folks that want to pay but cannot repay. This is usually due to loss of income \u2014 loss of job or the business went bad or there was an emergency that took away the money.\u201d\n\nThis is a common case in a country like Nigeria where people live from hand to mouth. Without insurance, anything can topple their sustainability.\n\nAt BFree customers are appraised based on two factors: willingness and capability to pay.\n\n\u201cWhen a lender like Branch or FairMoney gives us a portfolio, we assess and underwrite the loan. We take their behavioural data and build two things: collectability score and use case. Then we move these into a collection funnel.\u201d\n\nThis debt collection process basically starts as a self-service platform where customers can log in and see their own repayment plans. At this phase, customers get SMS messages and perform loan repayment activities themselves. This way BFree reduces the number of man-hours spent on making calls and customers aren\u2019t forced to deal with unexpected phone calls during working hours.\n\nIn the case where a customer defaults, BFree reaches out to the borrower to find out why and to also get a promised date of payment (verbal agreement). This simply involves reaching out and asking them for when they\u2019ll be able to make a payment. Based on the agreed dates, automated reminders are put in place.\n\nBFree operates call centres with about 200 agents who are responsible for reaching out to customers. BFree\u2019s goal is to make the process of debt recovery 95% automated in the next few years.\n\n\u201cThe story of collections has gotten bad press with BPOs taking data and threatening customers. Automating this process helps remove the risk of this happening because a bot will never threaten a customer.\u201c\n\nWhat happens when customers default\n\nFlosbach acknowledges that one of the inherent risks of lending is that you have to accept that there\u2019s always going to be default. He believes that the way out here is to accept that some customers won\u2019t repay, and assist customers that will repay as much as possible.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no portfolio in the world that doesn\u2019t have default. In this case, you have to assess whether it\u2019s a natural default or an operational default.\u201d\n\nIn a natural default, the customers don\u2019t repay because of an unexpected occurrence like a health emergency. When this happens the best case is to re-assess the customer status and agree on a different repayment plan.\n\n\u201cWe should normalize the fact that customers have financial emergencies, the same way nobody blames people for going to the doctor when they fall unexpectedly sick.\u201c\n\nIn an operational default customers don\u2019t repay because of a flaw in the loan collection process. For example, customers don\u2019t get the right repayment plan or they\u2019re not aware of how to make the repayment i.e they don\u2019t know which bank account to pay to.\n\nBFree\u2019s process helps to ensure that operational default decreases as much as possible. So far 95% of customers have rated their experience with BFree as good or satisfactory, a hint that the company\u2019s approach is effective.\n\nAs lending expands beyond an activity being performed by only traditional banks and digital lenders to one that almost every company can, BFree\u2019s value proposition remains relevant.\n\nFlosbach believes that BFree\u2019s ultimate goal is to increase trust in the African lending space.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re increasing trust in the financial retail market by decreasing risk and giving businesses a better margin.\u201d\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

The result is that access to the internet has become ubiquitous in many of the densely populated areas across the enormous country.\n\nCitizens in Sudan \u201crely heavily on mobile data as the primary means to keep its populace connected to the rest of the world,\u201d says the report.\n\nAlgeria is second-cheapest at $0.51, while Somalia takes the third-cheapest slot on the continent, at $0.60 per 1GB of mobile data.\n\nConsumer telecoms analyst at Cable, Dan Howdle, said countries with the cheapest rates of mobile data have excellent mobile and fixed broadband infrastructure, making it easier for service providers in those markets to be able to offer large amounts of data, which brings down the price per gigabyte.\n\n\u201cOthers with less advanced broadband networks are heavily reliant on mobile data and the economy dictates that prices must be low, as that\u2019s what people can afford,\u201d said Howdle in the report.\n\nSudan, with a population of more than 45 million and at least 13 million internet subscribers is at par with Italy ($0.27), but trails Israel ($0.05), Kyrgyzstan ($0.15) and Fiji ($0.19), in the global ranking.\n\nPhoto by Kojo Kwarteng on Unsplash\n\nInternet data costs per region in Africa\n\nOther African countries that charge mobile internet subscribers less than $1 to browse the web and run mobile apps are Ghana ($0.66), Libya ($0.74), Tanzania ($0.75), Mauritius ($0.75), Nigeria ($0.88), Cameroon ($0.90) and Senegal ($0.94).\n\nThe report, which featured more than 230 countries across 12 regions and compared the cost of 1GB from over 6,000 mobile data plans, also pointed out that North Africa (at an average of $1.53) has the cheapest data plans in the world.\n\nAlgeria (16), Libya (30) and Morocco (45) are in the World\u2019s top 50 while Egypt (55) Tunisia (59) and Mauritania feature in the top 100 global list.\n\nHowever, Egypt ($1.04), Tunisia ($1.09) and Mauritania ($5.56) charge more than $1 for 1GB of data.\n\nKenya and South Africa, with advanced mobile infrastructure and high internet traffic, fall far behind the top 100 list, with charges of $2.25 and $2.67 per gigabyte of data respectively\n\nThe cost of data in these two countries, however, is cheaper than the global average of $4.07. According to the report, South Africa and Kenya are considered competitive mobile markets with the prices of these \u2018wealthy nations\u2019 not necessarily considered expensive by customers.\n\n\u201cMany countries in the middle of the list have good infrastructure and competitive mobile markets, and while their prices aren\u2019t among the cheapest in the world they wouldn\u2019t necessarily be considered expensive by its consumers,\u201d says the report.\n\nSouth Africa and Kenya have rolled out commercial 5G networks in their markets.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "title": "DMO finalises plan to restructure CBN\u2019s over N10trn \u2018ways, means\u2019 advances to govt",
          "text": "The Debt Management Office (DMO) is working out the process of restructuring the over N10 trillion ways and means advances of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for government financing to a long-term debt.\n\nLike most central banks, the CBN Act 2007 allows it to lend to the government through ways and means and makes a provision of 5 percent of the previous year\u2019s government\u2019s revenues. However, due to recent shortfalls and spendings that the government has had to deal with, that limit has been exceeded.\n\n\u201cNow we have recognised that huge amount which has accumulated over the years and we are working towards restructuring it, meaning convert it into a tenored debt and then getting the necessary process approvals from the Federal Executive Council (FEC) and National Assembly to include them in the public debt stock,\u201d Patience Oniha, director- general, DMO said Wednesday evening in Abuja\n\nShe said the figure earlier in the year was about N10 trillion, but imagines that it should be much higher now.\n\nBut Nigeria\u2019s public debt stock grew by 7.75 percent to N35.465 trillion by the end of June 2021 from N32.916 trillion in December 2020, new figures from the DMO show.\n\nThis moderately raised Debt to GDP as at June to 21.92 percent from 21.61 percent as at December 2020.\n\nIn terms of the mix, external borrowing was 38.66%, while domestic was 61.34 percent.\n\nTotal public debt stock comprises the Domestic and External Debts of the FGN, 36 State Governments and the FCT.\n\nWhile Federal Government debt took the chunk of 83.07 percent, states and FCT borrowings averaged 16.93 percent.\n\nRead Also: $6.18bn external borrowing not new \u2013 DMO\n\nThe medium term debt management strategy which was approved in February increased the debt to GDP ratio for the usual 25 percent to 40 percent.\n\nShe also indicated that when the ways and means advances and other debt stock are put together, Nigeria\u2019s debt to GDP could get to 35 percent, explaining why it was already recognised in the latest Medium Term Debt Management Strategy.\n\nThe increase, according to her, is for the three reasons, one is the appropriation Act that is being implemented. The second and perhaps the most significant item for the additional space is the ways and means advances of the central bank. And the third is new borrowings that may come from those stand-alones like those that may be in the medium term external borrowing plan.\n\n\u201cSo it is not exactly correct to say that the government increased the from 25 percent to 40 percent to allow for new borrowing. The reality is that we already have a stock of ways and means to include, so we are only being realistic and work is ongoing in terms of restructuring or securitising the ways and means advances.\u201d\n\nAs at June, external debt in terms of composition showed that a significant portion of about 54.88 percent were multilateral loans which are all concessional.\n\nAnother component is the bilateral loans from China, France, Japan, India, Germany which is about 12.70 percent, and Oniha said that the utilization is quite visible in financing for airports, rail, road building and so on. China accounts for a chunk of about 10 percent.\n\n\u201cThe emphasis is to look at what those loans have been used for,\u201d she argued.\n\nThe third component of external borrowing is the commercial loans, including the Eurobonds, Diaspora bond which account for 31.88 percent. Promissory Notes account for 0.54 percent as indicated in the breakdown.\n\nOniha explained that the benefits of Eurobond issuance for Nigeria cannot be overemphasized first of all in terms of the interest and how it showcases the country in a positive light in the international financial markets where large pools of capital is available.\n\nThe sovereign Eurobonds have also helped provide a benchmark for several local companies and opened a window for Nigerian banks to raise tier 2 capital to meet regulatory requirements and enhance their capacity to lend to, and, support local borrowers.\n\nEurobonds have been a potent tool for building up Nigeria\u2019s External Reserves which supports Naira exchange rate and the country\u2019s sovereign rating.\n\nRaising funds externally through Eurobonds to finance budget deficits reduces the level of sovereign borrowing in the domestic markets.\n\nThe Eurobonds are actually issued as part of the approved government borrowing plan usually in the FGN\u2019s annual budgets, for financing capital projects thereby reducing the infrastructure gap.\n\nAccording to the DG, fiscal challenges have led to increased borrowing, including massive infrastructure funding, two times recession, and of course Covid-19 impact.\n\nNigeria has over the years, had consecutive budget deficits which have been financed by borrowing, amid inability to attracts proceeds from government assets.\n\nShe acknowledged that the country\u2019s public debt is fast growing, with high debt service to revenue ratio as well as concerns for use of proceeds, additional borrowing has been on the back of huge infrastructure deficit, recession, consecutive budget deficit, low revenue base, compounded by dependence on crude oil.\n\nGiving some sort of comparison, Oniha explained that among a sample of countries, including the advanced countries, Nigeria\u2019s public debt as a percentage of GDP is extremely high, but interest payment as a percentage of revenue is small.\n\n\u201cSo the missing link for us is revenue. For Nigeria, public debt as a percentage of GDP is 19 percent, but interest payment as a percentage of revenue is 43.2 percent. The numbers don\u2019t add up and this is what has informed DMO\u2019s position that we have to grow revenues.\n\n\u201cTax as a percentage of GDP is at 5.68 percent, even below Angola and from the recent World Bank\u2019s update on Sub-Saharan Africa, out of 115 countries, Nigeria was the 114th only before Afghanistan. We carry N35 trillion debt stock as at June and it\u2019s about to increase, it will keep increasing as we borrow more, so we should begin to focus very aggressively on revenues.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the challenge for us is how do we increase revenues rather than just focus alone on debt stock which is growing. We need to be asking why is the GDP not translating into revenues.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore, we need revenues, and public private partnership, and I think the fear should come with revenues,\u201d Oniha stated, hoping that the strategic revenue initiative of the government would make some impact.",

          "text": "Just a matter of days to the 61st Independence anniversary of Nigeria, and in the spirit of the International Day of Democracy marked on Wednesday, September 15, 2021, some Nigerians have said the country\u2019s democracy has failed to deliver on its basic pillars.\n\nThey also canvassed the enthronement of the two pillars of democracy, which are the rule of law and the integrity of the ballot.\n\nX-raying, in particular, the gains or otherwise of democracy to Nigeria since 1999, Martins Onovo, a United States-trained petroleum engineer, and former presidential candidate of the National Conscience Party (NCP); Okey Ikechukwu, executive director, Development Spec Academy, and Sa\u2019eed Husaini, director of research, Centre for Development and Democracy, blamed political practitioners for the low level of achievements so far recorded.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with BusinessDay, Onovo said what may have been termed as democracy at one time or the other in Nigeria since Independence in 1960, was not true democracy. He alleged that the situation had even degenerated since 1960.\n\n\u201cIf this was a democracy, I can guarantee you that by the nature of democracy, the interest of the people would be taken care of. We would have made progress if we were running a democracy,\u201d he said.\n\nOnovo pointed out that \u201cThe rule of law is corrupted; the integrity of the ballot is corrupted because votes have never counted in Nigeria since independence. Nigeria was founded on election rigging. We have the confession of our colonial officer, Harold Smith on that; that the colonial authorities rigged the first election. So, Nigeria was founded on rigging.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Electoral violence and Nigerian democracy\n\nHe further said: \u201cIf we claimed we did not understand our problem, Chinua Achebe explained it in \u201983, \u201984 in his book, \u2018The Trouble with Nigeria,\u2019 and everybody agreed. So, we can no longer claim we do not understand our problem because we agree with Achebe; but we deliberately pursue our own selfish interest to allow the national problem to fester. You can see that it has got worse with time.\u201d\n\nAccording to Onovo, \u201cIf you use this insecurity everybody is talking about as an example; as at the day President Muhammadu Buhari took over power, Nigeria was Number 4 on the World Terrorism Index; today Nigeria is Number 3.\n\n\u201cSo, it has got worse. If you look at the poverty data as at the day Buhari took over power, you would see that we were not the global capital of extreme poverty, but with Buhari we became the global capital of extreme poverty. If you look at our Transparent International Corruption Perception Index reading, as at the day Buhari took over, I think we were 136th, today we are 149th. So, corruption has become worse. So, everything has got worse.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the economy, it is the same data, forget the 5 percent they are reporting, it is false; because today naira is 550 to a dollar. When Buhari took over, it was 197. Today, your total national debt is nearly N40 trillion and you are going to borrow more; the request is before the Senate. But when he took over it was N12.1 trillion. So, nothing can be more catastrophic than the kind of democracy we think we are practising now.\u201d\n\nIkechukwu, in a monitored interview on Channels Television, said Nigeria had actually retrogressed since 1999.\n\n\u201cWe have actually retrogressed. At the level of fundamentals of democracy \u2013 values \u2013 we have lost mileage. At the level of incidentals, which include the dividends of democracy, standard of living, among others, we have also lost mileage,\u201d he said.\n\nThe political class appears to pursue narrow interest without considering the interest of the people, he noted, faulting the lack of internal democracy in political parties.\n\n\u201cThis consensus candidacy has continued from party level even to real elections without giving the people the opportunity to choose their leaders. Democracy is not being deepened when the people are not being given the opportunity to elect those they want to lead them,\u201d he said.\n\nHusaini, who also spoke on the Channels Television programme, noted that Nigerians had become all the more cynical and disillusioned as a result of the activities of those in power, noting that this appeared to have increased the level of apathy in the polity.\n\n\u201cWe need a more transparent and workable system. There is a need for more participation across board. What we see today is that people do more of politics than governance,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB) has submitted an interim report on the Air Force aircraft, King Air 350, that crashed killing then chief of army staff, Ibrahim Attahiru, and 10 others.\n\nDetails of the report have yet to be made public.\n\nPresenting the report to the Chief of Air Staff, Isyaka Amao, on Wednesday, the Chief Executive Officer of AIB, Akin Olateru, said the report contained 27 findings and eight recommendations for immediate implementation.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES had reported how an air force aircraft conveying Mr Attahiru and other senior officers of the army crashed around Kaduna airport. About five of the occupants were army generals.\n\nAlthough the statement, jointly signed by Edward Gabkwet, the air force spokesperson, and his AIB counterpart, Tunji Oketunbi, did not contain the details of the recommendations, the statement said the report is organised into three sections.\n\n\u201cThe submitted report is organized into three sections namely; the information obtained in the course of the investigation; analysis of data collected in view of the Board\u2019s Terms of Reference; and the conclusion, which covers the initial findings and immediate recommendations,\u201d it read.\n\nThe statement also said the final report will contain more detailed information.\n\nRead the full joint statement below.\n\nACCIDENT INVESTIGATION BUREAU SUBMITS INTERIM REPORT ON AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT INVOLVING NIGERIAN AIR FORCE KING AIR-350 AIRCRAFT TO THE CHIEF OF AIR STAFF\n\nFollowing the unfortunate incident involving a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) King Air -350 aircraft at the vicinity of Kaduna Civil Airport on 21 May 2021, the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao directed that a joint investigative body consisting of experienced NAF safety officers and the Accident Investigative Bureau (AIB) be constituted to investigate the circumstances surrounding the air crash. After about three months of painstaking joint investigation, the Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer of AIB, Engr Akin Olateru FNSE, today 15 September 2021 submitted an interim report on the sad incident to the Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Amao, at his office at NAF Headquarters, Abuja.\n\nThe submitted report is organized into three sections namely; the information obtained in the course of the investigation; analysis of data collected in view of the Board\u2019s Terms of Reference; and the conclusion, which covers the initial findings and immediate recommendations. It should be noted that at this interim stage, a total of 27 initial findings and 8 immediate safety recommendations were made for the convening authority as well as other aviation related agencies for immediate implementation. It is expected that the final report will contain the flight data recorder readout, the reviewed operator\u2019s and service provider\u2019s standard operating procedures as well as other detailed analysis.\n\nWhile receiving the report, the CAS reiterated the main essence of activating the \u2018joint investigative\u2019 clause contained in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed between the NAF and the AIB on 1 July, 2020. According to him, the successful collaboration is a clear indication of the potency of collaboration in aircraft accident investigation, which must be encouraged. Air Marshal Amao also noted that such collaborative efforts make accident investigations more transparent and open while also stating that the outcome of the investigation is not necessarily aimed at punitive measures but essentially at generally improving safety in the aviation industry.\n\nOn his part, the Chief Executive Officer of AIB, Engr Akin Olateru stated that the joint investigation with the NAF was its first direct involvement in military air crash investigation in Nigeria and second investigation outside its mandate having also assisted Sao Tome and Principe in the past. He also stated that copies of the report, with the endorsement of the CAS, will also be submitted to the Hon. Minister of Aviation and Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) to ensure that the recommendations addressed to aviation agencies are implemented. The Commissioner also stated that although the accident involved a military aircraft and crew, it happened at a civil airport adding that the involvement of AIB in the investigation by the Nigerian Air Force would help in closing the gaps on the civil aviation side.\n\n(Signed)\n\nEdward Gabkwet\n\nAir Commodore\n\nDirector of Public\n\nRelations and Information\n\n(Signed)\n\nTunji Oketunbi\n\nGeneral Manager\n\n{Public Affairs)\n\nAccident Investigation Bureau",

          "text": "Idowu Olakunle,Abeokuta\n\nOgun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has said that palliative work expected to be carried out on the bad portions of the Lagos-Ota and Ota-Idi-Iroko roads will be concluded by December.\n\nGovernor Abiodun stated this, today, Wednesday, when he led the Minister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola on an inspection tour of ongoing construction of Toll Plaza at Lotto, along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway.\n\nAbiodun noted that the palliative work on the roads is to reduce the hardship being experienced by commuters.\n\nThe governor also said the failed portions, which would be reconstructed by the Federal Road Maintenance Agency (FERMA), would cost N13.4bn and would be part of the N56bn contract sum.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, the Minister has graciously instructed that FERMA fixes those places and immediately begin to carry out palliative works on that road,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have given the commitment that we will relocate traders; we will control and manage traffic, whatever that it is we need to do, we will ensure that we begin to bring succour and needed relief to our people.\n\n\u201cThe state of that road today is pitiable. I went on that road myself and I felt bad for our citizens, however like the Minister has explained, we have decided to find a fasttrack solution and I must thank the Minister. He has graciously decided to extract those failed portion, those very terrible portions, not just at the old Toll Gate but about two kilometers of all the failed portions along the length of that road up to Abeokuta.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve identified those portions, they are costing them right now, they are extracting them from the main contract, they have costed them to be about N13.4 billion. He is going to find money using SUKUK bond to pay the contractors so they can focus on those places, not just rehabilitating them, but actually reconstructing them so that when the rest of the road construction commences, they will just commence and compliment those ones, so that is what is being planned.\u201d\n\nOn the Ota- Idi-Iroko road, the governor said talks are ongoing to get Mike Adenuga to handle the reconstruction of the road subject to approval by the Federal Executive Council, as done by Dangote, who handled to the Ilaro-Papalanto road.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn the Ota-Idiroko road like the minister has shared with us, that road is not under contract, but graciously, we spoke to Otunba Mike Adenuga, in the partnership that this state has built with the likes of Dangote who also is using his tax credit to build the Interchange to Papalanto Road, this has never happened before this Government came on board. This people have been in Nigeria and they\u2019ve not partnered with the state or federal government before. We must be doing something right to make Dangote to decide to use his tax credit to construct two major roads. Papalanto is almost N70 billion and also the Epe-Ijebu-Ode road going through Odogbolu road, it is another road he has accepted to do\u201d.\n\nPrince Abiodun who described Ota as the industrial hub of the State, noted that there were lot of emotion concerning the deplorable condition of roads in the town, saying \u201cwith work about to commence on the roads, succour would soon come to the people before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cThere are other issues that have been in the social media and in the news in the last few weeks, particularly issues that deal with the state of Ota roads and the reason for that is very simple, Ota is the industrial hub of this country and enjoys a lot of overflow of traffic from Lagos. So, of course, there is a lot of emotions about the state of roads in Ota and like the Minister and I discussed, Ogun State has probably the largest federal roads in this state.\n\n\u201cNow, we spoke to Otunba Mike Adenuga and he graciously accepted that he was going to use his tax credit to fund the construction of the Ota-Idiroko road, but that has to go through a process, for him to fund the road.\n\n\u201cFederal government must accept his design, valuation and a lot of things have to go to the federal executive council.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier, the Minister for Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola said the Lagos-Ota Road, inherited from the previous administration, was first awarded in the Year 2000 with the contract sum of N6bn and now needed the sum of N56bn for its completion.\n\nHe said though work started and completed on the Lagos end of the road, the bridge head at Ota had been in deplorable condition for sometime now, pledging that FERMA has been saddle with the responsibility of fixing the fail portions of the road.\n\nOn the Ota- Idi-Iroko road, the Minister said measurements, designs and office work were going on just as the State government was committed to clearing the road for construction of gutters to commence.\n\nWhile sympathising with those who ply the road, Mr. Fashola said government needed the support of lawmakers in making funds available for infrastructural development in the country.",
          "summary": "Abiodun noted that the palliative work on the roads is to reduce the hardship being experienced by commuters.\nThe governor also said the failed portions, which would be reconstructed by the Federal Road Maintenance Agency (FERMA), would cost N13.4bn and would be part of the N56bn contract sum.\n\u201cIn the meantime, the Minister has graciously instructed that FERMA fixes those places and immediately begin to carry out palliative works on that road,\u201d he said.\nPapalanto is almost N70 billion and also the Epe-Ijebu-Ode road going through Odogbolu road, it is another road he has accepted to do\u201d.\nOn the Ota- Idi-Iroko road, the Minister said measurements, designs and office work were going on just as the State government was committed to clearing the road for construction of gutters to commence.",

          "title": "$34b untapped remittances: Experts seek BDC involvement",
          "text": "Following the stoppage, by Nigeria\u2019s apex bank, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), of foreign exchange sales to Bureaux De Change Operators (BDCs), economists and financial sector analysts have advised the apex bank to allow them receive diaspora remittances as is done in other economies of the world. The estimated annual remittance by Nigerians in diaspora is $34 billion and a large part of it never makes it into the country. Financial pundits have advised the CBN to institute framework that allows BDCs, which have automated their operations, to receive these funds into the economy to boost dollar reserves and save the naira.\n\nThere are many things working in favour of Nigeria that are hardly noticed. Top on the list is the $34 billion estimated annual remittance by Nigerians in diaspora that are barely touched because of non-existence channels to attract the funds into the economy.\n\nGlobally, Nigeria is one of the few countries that concisely attract funds from migrant workers. Others are Pakistan, Canada, USA, Australia, and Vietnam.\n\nNigeria is on the side of those that have many migrant workers in the rest of the world, and therefore earn foreign currencies they want to remit home.\n\nBut there is a huge problem that limits the funds from getting home.\n\nIn a media report, renowned economist and chief consultant at B. Adedipe Associates Limited, Dr. Biodun Adedipe, explained that if Nigeria is able to manage that remittance effectively, it will add 0.4 per cent to our GDP growth annually.\n\nHe disclosed that a lot of the dollar don\u2019t come into the FX market in Nigeria. The receiver gets the naira equivalent of the fund even when the funds never got to Nigeria, denying Nigeria the full benefit of diaspora remittances , despite the country being at the top in terms of benefitting from migrant workers.\n\n\u201cSo what then happens is that instead of bringing it into the FX market in Nigeria, they keep it outside. That also becomes a leg that supports speculations that we talked about earlier on. I believe that was part of the reason why the CBN introduced the $1 for N5 incentive. The idea now is to see if the country can harness the most of the remittances,\u201d Adedipe said.\n\n\u201cThat now is a policy I think we need to interrogate more. How can we make it more attractive for those foreign currencies generated by migrant Nigerian workers to be remitted home, and become a part of our national supply to our market here? That now is a space for the BDCs\u201d.\n\nAnalysts said that what is needed is implementation of laws that stipulated that oil companies and other multinational companies bring dollars into the economy instead of keeping them at Home countries.\n\nThis will ensure that what is kept outside the market would come into Nigeria to boost supply. CBN already has the tools, but they need to enforce it.\n\nABCON President, Alhaji (Dr) Aminu Gwadabe said globally, BDCs remain one of the channels through which the Diaspora remittance funds come into countries.\n\nHe said that the BDCs remain at the centre of economic development and have the capacity to attract needed capital for the development of the Nigerian economy and deepening of forex market.\n\nFindings have also shown that forex remittances from Nigerians in the Diaspora far exceeded the country\u2019s earnings from crude oil export last year. Since many transactions are unrecorded or take place through informal channels, the actual amount of remittance flows into the country is arguably higher. The estimation is that migrant remittances to Nigeria could grow to $25.5 billion, $29.8 billion and $34.8 billion in 2019, 2021 and 2023 respectively.\n\nGwadabe said Diaspora remittances remain cheap source of fund, because it is not to be paid back with interest but goes directly into the construction of houses, payment of school fees, medicals and a lot of things that are adding value to the weak economy.\n\nAgain, BDCs are supposed to buy from travelers coming into Nigeria, whether they are foreigners or they are Nigerians who did some things offshore, and were able to make some money, and brought back those foreign currencies.\n\nBDCs are also expected to operate two-way rate, then in response to what they have told you, you will now disclose whether you want to buy from them or sell to them. The operators are also expected to be in tune with market dynamics, be able to fix its own rate within the recommended commission rate in such a way that is competitive in that market.\n\nOther issues include customer service, relationship management and commission which must be within market range.\n\nImport pressure on forex\n\nBut because we were net importers, that brought pressure on the FX market. And like we have also argued overtime, the major worry for the CBN or anyone considering the management of the FX market is the premium.\n\nPremium is the difference between the official rates of the FX rate you get in other segments of the FX market. The other segments will mean, the parallel market, the BDCs, of course in those days we used to talk about export proceeds, and all manner of different arrangements.\n\nBut today, the idea simply is that any other market outside of CBN is an alternative. So what is the rate there? How is it as compared to the official rate? So, the difference between these rates is called premium.\n\nAdedipe said: \u201cAnytime that premium is greater than five per cent, it then becomes an incentive for round tripping. This means that the foreign currency becomes now attractive for those who want to speculate to go and buy, sell and then, they generate more Naira. So they can return to the official market and buy even more dollars, then go back and convert the dollar and get even more naira. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called round tripping. There is no currency anywhere in the world that can survive such an arrangement.\u201d\n\nMore forex supply not solution\n\nAdedipe also said that the question that needs to be answered is what drives the exchange value of the Naira. If you are able to answer that question, it will bring us to the understanding of what is happening today.\n\nBut ordinarily, in the interplay of demand and supply, what CBN has done is not to reduce the supply of FX to the market. What they have done is to shift the supply from one segment of the market to another, and even doubled the volume; which means, the response of rate is not to the supply coming to the market, which in fact has doubled.\n\nEqually, what could have been the concern is access. The CBN has also dealt with that by not only telling the participatory banks to have desks designated for forex, where members of the public in need of foreign currencies for defined purposes can have access to the foreign currencies required, which you can now also give to them either in cash, or as a credit into their domiciliary account, or into their dollar card.\n\nThis means the issue is not supply on one hand, and on the other hand also, access is not the problem. It means the real issue is that the speculators knew that this position of the CBN is not something sustainable, which means that it\u2019s not institutionalised.\n\nThis means therefore that if another Governor comes into office, after the expiration of Emefiele\u2019s term, there is a likelihood that he or she may go back to the old way of doing things. So we have to come back to look at those factors that cause exchange rates to move. There are about 12 of them in economics.\n\n\u201cOne of them is the interplay between demand and supply, which as of today does not support what we see happening in that market. That is the depreciation of the Naira in the market as we see now is not supported by the interplay between demand and supply.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is why I say, ultimately, the only reason we can admit this is speculation, which is based on the fact that, oh, CBN will not be able to sustain this? So, the question now will be, why can\u2019t they sustain it? If we look at our external reserves, there are two ways to interpret that in this connection\u201d.\n\nDiaspora Remittances and BDCs\n\nThe BDCs have for years supported Nigeria\u2019s growth agenda and CBN\u2019s commitment to exchange rate stability. To continue to play these roles creditably, the BDC industry needs improved access to forex.\n\nThe ABCON believes the success of BDCs goes beyond favourable rates but access to multiple streams of forex earnings to deepen the market, keep the naira stable and boost BDCs operations.\n\nMaking BDCs one of the channels through which over $34 billion annual Diaspora remittances enter the economy will give depth to forex market and boost BDCs operations.\n\nDiaspora remittances to Nigeria, now at $23 billion annually remain a reliable source of forex to the domestic economy and that is why over 5,500 CBN -Licenced BDCs should come to mind.\n\nConcerned with the stagnant state of the nation\u2019s economy marred with inconsistent forex earnings through oil export, the ABCON agreed with Adedipe for BDCs to be one of the channels for receiving Diaspora remittances into the economy.\n\nGwadabe explained that Diaspora remittances represent household income from foreign economies arising mainly from the temporary or permanent movement of people to those economies. The remittances cash and non-cash items that flow through formal channels such as electronic wire, or through informal channels, such as money or goods carried across borders adding that Nigeria can cover a large part of capital flow gaps through remittances from its citizens in diaspora using the BDCs.\n\n\u201cNigerian BDCs operators have also identified with the immense opportunities presented by Diaspora remittances and want to play greater role in attracting more foreign capital into the economy. Reason being that remittances are known to help poorer recipients meet basic needs, fund cash and non-cash investments, finance education, foster new businesses, service debt and essentially, drive economic growth,\u201d Gwadabe said.\n\nConnecting BDCs\u2019 to Remittance Business\n\nFinancial pundits have continued to give reasons why BDCs should be brought into the Diaspora remittance business. For instance, financial institutions\u2019 long procedures, complicated forms, and history of poor service quality means BDCs are needed to deepen the market. The BDCs segment of the market operates in a simple manner while remaining closer to the people needing the remittance funds.\n\n\u201cBDCs buy foreign currency from remittance recipients and sell it to Nigerians who want to travel abroad. The reason for establishing these institutions in 1989 was to broaden the forex market and improve accessibility to hard currency. The CBN supervises and issues operational guidelines for BDCs. In March 2006, Nigeria had 293 licensed BDCs which have risen to over 5,500 operators today. This development means that BDCs are willing and ready to do the remittance business,\u201d Gwadabe said.\n\nFor him, remittances are on track to become the largest source of external financing in developing countries and Nigeria cannot be left behind.",

          "text": "President of Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote is in talks with some of the world\u2019s biggest oil traders to help finance his mega refinery project in Lekki, Lagos, Reuters has reported quoting close sources to the project.\n\nThe 650,000 barrel-per-day refinery, once complete, will be the continent\u2019s largest plant and redraw major trade flows of crude and fuel in the Atlantic basin.\n\nThe refinery has been delayed by several years and the cost has ballooned to $19 billion from Dangote\u2019s earlier estimates of $12-14 billion.\n\nConstruction was also delayed due to COVID-19 outbreaks among workers at the site and delays getting materials, two sources with knowledge of the project said.\n\nMany industry sources do not expect any products before the second half of next year.\n\nHit by economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and soaring construction costs, Dangote needs a cash injection.\n\nNigeria\u2019s state oil firm NNPC has agreed to buy a 20% stake in the refinery for about $2.8 billion but Dangote is looking for outside cash.\n\nNNPC\u2019s head Mele Kyari said a process was on-going to raise $1 billion with Afreximbank to fund part of its stake purchase.\n\nThe billionaire has held talks as recently as a month ago with executives from the world\u2019s top two oil traders \u2013 Trafigura and Vitol.\n\nTrafigura and Vitol declined to comment. A spokesperson for the Dangote Group did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nTwo sources with direct knowledge said the option of raising another $500 million from a trade house or consortium was being actively explored.\n\nThe details of a potential loan from a trading firm have not been finalised but the trader could receive a long-term contract to supply crude and receive cargoes of refined products as repayment.\n\nSwiss traders like Vitol along with Nigerian firms, have cashed-in for years in gasoline-short Nigeria by supplying mega tenders and being part of lucrative crude-for-fuel swap deals for over a decade.\n\nGetting a hold of Dangote\u2019s fuel will give the trader a stranglehold on a key set of new oil flows. Nigeria\u2019s new oil bill, approved last month after nearly 20 years of political wrangling, has added fuel-import licence requirements that experts fear will give Dangote an effective monopoly.\n\nUnder the new laws, the regulator will prioritize local refiners for import licences and volumes would be based on production capacity or market share.\n\nWhile Nigeria will remain open in theory to international trading houses, a partnership with Dangote would be the only way to guarantee a foothold in Africa\u2019s biggest economy\n\nDespite being Africa\u2019s biggest oil producer and exporter, Nigeria depends almost entirely on fuel imports after allowing its significant refining capacity, 445,000 barrels-per-day, to become dilapidated over several decades.\n\nMany past and current Nigerian officials, including President Muhammadu Buhari, have announced plans to refurbish them but political will has been lacking.\n\nThe Natural Resources Governance Institute, a non-profit policy think tank, has previously pointed to the moribund refineries as a key focus of oil corruption and waste in the country.",

Gen Ibrahim Attahiru.\n\nThe investigator also provided a list of 27 preliminary findings and eight safety suggestions that should be implemented right once.\n\nThe NAF Beechcraft 350 plane crashed near the Kaduna International Airport, killing everyone on board, according to NEWS DIRECT.\n\nNormally, the AIB only investigates civil aviation accidents and incidents in Nigeria, not military accidents and incidents, however the NAF had tasked the AIB with leading the investigation into the disaster.\n\nAccording to a joint statement signed on Wednesday by NAF spokesman Edward Gabkwet and his AIB counterpart Tunji Oketunbi, AIB presented its findings to the Nigerian Air Force after more than three months.\n\nThe statement was titled, \u2018Accident Investigation Bureau Submits Interim Report On Aircraft Accident Involving Nigerian Air Force King Air-350 Aircraft To The Chief Of Air Staff\u2019.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cFollowing the unfortunate incident involving a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) King Air -350 aircraft at the vicinity of Kaduna Civil Airport on 31 May 2021, the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao directed that a joint investigative body consisting of experienced NAF safety officers and the Accident Investigative Bureau (AIB) be constituted to investigate the circumstances surrounding the air crash.\n\nOlateru (right) hands over the interim report to Amao (left)\n\n\u201cAfter about three months of painstaking joint investigation, the Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer of AIB, Engr Akin Olateru FNSE, today 15 September 2021 submitted an interim report on the sad incident to the Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Amao, at his office at NAF Headquarters, Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe submitted report is organized into three sections namely; the information obtained in the course of the investigation; analysis of data collected in view of the Board\u2019s Terms of Reference; and the conclusion, which covers the initial findings and immediate recommendations.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that at this interim stage, a total of 27 initial findings and 8 immediate safety recommendations were made for the convening authority as well as other aviation-related agencies for immediate implementation. It is expected that the final report will contain the flight data recorder readout, the reviewed operator\u2019s and service provider\u2019s standard operating procedures as well as other detailed analyses.\n\n\u201cWhile receiving the report, the CAS reiterated the main essence of activating the \u2018joint investigative\u2019 clause contained in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed between the NAF and the AIB on 1 July, 2020. According to him, the successful collaboration is a clear indication of the potency of collaboration in aircraft accident investigation, which must be encouraged.\n\n\u201cAir Marshal Amao also noted that such collaborative efforts make accident investigations more transparent and open while also stating that the outcome of the investigation is not necessarily aimed at punitive measures but essentially at generally improving safety in the aviation industry.\n\n\u201cOn his part, the Chief Executive Officer of AIB, Engr Akin Olateru stated that the joint investigation with the NAF was its first direct involvement in military air crash investigation in Nigeria and second investigation outside its mandate having also assisted Sao Tome and Principe in the past. He also stated that copies of the report, with the endorsement of the CAS, will also be submitted to the Hon. Minister of Aviation and Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) to ensure that the recommendations addressed to aviation agencies are implemented.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner also stated that although the accident involved a military aircraft and crew, it happened at a civil airport adding that the involvement of AIB in the investigation by the Nigerian Air Force would help in closing the gaps on the civil aviation side.\u201d",

It was, however shocking, to see \u2018Yoruba Nation\u2019 advocates yesterday unequivocally throw their lot in with Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\n\u201cIPOB is a designated terrorist organisation. It has now publicly revealed a 50,000 strong paramilitary organisation. It regularly murders security services and innocent civilians, with a significant uptick of violent attacks this year. And it is currently attempting to hold Nigerian states hostage with orders to stay at home under threat of terror.\n\n\u201cWithout doubt, Nigerians and the entire world will judge Yoruba Nation by the company it keeps. No one can take seriously this organisation if it continues its IPOB association. When their allies systematically trample human rights, it raises sober questions about their claims to uphold the values of the UN.\n\n\u201cThe cooperation is a worrying development, once parsed with Yoruba Nation\u2019s increasingly violent rallies in Nigeria. Actions and associations speak louder than words. Yoruba Nation\u2019s talk of human rights promotion must therefore be ignored.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the Nigerian government will continue its work at the UN- to fight against corruption and illicit financial flows, and international cooperation. If we want to see stolen funds returned to their rightful home in Nigeria, the government must continue to campaign for and coordinate global action on asset recovery.\n\n\u201cThe government will remain the leading regional actor in the fight against global terror \u2013 particularly against threats emanating from the Sahel. Through the Nigerian Technical Aid Corps programme, the country also shares technical expertise with countries from the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific. At the same time, the administration is implementing a programme of environmental sustainability to combat developments which destroys Nigerian communities in vulnerable regions.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly through the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development can we secure a prosperous future for Nigeria. As the largest country in Africa, the government takes seriously its leadership role and will continue to strive for continental unity, cooperation, and shared prosperity.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur expectation is therefore for the media to work with the government to focus attention on the core issues the President, the leader of the country has on his programme.\u201d",
          "summary": "The Nigerian government has reacted to the ongoing demonstration at the United Nations headquarters in New York, United States of America, by a coalition of separatist organizations.\nIt was, however shocking, to see \u2018Yoruba Nation\u2019 advocates yesterday unequivocally throw their lot in with Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\u201cWithout doubt, Nigerians and the entire world will judge Yoruba Nation by the company it keeps.\n\u201cThe cooperation is a worrying development, once parsed with Yoruba Nation\u2019s increasingly violent rallies in Nigeria.\nYoruba Nation\u2019s talk of human rights promotion must therefore be ignored.",

That\u2019s exactly what they did.\n\n\u201cIntroducing LG GX Gallery series OLED TV, available in 65- and 77-inch screen sizes, LG\u2019s GX Gallery series TVs deliver everything that was cutting-edge about the wallpaper TV without the need for a separate soundbar to house all the electronics.\n\n\u201cThe company\u2019s success in creating a product that fuses together form and function so seamlessly has earned recognition from the world\u2019s most prestigious design award programs, its 65-inch GX Gallery series OLED TV winning the Best of the Best title at the Red Dot Design Award and top honors at the iF Design Award 2020.\n\n\u201cThis advanced TV\u2019s perfectly executed minimalist aesthetic and integrated bracket that allows for flush-to-the-wall mounting are the outcome of LG\u2019s peerless gallery design. A triumph of human-centered industrial design, the GX Gallery lineup would not look out of place in an art gallery exhibit, displayed as a series of understated, ultra-modern sculptures.\n\n\u201d It is this refined, artistic quality that the TVs bring to consumers\u2019 homes and what enables them to complement and augment practically any existing d\u00e9cor.\n\n\u201cAt the core of the gallery design is the creation of a complete TV that can fit harmoniously within a given space \u2013 a concept LG\u2019s designers refer to as \u201cadding spatial value.\u201d\n\nThe team behind the GX Gallery stayed true to its original vision throughout the entire development process, working closely with LG engineers to deliver a new kind of TV. The results speak for themselves: an advanced OLED TV with a thickness of less than 20 millimeters and a built-in, ultra-slim bracket that hugs the wall and is completely hidden from view\n\nThe gallery design would not have been possible without OLED, a technology which LG\u2019s expertise remains unmatched.\n\nOLED\u2019s inherent thinness enabled the designers to pursue the unique and elegant slender form factor they envisioned and see it become a reality.\n\nLG\u2019s OLED technology is also what enables the TVs to provide such unforgettable viewing experiences, with phenomenal color expression, infinite contrast and a wide viewing angle.\n\n\u201cCreating a sense of harmony wherever they\u2019re installed, LG\u2019s GX Gallery series TVs are designed to effortlessly fit in with modern consumers\u2019 lifestyles, providing more possibilities to curate their living spaces and more room to enjoy life.\n\nFeatured in the OLED Gallery Series is the \u03b1 (Alpha) 9 Gen 3 AI Processor.

Therefore, Commanders at all levels must provide quality and good leadership while imbibing the core values of the Nigerian Army\n\n\u201cCommanders must also ensure that they remain selfless, build and earn the respect and confidence of their subordinates in order to lead effectively.

It is also the task of Commanders to take care of the resources and logistics put at their disposal for the conduct of operations towards achieving results. Laissez faire attitudes on the part of commanders would not be tolerated. Like I have always said, failure is failure irrespective of the circumstances. To that end, I have directed the appropriate departments to come up with modalities for the evaluation of the performance of commanders in the course of their command.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, commanders must continue to cooperate and work in synergy with our sister Services, other security agencies and stakeholders while developing novel processes, strategies, and tactics to overwhelm the enemy using both kinetic and non-kinetic approaches. Commanders must be proactive in the conduct of their operations. You must take the fight into the identified and known enclaves of terrorists and criminals to neutralize them\u201d.\n\nAppealing to Nigerians for support, Gen Yahaya assured that in days ahead, there shall be more visible signs of improved security across the country, adding that the military will speak to the terrorists, bandits, kidnappers and other perpetrators of violence in the language they understand.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI however, seek the understanding and support of all Nigerians to enable us serve the nation as expected.

I would like to seize this opportunity to advise those fueling the crises being witnessed across the country to desist from their unpatriotic acts as we remain committed to ensure peace returns to every part of the country in no distant time.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Army, within the ambit of rule of law, will talk to the terrorists, bandits, kidnappers and other perpetrators of violence in the language they understand while ensuring that all peace-loving citizens of this country would go about their legitimate businesses and live their lives without fear or intimidation\u201d.",

The NAF last conducted a mission into Yobe State (Not Yunusari LGA) on 5 September 2021 and it was an armed recce. No bomb or missile was even expended\u201d.\n\nHowever, an international news outlet, BBC Hausa Service reported that dozens of civilians were allegedly killed in the early hours of Wednesday, September 15, 2021, after a military fighter jet mistakenly bombed a village named Buhari in Yobe State.\n\nWhile quoting an eye witness, BBC, reported thus: \u201cthree fighter jets went around the area before one of the pilots dropped the bomb on the civilian population. He added that 5 of his relatives died in the incident. Recall that a similar event happened in 2017 when the Nigerian Air Force mistakenly bombed an Internal Displaced Persons\u2019 camp in Rann, Borno State\u201d.\n\nAccording to another online report that quoted Bulama Bukarti, a popular journalist, who said: \u201cBBC Hausa reports that many civilians were killed & others injured earlier today when a jet believed to be NAF\u2019s bombed Buhari village, Yunusari LGA, Yobe State. A witness who lost five relatives said \u201cthree jets went around, then one of them started firing in the center of the village.\n\n\u201cThis area is in the northern part of Yobe, close to BH/ISWAP\u2019s area of operation, so it is possible that the jets were on anti-BH operation. Villagers say they are unsure if the jets belong to Nigeria or Niger, but it\u2019s unlikely to be Niger\u2019s given it\u2019s within Nigeria\u2019s territory.\u201d",

          "text": "Both North Korea and South Korea test fired ballistic missiles on Wednesday, the latest volley in an arms race that has seen both countries develop increasingly sophisticated weapons while efforts to get talks going on defusing tension prove fruitless.\n\nSouth Korea tested a submarine-launched ballistic missile(SLBM), becoming the first country without nuclear weapons to develop such a system.\n\nSouth Korea President Moon was attending that test firing when word came of the North Korean launches, its first ballistic missile tests since March.\n\nNorth Korea fired a pair of ballistic missiles that landed in the sea off its east coast, according to officials in South Korea and Japan, just days after it tested a cruise missile that is believed to have nuclear capabilities.\n\nNorth Korea has been steadily developing its weapons systems amid a standoff over talks aimed at dismantling its nuclear and ballistic missile arsenals in return for U.S. sanctions relief.\n\nThe negotiations, initiated between former U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in 2018, have stalled since 2019.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea fired two unidentified ballistic missiles from its central inland region toward the east coast, and intelligence authorities of South Korea and the United States are conducting detailed analysis for further information,\u201d South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a statement.\n\nThe missiles were fired just after 12:30 p.m. (0330 GMT), flying 800 km (497 miles) to a maximum altitude of 60 km (37 miles), the JCS reported.\n\nThe U.S. military\u2019s Indo-Pacific Command said North Korea\u2019s missile launches did not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel, territory, or allies, but highlight the destabilising impact of its illicit weapons programme.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga called the missile launch \u201coutrageous\u201d and strongly condemned it as a threat to peace and security in the region.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a daily briefing that China hoped \u201crelevant parties\u201d would \u201cexercise restraint\u201d.\n\n\u2018THE STRONGEST KOREA\u2019\n\nSouth Korea has been splurging on a range of new military systems, including ballistic missiles, submarines, and its first aircraft carrier. It has a stated policy of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.\n\nThe arms race has accelerated under Moon for a number of reasons, including his push for more foreign policy autonomy, wariness of relying on the United States after Trump\u2019s presidency and military developments in both North Korea and China, said Ramon Pacheco Pardo, a Korea expert at King\u2019s College London.\n\n\u201cSouth Korea would face many political and legal obstacles to develop nuclear weapons, both internal and external,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it will develop all other capabilities to deter North Korea and show who the strongest Korea is.\u201d\n\nOfficials at the SLBM test announced the development of several other advanced missiles including a supersonic cruise missile and a ballistic missile with a larger warhead.\n\nMoon cited the nuclear-armed North\u2019s \u201casymmetric capabilities\u201d as a reason for South Korea to develop better missiles.\n\n\u201cEnhancing our missile capability is exactly what\u2019s needed as deterrence against North Korea\u2019s provocation,\u201d he said, while stressing that the SLBM test had been planned and was not in response to the North\u2019s launches.\n\nUnlike the South, North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile systems have been banned by U.N. Security Council resolutions.\n\nIn November 2017, North Korea tested an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the entire United States and declared it had become a nuclear power. It has since focused mainly on testing shorter-range missile and rockets.\n\nNorth Korea this year declared it was seeking to miniaturise nuclear warheads, which could potentially be fitted to tactical missiles.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea continues to prioritise military modernisation,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, international studies professor at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.\n\n\u2018GREAT SIGNIFICANCE\u2019\n\nThe latest launch came as foreign ministers of South Korea and China held talks in Seoul amid concern over North Korea\u2019s tests and the stalled denuclearisation negotiations. read more\n\nNorth Korea said it successfully tested a new long-range cruise missile last weekend, calling it \u201ca strategic weapon of great significance\u201d. Analysts say that weapon could be its first cruise missile with a nuclear capability.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, when asked about the cruise missile tests, said all parties should work to promote peace and stability on the Korean peninsula.\n\n\u201cNot only North Korea but other countries are carrying out military activity,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cAll of us should make efforts in a way that helps resume dialogue.\u201d\n\nIn a meeting with Wang on Wednesday, Moon asked for China\u2019s support to restart dialogue, saying North Korea had not been responding to South Korean and U.S. offers for talks or engagement such as humanitarian aid, Moon\u2019s spokesperson said.\n\nThe nuclear envoys of South Korea, Japan, and the United States were meeting in Tokyo this week as well.\n\nU.S. envoy Sung Kim said on Tuesday the United States has no hostile intent towards North Korea and hoped it would respond positively to calls for talks.\n\nThe United States wants North Korea to give up its nuclear and missile programmes in exchange for sanctions relief. North Korea has refused.\n\nReuters",

          "text": "China\u2019s ambassador to the United Kingdom has been banned from the British parliament because Beijing imposed sanctions on legislators after they spoke out against alleged human rights abuses directed at the minority Uighurs in the far western region of Xinjiang.\n\nLindsay Hoyle, the speaker of the House of Commons, and John McFall, the speaker of the House of Lords, said it would not be \u201cappropriate\u201d for Zheng Zeguang to speak at an event in parliament while members were subject to Chinese sanctions. The ban was put in place on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI regularly hold meetings with ambassadors from across the world to establish enduring ties between countries and parliamentarians,\u201d Hoyle said.\n\n\u201cBut I do not feel it\u2019s appropriate for the ambassador for China to meet on the Commons estate and in our place of work when his country has imposed sanctions against some of our members.\u201d\n\nThe ban, described by the London-based Times newspaper as an \u201cunprecedented intervention\u201d, prompted a furious response from China.\n\n\u201cThe despicable and cowardly action of certain individuals of the UK Parliament to obstruct normal exchanges and cooperation between China and the UK for personal political gains is against the wishes and harmful to the interests of the peoples of both countries,\u201d a statement from the embassy said.\n\nChina imposed sanctions on nine British politicians, lawyers and an academic in March for spreading what it said were \u201clies and disinformation\u201d over the treatment of the mostly Muslim Uighurs.\n\nZheng Zeguang was China\u2019Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and was appointed as ambassador to the UK earlier this year [File: Jason Lee/Reuters]\n\nChina imposed the sanctions after Britain, the United States, European Union and Canada took \u201ccoordinated action\u201d against Chinese officials accused of engineering the crackdown on the Uighurs. The British parliamentarians who were singled out by China took the lead in a campaign to limit British investment in China by tabling a \u201cGenocide Amendment\u201d to trade legislation that was under consideration.\n\nAmong those sanctioned were former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith, Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of parliament\u2019s Foreign Affairs Committee, and Helena Kennedy, a human rights lawyer who sits in the upper house.\n\nZheng had been due to address the All-Party Parliamentary China Group, which is made up of members from both houses of parliament, on Wednesday. The group is seen as being more sympathetic to Beijing.\n\nThe sanctioned members had written to the speakers raising their concerns about the event.\n\n\u201cThis meeting should never have been proposed in the first place: the mother of parliaments that protects free speech and the liberties of free peoples,\u201d Smith wrote on Twitter as he thanked the speakers for their \u201cswift action\u201d.\n\nHoyle said the ambassador would be banned while the sanctions remained in place. The Times said it was the first time an ambassador had been barred from parliament.\n\nTim Loughton, a politician with the ruling Conservative party, also who was also subjected to the sanctions, welcomed the decision.\n\nHe said China could not think \u201cthey can shut down free speech by parliamentarians in a democracy\u201d.\n\nIn its statement, the Chinese embassy said the sanctions were \u201cbeyond reproach\u201d and \u201cjustified responses\u201d to the British action against Xinjiang-linked officials.\n\nLondon and Beijing have been trading angry words over a range of issues, including events in Hong Kong and China\u2019s trade policy.\n\nActivists and United Nations experts say at least one million Muslims have been detained in camps in Xinjiang.\n\nChina has denied accusations of abuse and says the camps are vocational skills training centres and necessary to fight extremism.",
          "summary": "China\u2019s ambassador to the United Kingdom has been banned from the British parliament because Beijing imposed sanctions on legislators after they spoke out against alleged human rights abuses directed at the minority Uighurs in the far western region of Xinjiang.\nChina imposed sanctions on nine British politicians, lawyers and an academic in March for spreading what it said were \u201clies and disinformation\u201d over the treatment of the mostly Muslim Uighurs.\nHoyle said the ambassador would be banned while the sanctions remained in place.\nThe Times said it was the first time an ambassador had been barred from parliament.\nTim Loughton, a politician with the ruling Conservative party, also who was also subjected to the sanctions, welcomed the decision.",

          "text": "Haiti\u2019s political crisis has worsened after Prime Minister Ariel Henry on Tuesday sacked the chief public prosecutor who had accused him of links to the assassination of President Jovenel Moise on July 7.\n\nHenry\u2019s decision to fire prosecutor Bed-Ford Claude has exposed the infighting at the highest levels of what is left of Haiti\u2019s government, more than two months after Moise was shot dead by assassins who stormed his private residence in the hills above Port-au-Prince.\n\nClaude was sacked hours after he asked the judge investigating Moise\u2019s murder to charge the prime minister with involvement in the case.\n\n\u201cI have the pleasure of informing you that it was decided to terminate your post,\u201d Henry told Claude in a publicly distributed letter.\n\nHenry, a political moderate and neurosurgeon whom Moise named prime minister just days before his death in an attempt to reduce political tensions, has pledged to improve the country\u2019s dire security situation and to organise long-delayed elections. He was formally appointed to the rule days after Moise\u2019s assassination.\n\nClaude said last week that phone records showed Henry had twice communicated with a man believed to be the mastermind behind Moise\u2019s killing on the night of the crime.\n\nThat suspect, a former justice ministry official whom Henry has publicly defended, is now on the run.\n\nHenry dismissed the prosecutor\u2019s request to discuss the matter as politicking and did not respond to the allegations.\n\nThat prompted Claude to write on Tuesday to the judge overseeing the investigation into Moise\u2019s murder and ask him to charge Henry as a suspect.\n\nHe also wrote to immigration telling them not to let Henry leave the country \u201cdue to serious presumption relative to the assassination of the president\u201d.\n\nLater on Tuesday, a letter from Henry to Claude dated September 13 emerged in which he said he was firing the prosecutor for a \u201cgrave administrative error\u201d, without going into detail. In a separate letter dated September 14, he named Frantz Louis Juste to the post.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the order is valid as Haiti\u2019s 1987 constitution mandates that the prosecutor can only be appointed or fired by the president, a position that remains vacant.\n\nSome legal experts expressed alarm at Claude\u2019s requests for Henry to be questioned and charged, seeing the prosecutor\u2019s move as an impediment to the independence of the judiciary.\n\nSome in government circles had also called in recent days for the prime minister to resign over the allegations.\n\n\u201cThese are grotesque and political acts,\u201d Samuel Madistin, a lawyer for a human rights organisation, told the AFP news agency.\n\nDecades of political instability, as well as natural catastrophes, have plagued Haiti\u2019s development. Its aid-dependent economy is the poorest in the Americas, more than a third of Haitians face acute food insecurity, and gangs have turned swathes of the capital into no-go areas.\n\nSo far, 44 people \u2013 including 18 Colombians and two Americans of Haitian descent \u2013 have been arrested in connection with the inquiry into the assassination. None of the president\u2019s security guards was injured in the attack.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extremely convoluted state of affairs,\u201d Michael Diebert, a journalist and author who has covered Haiti for more than 20 years, told Al Jazeera. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of doubt among people in Haiti about whether this investigation will be allowed to run its course. Most of the people who have been arrested so far, I don\u2019t think anyone seriously thinks they were the money men or the real intellectual authors of this crime.\u201d\n\nSome 44 people have been picked up in connection with the assassination of President Jovenel Moise, who was shot dead in his home on July 7 [File: Estailove St-Val/Reuters]\n\nHenry on Saturday criticised the earlier request for him to be questioned, saying: \u201cThese diversionary tactics, designed to create confusion and prevent justice from calmly running its course, will not stand.\n\n\u201cThose who are truly guilty, the masterminds of the odious assassination of President Jovenel Moise and those who ordered it, will be found, brought to justice and punished for their actions.\u201d\n\nOn the same day, the prime minister announced that Haiti\u2019s main political forces had reached an agreement to establish a transitional government until the holding of presidential elections and a referendum on whether to adopt a new constitution next year.\n\nThe agreement establishes a Council of Ministers under Henry\u2019s leadership.",
