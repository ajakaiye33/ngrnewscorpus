          "title": "SAN, others berate Buhari regime for attack on Sowore",
          "text": "Human rights activist and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, on Monday said the regime of the President, Major General Mohammadu Buhari (retd.), should be held responsible for the attack on a human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, who only sought to exercise his fundamental human rights.\n\nAdegboruwa, who was reacting to reports that Sowore was injured by a police officer during a protest at the Unity Fountain, Abuja, said the publisher of SaharaReporters had been \u201cthe target of criminal prosecution on account of his non-violent campaign for good governance and accountability.\n\nSowore was injured by a tear gas canister fired by a police operative in Abuja.\n\nThe politician was preparing to hold a rally with some associates when the incident happened at the Unity Fountain in Abuja on Monday.\n\nFootage of the incident showed Sowore falling on the ground after the canister hit him.\n\nBut the FCT Police Command in a statement by the command spokesperson, Mariam Yusuf, denied that Sowore was shot, saying there was no record of the incident.\n\nShe said, \u201cContrary to the speculation, police operatives professionally restored calm at the Unity Fountain following attempts by a group of protesters to incite public disturbance.\u201d\n\nBut Adegboruwa in a statement titled, \u2018Nothing must happen to Sowore,\u2019said, \u201cI urge all Nigerians and indeed the international community to hold the government of President Muhammadu Buhari responsible for anything that befalls Mr Sowore on account of the lawful exercise of his fundamental rights.\n\n\u201cThe Unity Fountain is a public place, where other citizens have held protests in support of the Buhari administration in recent past, without let or hindrance and even with police escorts.\n\n\u201cIn the period when President Muhammadu Buhari was leading the opposition politicians, he led several protests across the country, without anyone shooting at him or other protesters.\u201d\n\nAdegboruwa also asked the government to leave Sowore alone and called on protesters to remain peaceful and uphold the tenets of the law.\n\nAnother legal practitioner, Pelumi Olajengbesi, also condemned the attack on Sowore.\n\nOlajengbesi also made his position known in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt is however saddening and indeed condemnable that such a constitutionally guaranteed movement has been greeted with a violent and brutal response by the government who, acting through its police officers, opened fire on unarmed, peaceful protesters leading to several serious injuries on citizens, including a fatal wound on the person of Omoyele Sowore,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added, \u201cWithout mincing words, I want to reiterate that the Buhari-led administration will be held responsible and dragged before the international community should anything happen to Sowore and indeed all participants in today\u2019s peaceful protest at the Unity Fountain, Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government must do better and be more mindful of its troubling antecedents as hard of hearing and failing to distil historical hindsight from the experiences of the past.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "RESIDENTS of Enugu State on Monday complied with the sit-at-home order declared by all the pro-Biafra groups, including the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, in memorial of those who died during the civil war and pro-Biafra agitators who were killed by Nigerian security agencies.\n\nBut in places like Emene and Eke-Obinagu, soldiers deployed to ensure that there was no chaos and breakdown of law and order were reported to have attacked residents.\n\nAccording to sources, the soldiers, who were patrolling Airport, Orie-Emene and Eke-Obinagu road arrived on Owa Street and began to chase residents gathered in their compound and discussing about the sit-at-home.\n\nOne of the sources said, \u201cThe soldiers came here with about five patrol vans. Some of them started pointing guns at people and the people started running inside their compounds. Immediately, they all jumped down and started pursuing them.\u201d\n\nSchools, shops, banks close down in Asaba\n\nMeanwhile, business activities in Asaba metropolis were totally paralysed as schools, shops and business centres were shut down.\n\nAt the Okwe, Akwaebulu, Bonsac areas of Asaba, and Okpanam, public and private schools were shut down while shops at the Timbers Market, Ezeneyi, were also closed as result of sit-at-home order.\n\nTotal compliance in Ebonyi\n\nAlso, in Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State capital, streets, shops, schools, markets, banks, hospitals and even some police facilities were deserted on Monday morning as residents obeyed the sit-at-home order issued by the proscribed IPOB.\n\nThe PUNCH went round the capital city to monitor the exercise and observed that all major roads were deserted and had no sign of both human and economic lives in them.\n\nThe total compliance to this year\u2019s sit-at-home order by Ebonyi people was a sharp departure from what obtained in previous editions, which hitherto recorded partial compliance in the city.\n\nThe PUNCH reports that schools, four days ago, sent notices to parents that they would not open.\n\nOne of such notices sighted by one of our correspondents urged parents to stay safe at home with their wards.\n\nPeople were seen in the Ebonyi State capital relaxing on tarred roads because there was no vehicular movement.\n\nAgain, gunmen burn Imo police station\n\nBut gunmen have again burnt the Amandugba Divisional Police Headquarters in the Isu Local Government Area of Imo State.\n\nMonday\u2019s attack on police station increased the number of divisional police headquarters razed in the state to four in less than one week in the state.\n\nIt was gathered that on arrival, the attackers threw inflammable substances at the police facility and it ignited fire.\n\nThe PUNCH observed a video footage where the police station was up in flames.\n\nThe burning of the police facility was the only violent development in the state on Monday.\n\nWhen contacted, the police spokesperson in the state, Bala Elkana, said that the attackers were repelled and the inferno immediately put out.\n\nNo ESN seen anywhere in Anambra\n\nHowever, there was pin-drop silence in major cities in Anambra State in the early hours of Monday following the sit-at-home protest ordered by IPOB.\n\nCommercial activities in major cities of Awka, Ekwulobia, Nnewi, Onitsha, Ihiala were at a halt as shops, markets, banks, schools were closed.\n\nIn some streets monitored in Awka, the state capital, no single person was sighted on the road as of 11am.\n\nContrary to claims by the leader of IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, that men of the security arm of the group, Eastern Security Network, would be deployed on the streets to enforce the sit-at-home order, nothing of such was notice anywhere in the state.\n\nA member of IPOB, who spoke with one of our correspondents on the telephone, described the protest as a huge success.\n\nHe said, \u201cOnly goats and dogs and other animals disobeyed the order as you could spot only them moving in some streets in the state. No single human being was seen on any street from 6am to about 12 noon.\u201d\n\nBanks, schools, markets shut as Imo residents stay indoors\n\nIn Imo State, schools, banks, markets and other business enterprises failed to open on Monday.\n\nThe development was in a total compliance to the sit-at-home order declared by the IPOB.\n\nOur correspondent observed that no single vehicle was sighted on the ever busy Douglas, Wetheral, Bank, Tetlow, Ikenegbu, Okigwe, Egbu, Orlu and Government House roads.\n\nAbia obeys sit-at-home order\n\nThe situation was similar in Abia State as the people obeyed the sit-at-home order by the leader of the IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, in remembrance of soldiers who fought from the Biafran side during the civil war.\n\nIn Umuahia, the state capital, all the major roads and streets were deserted for the first time to observe the day.\n\nLike in other states, banks, schools, shop owners and other cooperate service providers in Umuahia also shut down their business.\n\nCop, four others killed in Ebonyi\n\nA policeman attached to the Ebonyi State Police Command and four Biafra agitators were reportedly killed on Monday while the sit-at-home order was being observed.\n\nAccording to an eyewitness, suspected IPOB members had blocked the Nnodo axis of the Ebonyi Local Government Area of the state, seizing and burning vehicles and tricycles of violators of the order in the area.\n\nAccording to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, some people who defied the directive in the early hours of Monday went home with injuries and destruction of their belongings.\n\n\u201cSo, it was like the police were mobilised to the area and there was a serious gun duel between the police and the agitators within Ebebe Junction, a suburb of Abakaliki, which claimed five lives,\u201d the source added.\n\nAlso, a source at the Alex Ekwueme Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, said about five corpses were brought into the morgue by the police.\n\nWhen contacted, the Commissioner of Police in the state, Aliyu Garba, confirmed that some suspected agitators were arrested.\n\nIPOB lauds govs, sit-at-home order recorded 100% compliance\n\nSpeaking on the order, IPOB lauded the South-East governors, Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, and different tribes that fell within Biafra for ensuring that the 2021 edition of Biafra Day was successful.\n\nThis was as the secessionist group observed that this year\u2019s Biafra Day recorded 100% compliance across Biafra land.\n\nAccording to the group, the huge success recorded further demonstrated that with unity, \u201cwe can actualise Biafra sooner than expected\u201d.\n\nThe group stated this in a statement signed by its Director of Media and Publicity, Emma Powerful, a copy of which was made available to The PUNCH on Monday.\n\nThe statement partly read, \u201cWe, therefore, wish to warmly commend Biafrans, South-East Governors, Gov. Ifeanyi Okowa, friends and lovers of Biafra freedom who made the exercise a huge success.\u201d\n\nFour policemen feared killed in Enugu\n\nMeanwhile, four policemen have been reportedly killed in various parts of Enugu metropolis.\n\nSources told one of our correspondents that one policeman was killed in Uwani in Enugu South, two at Mgbeme area of Coal Camp and another one killed along Okpara Avenue opposite Central Bank of Nigeria, all in Enugu North.\n\nOne of the sources said, \u201cI saw a police patrol van with blue colour parked near CBN along Okpara Avenue. Beside it was a mobile policeman lying in pool of blood. I don\u2019t know what exactly happened but the body was still lying there.\u201d\n\nWhen the spokesman of the Command, Daniel Ndukwe, was contacted on the telephone over the incident, he declined comment.\n\nHe later sent a text that read, \u201cI need to verify that first, please.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Chioma Obinna\n\nOn this year\u2019s World No Tobacco Day, the World Health Organisation, WHO has warned that smoking one cigarette a day can seriously harm a person\u2019s health even as it disclosed that no fewer than 1.2 million non-smokers die from exposure to tobacco smoke.\n\nIn a message to mark the day, WHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti noted that tobacco kills half of its users as it harms nearly every organ in the human body.\n\nShe said: \u201cTobacco use can lead to lung, mouth, throat, oesophagus, stomach, bowel and other cancers. It increases the risk of chest and lung infections, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and other conditions. There is no safe form of tobacco.\n\nNoting that the theme for this year was \u201cCommit to quit\u201d as the choice to stop tobacco was in individual\u2019s hands, she said: \u201c Millions of people have been motivated to quit tobacco during the COVID-19 pandemic because of evidence showing tobacco smoking impairs lung function, making it harder for the body to fight off coronaviruses and other diseases.\n\n\u201cOf the 1.3 billion tobacco users globally, 60 per cent have expressed the desire to quit but only 30% have access to the tools to do so successfully. Digital solutions can help to fill this gap and so at WHO we have introduced \u201cFlorence\u201d a digital health worker who gives brief advice on how to quit and links people with the tools and solutions that can help.\n\n\u201cMore than 75 million people in the African Region use some form of tobacco. This burden is likely to increase as consumer purchasing power improves coupled with intensive efforts by the tobacco industry to expand the African market. Public health advocates should therefore actively pursue counter-marketing campaigns that highlight the many risks of tobacco use.\u201d\n\nShe said WHO was supporting countries to scale-up programmes to help people quit tobacco, especially at the primary health care and community levels, adding that support to quit was available in primary health care facilities in 11 countries and in Angola, Botswana and Zambia these services are offered at no cost to consumers.\n\nContinuing, she said: \u201cNational toll-free lines where tobacco users can call and get advice are available in six countries. Nicotine replacement therapy is sold in pharmacies in 19 countries with governments fully covering the costs in Eswatini, Mauritius and Seychelles.\n\n\u201cNicotine replacement therapy is included in the essential medicines list in Algeria, Ethiopia and South Africa. Burkina Faso is implementing \u201cTobaccoCessation,\u201d a mobile text messaging-based solution.\u201d\n\nShe the promising progress now needs to be expanded to more countries in the WHO African Region. She called on governments and communities to be alert to industry tactics to attract new users and keep people using tobacco, even when they are trying to quit.\n\n\u201cProducts such as electronic cigarettes and nicotine pouches are highly addictive and not recommended as strategies to reduce tobacco use.\n\nShe affirmed that WHO remains committed to supporting Member States to meet their obligations under the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.\n\nThese include the development and implementation of programmes to promote quitting tobacco in schools, universities, health facilities, workplaces and sporting environments. Services to diagnose tobacco dependence and help people quit should be included as an integral component in national health and education programmes, plans and strategies.\n\nMoetti further called on governments to improve access to these services, using a combination of approaches, such as toll-free quitlines, nicotine replacement therapy (such as gum, patches, sprays and other products), and digital solutions to empower people to quit. These interventions can be phased in where resources are limited.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

An operation to separate one from another is so complicated that any mistake, can lead to the death of either of the twin. The two states are like two rivers flowing into each other and this makes it very difficult to identify which river actually flows into the other.\n\nA critical look at both states shows that it is impossible to actually differentiate people living in one state from another as there are some people who live in Ogun State and work in Lagos State, while a lot of people live in Lagos and work in Ogun State. A trip to border towns of Sango-Ota, Akute Alagboole, Lambe, Ojudu, Agbado, Mowe, Warewa, Isheri and a host of others communities in Ogun State will convince anyone that there is really no boundaries between the two states. Some residents of these areas erroneously believe they are \u201cLagosians\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn an effort to take full advantage of their closeness and shared socio-cultural affinity for the benefit of their people, Ogun and Lagos State governors, Dapo Abiodun and Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on May 24, at the Presidential Lodge, Abeokuta, signed a Memorandum of Understanding to formally inaugurate the Lagos-Ogun Joint Development Commission.\n\nThe joint commission is expected to focus on addressing infrastructural deficit, particularly road, that is pronounced in the border areas. Apart from revenue management and tax collection, which will take care of Pay As You Earn remittance to both states, the commission is also work on trade and Investment, resolution of boundary disputes, security, in the area of gathering and sharing of intelligence.\n\nThe physical planning including disaster management, partnership in the cultivation and processing of food crops, among others, are other areas the commission will work on.\n\nThe MoU is a clear manifestation of the common dream that drive the nation\u2019s biggest economy (Lagos) and that of her industrial capital (Ogun), to work together for the common good of their people and invariably, Nigerians as a whole.\n\nNo doubt, Nigeria is in dire need of socio-economic development and actions like this, will to a very large extent, accelerate more projects that will help move people, goods and services from one state to another and in the process, boost industrial activities in the nation.\n\nI commend this laudable move and use this medium to call on the governments of other states in the federation to emulate this laudable example set by the governments of the Gateway State and the Centre of Excellence by going into bilateral or multilateral agreements on a state to state or region to region basis, to fast track economic development in the country.",

          "text": "By Fredrick Nwabufo\n\nSIR: At a time when evil spars against good, we must choose a side. We either opt to be a part of darkness or take a place in the phalanx of virtuous knights. Staying taciturn while evil course through the land like molten magma from a volcano does not absolve anyone of complicity. All who keep silent in the face of evil are accomplices.\n\nA great pestilence is scourging the Southeast. The land is crimson from the blood of innocents. There is fear, anxiety and confusion. A region that was once the safest place in Nigeria is in the throes of anarchy. Police officers are being mauled; soldiers butchered; residents targeted, and citizens killed. INEC offices and police stations have been razed. And more public infrastructure is being incinerated daily.\n\nWhat makes these tragedies more devastating is the open support by some citizens of the Southeast. Some of them, particularly those who take residence on social media spreading poison, have rationalised the killings and destruction of public property in the region. They describe the killers and arsonists as \u2018\u2019our people\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019freedom fighters\u2019\u2019.\n\nWhen did we become a people who rationalise killings? When did we start appropriating arsonists and criminals? When did we become a people imbued with so much hate and anger? When did we become so emotive and reactionary? When did we become so unfeeling? When did life stop to matter to us? Why have we become the monsters we claim we are fighting? When did wanton killing and destruction become a show of strength for us?\n\nWhat have we become?\n\nHypocrisy is a vexatious problem here. Some people defending criminals taking innocent lives because \u201cthey are our people; they are freedom fighters\u201d. This is while they spread propaganda against other groups. It is really sickening.\n\nOn a supposedly #BiafraRemembranceDay, instead of being a solemn occasion, there were reports of killings and arsons in the south-east. It is not enough to say #Ozoemena because the Southeast is already at war. Igbo leaders would rather skirt around the issue because they do not want to be seen as going against the zeitgeist in the region. They are observing political silence. But anyone who keeps silent in the face evil is an accomplice.\n\nIt appears we learnt nothing from the civil war. Who invites the grim reaper to his own home? Who brings death and destruction upon his own people? Does freedom fighting entail killing and destruction of lives? The southeast is a commercial centre; the multiplier effect of the activities of gunmen on the region is colossal. Businesses will collapse while some will relocate out of the area. Already, some businesses are relocating from the place. Where does that leave us? If the regional economy plummets, families thrown into poverty and hunger ravages the population, what is the benefit of the agitations?\n\nWhat is happening in the southeast is terrorism. We must call it by its character. The killing of citizens; the methodical killing of security agents, and the destruction of public property are nothing short of terrorist acts.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCitizens of the southeast must rise and stop this declension into the void. It is in our greater interest to do so.\n\nThese are just my lamentations.",

          "text": "By Nuhu Abdulkadir\n\nSIR: While people have applauded the choice of the acting Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Mohammed Bello-Koko, all eyes will be on him to see how he addresses some of the major problems that have confronted the maritime sector in Nigeria part of which are inadequate financing, inefficient ports infrastructure, deficit in maritime infrastructure, inefficiencies, lack of transparency and sharp practices among numerous others.\n\nExpectations from stakeholders in the sector is remarkably high. Being a capital-intensive sector, anyone at the helm of affairs is expected to work to increase private sector partnership, because inadequate participation of the private sector is responsible for poor funding, subsequently, inadequate financing, inefficiency and ineffectiveness as well as stunted growth.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnother particularly important issue is inefficient and inadequate port and shipping infrastructure. How Bello-Koko handles the problem of decaying infrastructures such as ports, terminals, cargo handling equipment, channels and harbours, warehouses, ports access roads, intermodal transport involving rail and roads interfacing with ships and badges, utilities, information communication technology (ICT), deep seaport and scanners, will be of immense interest to ports users as these are parts of the challenges facing the maritime sector in Nigeria.\n\nAny reform the new NPA boss would embark must factor in the pathetic state of port access roads, particularly, the Lagos port complex, Apapa and Tin Can Island Port. The road condition in the Lagos port is disturbing and the pressure it has been exerting on Lagos metropolis has heightened the call for multiple modes of transportation.\n\nThere is also the problem of inadequate development of seaports and inefficient supportive logistics infrastructure. This is another challenge stakeholders in the maritime industry in Nigeria have had to grapple with. There is the need to increase vessel size, and this has remained a problem for ports and shipping companies. Also, accommodating much larger vessels has proved very problematic in ports, where the capacity for such ships is lacking.\n\nWorried, experts have repeatedly noted that if the Nigerian maritime sector was properly harnessed and managed, it can generate N7trillion to the national coffers and create numerous jobs for Nigerians. Instead, stakeholders have continued to express concern that Nigeria is losing several billions on a regular basis to revenue leakages, capital flight and policy inconsistencies in the maritime sector.\n\nA 2018 Brickstone white paper titled: Challenges and Solutions: Private Sector Participation in the Nigeria Maritime Industry stated that Nigeria is currently losing N15b or $101m annually in the sector. Worse still, the research noted that Nigerian ownership accounts for less than eight per cent, which is far less the percentage contemplated in extant legislative enactments. Put succinctly, Nigeria and Nigerians are unable to fully reap the benefits available in the maritime sector.\n\nTo address this, the new NPA leadership will be expected to investigate allegations of malpractices in shipping operations such as alleged under-valuation of imports, under-declaration of goods, concealment and fraudulent transactions on Gross Registered Tonnage (GRT) of vessels by shipping lines, among others.\n\nRenowned Nigerian maritime lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Olisa Agbakoba has said times without number that, the Nigerian maritime sector has huge untapped revenue estimated at N7 trillion per annum, maintaining that to harness this potential, existing policies, institutions, regulatory and legal framework in the sector must be overhauled. So, Bello-Koko would be expected to take encumbrances affecting the optimisation of the maritime sector to the National Assembly for legislative overhaul.",

          "title": "Nigeria: A frail or a failed state?",
          "text": "By Rachael Tiamiyu\n\nNigeria appears to be in a frail state. The country is facing a worrying spate of kidnappings, terrorism, and banditry. Nigeria currently has debilitating health and educational system. The unemployment rate is alarming. Over 70% of the Nigerian population lives below two US dollars daily. This portrays the high level of poverty. These challenges have broken the social pact between citizens and the state. That is why today, most Nigerians find themselves in a moment of doubt about the survival of this great country. Citizens are uncertain about the future of their dear nation. It is clear-cut that there is a real and imminent threat to the survival of Nigeria.\n\nNigeria\u2019s is experiencing a reckless political system that is corrupt, self-serving, and manipulative. The country has exceeded its elastic limit and tending towards its breaking point. The Nigerian government has failed to deliver law and order and, in some cases, contributed to the violence and lawlessness in the country.\n\nOne proof that the federal system is a broken one was best illustrated in Nigerian youths\u2019 recent #EndSARS protest. The movement centered on ending police brutality and bad governance\u2026 Also, justice was demanded for victims of police violence and extrajudicial killings.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe political rivalry among elite groups indicates that the current federal system is not fit for the 21st century. Another indicator that the system needs new constitutional innovations is the negligence of our political elites to empower ordinary citizens. There is an obvious lack of commitment to reduce inequality and improve state performance in service delivery. Rather than advancing economic competitiveness, they are more committed to unhealthy political competition.\n\nThe government is currently unable to guarantee the security of lives and property across much of its territory. As a result, constant calls for federal restructuring have become a way for Nigerians to share their displeasure with the country\u2019s weak economic performance and misgovernance. One proof that the federal system is a broken one was best illustrated in Nigerian youths\u2019 recent #EndSARS protest. The movement centred on ending police brutality and bad governance. There was a public outcry against the outrageous benefits for political office holders, widespread corruption, and lack of compassion by the political leadership. Also, justice was demanded for victims of police violence and extrajudicial killings.\n\nNigeria is a nation of significant promise, but she is currently facing serious economic, social, and security issues. Just like a dilapidated building can be reinforced to save it from collapsing, can Nigeria be resuscitated from its frail state? Is it too late to save the country?\n\nI would say joint actions of Nigerian citizens can create the basis for offering Nigeria a new lease of life. Nigerian leaders and citizens need to take proactive measures to redress the crisis. Some possible ways forward are as follows:\n\nNigerian leaders should seek to increase the country\u2019s economic productivity and citizen opportunities. This will include investing in human capital potential, creating employment, and expanding financial access and opportunities for the citizens.\n\nNigeria still struggles with having a national identity due to its differences. The country struggles to find a national concept and identity that can unite all its ethnic and religious groups. Fragmented and competing identities and low levels of social cohesion are key factors that can lead to a nation\u2019s fragility. Hence, Nigerians should embrace a broad national identity rather than being identified more closely with ethnic and religious groups.\n\nNigeria must also continue to invest in the common symbols of national identity. Leaders can employ prominent tools to promote national identities. Tools such as civic engagement, culture, dialogue, decentralization, and building inclusive institutions.\n\nAccording to UNICEF, one in every five of the world\u2019s out-of-school children is in Nigeria. For substantive development in the educational sector to occur, the government must re-address the issue of funding. To enable us to compete internationally, a strong private-public partnership is needed to invest heavily in education in infrastructure, technology, teachers, and research funding.\n\nIn addition, the government should promote technical hands-on learning. Technical adaptation centres should be supported and adequately funded\u2014enough of the \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach to knowledge.\n\nReconstructing a debilitating Nigeria can be made possible if our constitution is revisited. A revised constitution will most likely guarantee good governance: a constitution in which there is the effective, transparent, and accountable use of public resources. Our leaders must consciously optimize any available public resource and prioritize the citizens\u2019 health, safety, and prosperity. Also, proper implementation of accountability and transparency in governance should be institutionalized.\n\nHowever, the country is presently filled with the stench of corruption \u2014 the putrid which emits from our non-selfless, self-serving leaders. Corruption is a cankerworm that is destructively eating deep into the fabric of the country. Self-interest has dominated Nigerian governance and political leadership. In addition, the country has a frail working system as a result of a failed governance.\n\nNigeria seems sick; she is in an unconscious state. Can she still survive? Nigeria is in a state of comatose. Can she be revived? Nigeria is debilitating; can she be saved from collapsing? Nigeria is at its elastic limit but has she reached her breaking point? Her leaders have failed her. Is it too late to save our dear country? Nigeria is on the verge of failure but has she outrightly failed?",

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Geoffrey Anyanwu Enugu, Jeff Amechi Agbodo, Onitsha, Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri, Chijioke Agwu, Abakaliki, Obinna Odogwu, Awka and Paul Osuyi, Asaba\n\nTension and anxiety have pervaded the whole of the South East and parts of South South states ahead of the sit-at-home ordered by the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) and the Movement for the Actualisation of Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB).\n\nPro-Biafra groups had shifted the observance which is usually on May 30 to today because this year\u2019s anniversary fell on Sunday. However, many of their members used yesterday for prayers in the churches.\n\nIPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu, had warned, at the weekend, that any person that flouted the directive in the region would have him or herself to blame.\n\nSimilarly, MASSOB leader, Uchenna Madu, yesterday, warned the Nigeria security agencies that their threats would not hold waters. He advised them to steer clear during the commemoration of the Biafra day anniversary.\n\n\u201cWe can never be cowed or intimidated by empty threats of cowardice security agencies. Sit-at-home exercise must hold tomorrow. Our people will once again prove they want Biafra. The declaration of Biafra independence by General Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu must always stand,\u201d he said.\n\nThis came as the various police commands threatened to crush any form of procession or gathering relating to Biafra today.\n\nIn Onitsha, tension started building up on Saturday, May 29, following an alleged shooting of soldiers at Ihiala Local Government Area of the state by suspected gunmen which caused gridlock for hours at the Onitsha bridgehead due to tight security check there.\n\nThere was show-of-force patrol by joint-security forces along roads and streets of Onitsha and its environs, ostensibly to instil fear in anybody trying to cause breach of peace and breakdown of law and order.\n\nWithin the week, there was rush by people to the markets to make purchases and stock foodstuff due to fear of unknown during the exercise.\n\nAnnouncements were made in various churches in Onitsha during the services, advising worshippers to obey the sit-at-home order today to avoid any possible attack or being hit by stray bullets.\n\nAttendance in many churches was scanty due to fear, as many people assumed the sit-at-home started yesterday as it used to.\n\nChairman of Onitsha Main Market Association, Kenneth Onyeka, said the market will remain open for business.\n\nOne of the traders, Johnson Dikemba, told Daily Sun that for the past few years when Biafra Day was marked, the major markets in the Onitsha shut down to respect their fathers, grandfathers and mothers who lost their lives during the civil war.\n\nDecide what you want, Umahi tells residents\n\nEbonyi Governor, David Umahi, yesterday, seemingly recanted as he asked residents of the state to feel free to participate in the sit-at-home exercise if they so wished.\n\nThe governor had, on a statewide broadcast on Saturday evening to mark his six years in office, directed Ebonyi people to go about their normal businesses today.\n\nUmahi also said he had withdrawn his earlier threat to punish any trader who closed his shop in obedience to the order, saying it was within the rights of anyone to sit at home.\n\nHis Special Assistant on Media, Francis Nwaze, who addressed a press conference in Abakaliki, yesterday, said: \u201cEbonyi government has received several requests from some families and residents of the state, requesting they would like to remain indoors today to organise private family prayers in honour of their loved ones who were murdered during the civil war. Some of the people with this special request own shops in some of our markets across the state.\n\n\u201cWhile as a government, we remain resolute in the protection of lives and property of Ebonyians and all residents of Ebonyi State, we are aware that it is the right of anyone to remain at home or go about his/her normal businesses in this regard.\n\n\u201cFollowing the foregoing, Governor Umahi, who is highly in touch with the people has directed that those who may wish to remain at home with their shop(s) locked should neither be penalised, nor their shop(s) seized as it is their constitutional right while the rights of those who may wish to go about their normal businesses should not be infringed upon as it is equally their constitutional right.\u201d\n\nAnambra, Imo, Enugu, Abia set for sit-at-home\n\nIn Anambra, preparations for the sit-at-home appeared to have started on Saturday as there was panic buying by the residents of the state. Many residents thronged the markets to buy food stuffs that would last them till Tuesday.\n\nFood stuff markets all opened yesterday for business as those returning from churches were also seen stopping over to buy food items.\n\nMeanwhile, the Anambra State Police Command said it was adequately prepared to ensure there would be no breakdown of law and order in the state.\n\nPolice Public Relations Officer, Ikenga Tochukwu, told Daily Sun: \u201cWe are not deterred by the speculations but the command is concentrating on our mandate of protecting lives and property.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Don Adinuba, said: \u201cAs far as we are concerned, today (yesterday) is the anniversary of the creation of Biafra. And Anambra State Government, in 2016, became the first and only administration in history to honour the memory of those who died in the fight for freedom.\n\n\u201cAmong the people who attended the solemn ceremony at Ekwueme Square was Alex Ekwueme, Nigeria\u2019s first vice president. So, tomorrow (today) is not a public holiday.\u201d\n\nAsked if the civil service and schools would open today, he responded with a question: \u201cDid you hear that the government is closing down any school or declaring a public holiday or work free day? Tomorrow is just another day.\u201d\n\nAs at late yesterday evening, Imo residents appeared set to comply with the order IPOB order.\n\nRoads were getting completely deserted while most shops which normally opened on Sundays remained locked.\n\nAlso, many churches in the urban areas witnessed low turnout of worshipers while those that managed to hold services hurriedly closed.\n\nHowever, the police had assured residents of their safety, noting they had activated every tactical means to make sure no lives or property would be lost in the state today.\n\nSimilarly, a wave of uncertainty enveloped Enugu State, yesterday, ostensibly because of recent security threats.\n\nSo, many residents said they would like to stay indoors today to avoid unpleasant incidents.\n\nSome who are Federal Government workers said they would watch out first before taking any action, \u201cnow that the Federal Government facilities are targets.\u201d\n\nEnugu State Commissioner of Police, Mohammed Aliyu, warned anybody or group harbouring any sinister intentions to disrupt the relative peace and security enjoyed in the state, to desist forthwith, as such attempt would be vehemently resisted.\n\nHowever, residents of Abia State have braced up for the exercise even as police called on the people to ignore the order.\n\nMost residents of the state already see today as a public holiday as they bought most of what they would use on Monday, on Friday and Saturday.\n\nIn some churches across the state, yesterday, adherents were asked to remain at home as not to be victims of any clash between security agents and Biafra agitators.\n\nCommercial vehicle and tricycle operators spoken to said they would be off the streets in compliance with the order.\n\nAlthough, the state government did not issue order for closure of markets, some traders, who spoke to Daily Sun, said they would stay at home to avoid any trouble.\n\nDeal with troublemakers \u2013Delta CP\n\nCommissioner of Police in Delta, Ari Muhammed Ali, yesterday, urged his officers to deal decisively with troublemakers in any part of the state.\n\nAli warned that on no account should anybody be seen carrying or hoisting Biafra flag in whatever guise in the state.\n\nHis warning is coming on the heels of the sit-at-home order for today by members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nAli, in a statement, yesterday, by the acting Public Relations Officer of the command, Bright Edafe, said undercover police detectives have been deployed across the state to arrest anyone caught carrying Biafra flag, and ensure they are dealt with accordance with the law of the land.",

All passengers are advised to avoid the long arm of the law and act in good conscience by adhering to the guidelines to protect the lives and livelihood of all Lagos residents.\n\n\u201cSince the commencement of the new guidelines and the ban on non-Nigerians travelling from three countries (India, Brazil and Turkey) into Nigeria, Lagos State has recorded 568 in-bound passengers, who have been permitted to enter Nigeria from these three countries. We have isolated 433 passengers in our various accredited hotels and facilities; 262 are in Isolation and 154 passengers have been discharged with a negative COVID-19 test.\n\n\u201cNine have tested positive to COVID-19 and successfully isolated to prevent community transmission. Of the remaining 135 passengers, 119 have refused isolation and 16 are unaccounted for.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOn May 24, 2021, the Presidential Steering Committee led by Mr. Boss Mustapha and working together with the COVID-19 response in Lagos State, led by the Incident Commander, the Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, published a first list of defaulters of the laid down protocols travelling through the Murtala Mohammed International Airport as it relates to the red listed countries (India, Brazil and Turkey).\n\n\u201cAll passengers affected should contact the lead of our Case Management Unit, Dr. Abimbola Bowale, on [email protected] who will verify their status. The list of names who may have been mistakenly placed on this list and have been cleared will be sent to the Presidential Steering Committee for removal from the published names.\n\n\u201cHowever, all passengers that have been confirmed absconders will have their passports deactivated for a minimum of 1 year, if Nigerian and if foreign, will have their resident permits cancelled and deported as stated by the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19.\n\n\u201cAll absconders will also face the penalties of the coronavirus pandemic Law 2021 of Lagos State, including varying lengths of prison time up to one year and fines of up to N500,000. All affected passengers are to present themselves to the Yaba Mainland Hospital for assessment and COVID-19 tests to evaluate their status.\u201d\n\nThe commissioner who warned against third wave of the COVID-19 wave, said regardless of the reduction in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the state is yet to reach its target. \u201cGiven the requirement for achieving herd immunity (60 per cent of total population vaccinated), the state still needs to vaccinate about 14,000,000 (14 Million).\n\n\u201cHowever, the state would ensure ramp up testing by carrying out COVID-19 tests on all travelers.",

I stand with the people of Tegina at this tragic and difficult time,\u201d Musa said.\n\nThe state government, in its statement, expressed outrage at the escalating level of banditry in the state and also asked the federal government to take prompt action to salvage the situation.\n\n\u201cThe situation has reached crisis level. In fact it\u2019s a war situation that we have to confront without further delay,\u201d Governor Abubakar Sani Bello said in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mary Noel Berje.\n\nBello described the incident as unfortunate and unbecoming the serial attacks in the state, adding that: \u201cThe Joint Military Taskforce has been mobilised and are already tracing the tracks of the criminals for possible isolation and ambush.\u201d\n\nThe statement said government has also embarked on the conduct of house-to-house head count to ascertain the exact number of children abducted.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "An assistant director in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mrs Amie Alex-Irobi, is presently at the centre of a N2.5 million financial fraud which she engaged in towards a firm, Eraskorp Nigeria Limited, according to documents obtained by SaharaReporters.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that Alex-Irobi, who is at the Department of Technical Cooperation in Africa, collected the money from the firm in late 2019 with promises to help them secure contracts.\n\nThe firm, after the director defaulted, then wrote a petition to the Ministry and the woman was subsequently brought before the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, for more detailed investigations.\n\nTop sources in the ministry stated on Monday that instead of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyema, and the Minister of state For Foreign Affairs, Zubairu Dada, to act on the investigations, they shielded the woman and seconded her from the DTCA to a free trade zone authority to operate.\n\nIn a letter by the firm, Eraskorp, dated October 14, 2019, and written by its solicitor, Ajayi Olowo and Co and addressed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyema, the complaint was titled, \u201cReport of obtaining False Pretext of a sum of N2.5 million from Eraskorp Nigeria Limited by Mrs Amie Alex-Irobi, an Assistant Director with DTCA.\u201d\n\nThe letter obtained by SaharaReporters reads, \u201cWe are legal counsel to the Eraskorp Nigeria Limited, hereinafter referred to as our client. We have been briefed that Mrs Amie Alex-Irobi, a serving Assistant Director at the DTCA, Ministry of Foreign Affairs in May 2017 collected from our client the sum of N2.5 million only on the pretext that she was going to source contracts/projects for our client.\n\n\u201cAs at April 2019, Mrs Amie Alex-Irobi had neither refunded the said sum of money nor sourced any contracts/projects for our client. In view of the continual violation of the extant provisions of the law by the said Mrs Amie Alex-Irobi, who is currently a senior staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we have forwarded a petition to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission \u2013 a copy of said petition for your necessary attention.\u201d See Also Corruption EXPOSED: Another Senior Official Of Nigeria's Foreign Affairs Ministry Linked To Multi-million Naira Financial Fraud\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs then wrote to the Director-General of the DTCA and directed the Assistant Director to be released to the EFCC for investigation.\n\nIn a letter dated October 28, 2019, and signed by Ahmed Iya, Deputy Director (APEDD) for honourable minister, the ministry said, \u201cI am directed to forward herewith attached letter from Ajayi Olowo & Co solicitors, advocates, cooperate, property and tax consultants on the above subject for your attention and reaction.\u201d\n\nIn another letter dated February 18, 2020, and signed by Lot Egopija, Director (Planning Research and Statistics), the ministry directed the woman to appear before the EFCC for investigation and questioning.\n\nTop sources told SaharaReporters that after Alex-Irobi came back from the EFCC, her financial fraud investigations gradually died down after lobbying with the two ministers.\n\n\u201cIn 2016, she was demoted from rank of Assistant Director GL 15 to Chief Programme Officer GL 14 for acts of serious misconduct. In fact, the Disciplinary Committee recommended her for dismissal from service but for the magnanimity of then minister, Kadija Bukar Abba Ibrahim, who directed for a review on a compassionate basis.\n\n\u201cIt was thereafter that the officer embarked on another defrauding expedition culminating in the report under reference. The two ministers are well aware of the issues but they are in the habit of shielding and making DTCA a safe haven for criminals. The matter has been left uninvestigated or treated with levity. She was in fact promoted in the December 2020 promotion exercise to the rank of Assistant Director and granted secondment to the African Free Trade Zone so as to circumvent and avoid further questions about the officer,\u201d the source stated.\n\n\u201cShe is from Rivers State but related by marriage to the minister, Onyeama.

          "text": "An assistant director in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mrs Amie Alex-Irobi, is presently at the centre of a N2.5 million financial fraud which she engaged in towards a firm, Eraskorp Nigeria Limited, according to documents obtained by SaharaReporters.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that Alex-Irobi, who is at the Department of Technical Cooperation in Africa, collected the money from the firm in late 2019 with promises to help them secure contracts.\n\nThe firm, after the director defaulted, then wrote a petition to the Ministry and the woman was subsequently brought before the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, for more detailed investigations.\n\nTop sources in the ministry stated on Monday that instead of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyema, and the Minister of state For Foreign Affairs, Zubairu Dada, to act on the investigations, they shielded the woman and seconded her from the DTCA to a free trade zone authority to operate.\n\nIn a letter by the firm, Eraskorp, dated October 14, 2019, and written by its solicitor, Ajayi Olowo and Co and addressed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyema, the complaint was titled, \u201cReport of obtaining False Pretext of a sum of N2.5 million from Eraskorp Nigeria Limited by Mrs Amie Alex-Irobi, an Assistant Director with DTCA.\u201d\n\nThe letter obtained by SaharaReporters reads, \u201cWe are legal counsel to the Eraskorp Nigeria Limited, hereinafter referred to as our client. We have been briefed that Mrs Amie Alex-Irobi, a serving Assistant Director at the DTCA, Ministry of Foreign Affairs in May 2017 collected from our client the sum of N2.5 million only on the pretext that she was going to source contracts/projects for our client.\n\n\u201cAs at April 2019, Mrs Amie Alex-Irobi had neither refunded the said sum of money nor sourced any contracts/projects for our client. In view of the continual violation of the extant provisions of the law by the said Mrs Amie Alex-Irobi, who is currently a senior staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we have forwarded a petition to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission \u2013 a copy of said petition for your necessary attention.\u201d See Also Corruption EXPOSED: Another Senior Official Of Nigeria's Foreign Affairs Ministry Linked To Multi-million Naira Financial Fraud\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs then wrote to the Director-General of the DTCA and directed the Assistant Director to be released to the EFCC for investigation.\n\nIn a letter dated October 28, 2019, and signed by Ahmed Iya, Deputy Director (APEDD) for honourable minister, the ministry said, \u201cI am directed to forward herewith attached letter from Ajayi Olowo & Co solicitors, advocates, cooperate, property and tax consultants on the above subject for your attention and reaction.\u201d\n\nIn another letter dated February 18, 2020, and signed by Lot Egopija, Director (Planning Research and Statistics), the ministry directed the woman to appear before the EFCC for investigation and questioning.\n\nTop sources told SaharaReporters that after Alex-Irobi came back from the EFCC, her financial fraud investigations gradually died down after lobbying with the two ministers.\n\n\u201cIn 2016, she was demoted from rank of Assistant Director GL 15 to Chief Programme Officer GL 14 for acts of serious misconduct. In fact, the Disciplinary Committee recommended her for dismissal from service but for the magnanimity of then minister, Kadija Bukar Abba Ibrahim, who directed for a review on a compassionate basis.\n\n\u201cIt was thereafter that the officer embarked on another defrauding expedition culminating in the report under reference. The two ministers are well aware of the issues but they are in the habit of shielding and making DTCA a safe haven for criminals. The matter has been left uninvestigated or treated with levity. She was in fact promoted in the December 2020 promotion exercise to the rank of Assistant Director and granted secondment to the African Free Trade Zone so as to circumvent and avoid further questions about the officer,\u201d the source stated.\n\n\u201cShe is from Rivers State but related by marriage to the minister, Onyeama. She is also related to Mr Lot Peter Egopija, Director, Planning Research and Statistics from Rivers State.

          "title": "Attempts To Murder Sowore: In Vain Buhari's Bangles Cast! By Kunle Wizeman Ajayi",
          "text": "For the upteenth time, the Nigerian ruling class has launched another deadly attack on Omoyele Sowore, the National Chairman of the African Action Congress (AAC) and leader of the TakeItBack Movement (TIB.) This time, it's at Unity Fountain and it's yet again the same SARS Squad that made the last attempt on Sowore and other comrades' lives during the January 1st #RevolutionNow Crossover Night. I narrowly escaped that brutality myself. The grouse of the Nigerian rulers is that Sowore is leading the most sophisticated, ideological, and consistent opposition to its current Fascist momentum which is meant to destroy the heightening hunger of millions of Nigerian workers and youths for a new and pro-people country.\n\nThe protest at Unity Fountain was called by the Femi Falana-led T-PAPS and Omoyele Sowore was invited alongside other change-seeking activists and people. As early as 6.00am, the Unity Fountain had been sealed by war-ready police and DSS officers. The police officers on the ground engaged with Sowore to reach out to FCT CP Bala, who evidently denied the order to seal the fountain. But within a few minutes, the DSP Altine-led SARS Squad stormed the venue and started shooting. DSP Altine Daniel herself shot directly at Sowore and even told him pointedly after the activist queried that; \"I did!\"\n\nSowore at the hospital after being shot\n\nBut DSP Altine and the police thugs of President Buhari have failed again. Their plan to destroy all genuine voices of dissent is shattered. This is the third deadly attack on Sowore after the Great #ENDSARS Revolt which baptized and energized the Buhari-taunted \"lazy youths\" and turned them to a coconut head-generation that globally 'sorosoke' for a new democratic, economically developed and sustainable, secure, and pro-people Nigeria. The fourteen days of #EndSARS was so great that it shook not only the Buhari government, but the whole world!\n\nThe last point of the 5FOR5 Demands of the #EndSARS Revolt was salary increment and welfare of police and military rank and files. We urge all sensible police and military guys to start thinking from their hearts and stop licking the anus of their officers of impunity, who are the ones 'chopping' their lives all around while the rank and files are suffering and facing the hell of insecurity and terrororism. Many police guys are ambitious state terrorists themselves, but many still have some hearts. These ones must organize and be counted amongst the millions who truly want a country of peace and prosperity. The lessons of the 2002 National Police Strike need to be learnt and advanced.\n\nHowever, what are the lessons from this particular attack?\n\nFirst is that the Nigerian Ruling Class is testing the waters. I witnessed the New Year 2021 Crossover attack. The drunk SARS officers were pointedly agitated to inflict deadly injuries on us all, and especially Omoyele Sowore. Same DSP Altine called his bosses after the headbutt that broke Sowore's nose by DSP Suleiman Abdulkadir, and jubilantly announced that she had captured the big fish. But the protests afterwards caused them big regrets.\n\nAlso, this second straight shooting at Sowore was almost like the one at the front of the National Assembly when the Abuja Six were arrested. That same DSP Altine-led SARS Squad, let the cat out of the bag that the Buhari government is determined to go bunkers to eliminate all forms of real and formidable opposition.\n\nFinally, the deadly attacks on Sowore have shown that what the government fears the most is revolution! The Five-Point Demands of the #RevolutionNow of: An Economy that Works For the Masses; An Effective and Democratic End To Insecurity; An End To Systemic Corruption and For Total System Change; The Immediate Implementation of N30,000 Minimum Wage; and Free and Quality Education and Healthcare For All hit the nails at the heads while the Coalition For Revolution (CORE)'s Charter of Demands is an altruistic and radically historic booklet that opens the road to a new thinking for a new world in a new Nigeria.\n\nThe Buhari government is a cowardly affliction that must be defeated. Only the unity of all oppressed will instructively respond surgically and more safely to end the shenanigans of our oppressors. Scattered we may lose. From North to South, oppressions and mass poverty are things to unite us rather than divide us. Let all us all, by June 12, show the Buhari government that we all can march together in our millions to win. In the North, we march in millions to defeat Boko Haram, ISWAP, Bandits, and the state terrorists. From East to South, we march against Unknown Gunmen, Bandits, Kidnappers, and the Palliative Rogues in government. Our oppressors are one and the same in different agbada, babariga, and suits. Only by uniting all struggles of workers and youths like the January 2012 Uprising Against Subsidy Removal and the #EndSARS Revolts to a gigantic #RevolutionNow will we ever get the new Nigeria we want. As we soldier on, and Omoyele Sowore has bounced back like the lion is wont to, we point all our ten fingers of 'waka' to boo the Bubu and the ruling class in the words taken from Wole Soyinka's \"Abiku\" that: \"In vain your bangles cast!\"",

          "text": "Almentor, a video-based online learning platform for the Middle East and North Africa, has raised $6.5m in a Series B round led by Partech from its Africa Fund.\n\nThe startup was founded in 2016 when Ihad Fikry and Ibrahim Kamel decided there was a need to cater to the learning needs in the MENA region that were not provided by other platforms.\n\n\u201cWe live in a region with a population of 400 million-plus people but 90% of them cannot learn properly in any other language but Arabic,\u201d Ihab Fikry, Almentor\u2019s co-founder and CEO, says to TechCabal.\n\nThe courses are designed to provide knowledge \u201cin a proper manner without promoting any ideology or religious thoughts,\u201d Fikry says.\n\nHow Almentor works\n\nFrom gamified mobile apps to websites that enable streaming, online learning comes in different varieties across the world.\n\nHundreds of educational channels like TED-Ed, Khan Academy and Crash Course have carved a niche on YouTube, without having to build their own technologies. Where does Almentor fit in this universe?\n\nAlmentor can be accessed in multiple countries across Africa but the content is focused on North Africa and the Middle East.\n\nFikry describes Almentor as sharing the attributes of renowned platforms like Masterclass, Udemy and LinkedIn Learning.\n\nIt charges users a subscription to access its library of 12,000 videos.\n\nThe platform has a video-on-demand component that enables learners to stream content, while a learning management system engages users in classroom-like activities like asking and answering questions, and taking exams.\n\nAlmentor can be accessed anywhere, even in Nigeria, but the focus is to serve the Arabic region.\n\nTheir library includes math, history, natural sciences and training material for corporations. For social sciences where context may vary between countries, creators are selected from various countries to ensure the material is relevant. However, many users can find similarities because virtually every course is available in Arabic.\n\nAlmentor works with subject-matter teachers and professional content creators around the MENA region to create the courses. The company and the creators share revenue from subscriptions based on an agreement on exclusivity and whole ownership of the content by Almentor.\n\nFikry says they have received over 3,000 applications from people who want to create course material on Almentor, but the acceptance rate is currently at 12%. Besides welcoming applications, the startup proactively headhunts already successful lecturers and also engages agencies to recruit mentors for them.\n\nSo far, Almentor has provided 2 million successful learning experiences to users. Fikry explains this metric means the learner has consumed at least 25% of the learning material.\n\nLearning categories vary from basic (30% of their library) to intermediate and advanced levels.\n\nA typical Almentor learner is between ages 18 and 40 years old. 51% of learners are male while 49% are female. 60% are from Egypt, 25% are from Gulf nations like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Bahrain. The rest come from Algeria, Morocco, Niger and Arabs living in the US and UK.\n\nIn terms of socioeconomic status, Fikry says Almentor learners are between the middle and upper class.\n\n\u201cFor those in Class A+, they prefer to learn in English though some learn in French. For others, almost 40% can only learn in Arabic,\u201d Fikry, a PhD holder who used to be a management professor and PWC consultant, explains.\n\nSeed to Series B, driven by partnerships\n\nAs much as it is a service targeted as directly serving consumers, a key element of Almentor\u2019s progress has been over 80 partnerships it has entered with organisations and governments.\n\nOne such partnership is with the Ministry of Education in Egypt for a white-label curriculum targeted at 4.5 million students in grades 7 to 9. They have another with the government in the UAE to upskill entrepreneurs in the region.\n\nRegardless of the country or the partnership, Almentor\u2019s promise is that users will \u201clearn from a subject matter expert without being driven to any ideology,\u201d Fikry insists.\n\nIt is a sophisticated commitment that requires a range of management skills, beyond merely setting up technology for streaming and learning. It also needs capital to achieve its potential, Fikry says, which explains why they have sought out investors to continue to build.\n\nAs with having governments on board, working with VCs \u201cgives credibility to the platform as we are serving an area with lots of dynamics,\u201d Fikry says.\n\nHe says they particularly sought out Partech for this round owing to the VC\u2019s global spread of portfolio companies spanning fintech, edtech and other sectors.\n\nWith this Series B, Almentor has now raised $14.5 million.\n\nIt opened the funding gates with a $3.5 million seed fund in 2016. In 2019, Almentor\u2019s $4.5 million Series A was led by Sawari Ventures, an Egyptian firm that closed a $71 million fund in April. Sawari also invested in this Series B round as Sango Capital, a firm based in South Africa.\n\nCyril Collon, general partner at Partech, described Fikry and his co-founder as \u201ctwo fantastic mission-driven entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nHe believes Almentor is the leading platform for self-learning in the Middle East and Africa, and is looking forward to helping the company expand access to \u201con-demand cutting-edge personal learning & developments options.\u201d",

          "text": "Barely seven months after a $30 million funding round in which Jeff Bezos participated, Chipper Cash has raised $100 million in a Series C round.\n\nThe round was led by SVB Capital, a US firm investing in an Africa-focused startup for the first time. Existing Chipper Cash investors like Deciens Capital, Ribbit Capital, Bezos Expeditions and 500 Startups participated. One Way Ventures, Tribe Capital, and Brue2 Ventures also joined the round.\n\nChipper Cash enables individuals to transfer money at zero fees between African countries. It also offers Chipper Checkout, a paid service for businesses to receive payments by sharing payment links with customers or integrating a button on a website or app.\n\nBefore now, the startup was present in Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda. But Ham Serunjogi, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch they have now made their services available in the UK.\n\nThis expansion comes on the heels of a 33% increase in users \u2013 from 3 million in November 2020 to 4 million at present. Within this period, the company introduced new features to its app including virtual VISA cards for online shopping in Nigeria and crypto transactions in South Africa and Uganda.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also launching our US stocks product in Uganda, Nigeria and a few other countries soon,\u201d Serunjogi said.\n\nThis Series C marks a stunning rise for a three-year-old startup. It was founded in 2018 by Serunjogi, a Ugandan, and Maijid Moujaled, a Ghanaian. Three years later, the pair has steered the company to the top bracket of fintech startups on the continent, at least in terms of the amount of venture capital raised.\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nSince May 2019 when they raised $2.4m, the startup\u2019s total funding stands at $152.2m. Serunjogi, the Chipper Cash CEO, declined to be specific about what the startup is now worth.\n\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019re not getting into our valuation, but we\u2019re probably the most valuable private startup in Africa today after this round,\u201d he said.\n\nMaijid Moujaled (seated) and Ham Serunjogi, Chipper Cash co-founders\n\nIn March this year, Flutterwave \u2013 a private startup in Africa \u2013 raised $170m and explicitly said they were now valued at more than $1bn. Segunjogi\u2019s comment suggests that Chipper Cash may also now be worth over $1bn, even if they have raised $80m less than the Nigerian fintech.\n\nLike Flutterwave, Chipper Cash is headquartered in San Francisco but has over 200 employees working out of Africa and serving African customers.

Subscribe here to get it directly in your inbox every Sunday at 3 pm WAT Hello, On Tuesday, Stripe announced a feature for merchants to create payment links and sell online without a website. As with many things from Stripe, it sounded unparalleled \u2013 another \u201cgame-changer\u201d in global e-payments. But allow Patrick Collison, Stripe\u2019s CEO, tell you where the proof of concept came from: \u201c\u2026the thing that\u2019s interesting to me about the payment link \u201cspace\u201d is that it\u2019s a use case that really took off in other markets first \u2014 Nigeria, India, Philippines, etc. I suspect that staying abreast of important new patterns emerging outside US/Europe will become more important for many businesses in the years ahead\u2026\u201d Payments links is one example of how emerging markets can teach developed economies a few tricks for the digital economy. Another space where Nigeria\u2019s example may influence the global space is real-time payments, as we\u2019ll see shortly after a message from our partners. PARTNER MESSAGE\n\nThe Flutterwave Mobile app, the app that turns any smartphone into a mobile POS is now redefining commerce. The Flutterwave Mobile App makes it super convenient for anyone to take their business with them anywhere, anytime. Learn how you can take your business anywhere, anytime here. Now, let\u2019s dive in. Exporting e-payments One consequence of last year\u2019s pandemic was a sharp increase in the use of mobile wallets. According to a new report by ACI Worldwide, an American payments system company, mobile wallet adoption increased by 46% in 2020. Growth in 2019 was 40.6% while the mark for 2018 was 18.9%. This trend suggests that payments is becoming: more mobile: through apps available on smartphones, smart watches, etc and less in physical bank branches.\n\nfaster: if people are more confident to make payments online, it must be because both sender and receiver are getting notified of transaction success more quickly too. Indeed, online payments are becoming more real-time around the world. Real-time transaction volumes increased by 41% from 50 billion in 2019 to 70.3 billion in 2020. Transaction value rose by 32.8% from $69 trillion to $92 trillion. So which countries are driving this trend?\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights With 25.5 billion transactions in 2020, India is by far the global leader on real-time payments. China, South Korea, Thailand and the UK make up the top five.\n\nIndia\u2019s real-time payments revolution started in 2016 when the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) was launched. They\u2019ve gone on to build an Immediate Payment System. But before all this, Nigeria made a similar historic move with NIBSS Instant Payments (NIP) in 2011.\n\nNIP is a real-time payment solution that guarantees instant value to beneficiaries. NIBSS (Nigeria Interbank Settlement Scheme, a company co-owned by banks in Nigeria) built E-bills Pay on the NIP platform to enable account-to-account payments.\n\nBoth creations have been described as part of the foundations for Nigeria\u2019s fintech boom today. Andrew Levin, the chief economics for PwC in Nigeria once called NIBSS the most impactful fintech in Nigeria. What NIBSS did in 2011, many are still in the process of creating. The US\u2019s first real-time payment network is barely four years old. Instant transfers through that network only became available on PayPal\u2019s Venmo in August 2019. The US Federal Reserve Bank plans to launch FedNow, a NIBSS NIP of sorts, in 2023.\n\nBut as good as NIBSS has been in Nigeria, some fintechs are already looking to go further in making transactions more real-time and unifying payments.\n\nTeamApt, a startup founded in 2015, introduced a \u201cvirtual account\u201d system that has become a standard for instant transfers among Nigerian fintechs. This year, a new startup has come out of beta to provide instant settlement for businesses. It is already being called \u201cNIBSS for fintechs.\u201d\n\nThe upshot: Nigeria does not have India or China\u2019s population to top real-time payments lists. Nigerian consumers may not be at the income levels in economies like South Korea and the UK. But as Collison said, the West African country is a place to watch for trends that could shape the future of online payments. FROM THE CABAL Nigeria-based fintech OPay is said to be plotting a $400 million fundraise that will see it valued at $1.5 billion. The money will be deployed to deepend its impressive payments processing operation in Nigeria and expansion elsewhere. There\u2019s that will see it valued at $1.5 billion. The money will be deployed to deepend its impressive payments processing operation in Nigeria and expansion elsewhere.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "title": "How Nigerian credit fintech startup, BFREE, is helping Africans repay their loans",
          "text": "In 2019, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) issued a directive to banks mandating them to increase the number of loans they give. Consequently, there was an increase in loan requests.\n\nWith technology and the rise of money-lending platforms like Carbon, Branch, FairMoney, and Migo, offering personal collateral-free loans, anyone can borrow money without visiting a bank.\n\nThis means that lenders are more accessible. However, since the onset of the pandemic, they have had a tough time as borrowers haven\u2019t repaid their loans, citing the economic effects of COVID-19.\n\nIn 2020, the CBN activated the Global Standing Instruction (GSI) policy allowing banks to withdraw defaulting loans from any account held by a borrower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile loan collection for BVN-linked bank accounts may be somewhat smooth, the reverse is the case for credit fintech startups.\n\nMoreover, with millions of people demanding personal loans, lending amounts for these platforms become smaller. Also, lenders experience difficulties in collection for small amounts.\n\nThis challenge prompted the three co-founders \u2014 Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Julian Flosbach; Chief Production Officer (CPO), Moses Nmor; and Chief Operations Officer (COO), Chukwudi Enyi \u2014 to come up with BFREE, in August 2020.\n\nThrough its tech-enabled and credit management solution that makes collection processes more scalable, efficient, and user-friendly, BFREE concentrates on helping its customers with their finances.\n\n\u201cLending has experienced a digital revolution, but credit collection needs to be efficient, scalable, and ethical. That\u2019s exactly what we are doing at BFREE,\u201d Flosbach says.\n\nBuilt by an experienced team\n\nThe team met at FairMoney, where Flosbach was General Manager. Enyi was the Head of Growth at Nairabox, OPay, and FairMoney, while Nmor is a former team member at OPay, Kudi, and FairMoney.\n\nTheir duties at FairMoney were mostly related to managing loan collection. They\u2019d also all spent time at different fast-scaling financial startups where loan collection was a problem.\n\n\u201cAll the co-founders used to work in large digital lending fintech startups in Nigeria, and collections were always a struggle. Hence, we looked at the collection process to come up with a way to reinvent it from scratch to fix these challenges,\u201d Enyi reveals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile lending has evolved digitally, loan collection is still done traditionally through law firms and smaller collection agencies, with little or no transparency or accountability.\n\nBesides, customers are often threatened with calls, messages, and emails, which Flosbach calls \u201ca no-go for impact-oriented lenders.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough lenders are specialists and may seem to be focused on lending, they may not be skilled or focused on collections,\u201d Flosbach clarifies.\n\nTherefore, there is a need to specialise in loan collection and lending because the two products are different.\n\n\u201cThe lenders\u2019 tech improves the actual lending product and not collection. All the digital lenders I know look to outsource their collections due to the scalability issue,\u201d Flosbach says.\n\nSolving an actual problem\n\nLending platforms unavoidably end up with Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) companies that provide outsourcing services for large telcos or banks by managing their teleservices and customer services.\n\nSince the BPO companies are not lending professionals, the co-founders aim to help lenders get their money from their customers.\n\nCustomers fail to repay their loans for different reasons. Therefore, a different approach is required to make them pay back.\n\n\u201cNo legit customer takes a loan with the intention to default. However, life does not always go according to plan. In the end, a customer that cannot service a loan is in a financial emergency,\u201d Enyi explains.\n\nTo tackle this, they first identify why the customer defaulted before deploying machine language algorithms. BFREE uses a combination of a self-servicing platform, chat and call bots, and human contact centre operations after identifying how customers can repay.\n\n\u201cHere we deploy machine learning algorithms that predict the probability to repay a customer and define the use case of the customer,\u201d Flosbach submits.\n\nAnd if customers have not been repaying their loans and interests to the lenders, it\u2019s likely BFREE reaches out to them.\n\n\u201cIf a customer has not been servicing a balance from a lender, there is a good chance that we will get in contact with them and offer our product to find a solution that works for the customers and the lender,\u201d Flosbach says.\n\nOn the other hand, customers who don\u2019t repay are addressed differently.\n\n\u201cCustomers who don\u2019t repay don\u2019t want to because they don\u2019t see the benefits of repaying. Hence, they need financial literacy,\u201d Flosbach adds.\n\nBefore such customers start servicing a loan again, the startup gives them some financial education like understanding the importance of loan repayment and credit score.\n\n\u201cWe try as much to incentivise these customers to cooperate with us. For example, we offer them a discount on their loan repayments. After offering them the incentives, we do our financial literacy classes,\u201d says Flosbach.\n\nMeanwhile, they are currently testing these classes through their self-service platform to see how effective they would be on debt customers.\n\n\u201cWe do not use an app for our self-servicing platform, but a webview, which works like a webpage,\u201d he discloses.\n\nWhile they reach out to the debtors, the co-founders believe that in an ethical credit collection, not everyone would repay.\n\nAt the moment, Flosbach claims there is no other fintech startup offering the same service as BFREE on the continent.\n\n\u201cThere is no similar innovation in Africa in our space of the lending value chain. This part has been overlooked for quite a while, and our competition mainly consists of BPO companies.\u201d\n\nHowever, the team believes that with time, competition for innovation in credit collections in Africa would increase.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d welcome this step as it is always better for the end-customers if options are competing for the best customer value,\u201d Flosbach declares.\n\nA sustainable model\n\nOn how BFREE makes money, Flosbach explains, \u201cWe charge a certain percentage commission of the repayments that a lender receives. This commission depends on the lender\u2019s portfolio size, portfolio quality, and likes.\u201d\n\nAnd how sustainable is that?\n\n\u201cIt is sustainable. We have very solid unit economics as our solutions work very well, and we usually achieve at least 30% higher repayments than the BPO companies,\u201d he continues.\n\nThough the credit fintech startup operates a B2B2C model, with currently over 300,000 customers, it has its challenges.\n\n\u201cOne of our challenges is to convince lenders that there is a better way to do collection than how they\u2019ve been doing it,\u201d he says.\n\nFrom Nigeria to Africa\n\nThe Lagos-based credit startup recently raised an $800,000 pre-seed round to build a solution for all emerging markets struggling with infrastructure for collection in Africa. Nigeria-based Beta.Ventures, Launch Africa Ventures, and GreenHouse Capital led the round.\n\n\u201cWe focus all of our product development to assist customers in a state of financial emergency. There are millions of customers in personal debt. This is really what motivates us as a team,\u201d Nmor declares.\n\nThe team is bullish about the Kenyan market they are expanding into.\n\n\u201cWe have a team on the ground already that is setting up our solution as we speak,\u201d Flosbach reveals.\n\nIn the Kenyan market, there have been several cases where BPO companies threatened or publicly shamed customers, something Flosbach considers inappropriate for lenders.\n\nWhile debt consumers may default on a payment due to unforeseen circumstances, the high interest on payment is also a factor.\n\nRecall that in digital predatory lending in Nigeria, we highlighted how the interest rate upon repayment is one reason debt consumers don\u2019t repay promptly.\n\nIn Kenya, where scores of apps offering short-term advances similar to payday loans are common, the interest rate upon repayment is also a problem.\n\nThe credit fintech startup offers a personal budgeting service to debt consumers to help them spend within their means and repay their loans with interest promptly.\n\nThrough its consumer personal budgeting processes, algorithms, and financial literacy, BFREE believes it will tackle Africa\u2019s rising consumer debt.\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "title": "How Nigerian credit fintech startup, BFREE, is helping Africans repay their loans",
          "text": "In 2019, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) issued a directive to banks mandating them to increase the number of loans they give. Consequently, there was an increase in loan requests.\n\nWith technology and the rise of money-lending platforms like Carbon, Branch, FairMoney, and Migo, offering personal collateral-free loans, anyone can borrow money without visiting a bank.\n\nThis means that lenders are more accessible. However, since the onset of the pandemic, they have had a tough time as borrowers haven\u2019t repaid their loans, citing the economic effects of COVID-19.\n\nIn 2020, the CBN activated the Global Standing Instruction (GSI) policy allowing banks to withdraw defaulting loans from any account held by a borrower.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile loan collection for BVN-linked bank accounts may be somewhat smooth, the reverse is the case for credit fintech startups.\n\nMoreover, with millions of people demanding personal loans, lending amounts for these platforms become smaller. Also, lenders experience difficulties in collection for small amounts.\n\nThis challenge prompted the three co-founders \u2014 Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Julian Flosbach; Chief Production Officer (CPO), Moses Nmor; and Chief Operations Officer (COO), Chukwudi Enyi \u2014 to come up with BFREE, in August 2020.\n\nThrough its tech-enabled and credit management solution that makes collection processes more scalable, efficient, and user-friendly, BFREE concentrates on helping its customers with their finances.\n\n\u201cLending has experienced a digital revolution, but credit collection needs to be efficient, scalable, and ethical. That\u2019s exactly what we are doing at BFREE,\u201d Flosbach says.\n\nBuilt by an experienced team\n\nThe team met at FairMoney, where Flosbach was General Manager. Enyi was the Head of Growth at Nairabox, OPay, and FairMoney, while Nmor is a former team member at OPay, Kudi, and FairMoney.\n\nTheir duties at FairMoney were mostly related to managing loan collection. They\u2019d also all spent time at different fast-scaling financial startups where loan collection was a problem.\n\n\u201cAll the co-founders used to work in large digital lending fintech startups in Nigeria, and collections were always a struggle. Hence, we looked at the collection process to come up with a way to reinvent it from scratch to fix these challenges,\u201d Enyi reveals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile lending has evolved digitally, loan collection is still done traditionally through law firms and smaller collection agencies, with little or no transparency or accountability.\n\nBesides, customers are often threatened with calls, messages, and emails, which Flosbach calls \u201ca no-go for impact-oriented lenders.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough lenders are specialists and may seem to be focused on lending, they may not be skilled or focused on collections,\u201d Flosbach clarifies.\n\nTherefore, there is a need to specialise in loan collection and lending because the two products are different.\n\n\u201cThe lenders\u2019 tech improves the actual lending product and not collection. All the digital lenders I know look to outsource their collections due to the scalability issue,\u201d Flosbach says.\n\nSolving an actual problem\n\nLending platforms unavoidably end up with Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) companies that provide outsourcing services for large telcos or banks by managing their teleservices and customer services.\n\nSince the BPO companies are not lending professionals, the co-founders aim to help lenders get their money from their customers.\n\nCustomers fail to repay their loans for different reasons. Therefore, a different approach is required to make them pay back.\n\n\u201cNo legit customer takes a loan with the intention to default. However, life does not always go according to plan. In the end, a customer that cannot service a loan is in a financial emergency,\u201d Enyi explains.\n\nTo tackle this, they first identify why the customer defaulted before deploying machine language algorithms. BFREE uses a combination of a self-servicing platform, chat and call bots, and human contact centre operations after identifying how customers can repay.\n\n\u201cHere we deploy machine learning algorithms that predict the probability to repay a customer and define the use case of the customer,\u201d Flosbach submits.\n\nAnd if customers have not been repaying their loans and interests to the lenders, it\u2019s likely BFREE reaches out to them.\n\n\u201cIf a customer has not been servicing a balance from a lender, there is a good chance that we will get in contact with them and offer our product to find a solution that works for the customers and the lender,\u201d Flosbach says.\n\nOn the other hand, customers who don\u2019t repay are addressed differently.\n\n\u201cCustomers who don\u2019t repay don\u2019t want to because they don\u2019t see the benefits of repaying. Hence, they need financial literacy,\u201d Flosbach adds.\n\nBefore such customers start servicing a loan again, the startup gives them some financial education like understanding the importance of loan repayment and credit score.\n\n\u201cWe try as much to incentivise these customers to cooperate with us. For example, we offer them a discount on their loan repayments. After offering them the incentives, we do our financial literacy classes,\u201d says Flosbach.\n\nMeanwhile, they are currently testing these classes through their self-service platform to see how effective they would be on debt customers.\n\n\u201cWe do not use an app for our self-servicing platform, but a webview, which works like a webpage,\u201d he discloses.\n\nWhile they reach out to the debtors, the co-founders believe that in an ethical credit collection, not everyone would repay.\n\nAt the moment, Flosbach claims there is no other fintech startup offering the same service as BFREE on the continent.\n\n\u201cThere is no similar innovation in Africa in our space of the lending value chain. This part has been overlooked for quite a while, and our competition mainly consists of BPO companies.\u201d\n\nHowever, the team believes that with time, competition for innovation in credit collections in Africa would increase.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d welcome this step as it is always better for the end-customers if options are competing for the best customer value,\u201d Flosbach declares.\n\nA sustainable model\n\nOn how BFREE makes money, Flosbach explains, \u201cWe charge a certain percentage commission of the repayments that a lender receives. This commission depends on the lender\u2019s portfolio size, portfolio quality, and likes.\u201d\n\nAnd how sustainable is that?\n\n\u201cIt is sustainable. We have very solid unit economics as our solutions work very well, and we usually achieve at least 30% higher repayments than the BPO companies,\u201d he continues.\n\nThough the credit fintech startup operates a B2B2C model, with currently over 300,000 customers, it has its challenges.\n\n\u201cOne of our challenges is to convince lenders that there is a better way to do collection than how they\u2019ve been doing it,\u201d he says.\n\nFrom Nigeria to Africa\n\nThe Lagos-based credit startup recently raised an $800,000 pre-seed round to build a solution for all emerging markets struggling with infrastructure for collection in Africa. Nigeria-based Beta.Ventures, Launch Africa Ventures, and GreenHouse Capital led the round.\n\n\u201cWe focus all of our product development to assist customers in a state of financial emergency. There are millions of customers in personal debt. This is really what motivates us as a team,\u201d Nmor declares.\n\nThe team is bullish about the Kenyan market they are expanding into.\n\n\u201cWe have a team on the ground already that is setting up our solution as we speak,\u201d Flosbach reveals.\n\nIn the Kenyan market, there have been several cases where BPO companies threatened or publicly shamed customers, something Flosbach considers inappropriate for lenders.\n\nWhile debt consumers may default on a payment due to unforeseen circumstances, the high interest on payment is also a factor.\n\nRecall that in digital predatory lending in Nigeria, we highlighted how the interest rate upon repayment is one reason debt consumers don\u2019t repay promptly.\n\nIn Kenya, where scores of apps offering short-term advances similar to payday loans are common, the interest rate upon repayment is also a problem.\n\nThe credit fintech startup offers a personal budgeting service to debt consumers to help them spend within their means and repay their loans with interest promptly.\n\nThrough its consumer personal budgeting processes, algorithms, and financial literacy, BFREE believes it will tackle Africa\u2019s rising consumer debt.\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "Google-owned video-sharing platform, YouTube, released an update to its terms of service in November 2020. While it immediately took effect for users in the US, users outside the US will begin to experience the change from June 1, 2021.\n\nThe update revealed that taxes will now be levied on the royalties of content creators resident in the US, who are already entitled to payments on the platform. This will soon take place in other countries as the new terms of service are rolled out.\n\nThe platform revisited its data privacy policy and warned strongly that it would not permit the collection of any information, facial recognition data inclusive, that might be used to identify a user without their permission.\n\nYouTube also emphasised its right to monetise all content on the platform as it announced that ads might appear on channels not in the YouTube Partner Program (YPP), and the YouTubers who own these channels will not get a revenue cut.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat this means is that as a content creator on YouTube who isn\u2019t a partner on YPP, ads \u2014 which YouTube says you\u2019re not entitled to get payments for \u2014 might now appear during your videos.\n\nThe YPP was launched in December 2007 as a means of revenue generation for creators, who allow ads to appear on their videos for an amount of money. Members of the YPP have to meet certain criteria, including having up to 1,000 active subscribers and 4,000 valid watch hours in the last 12 months.\n\nAnd what\u2019re the implications of this?\n\nThe new policy puts some creators on the platform at a disadvantage, especially those still looking to grow their channels.\n\nRejoice Ambrose, a growing YouTuber running a lifestyle channel, thinks this may be detrimental to her growth.\n\n\u201cI do not think it\u2019s fair. I mean, ads can be so annoying; talk less for those of us who are still trying to grow our channel. How are we going to maintain viewers when they have to endure ads appearing on our videos, and we won\u2019t even get paid for them? But then, it\u2019s their platform; I don\u2019t think we can really do anything about it,\u201d she tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nIn YouTube\u2019s defence, more ads are a part of the company\u2019s investment in solutions that help advertisers reach a larger audience and scale their businesses.\n\nWe previously explored why some Nigerian YouTubers have to look outside the platform to get revenue for reasons like low content engagements because most of their viewers face the issue of low broadband access.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith these new updates, one can only wonder what the fate of budding and professional Africa-based YouTubers will be, as a large chunk of their audience is in demographics with low access to stable Internet data.\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nMay 26: New Episode! Listen to Built in Africa\n\nAn ardent learner. I try to be eternally evolving. It\u2019s hard, but someone\u2019s got to do it.\n\nComments",

          "text": "The move by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) last Tuesday that saw the regulator adopt the NAFEX rate of N410.25 per US dollar on its website received accolades from many industry players as they tagged it a \u2018major step\u2019 towards full exchange rate unification.\n\nBut, analysts say though commendable, it is nothing more than recognising what was due for recognition as more than 90 percent of economic transactions were already using the rate long before it was updated on Tuesday.\n\nThe government had since March adopted the Investors and Exporters (I&E) window rate (also known as the NAFEX rate) for government transactions, the CBN retained the old N379 per dollar official rate on its website, which created some confusion for investors.\n\nThe CBN pulled down the rate two weeks ago and followed that action up by officially adopting the I&E window rate on its website where the naira is quoted at a weaker rate of N410.25 per dollar.\n\nIssues around liquidity and restriction on dollar deposits and usage are bigger challenges to full unification than merely recognising an overdue update on the CBN website, analysts say.\n\n\u201cI would not expect any significant impact on the economy,\u201d Ayorinde Akinloye, investment research analyst at United Capital, states.\n\nRead Also: BDCs tell public to patronize CBN-licenced operators\n\nNigeria, unlike it African peers, has continued to operate multiple exchange rate windows. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Presidential Economic Advisory Council hold the view that ditching the multiple exchange rates practice, which Nigeria started in 2016 in reaction to lower oil prices, will open up the economy to badly-needed investments.\n\nA Lagos-based economist believes the efforts at regulation of use only create artificial scarcity and ultimately keeps driving the rate down against the dollar.\n\n\u201cInstead of a gradual merge, liberalise the market \u2013 allow cash dollars paid into domiciliary accounts for payments and transfers. In no more than six months all the noise and speculation will disappear,\u201d an analyst, who pleaded anonymity, says.\n\nAccording to him, if the market is liberalised the naira will settle at its true value, which is higher than the current NAFEX rate.\n\nThe gap between the CBN official exchange rate and the parallel market, the rate at which most Nigerians access the dollar, deepened last Wednesday following the speculation from the recent move by the apex bank.\n\nNaira fell in the parallel market to its lowest level in five months at N493 per dollar on Wednesday, the weakest since November 30, 2020, when the currency depreciated to N510/$.\n\nData collated from the black market implies a gap of N83 between the now official NAFEX rate and the parallel market rate.\n\n\u201cThere is so much cash dollars in the economy but people cannot use it except for no more than $5,000. Even that with so many restrictions,\u201d another analyst who asked not to be quoted, says.\n\nAs part of its efforts to curtail demand for forex and reduce the utilisation of the banking system to facilitate black market dealing in forex, the apex bank, in a guideline issued last year reduced the amount of cash dollar deposit in domiciliary accounts by 50 percent from $10,000 to $5,000 monthly.\n\nBut despite its effort to curtail the demand for the dollar, the policy by the apex bank has failed to yield results as the value of the naira has continued to depreciate. The CBN devalued the currency on two occasions last year.\n\nThe naira at the CBN\u2019s FX window has depreciated by an average of 7.7 percent annually in the last 10 years, according to Ayodeji Ebo, head, retail investment, Chapel Hill Denham.\n\nThe continuous devaluation of the naira is a key concern for both local and foreign investors who are looking to preserve the purchasing power of their savings and investments. Foreign investors have had their money trapped in Nigeria\u2019s debt market since March 2020 amid dollar shortage.\n\nDollar supply challenges in Nigeria come from its dependency on the foreign earnings from crude oil, which has continued to account for over 90 percent of the export of Africa\u2019s largest economy. Although on the rise, the falling global crude price always reduces FX supply in Nigeria and affects the exchange rate like in 2016 and 2020.\n\n\u201cTo have stable currency Nigeria must diversify the sources of its FX supply,\u201d Ebo states.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Government has expressed concern over 16,100 Nigerians killed annually by tobacco, calling for urgent measures and partnerships among relevant stakeholders to check its consumption and reduce the health and other risks associated with tobacco use.\n\nPermanent Secretary, Edo State Ministry of Health, Dr. Osamwonyi Irowa said this while briefing journalists in Benin City in commemoration of the World No Tobacco Day, marked by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other organs to raise awareness and check the consumption of tobacco.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe WHO reports that tobacco kills over 8 million people each year and more than 7 million of these deaths are as a result of direct tobacco use, while around 1.2 million are the result of non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke.\n\n\u201cThe Tobacco Atlas 2018 report for Nigeria, estimates more than 16,100 annual deaths from tobacco-related diseases. Also, a research published in 2021 by the Centre for the Study of the Economics of Africa showed that 29,472 deaths were attributable to smoking. It is also pertinent to note that tobacco is the major risk factor for Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) and is associated with higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 outcomes and death.\u201d\n\nIrowa said the theme for this year\u2019s celebration, \u2018Commit to Quit\u2019 is apt as WHO has set a target of supporting at least 100 million people worldwide in their attempt to quit the use of tobacco by adopting various initiatives such as digital solutions.\n\nIrowa said the Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki has keyed into the concept of supporting people in the State in quitting tobacco as WHO\u2019s findings have shown that many tobacco users are willing to quit the habit and therefore need support.\n\nHe noted: \u201cThe State Government is ever committed to support the Federal Ministry of Health with the WHO on the roll out of Nigeria Tobacco Control Communication Plan, the toll-free line for tobacco cessation in Nigeria and the WhatsApp cessation service, which will be launched by the Honourable Minister of Health today in Abuja.\n\n\u201cToday as we observe World No Tobacco Day, I call on people of all ages, especially the young, to join the fight against the tobacco epidemic. I encourage youth groups to build a movement for a tobacco free generation.\n\n\u201cI urge our celebrities and influencers to join their voices on tobacco cessation; I call on parents, caregivers and teachers to educate children on the harmful effects of tobacco products and the need to stop for those already using it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that the Government of Edo State will continue to implement comprehensive tobacco policies as outlined in the National and WHO framework convention on Tobacco control to help reduce the morbidity and mortality from tobacco use,\u201d he added.\n\n...",

          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), has given a notice to the Federation Account and Allocation Committee (FAAC) that it will deduct about N126 billion from its remittance to the Federation Account at the next meeting scheduled for June, amid rising subsidy payments.\n\nIn a report signed by NNPC\u2019s Bello Abdullahi, on behalf of the Chief Financial Officer, the corporation stated that subsequently, it will begin the subtraction of the balance of an additional N50 billion, being Joint Venture (JV) cost recovery to sustain crude oil production level.\n\nIn the document which detailed the status of the corporation\u2019s finances during its monthly FAAC meeting, which took place between May 19 and 20, the NNPC also confirmed that it did not make any remittance to the Federation Account during the period.\n\nThe development may further throw the three tiers of government, federal, states and local governments, into harsher times next month as they may get less from the Federation Account, as a result of the huge payment the NNPC is paying for subsidy on petrol, ThisDay reported.\n\nIn April, the corporation had notified the Accountant-General of the Federation (AGF), Mr. Ahmed Idris, that it would not be able to remit any funds to the Federation Account in April for distribution in May.\n\nNNPC said it posted a value shortfall of N111.966 billion in February 2021, which would ultimately impact on its ability to contribute to the joint account shared among the federal, state and local governments.\n\nThe corporation attributed the N111.966 billion shortfall to the rising average landing cost of petrol, which jumped to N184 per litre in March as opposed to the existing N128 ex-coastal price.\n\nAccording to the corporation, the N111.966 billion incurred as landing cost would be deducted from April oil and gas proceeds due to the federation in May.\n\nHowever, it was learnt that the impact on the federation was not as far-reaching as expected because the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), which collects royalties and bonuses on behalf of the federal government, came to the rescue with the remittance of about $500 million it received from the marginal fields it recently put up for bids.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, had confirmed the role played by DPR in augmenting the FAAC allocation for April, which was shared in May.\n\nThe minister, however, did not disclose how much was paid into the account.\n\nBut the NNPC had in a reaction to the dust raised by the letter to the accountant general, stated that the corporation wasn\u2019t broke, adding that the zero revenue projection only had to do with the federation revenue stream, which it manages and not a general reflection of its overall financial performance.\n\nIn the fresh notice raised by the corporation to deduct N126 billion from its remittance in June, it said it was still shouldering the burden of the differentials from the sale of petrol, which it prefers to call \u201cunder-recovery\u201d.\n\nThe FAAC document added: \u201cNo remittance to Federation Account in April, 2021 (May, 2021 FAAC) due to recorded value shortfall resulting from difference between landing cost and ex-coastal price of PMS (petrol) recorded in March, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe sum of N61,966,456,903.74 was deducted out of the total March value shortfall of N111,966,456,903.74. This is to make funds available for JV cost recovery to sustain the existing production level. The balance $50,000,000,000.00 will be deducted in subsequent months.\n\n\u201cIn addition, April value shortfall of N126,298,457,944.36 is to be deducted from May federation proceeds in June 2021 FAAC meeting.\u201d\n\nThe figures further showed that while a net revenue of N90.8 billion was remitted to FAAC in January, N64.1 billion was remitted in February, N41.1 billion was presented in March and zero amount recorded for April.\n\nMeanwhile, the corporation has said that it sold total oil and gas valued at $565.4 million or an equivalent of N214.5 billion in April, according to the document.\n\nNNPC stated that its overall crude oil lifting for both export and domestic in March 2021, recorded 29 per cent decrease relative to the 10.79Mbbls lifted in February 2021.\n\nThe national oil company said Nigeria maintained 1.52 million bpd OPEC production cut in the first quarter of 2021, while export crude oil revenue received in April amounted to $1.89 million, equivalent to N723 million.\n\n\u201cThis represents a 98 per cent decrease compared to March 2021. Domestic gas receipts in the month was N5.13bn,\u201d it added.\n\nIt stated that feedstock valued at $54.6 million was sold to Nigeria LNG during the period out of which $52.4 million was received during the month, with the difference being Modified Carry Agreement (MCA) obligations, gas reconciliation and credit notes.\n\nMCA is a financing agreement whereby the International Oil Companies (IOCs) advance loans to NNPC to invest in upstream projects.\n\nFor other receipts, the corporation stated that $1.25 million, being miscellaneous receipts, gas and ullage fees and interest income was received in April 2021.\n\nThe data also showed that the exchange rate the CBN sold foreign exchange to the NNPC moved from N379 to N383.47, while N15 billion was spent on government priority projects.\n\nIn the same month, the corporation lost 3.1 million barrels for various reasons, ranging from shut-ins due to repairs, industrial actions, flow line leaks and power failure.\n\nOn the analysis of receipts due in April, gross revenue from JV crude was N124.3 billion, JV gas was N26.1 billion, while N5.8 billion was received from miscellaneous sources, amounting to N156.3 billion.\n\nAfter deduction of royalty, JV cost recovery, profit before tax and taxes, receipts from JV crude came down to N5.5 billion, while that of JV gas stood at N7.8 billion.\n\nOf the March domestic crude oil payable in June by the NNPC, in line with the 90-day payment plan, Chevron Nigeria Limited has roughly 2.89 million barrels valued at N72.6 billion while Eroton\u2019s share is 130,000 barrels valued at N3.1 billion.\n\nAlso, Mobil Producing has 2.84 million litres, valued at N68 billion, Seplat\u2019s is N3.36 billion, SPDC\u2019s share of the JV is N33.6 billion while the value of Total\u2019s crude oil payable in June is N3.1 billion, totalling approximately N184.5 billion or equivalent of $487 million.\n\nAs of March 31, total pre-2016 JV cash call arrears repayment status indicated that JV negotiated debt remained at $4.68 billion, total payment till date is $3.1 billion, while outstanding balance is $1.54 billion, with the exception of Mobil which has been fully paid by the NNPC.\n\nIn April, N938.9 million was spent on security and maintenance, while strategic holdings of the NNPC gulped N740 million, amounting to N1.679 billion.\n\nIn all, 37 vessels imported petrol for the month under review, with landing cost ranging from between N169 and N199.90. Also, a total of N1.48 billion litres were imported for the month, 1.99 billion litres were sold, with depot price remaining at N128 and the recorded loss put at N111.9 billion.\n\nNNPC: Negotiations Ongoing to Acquire Stake in Dangote Refinery,\n\nThe Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Malam Mele Kyari, yesterday clarified that the plan by the corporation to purchase 20 per cent minority stake in Dangote has not been concluded.\n\nKyari, in a text message in response to enquiries by THISDAY on the matter, said the terms of the agreement were being finalised and could be subject of non-disclosure understandings.\n\nHe added that the NNPC is interested in acquiring a stake in any private refinery with a capacity in excess of 50,000 barrels per day and not just the Dangote Refinery alone.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the Dangote Refinery acquisition, it\u2019s actually an ongoing negotiations that was disclosed by one of our executives. We haven\u2019t concluded; terms are being finalised and may be subject of non-disclosure understandings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to discuss the details at this point. However, the decision is for NNPC to expand her portfolio as is the common practice amongst national oil companies as matter of energy security considerations and risk management. We will take equity from any refinery that plans to process in excess of 50,000 barrels per day, not just the Dangote.\u201d\n\nThe 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) integrated Dangote Refinery, expected to process a variety of light and medium grades of crude, including petrol and diesel as well as jet fuel and polypropylene, is owned by Nigeria\u2019s Dangote Group and is worth about $15 billion.\n\nIt is designed to produce about 50 million litres of petrol and 15 million litres of diesel a day, roughly 10.4 million tonnes of the product, 4.6 million tonnes of diesel, and four million tonnes of jet fuel per year, in addition to having a fertiliser plant, which will utilise the refinery by-products as raw materials.\n\nParts of this report is credit to ThisDay",

          "text": "It is my singular honour to perform this unpleasant duty of paying tribute to my young, pretty and precocious niece Dr. Chinyere Ofure Aneziokoro who died in the United States on May 31, 2006 from breast cancer at the unripe age of 40 years. I wish to thank her parents, Emeritus Professor of medicine, Anezi Okoro and Dr. (Mrs) Ese Aneziokoro who initiated, very wisely, the idea of establishing a foundation, the Dr. Chinyere Ofure Aneziokoro Foundation at the College of Medicine, University of Benin in her memory. I also wish to thank the authorities of the University of Benin for granting the request and graciously setting the stage for bringing this idea to fruition. Chinyere was born on April 17, 1966, three months after the turbulent coup of January 15, 1966 in which some important Nigerian leaders were killed. She had her secondary school at the Federal Government Girls College, Abuloma, Port Harcourt and her university education at the Bendel State University Ekpoma, Bendel State. She then proceeded to the University of Nigeria\u2019s College of Medicine in Enugu where she got her degrees in medicine in 1988. She had further studies in Infectious Diseases and Internal Medicine in the UK and United States and practised her craft meritoriously in both countries. At the time of her death she was an Attending Physician at the Infectious Diseases Section, Department of Medicine, Loyola University Medical Centre in Maywood, Illinois, USA. She was also a leading expert and fellow in infectious diseases who was respected throughout the United States. At the time of her death she had become a member of the Nigerian Medical Association, Medical Women\u2019s Association of Nigeria, British Medical Association, Infectious Diseases Society of America, American College of Physicians, Glasgow Medical Society, UK and the American Medical Association.\n\nShe got married to Dr. Chukwueka N. Ikedionwu on July 16, 1994 and they are blessed with two children, Nnadubem Chigozie and Chizelum Nneoma.\n\nWhile Chinyere was growing up we in my family admired her brilliance and her dedication to her studies and we wondered what she would choose to be in life. But we knew that with her early signs of being a child prodigy and with her early dedication to her studies she would be eminently successful in whatever she would choose to do. When she chose Medicine our joy knew no bounds. Medicine is an interventionist course between life and death. As a famous American writer Mencken once said \u201cone of the chief objects of Medicine is to save us from the natural consequences of our vices and follies.\u201d It does save us sometimes; sometimes it doesn\u2019t because Medicine\u2019s success comes from the doctor\u2019s knowledge, the patient\u2019s obedience and God\u2019s intervention. The relationship between a doctor and a patient is intriguing: The doctor asks the patient what is wrong with him (patient). The patient tells him (doctor) what he thinks is wrong. After that the patient also asks the doctor what then could actually be wrong with him (patient). It is then the doctor\u2019s duty to piece together the information he gathers from the patient and factor it into his diagnosis and treatment. So the doctor serves as the middle man, the intermediary, the problem solver between the patient and death. If his prescription is right the patient survives. If it is wrong the patient may die. So death and Medicine are in a long drawn mortal battle for survival. When Medicine fails, death wins. When Medicine succeeds death loses; it retreats but that retreat is very temporary, some kind of pyrrhic victory for the patient for no victory over death is ever permanent because death is the boss. So when my niece chose Medicine I knew she chose mercy; I knew she chose humaneness; I knew she chose humanity. I knew that we had a doctor in the house and that we would not have to go to the petty medicine seller for treatment or to indulge in self-medication. We knew that we would be saved from sickness worries because when people are sick they hang their hopes on the expertise of the doctor and if you have a doctor in the house, as we did, your confidence was boosted tremendously. But we didn\u2019t avert our mind to the fact that a doctor is as human as the non-doctor, that a doctor can be sick, that a doctor may fail to get a cure for his sickness, that a doctor can die. The reality dawned on us when our niece had breast cancer and she could not cure herself and could not be cured by other doctors. She died. It dawned on us that all persons, doctors and non-doctors, are equal in the presence of death. Chinyere, an expert in infectious diseases died 14 years before the arrival of covid-19 in the world. If she had lived longer she would have been one of the frontline soldiers battling to kill the spread of the virus which has ravaged the world and changed the way we work and live. It is sad that she did not live long enough to put her expertise at the feet of the world at a crucial time such as this. But we take consolation, call it cold comfort, that she lived a very fulfilling and fruitful life in the short time that she lived and made those that she loved and those that she didn\u2019t even know the centre of her gravity the subject of her exertions and the beneficiaries of her love. We can comfort ourselves by saying that since Chinyere still lives in the hearts of those who love her, she is not dead. She is not dead because she is not forgotten.\n\nKen-Calebs Olumese, founder of NiteShift Coliseum, is an uncle to Dr. Chinyere Aneziokoro\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

I used to feel very bad, go into my room, and cry. But one day I found out that each time I get a hit on social media, somebody new knows me somewhere.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re either buying a property or trying to book an apartment with my firm.\u201d\n\nUbi who has four children with four women also said; \u201cI can\u2019t change these things. These are my kids. Am I doing the fatherhood duty well? Yes. So I always just turn the negative to positive.\u201d\n\nFranklin added that he is involved in many things \u201cto make sure my kids have a better life\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cSome of my kids don\u2019t live in Nigeria. You\u2019re spending forex. I can\u2019t remember the last time I went to a club.\n\n\u201cFor me, spending had to reduce. I want to leave something in my kids and for them. I\u2019m not in for that thing where people say, \u2018I\u2019m not going to leave everything for my kids'\u201d.\n\n\u201cListen, they have to start from somewhere.

He was playing with it and I took it from him. You know, when I travel to London, I have these coins I keep somewhere. He was playing with it and swallowed it.\n\n\u201cI was just looking at him. What do I do? Do I spank this boy because his mum already said I\u2019m not always hard on him? I didn\u2019t want him to refuse when he\u2019s asked to go to daddy\u2019s house subsequently. For me, that was scary.\n\n\u201cSo whenever he has a cut, some men will say I\u2019m not taking care of the boy but that\u2019s not it. These kids are fast in doing things. For me, I respect that they\u2019re with their mothers longer.

          "text": "Barely 24 hours after 200 school children were abducted by bandits in Niger, gunmen again attacked another community killing 15 villagers in Beri town in Bobi district of Mariga local government of the state Monday morning.\n\nIt was learnt that one mobile policeman was also killed by the bandits during the attack.\n\nIt was however gathered that the local vigilantes were able to kill 5 of the bandits in a gun duel.\n\nAn eye witness account recounted thus: \u201cThe Beri Police Station was burnt by the bandits with several people reported to have been injured during the stampede that accompanied the arson on the police station.\u201d\n\nAnd while the attack was on, another group of bandits were reported to have stormed yet another village, Garin-Gabas of the same local government of the state but were successfully repelled by the youths.\n\nAlso this Monday, some bandits reportedly raided Ungwan Bako in the Kotonkoro district of Mariga local government, abducting many people, mostly women and children.\n\nHowever, casualty figures and number of people kidnapped in these two other incidents could not be ascertained as at the time of writing this report\n\nThe Niger State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA) confirmed the incidents but did not give details.\n\nPolice Public Relations Officer of the state Police Command, DSP Wasiu Abiodun, did not respond to calls made to his cell phones for comments on the developments.\n\nGov Bello jets out for solution\n\nTo address the lingering banditry in the state, Governor Sani Bello \u2013 a few hours after the kidnap of about 200 students from Saliu Tanko Islamic School on Sunday \u2013 left Nigeria in search of solution.\n\nThe governor\u2019s media aide, Mary Noel-Berje said: \u201cThe governor, who had left the country to explore all possibilities of strengthening the state\u2019s security architecture before the incident happened, is expected back soon.\u201d\n\nShe further stated that the governor had given directives to the security operatives and state government officials to do all they can towards ensuring the safe return of the abducted Tegina Islamiyya children and others.\n\n\u201cThe governor is expected back in the country within the shortest period of time and has assured the rescue and safe return of the children.\n\n\u201cGovernor Sani Bello also assured all Nigerlites that the government will continue to do all it can to protect the lives and property of its citizens while guaranteeing the continued peace and stability of the state.\n\n\u201cWhile assuring the parents of the abducted children of their safe return as the security agencies have been directed to do all it can to bring back the children as soon as possible, the governor also urged the citizens to cooperate and share intelligence and information that will help in the quick rescue of the children,\u201d Berje further said.\n\nHow the bandits abducted the school children\n\nThe bandits reportedly seized the police station in the town and went round the town shooting sporadically into the air to scare residents before breaking into a private school where they abducted children attending Islamic lectures.\n\nThe school, which consists of nursery and primary schools, also hosts Islamiyya students in the evening and at weekends.\n\nThe mass abduction of the Islamic school students was the second in Rafi local government area in six months.\n\nDozens of students were earlier in the year kidnapped at Government Science College (GSC) Kagara but were later released after negotiation with the state government.\n\nAsides from the attack on schools, several residents across different local government areas of the state have been displaced after the invasion of bandits.\n\nDeath toll rises in Ebonyi\n\nIn a related development, the death toll in the three communities of Ebonyi -Benue borders attacked by suspected herders had risen to 42.\n\nThe suspected armed herders had Saturday morning invaded Odoke Ishieke, Obakota Ishieke and Ndiobasi Ishieke communities all in Ebonyi local government area of Ebonyi state and killed over 30 persons not leaving behind pregnant women and nursing mothers.\n\nThe communities has common boundaries with Ardo local government area of Benue state and since the invasion, security agents have been recovering dead bodies from bushes in the affected areas.\n\nA resident of one of the area who simply gave his name as Nwegede told Blueprint that 31 bodies were recovered in Ndiobasi Ishieke, 6 in Odoke Ishieke and 15 bodies in Obakota Ishieke.\n\nHe said: \u201cHerdsmen butchered Izzi people like this at Nwori Ndiobashi side. Most of the victims are at Sudan Hospital Onuenyimu right now battling machetes and gunshot injuries.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, many victims of the attack are still receiving treatment at the Federal University Teaching Hospital Abakaliki 2 (FETHA2) and AMURT-a health centre close to the scene of the incidents.\n\nA stakeholder from the affected communities and Commissioner for Capital City Development, Chief Onyekachi Nwebonyi said over 30 bodies were evcuated from bushes around the affected communities while soldiers were still recovering more bodies.\n\n\u201cIt is a very unfortunate situation. We got a very sad news yesterday morning that armed herdsmen invaded Izzi land particularly in a place called Ndiobashi and killed so many of our people. We quickly alerted the security agencies to come to their aid but unfortunately, the Benue state government who claimed ownership of the area could not respond positively.\n\n\u201cBut we commend the Governor of Ebonyi state who upon hearing the incident, swung into action even though the land is in dispute and sent the security agencies to repel the attacks. As I speak to you, over 30 bodies have been evacuated and as I talk, the soldiers are still evacuating more dead bodies in the bush.\n\n\u201cI visited there yesterday and the victims narrated their ordeals but of a truth, the area is in disarray. People are panicking but we have been able to encourage them to complement the efforts of the security agencies to beef up security in the area so that the ugly incident doesn\u2019t reoccur,\u201d he said.\n\nOne killed in Gombe\n\nSimilarly, the Gombe state government has confirmed the attack that left one dead and over 50 houses burnt in parts of Shongom and Filiya District in Shongom local government area of the state.\n\nAddressing newsmen Monday shortly after an emergency security meeting by the State Security Council, the state Commissioner of Information, Mr Julius Ishaya, confirmed the attack and assured the council was working to restore peace in the affected area.\n\nWhile noting the extent of damage by the attackers, the commissioner said, \u201cbased on security report, over 50 houses were burnt, including food and other essential items of the people.\u201d\n\nThe commissioner revealed that while condemning the carnage, the council called for the immediate engagement of stakeholders from the affected area under the chairmanship of the paramount ruler of the Kaltungo chiefdom, Alhaji Sale Muhammad to find solution and restore peace to the area.\n\n\u201cThe council reiterated that the banning of militia or hunter groups still stands. The security agents have been alerted on that, so anybody who behaves like a militia or a hunter will be handled appropriately by the security agents\u201d.\n\nOn his part, the state\u2019s Commissioner of Internal Security and Ethical Orientation, Adamu Dishi Kupto, directed security agencies in the state to investigate the attack and ensure perpetrators were brought to justice.\n\nWhile urging residents in Gombe to break off from the act of taking laws into their hands Mr Kupto said: \u201cGod has created us to be and live together so we don\u2019t have to question him on why are we are living together despite our differences.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Mai of Kaltungo, Engr. Sale Muhammad, assured that the chiefdom would continue to sensitise its people to embrace and live peacefully with one another.\n\nI fear for Nigeria \u2013 Cleric\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Vicar General of the Catholic Archdiocese of Lagos, Rt. Rev. Msgr. John Asuquo Aniagwu has expressed worry over the wanton destruction of lives and properties in different parts of Nigeria.\n\nHe urged the federal government to urgently address the various agitations across the country in order to save the country from being plunged into a civil war.\n\n\n\nThe Catholic priest said the palpable apprehensions in the different parts of the country were dangerous signal to its political, social and economic stability.\n\n\n\nMsgr Aniagwu, who is the Parish Priest of St. Leo\u2019s Catholic Church, Ikeja, Lagos, told journalists that the National Assembly needed not to embark on consultations across the geopolitical zones for inputs on a new constitution, describing it as an exercise in futility.\n\n\n\nThe Vicar General said: \u201cI feel apprehension, I don\u2019t know where we are going and I fear that the worst may happen still with those who should do something fails to do what we should do. Every day, we see agitation here and there and one doesn\u2019t know where the next bad news is going to come from? Every day we are hearing of killing here and there, initially it was in the north east, we were all concerned, praying for them there, the crisis moved to the North West and now it is all over the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo I have great apprehension and fear about what may befall this nation and I am praying that the worst should not happen because the way it is going, it tell me that there will be escalation of all types of tension in the country, the violence in the different parts of the country simultaneously does not speak well for the country.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said the federal government should visit reports of the constitution conferences of 2005 and 2014 and implement parts of the recommendations in the two documents as part of solutions to address the current unrest.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are so many voices clamouring for change in this country. In 2005, President Obasanjo convoked a national conference in Abuja, I was a delegate to that conference, we spent 5 months in Abuja during the conference, we produced copious reports and some of the things they are talking about now, restructuring, dissolution of power, a new constitution, reform of the electoral processes, and we discussed all those things.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly at that time said we have no locus standi and our reports were never looked at, it\u2019s there gathering dusk wherever it is.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn 2014, there was another conference by the Jonathan administration that came out with far reaching recommendations which the government of the day again refused to take onboard. So it is not as if people are not talking but of course the ruling government has to at least agree to look at these things on their merit. Whatever is good take it, whatever is not good put it aside but to completely rubbish it and said we don\u2019t want to see it I think is the act of arrogance as if they have the monopoly of wisdom.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "A two-day zonal public hearing of the Senate on the review of the 1999 Constitution on Thursday ended with stakeholders from the North-East demanding the creation of additional states, 25 per cent derivation, gender equality, free and compulsory education, among others.\n\nThe exercise was organised by the Senate in 12 centres across the country to collate the views of Nigerians on the key areas to be amended in the 1999 Constitution in order to address agitations in the country.\n\nIn Bauchi centre, the people of Southern Borno comprising nine local government areas on Thursday disagreed with the position of the Borno State government and insisted on the creation of Savannah State.\n\nAddressing newsmen shortly after presenting their memorandum, a representative of the movement for the creation of Savannah State and former Secretary to Borno State government, Ambassador Dauda Danladi said the southern part of the state is being marginalised, hence the need for the new state.\n\nThe speaker of Borno State House Assembly, Abdulkarim Lawan had on Wednesday kicked against the creation of an additional state from Borno, which was demanded by the stakeholders in September last year in a letter to the Senate.\n\nIn the document, the group said the move was necessary as Borno is the largest in the country in terms of landmass to enhance self-determination, compatibility, equitable and even development, and responsive governance.\n\nWith the proposed capital in Damboa, they further said it will comprise nine LGAs in Southern Borno Senatorial District \u2013 Askira/Uba, Bayo, Biu, Chibok, Damboa, Gwoza, Hawul, Kwaya-Kusar and Shani.\n\n\u201cWe the people of Askira/Uba, Bayo, Biu, Chibok, Damboa, Gwoza, Hawul, Kwaya-Kusar and Shani Local Government Areas of Borno State wish to present our request for the creation of Savannah State out of the present Borno State.\n\n\u201cWe had before now presented requests for the creation of this proposed State at various times in recent years. Between 1982, 1983 and 1996 a request was made by the people of these Local Government Areas of the former Borno State for the Creation of Savannah State to the National Assembly of the Second Republic\n\n\u201cDuring the agitation across the country in 1991 for the creation of more States, requests were made for the creation of two States out of the former Borno State, namely; Savannah and Yobe States. The request for the creation of Yobe State was granted.\n\n\u201cWe had also earlier submitted this request to the National Constitutional Conference through its Committee on the States Creation. The move to kick start the process of reviewing the 1999 constitution then, which could accommodate states and local governments creation along with necessary boundary adjustments was indeed a welcome development and we enthusiastically participated.\n\n\u201cIn 2014, we equally submitted our request to the National Conference Committee on states creation. That effort resulted in the shortlisting of SAVANNAH State as one of the fourteen (14) states recommended for creation in Nigeria. The 2014 Conference report has again clearly shown that SAVANNAH state met all necessary criteria for the creation of the state in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTo us, this present move by your humble and esteem selves to Kick-start the process of review of the 1999 Constitution which could accommodate States and Local Government Creation and necessary boundary adjustments, is indeed a welcome stride and we pray that our submission will again receive the blessing of the National Assembly. It is in this regard that we wish to respectfully submit our memorandum for the creation of SAVANNAH STATE with its proposed capital at DAMBOA.\n\n\u201cUnder and in fulfilment of the provisions of section 8(1)(a) of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, all the democratically elected members at the National, State and local government levels representing the area demanding for the creation of Savannah State, have after consideration of the long time yearnings and aspirations of the people of the proposed state, endorsed this noble request for the creation of SAVANNAH STATE.\n\n\u201cGiven the opportunities provided by the State creation to bring Government closer to the people and to foster even and rapid development, the people of the proposed Savannah State who are eager to bring about balanced and accelerated development are making this passionate appeal for your kind consideration of our request for the creation of Savannah State,\u201d the letter said.\n\nThe letter further said \u201cin making our demand for curving out Savannah State out of the present Borno State, we have been motivated by our desire to bring Government closer to our people and to accelerate rapid and even development of the sub-region as well as the need to remain united within the context of the New State and the Nation\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the creation of Savannah State out of the present BornoState will make it possible for both states to plan and provide the basis for integrated and even development and thus create more investment and employment opportunities for our people.\n\n\u201cThe proposed Savannah State is richly endowed with Solid Minerals, agricultural products, tourism potentials and human resources that can be harnessed to lay a solid foundation for the transformation of the State.\n\n\u201cIt is an incontrovertible fact that greater part of both the human and material resources of the present Borno state come from the southern part. We are confident that the resources available to the proposed savannah state can sustain it, and make it even more viable than many already established state.\u201d\n\nAmong the mineral resources listed are quartz, limestone, iron ore and magnesium.",

More importantly, I would never trivialise mental health or use the term lightly.\n\n\u201cThe truth is I have suffered long bouts of depression since the US Open in 2018 and I have had a really hard time coping with that.\n\n\u201cAnyone that knows me knows I am introverted and anyone that has seen me at tournaments will notice that I\u2019m often wearing headphones as that helps dull my social anxiety.\n\n\u201cThough the tennis press has always been kind to me (and I want to apologise to all the cool journalists who I may have hurt), I am not a natural public speaker and get huge waves of anxiety before I speak to the world\u2019s media.\n\n\u201cI get really nervous and find it stressful to always try to engage and give you the best answers I can.\n\n\u201cSo here in Paris I was already feeling vulnerable and anxious, so I thought it was better to exercise self-care and skip the press conferences. I announced it preemptively because I do feel like the rules are quite outdated in parts and I wanted to highlight that.\n\n\u201cI wrote privately to the tournament apologising and saying that I would be more than happy to speak with them after the tournament as the Slams are intense.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take some time away from the court now, but when the time is right I really want to work with the Tour to discuss ways we can make things better for the players, press and fans.\u201d\n\nThe story so far\n\nMany athletes, both in and out of tennis, applauded Osaka\u2019s stance after she announced it on Wednesday, although many said speaking to the media is \u201cpart of the job\u201d.\n\nGrand Slam rules state players can be fined up to $20,000 (\u00a314,160) for failing to meet their media obligations, with the Women\u2019s Tennis Association (WTA) saying players \u201chave a responsibility to their sport and their fans\u201d to speak to the media during competitions.\n\nFollowing her win over Tig, Osaka did take part in the usual on-court interview with the victor.\n\nLater on Sunday, organisers of the four Grand Slams released a joint statement saying Osaka could face \u201cmore substantial fines and future Grand Slam suspensions\u201d for her decision.\n\nThe Grand Slams added that following Osaka\u2019s announcement on Wednesday, Roland Garros teams had asked her to reconsider her position and were unsuccessful in their attempts to check on her wellbeing.\n\nAfter a \u201clack of engagement\u201d from Osaka, the Grand Slam organisers wrote to her to offer support, as well as to \u201cremind her of her obligations\u201d.\n\nIn response, the two-time Australian Open champion tweeted: \u201cAnger is a lack of understanding. Change makes people uncomfortable\u201d.\n\nThe following day, Osaka announced her decision to withdraw from the tournament altogether.",

Colombia was removed as co-host on May 20 as street protests against President Iv\u00e1n Duque rocked the nation.\n\nCONMEBOL said on Twitter that the tournament is confirmed to take place between June 13 and July 10. Brazil is the defending champion, winning the competition in 2019 as hosts.\n\n\u201cThe host cities and the fixtures will be confirmed by CONMEBOL within hours. The oldest international tournament in the world will make the whole continent cheer!\u201d the South American body said.\n\n\u201cCONMEBOL thanks President Jair Bolsonaro and his team, and also the Brazilian soccer confederation for opening the doors of this country for the safest sporting event in the world today. South America will shine in Brazil with all its stars,\u201d the soccer body said.\n\nMore than 460,000 people have died of COVID-19 in Brazil, with many analysts expecting another wave of the disease to hit the country by late June. Many hospitals have more than 80% of their intensive-care unit occupied by victims of the virus.\n\nBolsonaro has challenged social distancing restrictions and called for a return to normal life despite a slow vaccine rollout. His handling of the pandemic response is under investigation by a Brazilian senate inquiry.\n\nArgentina is facing a surge of coronavirus infections, with strict lockdown measures imposed last weekend amid a seven-day average of 35,000 cases and 500 deaths. More than 77,000 people have died in the country due to the disease, as the virus continues to spread.\n\nSouth American teams are already training for the tournament and two rounds of World Cup qualifiers are starting this week.\n\nLike other continental tournaments, Copa America was initially scheduled for 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced its postponement.\n\nThe 2020 version of Copa America was to introduce a new format with five teams based in each of the co-hosts, Colombia and Argentina. Group A features Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay while Group B includes Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.

          "text": "China has explained her role in the blockade of Taiwan from attending recently held World Health Assembly.\n\nA statement from the spokesman of Chinese Embassy in Nigeria, Zhang Hang said China could have unilaterally block Taiwan from attending the United Nations organized function, insisting that the decision was taking by over 80 countries.\n\nZhang said the decision was taken by allies of China across the world who believe in a United China which include Taiwan.\n\nZhang, in the statement said: \u201cI was caught by surprise to read in a local newspaper an article entitled \u201cTaiwan\u2019s exclusion from the World Health Assembly undermines global health\u201d by Her Excellency Mary Beth Leonard, U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria, indicating China wrongfully blocked Taiwan from participating at the WHA.\u201d\n\nHe said Nigerians and everyone else across the globe should be interested in what actually happened.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn May 24, The General Committee and the Plenary session of the 74th WHA respectively decided to reject the so-called proposal of \u201cinviting Taiwan to participate in the WHA as an observer\u201d submitted by certain countries. Can China succeed in doing this alone? No, actually among 194 members of World Health Organization, more than 150 countries, including Nigeria voiced their support for China, and more than 80 countries sent letters to WHO to express their commitment to the one-China principle and opposition to Taiwan\u2019s participation in the WHA.\u201d\n\nHe asked: \u201cWere all these countries wrong? Absolutely not.\u201d\n\nZhang said: \u201cWHO is an international organization only sovereign country can join. Taiwan is not a sovereign country, it is an inalienable part of China. The Resolution 2758 of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in October 1971 and the Resolution 25.1 of WHA in May 1972 had already provided the legal basis for the WHO to abide by the one-China principle, and recognized Taiwan as part of China.\u201d\n\nHe further said: \u201cOne-China principle is an international consensus and adhered by 180 countries including the U.S.A..\n\nTaiwan region\u2019s participation in the WHA must be handled in accordance with the one-China principle and through cross-strait consultations. The incumbent authorities in the Taiwan region since 2016 obstinately adhered to the separatist position of \u201cTaiwan independence\u201d and refused to recognize that both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one and the same China. As a result, the political foundation for the Taiwan region to participate in WHA has ceased to exist.\u201d\n\nZhang added that: \u201cBased on the one-China principle, the Central Government of China has made appropriate arrangements for the Taiwan region\u2019s participation in global health affairs. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the Central Government of China has sent 260 notifications on COVID-19 to Taiwan region. Health experts in Taiwan region have participated in 16 WHO technical activities.\n\n\u201cThe WHO Secretariat briefed health experts in Taiwan region several times on pandemic information. The so-called \u201cinternational epidemic prevention gap\u201d does not exist, nor do experts of Taiwan region lack channels and platforms to share response and control practices with others.\u201d\n\nHe however said as COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage globally, it is high time for responsible international community members to show solidarity, instead of politicizing health issues and interfering with other countries\u2019 internal affairs.\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja",
