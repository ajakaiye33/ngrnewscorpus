          "title": "Talks with FG panel over strike fruitless \u2013 SSANU",
          "text": "The Joint Action Committee of the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities and Non-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Associated Institutions has said no tangible achievement was recorded at the Federal Government Renegotiation Panel.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with our correspondent on Tuesday, the National Vice-President, SSANU, Dr. Abdussobur Salaam, said the panel met only once with SSANU since it was inaugurated on March 7, 2022.\n\nThe PUNCH had reported that the committee, which was chaired by the Pro-Chancellor of Alex Ekwueme Federal University Ndufu-Alike, Emeritus Prof. Nimi Briggs, was given three months to conclude the renegotiation with the four university unions and send the report to Federal Government.\n\nThe committee\u2019s timeline ended on Monday.\n\nIt is believed that the committee will submit its report to the Federal Government this week or get an extension.\n\nBut Salaam explained that the Briggs committee\u2019s engagements with SSANU had been minimal and the timeline was not being adhered to.\n\nHe said, \u201cWithin the three months timeline, SSANU has only had one meeting with the Briggs renegotiation team. The meeting was held on Friday, April 8, 2022. Today, being June 7, makes it exactly two months ago.\n\n\u201cAt the meeting, nothing tangible was put on the table. No offer was made by the government, particularly on improved conditions of service and welfare of our members.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s side seems not to be sure of itself and groping in the dark as far as its mandate is concerned.\n\n\u201cAs of now, we have no reason to express satisfaction because even the paces of the discussions have been too slow. If it has taken two months after the first meeting with SSANU and no meeting has been called, it gives room to doubt the willingness and capacity of the committee to deliver on its mandate.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that the panel be properly empowered to take decisions on behalf of the government.\n\nSalaam said, \u201cThe Committee should be properly empowered to take decisions on behalf of the government. To be breathed down upon by government officials as the engagements with the committee suggest is not good for confidence building. They should show that they have a mandate to commit on behalf of the government.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the committee appears not to take cognisance of the timelines in the discharge of its assignment. Whatever the bottlenecks militating against the timelines should be removed.\n\n\u201cIf we have only had one meeting within the three months timeline with nothing tangible being put on the table, it leaves much to be desired and it is highly unfortunate.\u201d\n\nWhen our correspondent contacted Briggs on the telephone for reactions on SSANU\u2019s complaints and other issues, he declined comment, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t react to anything on telephone.\u201d\n\nSSANU\u2019s strike started with a warning strike of two weeks which commenced on March 27, 2021, while the extension of another two weeks commenced on Sunday, April 10, 2022.\n\nThe union\u2019s demands include the inconsistent issue of the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System, unpaid earned allowances, and delay in the renegotiation of FGN, NASU, SSANU agreements, and non-payment of minimum wage arrears.\n\nOthers include neglect and poor funding of state universities, non-payment of retirement benefits to outgoing members of the unions, and usurpation of the headship of non-teaching units in clear violation of conditions of service and establishment procedures, among others.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Some property owners along Old Garage, MDS and Fakunle areas of Osogbo, Osun State capital, on Tuesday, staged a peaceful protest over non-payment of over N1bn compensation after the state government had demolished their property.\n\nThe protesters, who blocked MDS Road in the state capital while the protest lasted, wielded placards with inscriptions such as \u2018Osun govt, pay our compensation;\u2019 \u2018Oyetola, you are a man of your words, fulfil your promise;\u2019 \u2018Oyetola, pls save our souls;\u2019 amongst others.\n\nThey said the State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, promised to pay their compensation in instalments when he assumed office.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the affected property owners, the leader of the protesters, Funke Afolabi, said over 600 shops belonging to them located along Old Garage/Fakunle axis in Osogbo, were demolished by the state government in 2013 for the expansion of road.\n\nShe said, \u201cEnumeration and valuation were carried out by officials of the Ministry of Lands and Physical Planning for payment of compensation.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the compensation was not paid by the Aregbesola-led government in spite of a series of letters of reminder and visitations to him.\n\n\u201cOn assumption of office of the Governor of Osun State, Alhaji Isiaka Oyetola, in 2019, a courtesy visit was paid to him by all the affected claimants. At the meeting, the governor stated that compensation would be paid in tranches to all the claimants.\n\n\u201cIt is disturbing to note that approval has been given for compensation to be paid to a section of the claimants with the exclusion of claimants from Old Garage, MDS, Olaiya Junction and Fakunle Area. This development negates the principle of equity, justice and fairness. Over 600 shops were affected and we are being owed about N1 billion compensation, \u201cAfolabi said.\n\nShe then appealed to Oyetola to revisit the issue with a view to compensate the property owners for the losses they incurred.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

I\u2019ve lived my life to this age without needing or relying on \u201cprophecies\u201d, and it\u2019s too late now to change. My prayer is simply: \u201cLet your will be done\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo please, if you\u2019ve further \u201crevelations\u201d just pray about them or keep them to yourself.

If you have a few isolated cases of say one or two, I don\u2019t think that is unusual and one beautiful thing is that we have resolved all of them.\n\n\u201d A few unforeseen hitches here and there due to missing names and typographical errors. For example, Enugu and Edo cases have being been resolved so also of Anambra State. Since all these issues have been successful resolved, I think we are going to have a first class Primary election\u201d, he stated.\n\nGiving the form the accreditation took, the governor said delegates on entering the Civic Centre would locate their State stand, presented their valid identification and after proper identification has been done, are issued with a delegate card which has the name, State and local government and the QR code of the delegate.\n\nHe said on getting to Eagles square, venue of the primary, the delegate card is scanned to confirm its authenticity, adding that each delegate would be issued with a Voter\u2019s card together with their delegate card which would also be scanned to ensure that the holder is genuine and that he has not voted twice.\n\n\u201d Once they Scan that card, it can not be pass to someone else. All these features are embedded in the delegate card and we believe that this is probably the first time this type of process is being used and we are hopeful that we will have a world class Presidential Primary\u201d, the Governor emphasized.\n\nWhile noting that his Committee is working in collaboration with other committees, added that Accreditation Committee was to ensure that only valid delegates, observers, protocols, governors and other eligible people are allowed into the venue, maintained that a lot of work has been put into planning to ensure that delegates are attended to at a shortest possible time.\n\nThe Senator representing Lagos West, Senator Olamilekan Adeola commended the governor Abiodun led committee for doing a good job advising the delegates to vote for a candidate that would work for the betterment of the people.",

The governors have no power to reduce the number of aspirants, not even the party. According to section 84 subsection 9 to 10 of the act, it shows clearly that if one person says I am not going to withdraw, then, there is going to be an election.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned, we are ready for election, and if all the 23 people that are there are screened by the party and allowed for election, we will conduct an election.\n\n\u201cSo, the idea of pruning down or selecting a number of people that Governors do is just to reduce the number of people that we intend to support in order to reduce the tension. It is not necessary to force anybody actually to step down.\n\n\u201cThe number of people that we will be supporting has not been pruned down to three, it is still five. Sometimes you don\u2019t always get what You want. I think Mr President definitely wanted consensus in order to reduce the rancour,\u201d he said.\n\nAlready, almost all the aspirants are already at Eagle Square, venue of the exercise, including Vice President Osinbajo, the Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, his Ebonyi counterpart, Dave Umahi, Ekiti, Kayode Fayemi, former governor of Zamfara State, Sani Yarima, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, Rotimi Amaechi, among others.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Nine African startups representing 8 countries have been selected to participate in the second edition of the Norrsken Impact Accelerator, a prominent early-stage accelerator. The accelerator is one of the programmes of the Norrsken Foundation. The foundation was established in 2016 by Niklas Adalberth, co-founder of Swedish fintech unicorn Klarna, to support entrepreneurs globally in solving some of the world\u2019s biggest challenges.\n\nNorrsken Foundation has been courting Africa since it announced in 2019 the launch of its entrepreneurship hub, Norrsken House, in Kigali, Rwanda. The first outside its headquarters, Sweden, the hub also features an African-focused seed fund which has allowed it to invest in Rwandan companies, most notably Viebeg Technology and PesaChoice.\n\nLast December, it opened the hub, welcomed 250 entrepreneurs, and hopes to bring in 750 more. In the same year, it selected 11 startups from Africa to join the inaugural edition of the Norrsken Impact Accelerator.\n\nOf the 20 startups around the world that were chosen for the accelerator, the 9 are African companies are Nigerian digital primary health startup, Clafiya and clean tech startup, SunFi; Mozambican mobility platform Appload; Ugandan lending platform Emata; Tanzanian payment solution Umoja Labs; Rwandan artisan recruitment service Fixa; Ghanaian BNPL platform Motito; South African health network HealthDart; Kenyan savings and investment service Power Financial Wellness. All 20 companies address issues in mental health, poverty, sustainable agriculture, financial inclusion, or green energy.\n\nThe budding businesses will undergo an 8-week growth sprint at Norrsken House in Stockholm; receive mentorship from a roster of over 110 entrepreneurs, investors and unicorn founders; and be given $125,000 in upfront pre-seed or seed investment from the Norrsken Foundation.\n\n\u201cOur accelerator brings together over one hundred extraordinary individuals who channel their knowledge, experience and network to pave the way for early-stage, up-and-coming impact tech startups,\u201d said Funda Sezgi, Norrsken Impact Accelerator managing director and co-founder. \u201cWe only want to work with companies that are solving real, urgent and important problems\u2014problems that matter. We believe that all of the companies in our 2022 cohort are doing exactly this, and we\u2019re so excited to be part of their growth journeys from here!\u201d\n\nSince the inception of the accelerator, participating startups have collectively gone on to raise $24 million in pre-seed and seed funds from investors like Brilliant Minds co-founder Ash Pournori, Kry co-founder Fredrik Jung-Abbou, P\u00e4r Norberg of Nordic Capital, Capital T, Globivest, and Norrsken Foundation.\n\nEarlier this year, we wrote about the Norrsken Foundation\u2019s Norrsken22 Africa Tech Growth Fund, a $200 million fund backed and managed by 30 unicorn founders to help African entrepreneurs build the next generation of tech giants.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Mara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, has appointed Susan Younis as its Chief Marketing Officer (CMO).\n\nIn a statement, the company said Younis will oversee \u201cend-to-end brand awareness, guide the marketing teams to develop strategy and lead Mara into becoming a digital finance and crypto market leader across Africa.\u201d\n\nYounis joins Mara from a similar role at Platoon, Apple\u2019s creative artist services division that nurtures and builds the careers of independent artists. There, she oversaw marketing for African artists including Ayra Starr, Asa, Simi, Spinall, and Khaid.\n\nBefore working at Platoon, Lagos-born Younis was a marketing director at Warner Music Group, with previous stints in different roles at MultiChoice, Africa\u2019s leading entertainment company, and Viacom, one of the largest communications and media conglomerates in the United States.\n\n\u201cI am thrilled to be joining Mara at such a critical time of transformation for the crypto economy in Africa,\u201d Younis said. \u201cThe team are some of the most dynamic and forward-thinking executives in the business. I am honoured to contribute my experience in leading our marketing efforts, as we grow across Africa.\u201d\n\nThis appointment of a CMO with broad experience shows Mara\u2019s commitment to \u201cincrease the number of Africans who can participate in the crypto economy\u201d.\n\nPer a recent report by Chainalysis, Africans received $105.6 billion worth of cryptocurrency between July 2020 and June 2021\u2014an increase of 1,200% from the year before. Despite the widespread adoption of crypto on the continent, there\u2019s still room for growth, as most African regulators are averse to the use of crypto, and internet penetration is still generally low in Africa, compared to other continents.\n\nFounded in April 2021 by Chi Nnadi, Lucas Llin\u00e1s M\u00fanera, Dearg OBartuin and Kate Kallot. Mara\u2019s executive team and board advisors include former executives from Amazon, PayPal, Uber, Nvidia, and other Fortune 500 companies.\n\n\u201cSusan Younis brings a wealth of experience and rigour to this role, having spent her entire career building brands across the globe.\u201d Nnadi, co-founder and CEO said.\u201d Her type of knowledge is exactly what our organisation needs now to scale across the African market.\u201d\n\nThe crypto startup which raised a $23 million seed round in May from Coinbase Ventures, FTX, and other investors, is building a suite of products that address various crypto-finance needs for the African audience.\n\nIts flagship product is a consumer crypto-brokerage app that allows users to buy, send, sell and withdraw fiat and crypto assets. The company is targeting an initial launch in Kenya and Nigeria, the two countries in which it is headquartered, in the coming months.\n\nThis appointment of Younis also underscores the current trend of Web3 companies hiring talents from Big Tech and other Web2 companies. For instance, Amazon\u2019s Pravjit Tiwana left his position as General Manager of AWS Edge Services to become the Chief Technology Officer at crypto exchange, Gemini; Google\u2019s former vice president, Surojit Chatterjee, now serves as Coinbase\u2019s Chief Product Officer; Ryan Wyatt, former Head of Gaming at YouTube, now leads Polygon Studios as its CEO.\n\nShare this article",

Is a united, peaceful and prosperous Nigeria still possible? Will Nigeria retain its sub-optimal mainstream scenario of wavering, drift and dithering? Is a best-case scenario of growth, sustained expansion and shared prosperity a realistic prospect?\u201d Opeyemi Agbaje, founder/chairman of RTC Advisory Services Ltd, asked.",
          "summary": "Politicking has reached fever pitch ahead of the presidential primary of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) as the party faces an uphill task of choosing its presidential candidate.\nThe indication is that the choice of the 2023 APC presidential candidate will emerge through the ballot at the ongoing national convention.\nIntensive lobbying of APC delegates has begun in Abuja as the ruling party prepares to choose its presidential candidate at the Eagle Square on Tuesday.\nA similar leak, though true, was the news about the northern APC governors\u2019 support for a consensus candidate from the South.\nBut as it is, the southern region and APC presidential aspirants from that part of the country are yet to arrive at a consensus, as advised by the party\u2019s hierarchy.",

Led by the United Nations Environment Programme (\u201cUNEP\u201d), and held annually since 1974, each edition focuses on raising awareness and mobilizing the world to take positive action to protect nature and our planet.\n\nThe theme for this year is \u201cOnly One Earth\u201d with focus on \u201cLiving Sustainably in Harmony with Nature.\u201d It beams a spotlight on climate action, nature action and pollution action while encouraging everyone, everywhere to live sustainably. Chevron Nigeria Limited (\u201cCNL\u201d), operator of the joint venture between the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (\u201cNNPC\u201d) and CNL (\u201cNNPC/CNL JV\u201d), identifies with this global action to save the planet as it aligns with our commitment to protecting the environment while providing affordable, reliable, and ever-cleaner energy.\n\nCNL, not only conducts its business in a socially and environmentally sustainable manner, but also in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, stakeholder expectation and best industry practices, and has made Environmental stewardship part of its social investment programmes.\n\nRick Kennedy, CNL Chairman and Managing Director, explains that CNL\u2019s approach to sustainability is highlighted by its commitment to protecting the environment, empowering its people, and always getting results the right way. \u201cChevron is proud to be part of the solution to global environmental issues wherever we operate. Our environmental and energy transition efforts focus on lowering the carbon intensity of our operations, building lower carbon businesses, supporting well-designed climate policy, responsible water management, and biodiversity, while using our Operational Excellence Management System (\u201cOEMS)\u201d to manage risks.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the company\u2019s OEMS delivers industry-leading performance in process safety, personal safety and health, environment, reliability, and efficiency. \u201cOur Environmental philosophy and processes lay the foundation for sound environmental management. The company protects the environment through the entire lifecycle from responsible design, development, operations, and asset retirement.\u201d he stated.\n\nCNL recognizes the importance of minimizing its environmental footprints and promoting ecosystem restoration. The company continually aims to achieve world class environmental excellence through implementation of its Environment Risk Assessment and Management (\u201cERAM\u201d) procedure to identify, assess, mitigate, and manage environmental risks, environmentally related community health risks, and environmentally related social risks. CNL is committed to ecosystem sustainability, including ecosystem restoration interventions where required.\n\nThe restoration programmes provide positive environmental impacts and opportunities for raising the awareness of the community members to the impacts of degradation and benefits of restoration.\n\nCNL is advancing its lower carbon strategy focusing on lowering the carbon intensity in its operations and taking proactive approaches to managing its methane detection and reduction capabilities. CNL utilizes high tech Optical Gas Imaging (\u201cOGI\u201d) cameras for detecting minute fugitive emissions. CNL has reduced routine gas flaring by over 95% in its operations in the past 10 years.\n\nChevron recognizes the importance of protecting and conserving a region\u2019s biodiversity, and we have a long history of working in collaboration with communities, industry groups, regulators, and conservation groups to identify and protect biodiversity in parts of the world where we operate. CNL, in partnership with the Nigerian Conservation Foundation (\u201cNCF\u201d) established in 1992, the Lekki Conservation Centre (\u201cLCC\u201d). This 78-hectare facility, a center of excellence in environmental research and education, is reserved as a sanctuary for the rich flora and fauna of the Lekki Peninsula.\n\nIn 2005, CNL began supporting a yearly postgraduate research scholarship for PhD students in environment and conservation, instituted by the NCF. Additionally, the company hosts the annual S.L. Edu Memorial Lecture to promote environmental management awareness and partners with the Lagos State Government and NCF to sponsor an annual environmental awareness programme, tagged, Walk for Nature, an event held to create awareness and promote nature conservation and sustainable environmental management.\n\nEsimaje Brikinn, CNL\u2019s General Manager, Policy, Government and Public Affairs notes that for over 60 years, CNL has remained an active agent of sustainable development and strong advocate of partnerships in support of the environment. \u201cWe will continue to partner with stakeholders in raising public awareness to create the transformative environmental change we need to advance to a more sustainable future of our Only One Earth,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

When there is momentary flooding in Benin metropolis, the party and their lackeys go about taking pictures, making bogus claims. But on a very important occasion such as the Owo attack, they have failed to make a statement to commiserate with the victims.\n\n\u201cThe attack speaks to the failure of the APC at the national level, in Abuja, to take responsibility and face the issue of safety and security squarely. This failing is what Edo APC has refused to acknowledge and draw the attention of its leaders in the executive arm of government to so as to forestall a reoccurrence.\n\n\u201cIt bears repeating that the APC-controlled Federal Government is in charge of all security agencies in the country from the Nigerian Armed Forces, to the Nigeria Police Force, the Department of State Services (DSS), the Nigeria Intelligence Agency, the Civil Defense Corps and other paramilitary agencies.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cIt smacks of hypocrisy, playing the ostrich and irresponsible politicking to shy away from calling attention to the parlous state of our national security architecture, but seek out mundane and pedestrian occasions to lampoon the Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki.\n\n\u201cThe party should be reminded that their duty as a political party is first of all to Nigerians before selfish, parochial interests.\u201d\n\n\u201cEdo APC must call their government to order.

          "title": "How some politicians wanted to take advantage of separatist agitation in S/East \u2014 Uko",
          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nEvangelist Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko, founder of Igbo Youth Movement (IYM), has noted that separatist agitation in the southeast worsened because some politicians wanted to use the development to advance their political careers.\n\nUko, the secretary of Eastern Consultative Assembly (ECA), who spoke in this interview, noted that the politicians were only interested in using the agitators to win elections.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nOver the years, you have been an active voice in the Southeast. What do you think has changed?\n\nWhat has changed in the last couple of decades, is that the very thing I feared and worked so hard to avert has finally come upon us regrettably. The restive youths of the East finally rose up in anger. I had thought that both the Government and leaders of the region would listen to the truth, that the lid of the boiling cauldron could be blown off, when the temperature gets hotter and that everything should be done to reduce the heat and engage the youths.\n\nIt seems they wanted to see the mayhem first before they believe. The state of affairs in the East today was clearly avoidable, but political leaders made a mess of eating boiled eggs. Sad.\n\nFrustrating dichotomy simmering for decades metamorphosed into seething anger in the hearts of youths of this region, who scared of watching their own kids face the kind of marginalisation they faced, raised their voices in diverse disparate forms. But the state not only chose to ignore them, but went ahead to mishandle the agitation by applying very wrong strategy of containment.\n\nLeaders of the zone made things worse by misdiagnosing the crisis, which helped complicate the issues. Know-it-all attitude of both the Government and regional leaders mestastasised the crises. Even up till date, the real issues that inspired the agitation has not been given attention.\n\nEveryone seems only interested in the symptoms of the problem. Nobody cares to address the root cause. What changed is that a little flicker of flame was unwittingly fanned into an inferno by the leaders who claimed to have all the solutions. That\u2019s what changed.\n\nSoutheast is presently a war zone, with many point at IPOB as the culprits. Who do you think is responsible?\n\nThe sorry state of affairs in the East is pathetic, but finger-pointing isn\u2019t the way out. Identifying the root causes, correcting past errors and truthfully addressing the root cause, will better heal the land than finger-pointing. Dr Alex Ekwueme pleaded with me to do all I can to avoid what\u2019s happening today. He gave me two pages of print out from the Internet, where one Egemba and others were accusing the leadership of the agitators of embezzling their defense fund they had contributed overseas. Alarmed and worried, he mandated me to impress upon the agitators that violence of anykind would be wrong. He pleaded with me to bring Nnamdi to him for a talking-to, when he is released from Kuje prison.\n\nWhen Nnamdi came out on bail five years ago, I took him to Dr Alex Ekwueme and the great sage admonished him in my presence to eschew violence completely. Nnamdi affirmed that he would never resort to violence. I took him to over a dozen elders, Bishops and traditional rulers and they all advocated for peace. In fact Col Joe Achuzia reminded him that when people die, they don\u2019t come back to life. Therefore violence must be shunned. Archbishop Anikwenwa begged him to avoid anything that would lead to blood letting, when I took him to Awka.\n\nNnamdi told me they are demanding for referendum on the future of Nigeria. I advised him to key into restructuring instead. Because I know from my numerous interactions during my serial IYM seminars, that the loss of faith in Nigeria exhibited especially by diaspora Igbo population, is as a result of the unitary structure that feeds nepotism, sleaze, mediocrity and dichotomy.\n\nHe agreed with me. When the Southeast Governors pleaded with me to bring to a meeting on 30th August 2017, I pleaded with an elderly constitutional lawyer, Prof Ben Nwabueze to lead us to the parley, he consented. Nnamdi repeated his demand for the early restructuring of the country before the Governors, who assured us that they will take his demand to Abuja.\n\nAn agreement was to be signed in a fortnight where Nnamdi will agree to play down the agitation for six to twelve months to allow the restructuring of the country to proceed. But regrettably his house was attacked on the eve of the concluding meeting. In fact someone else was asked to rush to his house on the pretense that some political leader would use his phone to speak with Nnamdi\u2019s Dad just minutes before the military assault on his house. Nnamdi escaped to Israel and the rest is history.\n\nThat is the genesis of the lack of confidence between Nnamdi and the authorities that inflamed the situation to the mess in the land. Breakdown in communication and the refusal to engage the agitators in the same manner Niger Delta militants, bandits etc are engaged, deepened the gap.\n\nThe ruthless pillaging of armed herdsmen probably inspired the militia in the East. This is the truth of the matter. While it was wrong to form a militia, it is equally unhelpful to begin the story from the middle. Cutting off the origin of the emotions and sentiments amongst younger elements of the region that inspires the agitation, would be unhelpful. It is in trying to sincerely find out why millions of youngsters from the region agitate to secceed, that your question will be truthfully answered. Nobody knows who are responsible for the mayhem.We will do well to engage the agitators.\n\nWhen and why did the agitation turn violent? What is responsible for that?\n\nI\u2019m close to the ordinary people of my region. The admiration and confidence they repose in me, helped me earn their confidence and made the peace efforts I championed possible, but that has also generated a lot of envy from the political class who blackmail me viciously. My disagreement with the political leaders, stem from their arrogance and paranoia.\n\nThey lack deep insight on the origin of the agitation, they are also scared of presenting the truth to Abuja. They prefer adhoc responses that only deepened the situation. The agitation turned violent when the agitators established a militia, ostensibly to defend the farmers, who are scared of the herdsmen attacks. Before then they only marched with Biafran flags demanding referendum.I disagree with the formation of the ESN, because that would provoke the government. I also know that killing the unarmed agitators would lead to unexpected reaction and response from them.\n\nI walked away from the agitators over three and half years ago, months before the 2019 elections. I refused to take calls from them and switched off from them since then. I don\u2019t know at what point things got out of hand. My reason for walking away was three fold.\n\nOne, politicians were desperate to use them to advance their political careers. They were meddling through their lawyers, siblings etc. They weren\u2019t interested in closure and resolution of the crises. They were only interested in using them to win elections. One was desperate to use them to become governor, another was desperate to use them to launch his attempt to become Vice President or even President. These politicos began to induce and manipulate the agitation while at the same time cleverly deceiving the security agencies that they have the solution to the agitation.\n\nTwo, my attempt to present the truth about the anger and frustrations that inspires the agitation in the hope that sincerely addressing them to seek closure, was unacceptable to both the regions leaders and the Government. So I had to withdraw completely since January 2019.\n\nThirdly, the legion of advisers to the federal Government on the issue, was frightening. This army of \u201cfriends\u201d of government, survive entirely on giving information on such matters. They all claim they are in charge of the region and they therefore should be the ones to resolve the issues. This set of people who actually have no idea what really drives the agitation, only misadvised and misled the Government. This last group actually deepened the situation in their bid to impress Abuja.\n\nWhen I turned my back on the agitators just before the last general elections three and half years ago over Nnamdi\u2019s delay to call off the election boycott and allow people vote candidate of their choice, Nnamdi refused to inform his politician friends that I\u2019ve turned my back on him.They only found out last year when one Senator visited me in Enugu to plead with me to travel out of the country to meet Nnamdi. He was shocked when I told him I had no interest and that I walked away from them over three years earlier. He left disappointed.\n\nI believe that sincerely engaging Nnamdi even in detention, will greatly help heal the land. Those who destroyed the peace effort I built through the grace of God, five years ago, are too ashamed and too proud to acknowledge their mistake.That is the truth.\n\nDo you think governors of the region have done enough to stop the mayhem in the East?\n\nThere\u2019s no point recriminating the governors. They acted within the limits of the system the country operates and also knowledge barrier.For instance I pleaded with Governor Ugwuanyi on several occasions to convince fellow South East Governors to set up a joint committee to engage the agitators to extract their grievances and begin to parley with them.\n\nI met him about a dozen times between 2015 and 2017 begging him to engage the agitators. He kept telling me to come back in three months. Governor Umahi also told me that the issue is beyond them. On one occasion Governor Umahi told me that he was elected to govern Ebonyi state and not to engage Biafran agitators.\n\nThey didn\u2019t believe me as I pleaded that if the 2017 opportunity is missed that it may be difficult to resolve the crisis. They probably thought I was looking for something, they also probably believed that the agitation would be crushed. They didn\u2019t understand that the thing has gained traction and that delay was dangerous.\n\nI don\u2019t blame anyone. They didn\u2019t see or hear what I saw and heard in my three decades of organising IYM seminars and talk shops for Igbo youths all over the country. Do they didn\u2019t take my suggestions seriously.\n\nYou are an advocate of equity and fairness in Nigeria. What do you make of the just concluded PDP primaries?\n\nFairness demand the Southeast be supported to produce the next President. That would be the right thing to do now, given certain facts on ground. But turn by turn presidency suggests there\u2019s something wrong with our country and our structure.\n\nSectional presidency and ethnic prejudice is unhealthy. Regional and religious differences wouldn\u2019t be an issue if Nigeria were restructured along the lines of true federalism and devolution of powers. People jostle for central power because of the winner-takes-all attitude that the unitary structure supports.\n\nIn truly federal systems the world over, \u201cit\u2019s our turn\u201d mentality doesn\u2019t exist. Nigerian political class is predominantly dominated by a predatory band of ruthless exploiters who throw up every injurious argument in order to grab power for themselves. They manipulate ethnic sentiments and sectional emotions to whip up division amongst the people that would help tilt power to their advantage.\n\nMeanwhile they themselves hardly quarrel amongst them selves, especially when they share their loot. There\u2019s no difference between a northern politician and a southern politician, a Christian politician and a Muslim politician, a PDP politician and an APC politician. They are all offshoot of civilian friends, acolytes and associates of the military rulers of Nigeria, who jumped into Partisan politics and have held the country by the jugular since 1999. If Nigeria is restructured today nobody would care from which zone the President will come from.\n\nIt\u2019s the over centralization of power at the centre and the crippling of the federating units by the 1999 constitution that makes the stake very high for the struggle for central power and all kinds of arguments prop up as politicos struggle to outmanouvre each other by driving ethnic arguments. In the case of the Igbo, I think Igbo politicians are responsible for crashing the desire and dream for a South East Presidency. 95 of them voted as delegates at the convention and 80 voted against South East Presidency.\n\nWhen I marched for Igbo presidency 20 years ago in Enugu, our politicos told me \u201cElliot do you really think an Igbo man can be president in your lifetime?\u201d It\u2019s tragic that Igbo political class do not believe in it and always work against it as they always place self interest over group interest. Sad but true.\n\nIt appears the Igbo presidency project is on the brink of dying? What do you think they are not doing right?\n\nWhat they aren\u2019t doing right is that the culture of placing personal aggrandizement and individual accommodation above Regional interest will continue to hurt the zone politically.\n\nHistory has noted that over 80% of South East delegates voted against South East presidency.\n\nGovernors of the region did not support Igbo aspirants\u2026?\n\nThe Governors mobilised and voted according to their own interests. Confirming that the interest of the people do not matter to them. But that isn\u2019t new. It has always been that way. Which points to the state of affairs in the region. Sad.\n\nWhat do you make of the quest for rotation of presidency between the South and the North, the six regions?\n\nRotation isn\u2019t a bad idea, but as I said few minutes ago, a restructured Nigeria will have no need for all these, because each region will develop according to their need and strengths. Nobody will care about where the President comes from, as each region will be in charge of her destiny. Germany, India, the US, the UK, Australia, Canada etc don\u2019t rotate the Presidency, because true federalism ensures each federating thrives.\n\nIs the South East worse off under APC than it was under PDP?\n\nPeople of my region are suffering from poor leadership irrespective of the political party. We are stuck with a conscienceless political class irrespective of party affiliation. The actors do not care about the welfare of the people and the future of the land.\n\nImagine this: Immediately after the 2019 general elections, I approached the DG of the South East Governors forum, Prof Otuanya and told him that the Governors should kindly set up a team that would quickly engage the agitators in order to avoid what\u2019s happening in the region today. He promised me they would. A few weeks later he was appointed SSG by Enugu Governor, I assumed he would take seriously what I suggested. They dutifully ignored my request until the situation deteriorated.\n\nAgain, we pleaded with them to establish a South East Development Commission, till date, nothing has been done along that line, as they prefer to work alone and sometimes at cross purposes. We are dissapointed. Nobody is proud of them here, except their retinue of praise singers and cheer leaders.\n\nWhat will bring peace to the region, judging from your interactions with different stakeholders of the region?\n\nOnly dialogue will bring genuine healing and lasting peace. The errors made by the Igbo political class in handling the agitation, brought us to where we are today. They were using the earlier leader of the agitators to win elections and empowered him in the process. They erroneously assumed that this one would be like the previous leader. They lacked deeper insight that what gave the second leader great following was because he swore to the followers that he would not behave like the earlier discredited leader who was accused of pecuniary pursuit, compromise and departure from the ideals of their struggle.\n\nThe political class didn\u2019t know this and therefore supported brutal suppression which backfired and snowballed into a big crisis. Only sincere dialogue and the willingness to address the root cause which is the suffocating unitary system. Engaging the agitators remain the path to peace.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari departed the Abuja venue of the All Progressives Congress presidential convention early Wednesday, minutes after he delivered his address.\n\nHe left with his wife, Aisha at about 1.30 a.m and was seen off by top officials, including Vice-president Yemi Osinbajo, one of the contestants in the primary.\n\nIn his speech, Buhari urged members of his party to remain united and avoid acrimony.\n\nHe rallied delegates at the special convention to consider voting the presidential candidate with the best chances of securing victory in the 2023 general elections.\n\nIn his address at the Eagle Square, venue of the special convention, the President said the critical task ahead of the Abdullahi Adamu-led National Working Committee (NWC) \u201dremains to continue to forge the unity of purpose among party members and to keep securing needed compromises in the interest of the party.\u201d\n\nThe President, who spoke to the delegates before the voting exercise to elect the presidential candidate, urged party officials and delegates to follow due process and abide by all extant laws and regulations pertaining to election of the party flag bearer.\n\nThe Nigerian leader said the flag bearer must be knowledgeable, fair-minded nationalist with a very strong belief in the unity of the country and strength of character and purpose to steer the country forward.\n\n\u201dMy fellow party members and compatriots, I commend you for your various roles and contributions towards the successful conduct of the various APC primaries across the nation. I commend the party stakeholders, officials, organs and the Abdullahi Adamu-led NWC.\n\n\u201dI commend your efforts in organising party exercises and urge you not to rest on our achievements so far. Now we have a big task ahead: the special convention for the presidential primary.\n\n\u201dI congratulate all the winners, our newly emerged party flag bearers, so far, for the 2023 general elections and urge you to be magnanimous in victory, particularly towards your fellow aspirants who conceded to you. I urge you at all times to abide by the Party rules and follow party reconciliation processes.\n\n\u201dIn every competitive event, there are bound to be winners and runners-up; and as such, all the aspirants who lost or conceded at the primaries, I equally urge you to maintain the spirit of sportsmanship and to stand by our great party for the next challenges ahead.\n\n\u201dAs we go into the presidential primary, I urge all to keep to the same spirit. We must avoid acrimony and maintain the spirit of sportsmanship. The critical task ahead of the Abdullahi Adamu-led NWC remains to continue to forge the unity of purpose among party members and to keep securing needed compromises in the interest of our great party.\n\n\u201dI enjoin you all to be fair to all and to create a level playing field for all the presidential aspirants in the coming crucial party exercise.\n\n\u201dPlease, follow due process in all the party decisions and I call on all party members, particularly the party officials and delegates to abide by all extant laws, rules, and regulations and to consider voting for the presidential candidate with the best chances of securing victory for our great party in the coming general elections,\u201d he said.\n\nUnderscoring that the principal challenge before the party is the need to keep a united front, the President affirmed that the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party has vested its powers in NWC for the time being, as requested, and in compliance with the Party Constitution, to ensure smooth party administration and operations in these critical times in the overall interest of the party.\n\nPresident Buhari, therefore, assured the party Chairman and the entire NWC members of his support, adding:\n\n\u201dPlease do not hesitate to call on me and all other appropriate quarters for the help that will propel our great party to the victory that we all seek. To ensure a hitch-free presidential primary, please let us work collectively in the interest of our great party and our great country.\u201d\n\nOn governance issues and how his administration has steered the ship of state in the last seven years, the President declared that the APC Government in spite of inheriting a nearly dead economy, has made substantial progress in implementing reforms, providing infrastructure and social care and redeeming Nigeria\u2019s image in the international community.\n\n\u201dFellow delegates, fellow men, women, youth, citizens of our country. Many people have short memories. But let us remember the situation we inherited.\n\n\u201dA nearly dead economy in spite of oil being over $100 per barrel for many years. Vast areas of our country under insurgent control. Salaries, wages, pensions unpaid for months in many states.\n\n\u201dProblems were left unattended or ignored. Infrastructure left to decay. Internationally we were despised.\n\n\u201dYour APC Government has changed all that. Our response to any new challenges, whether banditry, kidnappings, insurgency has been prompt and head-on. Rehabilitation of infrastructure has taken place on a massive scale. Our response to Covid-19 is second to none in Africa.\n\n\u201dWe have made substantial progress in governance, in implementing reforms, in democratic processes and in social care.\n\n\u201dWe are now respected in Africa and across the world. These major achievements by APC are historic and far-reaching.\n\n\u201dWe now have to choose a leadership not just to win elections next year but to continue and improve on these landmarks.\n\n\u201dWe must choose a knowledgeable, fair minded nationalist with a very strong belief in the unity of our Nation, Nigeria, and strength of character and purpose to steer the country forward. We should not allow the PDP to drag the country backwards, \u201d he said.",

          "text": "Nigeria is hosting the maiden edition of the \u2018Nigeria-Africa Natural Resources and Energy Investment Summit\u2019, a three-day Summit with the theme \u2018Towards a Greener Africa\u2019, in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nSpeaking in his keynote address at the event, President Muhammadu Buhari represented by the Hon. Minister of mine and steel Arc Olamilekan Adegbite on Wednesday said Africa needs to join the rest of the world\u2019s shift from fossil fuel to renewable energy sources.\n\nArc Olamilekan Adegbite, pointed that Africa requires a huge amount of energy generation to drive its development.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s convention is indeed important. Africa requires a huge amount of energy generation to drive its development, even as the world shifts away from fossil fuel to clean and renewable energy sources, in the fight against climate change. In the midst of this energy transition lies many challenges and opportunities for a continent yearning for development.\n\n\u201cI believe this should spur us as a continent of diverse people to co-operate and collaborate more, initiate innovative solutions to the challenges that are peculiar to us, come up with technologies and products that will lead to the growth and industrialization of Africa in a more environment friendly manner while encouraging the development and financing of green energy projects.\n\n\u201cOur meeting today provides the opportunity to share views on natural resources and energy market developments. Additionally, the morning session will focus on Maximizing Mineral Potentials and Attracting Private Investments. Our esteemed speakers will discuss the opportunities within the Nigerian Mining Sector, the underexplored minerals which are key to clean renewable energy, the success stories and the strides towards driving Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into the Sector.\n\n\u201cParticipating countries in the Declaration of Cooperation would strengthen their cooperation, through joint assessment and viewpoints, with the aim to financing sustainable African Natural Resources and Energy Projects that are key to the transition, for the benefit of producers and consumers and to regularly review at technical and ministerial levels the status of our cooperation,\u201d he noted.\n\nOn policies and framework, Buhari stated that, \u201cOur joint meetings and activities will support us in formulating favorable policy and strategy development for the natural resource sector as the world looks towards a greener future. A policy that is less subject to extremes, both today and in the future.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Group Managing Director, African Industries Group, Alok Gupta, who was represented by Partha Ghosh spoke on opportunities on Nigeria\u2019s mining sector. African Natural Resources and Mines Limited, ANRML, is a group company of the African Industries Group.\n\n\u201cNigeria is heavily endowed with solid minerals with 44 minerals found in over 500 locations including all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, have more than one mineral type which indeed is a rare occurrence.\n\n\u201cWith the view of maximizing these opportunities, to create wealth, grow the GDP and expand opportunities available to Nigerians. The mining sector is the backbone of industrialization of the economy.\n\n\u201cHe also pointed various incentives rolled out n the Buhari-led administration to promote ease of doing business in the sector.\n\n\u201cThe mining implementation and stability is strategically focusing on steel. Nigeria has the 12th largest steel deposits in the world with more than 3 billion tonnes resources in Kogi, Enugu, Zamfara and Kaduna States.\n\n\u201cAnnually $3.3 billion is still spent on steel imports which impact the economy. With focusing on steel Nigeria can reduce dependency on imports and the economy would become a major player in global markets.\n\nHowever, he disclosed that his company has established a fully integrated mining and steel processing plant in Gujeni Village in Kagarko Local Government Area of Kaduna State, with 5 million tonnes per annum, which is Nigeria\u2019s largest foreign direct investment of $600 million, and will be employing over 4000 Nigerians, including good community development projects and schemes ongoing.",

          "text": "Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, HE Chief Timipre Sylva has disclosed that Nigeria made a strong commitment to embracing energy transition while pledging to significantly reduce its greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\n\nThe Minister stated this yesterday at the Nigeria-Africa natural resource and energy summit in Abuja\n\nHe said that that was in addition to the commitment Nigeria made through President Muhammadu Buhari, at COP 26 in 2021 to attain carbon net-zero by 2060.\n\nSylva who explained that Nigeria is following a transition pathway that combines technology, investment, business strategies, and government policy that will enable Nigeria to transit from its current energy system to a low-carbon energy system with natural gas playing a pivotal role, added that the country needs affordable, reliable and sustainable energy resources to eradicate the prevalent energy poverty in the shortest time possible, and propel economic growth.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe only viable option currently on the table is natural gas, considering vast proven gas endowments, put at 209 TCF, with 600 TCF potential reserves. We cannot ignore this resource, especially when energy poverty is viciously starring at us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe goal of Nigeria\u2019s gas policy is to ensure that gas development is undertaken in accordance with our socio-economic development priorities. The aim is to guarantee long-term energy security in the country, and boost the domestic gas market, hence the declaration of 2021-to-2030 as the \u2018Decade of Gas\u2019 by Mr. President. We have embarked on a critical pathway to ensuring that our abundant Natural gas resources are marshalled to engender domestic economic growth and development.\u201d\n\nHe also said that the Ministry of Petroleum Resources has launched the National Gas Expansion Programme NGEP as part of the National Gas Policy to expand Nigeria\u2019s Domestic gas utilization; the National Gas Flare Commercialization Programme; as well as specific provisions in the new Petroleum Industry Act PIA that elevates LPG as the fuel of choice compared to other competing fuels and the usage of solar energy is already being vigorously promoted across the country, while the use of hydro, wind and other natural resources are also being expanded.\n\nThe Minister who lauded the theme of the Summit \u2018Towards a Greener Africa\u2019 observed that it is very apt and timely at this challenging time in the energy industry globally. However, he explained that at the core of this challenge is the issue of climate change that is eliciting clamour for transition to greener energy sources to reduce carbon emission.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that every nation and region comes up with a green initiative to foster a collective combat against the incessant threat to the planet caused by CO2 emission. Such initiatives must be bold, decisive and on target.\n\n\u201cIt should however be borne in mind that such initiatives should reflect the realities and conditions prevailing in these places, particularly the socio-economic development and energy needs.\n\n\u201cThe key consideration in every country\u2019s energy policy should be pivoted on energy security. This constitutes a very high priority goal for nations all over the globe. The reason is not far-fetched: Energy propels economic growth.\n\n\u201cThat makes energy security synonymous with optimum and sustainable economic growth. Energy is an indispensable ingredient for human development and socio-economic prosperity. It is central to jobs creation, security, health, and other challenges facing humans.\n\n\u201cThis is why access to energy is prominently addressed in the UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals. In particular, SDG 7 focuses on access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, as a fundamental right.\n\nHe said that as at today, energy poverty is still much prevalent in the world, especially in Africa where millions of people still do not have access to electricity or clean cooking fuels.\n\nBased on the UN data, about 760 million people lack access to electricity worldwide, with three out of four of them living in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nFurthermore, one-third of the world\u2019s population \u2013 about 2.6 billion people \u2013 have no access to clean cooking fuels, with over 900 million of these in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nOn the average, only 48% of sub-Saharan Africa population have access to electricity, while only 18% have access to clean cooking fuels, compared with a global average of 90% and 70%, respectively.\n\nIn relation to CO2 emission, World Bank statistics shows that the world average of CO2 emissions was 4.48 metric tons per capita in 2018, with some regions and individual countries recording five to seven times this value. Emission by sub-Saharan Africa in total was only 0.76 metric tons per capita.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe implication of the above is that the issues surrounding energy poverty, climate and sustainable development are not mutually exclusive. Consequently, the approaches to attending to these issues should not be disconnected.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Sylva admitted that climate change is definitely of serious concern to Africa. But of equal concern is the alarming level of energy poverty. Both must be addressed in a sustainable manner. It must be a win-win situation.\n\nEnergy transition is about providing clean energy, and not about discriminating between energy sources. In the face of the current high level of energy poverty worldwide, especially in Africa, all energy sources will be required to achieve the sustainable development goal of providing access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.",

          "text": "Ondo State Governor, Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has disclosed that 80 persons were involved in last Sunday\u2019s terror attack at St Francis Catholic Church, Owa-luwa street, Owo.\n\nGovernor Akeredolu said 22 people lost their lives to the horrific attack while 52 survivors are on admission at the Federal Medical Center, Owo, St Louis Hospital, Owo and the Owo General Hospital as well as some private hospitals.\n\nThe Governor disclosed this on Tuesday during a statewide broadcast to the people of the state in respect of the last Sunday\u2019s terrorist attack at St. Francis Catholic Church, Owaluwa Street, Owo.\n\nREAD ALSO: Pope \u2018Deeply Saddened\u2019 By Owo Terrorist Attack\n\nAkeredolu said the attack was an attempt to test the will of the people of the State and indeed, the Southwest.\n\nHe added that the dastardly act has the brazenly possible consequence of invitation to national anarchy, saying that \u201cYorubaland, and Owo in particular, have never been conquered before; and it will never happen.\u201d\n\nHe promised to commit every available resource to hunt down the assailants and make them pay dearly, stressing that the state will never bow to the machinations of heartless elements in its resolve to stamp out criminals.\n\n\u201cThe site, that is, St. Francis Catholic Church, Owaluwa, Owo presents a gory war-like scene. The Federal Medical Centre, Owo, the St. Louis Hospital, Owo, the General Hospital, Owo as well as some private hospitals in Owo were filled with the injured, most of who were in critical conditions.\n\n\u201cThe most unfortunate part is the lives of innocent children cut down in their prime and some severely injured by the mindless attackers.\n\n\u201cAt Owo, the anger was palpable. The tension was at an abrasive level just as the urge for reprisals was high. Without doubt too, the ripple impact of this heinous act as well as the understandably angry reaction across the State could not have been different.\n\n\u201cI urge our people to be calm but remain vigilant. Do not take the law into your own hands. Leave the rest for government to shoulder. I have spoken to the heads of the security agencies. I can assure you that security operatives have been deployed to monitor and restore normalcy to Owo kingdom.\n\n\u201cMay I use this medium to express gratitude to President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, who aside his demonstrated concern, directed his Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, GCON to visit the scene of this criminal act.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum led by its chairman, Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, their Excellencies, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, the Honourable Minister of Interior and Engr. Seyi Makinde, the Governor of Oyo State also deserve a special mention for their collective and individual show of love and empathy.\n\n\u201cWe will remain eternally grateful to His Excellency, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu for his donation of a whopping amount of N50 million to the victims and N25 million to the Catholic Church, Owo. The gesture of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum which donated N50 million to the victims is equally appreciated.\n\n\u201cThe donations are to assuage the effects of the attack. In the meantime, I have directed that an account be opened to receive further donations from well meaning individuals and corporate bodies who may wish to assist the victims of the terrorist attack.\n\n\u201cI am particularly enthralled by the wonderful show of solidarity from my brothers across party divides, especially in the State. It is heartwarming that we all have found a common ground to confront these monsters.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, I thank the former Governor of Ondo State, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko and the entire PDP family. To all others too numerous to mention, your show of love, encouragement and goodwill are not taken for granted. You have displayed compassion and demonstrated an appreciable level of brotherliness.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, I commend the medical teams of the Federal Medical Centre, Owo, the St. Louis Hospital, Owo, the General Hospital, Owo and some private hospitals who showed love and participated in stabilising the victims in the various hospitals.\n\n\u201cWe equally appreciate the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) and BEDC for their assistance. I convey our gratitude to volunteers who assisted in evacuating the victims and the dead to the hospitals and mortuaries respectively.\n\n\u201cI also thank our people who had deemed it fit to voluntarily donate blood towards the treatment of the victims. They have lived up to expectation within the precinct of the available space and time.\u201d",

          "title": "APC Special Convention is Nigeria's encounter with Destiny",
          "text": "Here comes a time in a nation when the hopes of the moment. Let not the destiny of this land be stolen because we did not do what was meant for us to do at this critical moment. Remember, we formed this party, APC, not simply to wrest power from a wrong and failing PDP.\n\nWe formed this party to give the people of this land the progressive good governance they deserve so that they may live as well and as peacefully as any people on the face of this earth. This corrective journey began with the election of President Muhammadu Buhari. At this convention, we must take the next step toward the proper and necessary direction.\n\nIn 2015, the All Progressives Congress won the election to halt the drift in our nation\u2019s governance, redirect our path, and make clear our national priorities We dedicated this party to the guiding principle that government must be for the benefit or each and every Nigerian before it is for the benefit of any single one of ns, No one is above legal rule or regulation. Likewise one is too low for justice and compassionate governance cover or protect him.\n\nWithin this context, the APC under President Muhammadu Buhari has governed with patriotic and disciplined commitment this past seven years. The Buhari government has championed needed reforms, ranging from an innovative petroleum industry law to measures that are aimed at improving power and electricity generation for all Nigerians. Government has invested heavily in building modern airports and railway network and roads. Every Naira is better managed than in prior administrations.\n\nThis greater fiscal probity was achieved despite the vast reduction in national revenue caused by the COVID and recurrent global economic downturns. The Buhari government has done more with much less than its PDP predecessors did. The successive PDP administrations did next to nothing with the plenty they had. What they did with our nation\u2019s abundance is no secret. But what they did not do was even a greater embarrassment.\n\nThey left abandoned infrastructure projects all across the nation. The APC completed them. They allowed ISWAP/ Boko Haram to erect strongholds. The Buhari government has been compelled to wage great war against these threats because of the decade of neglect by the PDP.\n\nThe PDP should have uprooted this evil when it was but a seed. The APC-led government is now left to contend with the dangerous tree it has become. Yet, as surely as I can state my name, the next APC government shall uproot this evil such that, never again, shall it try to take hold in this land.\n\nWhile fighting this evil with a purposeful hand, we remain mindful of the socio-economic and political inequalities that often spawn unrest and social instability. Despite economic difficulties wrought by protracted global recession, the APC-led government has progressed in diversifying the economy, improving food security through intense investment in the agricultural sector.\n\nBut the long day for national rebuilding is not over. Even greater, bolder work is needed to beat back the hard challenge swe face. Yet, my hope is high and that is hope not for myself but for you and this nation, My greatest trust and comfort reside in the innate goodness of the people of our beloved nation, Joiner in common purpose, with leadership informed by wise and correct policies, the things that we can accomplish are nothing less than historic.\n\nWe can change the very face of the nation Though this season of primaries has been abbreviated, I have talked to thousands of people across this land. Yes, there were crowds and jubilant receptions offered me. These were nice things, but they are not the most important factors to the task at hand. People approached me wanting to know if I had a plan to continue the fight against terror and violence.\n\nThey wanted to know if I cared about agriculture and the plight of the ordinary farmer. Youths asked me about jobs and their future in this world. The poor asked how and when they will be assured that they can daily place food on the table for their innocent children.\n\nThey did not ask for mage or for me to give them charming yet empty responses. Our people asked honest, serious questions and I gave then honest and serious answers I told them what we can achieve through hard work and dedication to a higher national purpose\n\nI told them we must work harder than ever; but I also assured them that the average person shall not feel left behind, Building on the reforms of the past seven years and on the progressive ideals of our party, the coming APC-led government, under my watch, shall place the welfare of the average Nigerian above that of any elite or special interest. Our progressive government must be for the people and never for the powerful.\n\nThe powerful already have. Let us give succour and an open door to the less privileged. Let us bring forth a society built on shared prosperity, belief in justice, compassion for others and an unshakable commitment to a form of governance that treats all citizens with equal respect and due regard. Let us not just open the door to the promise of a better society. Let us brick by brick and stone by stone build a new society that begets a greater nation.\n\nWeighty matters now rest in the balance. A fateful decision awaits you the delegates to this convention. Choose that which most wholly benefits the nation. Think big at this moment that we may accomplish great things in the next APC administration that will come on 29 May 2023.\n\nMy experience in office and the knowledge gained through hard work, tough trials and patient undertaking have prepared men for this hour. I am a man of purpose with a serious mission. My vow is to use all that I know and all of my abilities to the benefit of the nation and its people. I do not step forward because I think this nomination is my due. I step forward because I can help lead our nation to become what it ought to be.\n\nI do not say this as a boast. Hear me out. I claim not to be special nor great. My training, experiences, acquired knowledge are what is special and uniquely suited for this moment. I am merely a conduit, a servant of a cause much larger than myself.\n\nNow is a time for progressive vision and singular purpose. There is a general agreement that 2023 will be an encounter with destiny, when our nation shall need a certain type of leader to realise a better Nigeria.\n\nWe need to build a Nigeria where sufficient jobs for the urban population are available and lead to a good life most wholly benefits the nation.

Additionally, we must continue to empower the states so that grassroots economic and political development is maximised.\n\nThough our tribe and tongue may differ, we must build a united country , premised on equity, fairness and justice. True reform and progress lie not in copying others but in identifying our own opportunities. I have done this in Lagos. I humbly ask you to allow me to use these skills and experiences to advance the nation.\n\nI come to you with a coherent vision on how to improve our nation such that our schools, industry, agriculture and infrastructure will become the pride of all. Ours shall be a land where all Nigerians will have an equal chance and no one is excluded because of his ethnic background, religious creed, place of origin or social station. We are all Nigerians.\n\nBy this statement, Iseek your help and support to become our party\u2019s nominee and standard bearer in the coming February 2023 elections. To lead Nigerians is a sacred trust, which I do not take lightly or seek selfishly. By giving me the party\u2019s mandate, I hereby makey solemn vow to make Nigeria the best home for its citizens.\n\nAs an indivisible, united country, we shall overcome the destructive forces attempting to steal our destiny. May the triumph of our democratic journey be complete and serve as an exemplar to Africa, our race, and the rest of mankind. We were born for this moment. Let us now make the most of it and fulfil our destiny.\n\nI thank you all for listening.\n\nMay God bless you all.\n\nMay God Bless our party, the APC.\n\nMay God bless our beloved nation, the Federal Republic of\n\nNigeria.\n\n*Asiwaju Bola Ahmed TINUBU",

Although statues are on public display in many Muslim countries, they are less common in the Arab Gulf.\n\nThe sculpture by Algerian-born French artist Adel Abdessemed depicts the moment during extra time in the 2006 World Cup final when Zidane head-butted Italy\u2018s Marco Materazzi. Zidane was sent off in his final match as a professional footballer, and Italy went on to beat France on penalties.\n\nAl-Mayassa told reporters the aim of displaying the work was to promote conversations about \u201cstress on athletes\u2026and the importance of dealing with issues of mental health.\u201d\n\n\u201cZidane is a great friend of Qatar.
