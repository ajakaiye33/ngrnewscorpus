          "title": "Refinery: Dangote not happy with NNPC proposed stake acquisition, says Kyari",
          "text": "Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Melee Kyari, says African billionaire and business magnate, Aliko Dangote, does not want to sell shares in his refinery and petrochemical project under construction in the Lekki Free Zone, Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nKyari, however, said it is important that the NNPC, as the national oil company, guarantee energy security for the country by \u201chaving a say in the board of the refinery\u201d.\n\nThe NNPC GMD spoke on Tuesday when he featured in Channels Television\u2019s \u2018Sunrise Daily\u2019 programme monitored by The PUNCH.\n\nAccording to him, the NNPC will take 20 per cent equity in the Dangote Refinery which has the capacity to produce 650,000 bpd per day.\n\nNigeria, Africa\u2019s biggest oil producer, has for several years been importing the bulk of its refined petroleum products from Europe and other places as a result of the inability of its refineries to refine crude oil abundant in the country.\n\nThe country has four national refineries including the Kaduna Refining and Petrochemical Company, Port Harcourt Refining Company and Warri Refining and Petrochemical Company.\n\nLast year, a total of N81.41bn was expended on the four refineries between January and August even though the facilities never refined a drop of crude oil all through the period.\n\nSeveral billions of dollars have also been spent by many governments to revive and rehabilitate the nation\u2019s refineries but no success has been recorded in a very long time.\n\nThe consuming public continues to bear the brunt of the government\u2019s inability to make its refineries functional. Today, petrol sells for between N163 and N 165 per litre in the country, with the NNPC mulling an increment, saying the current pump price is short of petrol landing cost which it said is around N232 per litre.\n\nWith epileptic power supply, Nigerians rely on petroleum products to generate energy; power their vehicles, and generating sets. These, no doubt, make the cost of living for average citizens burdensome, especially with minimum wage at N30,000 per month for each worker, a paltry sum hardly enough for an individual to survive a month, not with the rising food prices in the West African country.\n\nMany private entities have since identified the opportunity in the energy sector and came up with modular refineries which have the capacity to produce some thousands of litres of petroleum products but their output is far short of the daily petroleum consumption of Nigeria, with over 200 million people.\n\nOne of the big entrants into the energy sector is business magnate, Aliko Dangote. His refinery, which is projected to start production next year, is expected to fill in the gap for imported petroleum products.\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday, the NNPC GMD said, \u201cDangote refinery will come to work, by 2022, it should come into production and what that should do is to deliver over 50 million litres of gasoline, to be specific, into our market.\n\n\u201cWe are also working on our refineries to make sure we fix them; we have awarded the Port Harcourt refinery rehabilitation and ultimately we are close to that of Warri and Kaduna, so that very soon, in July, all of them will work contemporaneously and at the end of the day, we will deliver all of them.\n\n\u201cThe net effect is that you are going to have an environment where Nigeria becomes a hub for petroleum supply. It is going to change the dynamics of petroleum supply, even globally, in the sense that the flow is coming from Europe today and it is going to be reversed to some other direction. We will be the supplier for West Africa legitimately and also many other parts of the world.\n\n\u201cThe meaning of this is that there is an opportunity thrown at us and I am not sure that Mr Dangote wants to sell his equity in the refinery. I can confirm that it was at our instant that we started the engagement; he did not want to sell his shares in this refinery.\n\n\u201cThere is no country that would watch a business of this scale, which is bordering on energy security, which also has high implication even on the physical security of our country and you watch it that you don\u2019t have a say.\n\n\u201cFor us as a strategy, we will take equity in very significant businesses that are anchored on the oil and gas operations \u2013 fertilizer, methanol plants, modular refineries and so many other businesses that we are dealing with so that we can expand our portfolio but also as the national oil company, we have the responsibility to guarantee energy security for our country and there is nowhere you can have that say except you have a say in the board of this institution.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not sure Mr Dangote is very happy with this. We are taking 20 per cent equity of the Dangote Refinery. There is a valuation process, it is very international and very regulated. No bank will give you money to buy stake,\u201d he added.\n\nKyari further said that the NNPC is seeking the authority of the Federal Executive Council to close the deal which he said is worth about $19bn.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to take government money to buy it, we are going to borrow because we know that this business is viable in the short term\n\nBanks have come forward to lend us,\u201d Kyari stated.\n\nThe NNPC GMD also said, \u201cWe are very proud that we did this, this is good for our shareholders including all the 200 million Nigerians who will also be happily buying shares from this refinery if they have an opportunity but now we have done that on their behalf so that ultimately, the value will come to all of us.\u201d",

Wike Leaders of Nvakaohia alleged the community was being forced to accept the MoU against its will by the Commissioner for Chieftaincy and Community Affairs, Mr. Sunny Ejekwu.\n\n\n\nEze Dennis Orji, chairman, Nvakohia-Rumekpe Council of Chiefs; Chief Rowland Owhonda, Eze Ekwutche community; Chief Godwin Woruka, Eze Imogu community; Henry Nwonodi, chairman, CDC Imogu-Nvakaohia; Lawrence Rigumah, CDC chairman, Ekwutche-Nvakaohia community and London Adams, CDC Chairman, Ovelle-Nvakaohia community, in a joint statement, called on Governor Nyesom Wike to call his aide, Ejekwu, to order.\n\n\n\nThey warned the Commissioner\u2019s actions were capable of plunging Rumuekpe clan into crisis.\n\n\n\nThe letter read: \u201cWe, the chiefs, elders, stakeholders, women, youth and Community Development Committees, CDCs, of Nvakaohia-Rumuekpe in Emohua Local Government Area of Rivers State made up of Imogu, Ekwutche and Ovelle, wish to call on our leader and defender, His Excellency, Governor Nyesom Wike, CON, to call his Commissioner for Chieftaincy and Community Affairs to order and direct him to stay away from Nvakaohia Rumuekpe engagement with Total E&P Nigeria Limited, if all he wishes is to plunge the peace loving community into crisis as he is currently doing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner for Chieftaincy and Community Affairs, Sir Sunny Ejekwu, had sent us threat messages, compelling and coercing us to sign a purported Memorandum of Understanding, MOU, on Wednesday, 15th June, 2021 with Total E&P Nigeria Ltd against our will. The Commissioner is on a mission to sabotage and undermine the effort of the governor to promote host community rights and entitlements with International Oil multinationals in the state and Nvakohia-Rumekpe will not fall for it.\n\nCrux of the matter\n\n\u201cNvakaohia- Rumuekpe community through its representatives had negotiated a MoU with Total E&P Ltd, but we wrote to the company that the signing of the said MOU should be put off till further notice.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is to enable both parties to properly interface with Total E&P Ltd on a widely publicized petition we wrote to the company through the Integrity Friends for Truth and Peace Initiative TIFPI, which demands include remediation, compensation for years of neglect, humanitarian intervention, etc. for the devastation of the community caused by Total E&P Nigeria Ltd.\n\n\n\n\u201cInformation available to us is that Total E&P Nigeria Limited in a meeting held somewhere in New GRA, Port Harcourt, compromised a top government with millions of naira and promised him some major running contracts if he succeeds to do their bidding and undermine the interest of Nvakaohia-Rumekpe community which the company has destroyed,\u201d they said.\n\n\n\nWhy we went ahead with new MoU \u2013 Chief Oloko\n\nHowever, Chief Sunday Oloko, who spoke for the section of Nvakohia community that signed the MoU, said: \u201cSince 2016/2017 when it (MoU), expired, it has been from one problem to another. Nvakaohia today is one. We have no difference, the signing is going on. We are going on now.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Ejekwu hails MoU\n\nRivers state Commissioner of Chieftaincy and Community Affairs, Mr. Sunny Ejekwu, commended the communities for accepting peace to renew MoU with Total E&P Limited.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cThere were different disagreements within the communities, there were forces that wanted to derail the process not to hold today. What we used to know is that IOCs look out for faults in the community to pull out from MoUs. Months and years will run, who loses, the communities.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe thank you for your commitment to ensure that this is achieved. The communities have faced different challenges but I am happy that we have resolved all and come together to sign this MoU,\u201d he said.\n\nWe are committed to touching lives \u2013 Total\n\nOn its part, Executive Director, Total E&P, Port Harcourt District, Mr. Obi Imemba, who spoke expressed happiness on the formal signing ceremony of the renegotiated MoU, said that over four years had elapsed since their expiration of their last agreement.\n\n\n\nImemba noted that that the MoUs would have far- reaching impact on the communities in areas of infrastructural development and employment, adding that the firm was prepared to touch lives of community people.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that both parties have worked hard towards this mutually acceptable outcome, bearing in mind that the last MoUs with the communities expired in December 2016/2017 and due to intra- community conflicts, it was difficult to renegotiate the MoU. We all should, therefore, be proud of this achievement as this is a notable milestone in our relationship with each other,\u201d he asserted.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

But the 79-year-old former intelligence operative accused the court and Zondo of bias, walked out of one scheduled panel hearing in November and boycotted another in February.

Under extremely difficult conditions, we achieved something big through concentrating national resources,\u201d Tao told him.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCheng Meidong from Peking University summarized three capabilities of the CPC.\n\n\u201cThe CPC has a strong capability to lead, a scientific method to make decisions and a capability to unite people and get support from people,\u201d Cheng told Goodrum.\n\nAnd the Party\u2019s mature system to select and promote officials also matters a lot.\n\n\u201cEvery CPC official that reaches the pinnacle of the leadership structure must have been effective in a variety of challenging assignments, starting in the places most in need,\u201d said Laurence Brahm, senior international fellow at the Center for China and Globalization.\n\nBrahm said this ensured the officials could make the right decisions in demanding moments. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge collection of hands-on experience, not just theory.\u201d\n\nTao also mentioned the Party\u2019s ability to make and implement both short- and long-term planning.\n\n\u201cThe plans China made for modernization last for 50 years or 100 years,\u201d Tao said. He drew a comparison with some political leaders in other countries, saying what they cared about are mainly short-term and local interests.\n\nThanks to all these special traits, the CPC has done an excellent job in governing the nation. China has created more green area than any other nation. It is reaching for the stars as it sends missions to Mars and astronauts to its own space station.\n\nLooking to the future, Ian Goodrum is expecting more.\n\n(chinadaily)",

          "title": "Bitcoin Dip continues \u2013 Should you buy the dip or Cut your Losses?",
          "text": "It is no longer news that the crypto market is in a bearish run as bitcoin tanked below the 30k in June. Most traders decided to buy the dip hoping that the sharp decline will be followed by a bullish movement. Although there was a quick retrace, with the asset trading close to $40k, bitcoin failed to meet most traders\u2019 and investors\u2019 expectations.\n\nTo further cement the bear run, bitcoin\u2019s price corrected below $30k on the 21st of June. All these price actions indicate that the price of bitcoin is still in a bearish market. While many traders see the bearish trend as an opportunity to continue to buy bitcoin and add to their portfolio, there are a lot of doubts about how long the current trend will last.\n\nAlthough people who decided to buy bitcoin when the price initially dropped in May would have made a slight profit on their investment when the price traded at around $40k. On the other hand, most of these traders would decide to hold on to the asset with a strong hope that it is going further up. Now that the dip is continued, many crypto investors are in a panic as bitcoin witnessed another setback from this point. The big question remains; should you continue to buy the dip? Or should you cut your losses?\n\nFind out everything you need to know about the crypto crash.\n\nWhat does buying the dip mean?\n\nBuying the dip is simply a term used when a trader decides to accumulate an asset when it crashes or falls. For instance, when you buy bitcoin because the value has dropped, you are basically \u201cbuying the dip\u201d. Although it is believed that the term is unique to only a bearish market, people believe you can only buy the dip when the market is experiencing a bearish trend, however, it\u2019s not. There are highs and lows in a bullish market as well. Some even believe it is safer to buy the dip in a bullish market where the general trend is \u2018up\u2019. Although the profit you get from buying the dip in a bullish market might not be as huge as when you buy the dip in a bearish market and the asset eventually enters a bearish momentum.\n\nBuying the dip might be very risky because you can\u2019t predict when the price decline or bearish trend is going to end just like the current situation of bitcoin price. Entering the market at the wrong time could lead to a loss.\n\nBuying the dip seems to be a strategy for the bearish market because it is very obvious that the price of the asset has massively declined or crashed from its all-time high price. The bear market tends to be the perfect scenario for newbies to also learn how to buy bitcoin.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe dip of an asset is a great point of entry for traders because there is every possibility that it goes back to trade at that level or beyond. However, as explained earlier, it\u2019s still a risk, while the price might return to trade at a higher price, it could also crash further to an unexpected level. You might be tempted to buy the dip blindly when the price of an asset begins to decline, however, this might also be a wrong move. You need to critically analyze the market before buying the dip.\n\nWhat does it mean to cut your losses?\n\nCutting losses simply means selling an asset to protect your portfolio and avoid more losses. So when you decide to sell part of your bitcoin holdings because the price is dropping you are simply cutting your losses. To most traders, cutting losses isn\u2019t the best thing to do in a bearish market. However, it might just be what will save you from making further losses from your investments or even losing all your investments on an asset that is on its way to the bottom.\n\nBitcoin price continues to dip \u2013 What should you do?\n\nWhile many traders believe it is the right time to continue to buy bitcoin and build your portfolio. Some have hinted that this isn\u2019t the time considering the high volatility at the moment.\n\nBuying the dip depends on whether you are ready to take the risk. As we all know, this isn\u2019t the first time there will be a crash and unfortunately it won\u2019t be the last because of the high volatility of the crypto market. This isn\u2019t the first time bitcoin will experience a wild decline in price. In fact, the present crash isn\u2019t up to that of 2018 when bitcoin experienced a sharp decline after the boom in 2017. Bitcoin witnessed an 80% decline from the January 2018 peak. While price history hints at a possible recovery, it is important to only invest an amount you can afford to lose because you never can tell.\n\nIs cutting your loss an option?\n\nAs stated earlier, liquidating your entire portfolio in a bearish market isn\u2019t the best strategy. If you can withstand the risk, the key is to remain patient and hold on to your investments even if you are not adding to them. Rather than selling your BTC for fiat, you can consider diversification.\n\nWhat is diversification?\n\nDiversification simply means exploring other options. The bear market offers you the option to diversify your crypto investment portfolio and buy some good altcoins with solid use-cases and great growth potential. So instead of putting all your eggs in one basket, you can decide to spread your chances by buying these altcoins.\n\nRather than selling your bitcoin because of the falling price, you can sell part of your holdings for other assets. With this, you are reducing the losses that will be made when the price of bitcoin dips further.\n\nBefore the commencement of the bear run, a lot of businesses were adopting and people were learning how to buy bitcoin. The dip has however discouraged newbies and frustrated traders to sell their assets and cut losses.\n\nTo some, buying bitcoin at the moment may a dumb decision but long-term Hodlers know better, and they have a first-hand positive experience of buying the dip. Although the price could still dip further down, bitcoin has a good history of price recovery so buying the dip might eventually pay off. People who bought the dip in 2018 now have a good story to tell about Bitcoin.",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe Director-General, National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brigadier General Shuaibu Ibrahim, has said that the scheme is determined to take unemployed Nigerians out of labour markets.\n\nGeneral Ibrahim said this when the management of the Sun newspaper, led by the Managing Director/Editor-in-Chief, Onuoha Ukeh, to pay him a courtesy visit in his office in Abuja on Monday.\n\nHe further noted that with scaling up of Skill Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Development (SAED) programme under his leadership, the management will ensure that every Nigerian who passed through the scheme will be equipped with relevant skills.\n\nWhile appealing to Nigerians and the private sectors to pick interest in matters concerning the scheme, he commended the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Bank of Industry among others for supporting the scheme.\n\n\u201cIt is a pleasure to have you, the management of the Sun newspaper. There is no doubt that the Sun is a big platform with wide reach. We appreciate the support of the management for publishing our programmes through editorial and advertorial.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that the Sun has a big stage for the scheme to partner. I want to assure you that we are going to take this relationship to the next level. We promote national integration and entrepreneurship simultaneously in NYSC. With integration there will be unity, peace, development and with these, corps members can be mobilised year in year out.\n\n\u201cIn the course of mobilising the corps members, we have come to realise that skill acquisition is very germain because white cola jobs are not readily available anywhere. While we promote national unity, we also give attention to skill acquisition this time during orientation and post orientation programmes. Our target is that Nigerian youths don\u2019t need to go searching for jobs after service.\n\n\u201cI am happy to inform you that the corps members that took advantage of our skills acquisition training are doing wonderfully well. We have our partners with the CBN, BoI, Access bank, Unity bank that provide start up capital through NYSC Foundation for them to set up their businesses after their service year.\n\n\u201cTo scale up our mission, we have appealed to the federal government on the need to have NYSC Trust Fund which will be made available as start up capital for all corps members. One of our cardinal focus is to make those that passed through the Scheme self reliant.\n\n\u201cOur target is to take many unemployed Nigerians of the labour markets. We have realised that these fresh graduates are digital in all there dealings. Once we can provide job for the unemployed Nigerian youths, I can assure you that we can go to bed and sleep.\n\n\u201cWe realised that the ones we empowered are not only doing well but also employing others. The joy of the whole thing is that they don\u2019t establish these businesses in their state of origin but state of residents which is part of the integration.\n\n\u201cI want to urge Nigerians to take interest in what the NYSC is doing. We also encourage the private sector to invest in the Scheme,\u201d he appealed.\n\nSpeaking earlier, Onuoha, who led the Sun newspaper management, had commended the management of the Scheme, assuring it of the readiness of the newspaper to provide its big platform to publish its activities and programmes.\n\n\u201cWe are happy to be here today and to underscore the importance of this visit, almost the whole members of the management team are on this visit. We came to strengthen our relationship with the Scheme and testify the good work you have done.\n\n\u201cThis visit is part of the efforts to liaise with critical stakeholders to celebrate with the organisations and commend those we feel are doing well.\n\n\u201cThe Sun has made tremendous improvements since inception till now including our press printing simultaneously in three zones like Abuja serving the north, Aba, serving the Southeast and South-South and Lagos, in charge of the South-West.\n\n\u201cAs the Voice of the Nation, we talk about everybody including the common, high and mighty in the society. We give voice to anybody who has anything to say.\n\n\u201cWe can testify for the successes you have recorded including last year during COVID-19 pandemic when the world economy was threatened. We also commend the efforts you have made within this two years you took over the mantle of leadership as the DG,\u201d he said.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

However, I will like you, as legislators to take note of this.\n\n\u201cMany of the people who are clamouring for restructuring are referring to the 1963 constitution.

          "text": "From Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu\n\nThe Anglican Communion, Enugu Diocese, has condemned the designation of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) as a terrorists organisation describing the group as agitators for fairness and equity.\n\nThe church stated this in a communique issued at the end of the First Session of its 18th Synod at Emmanuel Church, Achara Layout, where it expressed worry over rising insecurity in the country. It also threw its weight behind the recent ban on open cattle grazing by governors of the southern states of Nigeria.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 signed by the Chancellor, Prof. Offornze D. Amucheazi (SAN); Registrar, H.B.C Ogboko; Synod Secretary, Dr. Stanley N. Nweze and Archbishop/Bishop of Enugu, Most Rev. E.O. Chukwuma also expressed displeasure over what it described as religious denominational marginalisation in Enugu State.\n\nIt alleged that persons from a particular religious denomination dominated government appointments into public offices to the detriment of other denominations and urged the government to correct the trend. The Synod which had as its theme \u201cLet there be light and there was light \u2013 God\u2019s dominion over the sieges of life\u201d ended on Sunday.\n\nPart of the communique read: \u201cThe synod is burdened with the predominance of persons from a particular religious denomination in Enugu State government\u2019s appointments into public offices to the detriment of other denominations, particularly the Anglican Communion. The synod enjoins the government of Enugu State to ensure equitable and fair distribution of appointments among the religious denominations in the state and also plead that our mission schools be returned to the church.\n\n\u201cThe synod notes that IPOB is not a terrorist organisation, but are agitators for fairness and equity. The synod urges the Federal Government to dialogue with various groups agitating for self determination in Nigeria, such as IPOB and others with a view to addressing issues surrounding the agitations. The synod expresses its support to the recent ban on open cattle grazing by the governors of the southern states of Nigeria and supports the call for the adoption of the modern technique of cattle ranching as a panacea for the incessant invasion of farmers and farmlands by marauding herdsmen. The synod however, urges the governors to give legal backing to the decision, to enable it be implemented effectively.\n\n\u201cThe synod bemoans the rising insecurity in the country to wit: the menace of unknown gunmen, unscrupulous activities of Fulani herdsmen armed with AK47, kidnappers and bandits. The synod calls on the Federal Government to ensure that all criminal elements face the law irrespective of religion, tribe or ethnicity. The synod condemns the attacks on public infrastructures and police stations and accompanying killings, especially in the South East, and urges the security agents to fish out the perpetrators.\n\n\u201cThe synod compliments the maturity and peaceful disposition that have so far characterised the campaigns for the November 6, 2021 Governorship election in Anambra State. The synod urges the contestants and stakeholders to sustain the peace in the State. The synod enjoins the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct a credible election.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "FRONTLINE gubernatorial aspirant for the November 6, 2021 election in Anambra State, Dr. George Moghalu, has declared that contrary to suggestions in some quarters, there was no governorship primary by the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Anambra State last Saturday.\n\nAddressing a press conference at the Valencia Hotel, Wuse 2, Abuja, yesterday, Dr. Moghalu disclosed that \u201cin a few locations in the state, election materials arrived late in the evening, after both voters and officials had dispersed and long past the time, when it was possible to conduct even a semblance of an election.\u201d\n\nHe added that in the rest of the state, neither materials nor personnel arrived, stressing, \u201cAs a result, elections did not hold in any voting centre in Anambra State on Saturday, June 26, 2021.\n\n\u201cDespite this evident reality, the primary Election Committee appointed by the leadership of the party and chaired by the Governor of Ogun State, Prince Dapo Abiodun, went ahead to produce and announce purported results basedon nothing other than their fertile imagination and motivated by their private interests and arrangements.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, it is the motivation of those private interests that caused them to produce results so dubious that they have made themselves and our great party the subject of derision across the state and in the country.\u201d\n\nMoghalu, who disclosed that he has served the party in different capacities, declared that he would follow every legal path to ensure that the rights are done, stating his belief that APC leadership would do all in its power to organize a governorship primary in Anambra State.\n\nInsisting that the manufactured results would not stand, Moghalu, who is also the Managing Director of Nigeria Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA), stated: \u201cAs we, speak no major television station in the country has one recorded video clip of elections taking place anywehere in Anambra State.\n\n\u201cYet, there are thousands of videos showing voters across the state complaining bitterly about the fact that neither the materials nor the personnel for elections was provided in their locales. The arrogant incompetence of the farce orchaestrated by Prince (Dr.) Dapo Abiodun, his team and the people they answer to insults every man and woman in Anambra State.\n\n\u201cThe committee has abused its authority and participated in the corruption of the democratic ideals of the progressive movement. They have sought to rubbish the hardwork and sacrifice that has gone into building the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Anambra State. Their actions are an insult to good conscience bordering on the criminal. And I reject these results in their entirety and without the slightest reservation.\u201d\n\nHe therefore called on the national leadership of APC and all those in the party, who still believe in the promise of democracy and good governance, who are committed to protecting respect for electoral processes and ensuring the rule of law to act now and ensure that primary elections are are properly conducted in Anambra State.\n\nHe maintained that members of the party can choose a candidate with character and integrity to lead the party to the Government House in Awka on November 6, 2021.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "By James Emejo\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has approved the release of 50,000 metric tonnes of maize to 12 major producers to control the price of the commodity.\n\nThe bank said yesterday that the latest rollout of the commodity from the Strategic Maize Reserve (SMR) under the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP) to companies would be the third intervention by the CBN in recent times.\n\nIt stated that the release of the grains is aimed at checkmating the activities of middlemen hoarding the product to cause artificial scarcity.\n\nCBN spokesman, Mr. Osita Nwanisobi, confirmed the release of the grains in a statement yesterday and expressed optimism that the release would crash the price of maize, reduce pressure on the market, and make the product directly available to feed producers, thereby reducing the price of poultry feed.\n\nHe added that as part of the bank\u2019s financing framework, the CBN would continue to facilitate the funding of maize farmers and processors through the ABP commodity association, private/prime anchors, and state governments, Maize Aggregation Scheme (MAS) as well as the Commercial Agricultural Credit Scheme (CACS).\n\nAccording to the statement, the identified recipients of the grains included Premier Flour Mills, Crown-Olam, Grand Cereals, Animal Care, Amobyn and Hybrid Feeds.\n\nOthers are Obasanjo Farms, Zartech, Wacot, Sayeed Farms, Pandagri Novum and Premium Farms.\n\nReacting to the development, the National President of the Maize Association of Nigeria (MAAN), Dr. Bello Abubakar, urged middlemen to desist from taking advantage of the supply gap to hike the price of the commodity.\n\nHe assured the people that farmers will maintain reasonable pricing regime of the products.\n\nThe apex bank had while responding to the activities of middlemen earlier in January, released 300,000 metric tonnes of maize, a move which led to the reduction in the price of the commodity.\n\nAlso, the bank, in a renewed move to address the rising cost of food prices in the market partnered with the Rice farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) to distribute 27,000 metric tonnes of rice paddies directly to millers last week.\n\nThe direct allocation from RIFAN warehouses across 16 states of the federation followed the earlier sale of paddy aggregated as loan repayment under the ABP to millers from the rice pyramids unveiled in Niger, Kebbi, Gombe and Ekiti States.\n\nEarlier in February, maize farmers had criticised agitations by some groups for the importation of the commodity, describing it as a calculated attempt to further hinder maize production in the country.\n\nThey, however, said with current improvement in local production capacity and funding support from the CBN, under its Anchor Borrower Programme (ABP), as well as expectations that the COVID-19 pandemic will be better managed globally, the country should be able to achieve at least 25 million metric tonnes (MMT) before the end of the year.\n\nThey added that in the short-term, the price of maize, which had hit the roof in recent times, will drop within three to four months with the modalities put in place to achieve price reduction.\n\nAlso, the National President of MAGPAMAN, Dr. Edwin Oche, had stated that the CBN\u2019s massive investment in ABP had boosted maize production from eight million metric tonnes to about 20 million metric tonnes within three years.\n\nHe said local farmers had the capacity to grow enough maize to support both industrial use and local consumption.\n\nHe had said: \u201cToday, we shouldn\u2019t have been discussing this if not for the challenges encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cIf not for the advent of COVID-19 that affected food chains and production as well as agriculture as a whole both locally and internationally, we will not be talking about the price increase in maize per bag. We will not be talking about the increase in feeds, flour and all the derivatives from maize and others.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a global issue and as an association, we are dealing with it and strategically looking at the ways to ameliorate the problem by engaging the federal government and CBN and other partners to ensure we come out of it.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "PDP Warns Matawalle, Vows to Challenge Defection in Court",
          "text": "By Chuks Okocha\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday cautioned Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State against his planned defection to the All Progressives Congress (APC), stressing that his defection amounts to a decision to vacate office as no law allows him to cross over to any other party with the governorship mandate statutorily given to the main opposition party.\n\nPDP also informed the governor that his defection would be challenged in the court.\n\nThe main opposition party has dissolved the state\u2019s executive council as a precautionary measure.\n\nAddressing a press conference yesterday, the National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, said that the 1999 constitution as altered has no provision for independent candidate.\n\nHe specifically stated that the PDP will test the defection in a court of law as it is subject to legal interpretations.\n\nThe party said it was watching developments in Zamfara State as they concern reports of plans by Matawalle to cross over to the APC.\n\n\u201cThe PDP categorically cautions Bello Matawalle to know that his plans amount to a decision to vacate office as no law allows him to cross over to any other party with the governorship mandate statutorily given to the PDP through the ballot box, as already established by the provision of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and the standing judgment of the Supreme Court,\u201d it said.\n\nAccording to the PDP, \u201cA combined reading of Section 221 of the 1999 Constitution as the pronouncements of the Supreme Court in Faleke v. INEC (2016) is clear in holding that it is the political party that stands for election, that votes scored in election belong to the political party and that the candidate nominated to contest at an election by his party, acts only as the agent of his party.\u201d\n\nThe PDP also further cautioned members of the National Assembly as well as members of the Zamfara State House of Assembly not to allow themselves to be pushed into losing their seats as the provisions of the constitution are very clear in barring lawmakers from cross carpeting, except in a situation of a division in the political party upon which platform they were elected.\n\n\u201cThere is no division in the PDP to warrant a defection of any of our lawmakers,\u201d it said.\n\nThe party urged Matawalle as well as members of the National and State Assembly from Zamfara State to take caution.\n\nMatawalle had benefitted from a Supreme Court decision which, voided the primaries of the APC in the state and declared the election of the then ruling party candidates in the 2019 general election void.\n\nThe apex court had consequently directed that the party with the next highest number of votes should be declared the winner, paving the way for all the PDP candidates, including Matawalle that came second in the poll to be declared elected by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nThe PDP argues now that the position belongs to it and not Matawalle.\n\nMeanwhile, there are indications that the deputy governor of Zamfara State may not defect with the governor.\n\nThe deputy governor is the son of the former National Security Adviser, General Aliyu Gusau (rtd).\n\nA source at the PDP National Secretariat said the party has gotten confirmation that the deputy governor has refused to defect with the governor\n\nThe governor had last month sacked all the commissioners because of the fear that some of them will not go to the APC with him.\n\nAlso, it was gathered that some senior government officials may not defect with Matawalle.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Working Committee (NWC) of the PDP has approved the dissolution of the Zamfara State Executive.\n\nAccording to the spokesperson of the PDP, \u201cThe decision is in line with the provision of Section 29 (2)(b) of the PDP Constitution 2017 (as amended).\u201d\n\nThe party urged all party leaders, critical stakeholders and teeming members of our party in Zamfara state should, by this, be guided accordingly.\n\nFielding questions from newsmen, Ologbondiyan said that what happened at the Supreme Court in 2019 is different from all other defections as it is only political parties that sponsor candidates to elections and that there is no provisions for independent candidates in the constitution.\n\nHe insisted that PDP will test the defection in court if Matawalle eventually defects.\n\nOn the other cases of governors defecting, he blamed it on fear and intimidations as some of the governors in question have soiled their hands.\n\nHe maintained that these defections were not based on the love of the people but due to pecuniary interest of the concerned governors.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Sultan: Tribal Politicians Bent on Tearing Nigeria Apart",
          "text": "Calls for equal freedom, rights for all Nigerians\n\nBy Adedayo Akinwale\n\nThe Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III, yesterday accused those he labelled as tribal politicians of working for the disintegration of the country, under different guises.\n\nThe sultan, in a speech at the Northern House of the Representatives Caucus retreat on the Petroleum Industry Bill, said in Abuja that they were promoting divisive agenda despite the fact that the country was passing through multiple challenges and the government trying its best to improve the situation.\n\nHe added that Nigerians must enjoy equal freedom and equal rights to live peacefully and pursue their legitimate businesses in any part of the country they so choose, be it in the market or in the forest.\n\nHe said: \u201cToday, tribal politicians are bent on tearing the fabric of our nation apart under different guises. As patriotic and peace-loving Nigerians, we should not hold our arms and watch them destroy our unity. I, therefore, urge you, grassroots politicians, to continue to support the government\u2019s efforts in restoring peace and stability across the country as no nation can prosper under chaos.\n\n\u201cAll Nigerians must enjoy equal freedom and equal rights to live peacefully and pursue their legitimate businesses in any part of the country they so choose, be it in the market or in the forest.\n\n\u201cWe must reject all ill-conceived schemes that are divisive, schemes that are setting Nigerians against fellow Nigerians. We must abhor laws that are capable of causing inter-tribal or inter-regional disharmony. All men are created equal and the unity of Nigeria is sacrosanct.\u201d\n\nOn the PIB, Abubakar said Nigeria\u2019s economy had for more than five decades remained dependent on oil, despite the fact that the world is moving away from oil to clean energy.\n\nHe stated that it was of great importance for the National Assembly to treat the PlB as a priority before it is too late.\n\nAccording to him, God has blessed Nigeria with abundant hydrocarbon resources but the nation is yet to fully discover and tap these resources due to suboptimal regulations.\n\nAbubakar said while the country continued to talk about poverty, unemployment and the attendant insecurity, the nation was sitting on billions of barrels of hydrocarbon from Sokoto Basin to Chad Basin, and from Gongola to Bida and Benue Trough Basins untapped.\n\nHe added that the country should have a PlB that would encourage massive hydrocarbon exploration in those frontier basins, a PlB that would attract foreign investors to bring their funds and develop the resources.\n\nThe Speaker of the House, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, said the PIB was one of the most topical pieces of legislation before the National Assembly, stressing that he knows the lawmakers would want to be part of this important history.\n\nHe said there was a need for the parliament to put in place a legislative framework that creates a system that is not only globally recognised, but timely and apt in order to promote economic engagements within and outside the country.\n\nGbajabiamila added: \u201cThe only legislation on the ground now that regulates the oil and gas sector in Nigeria is the old 1959 petroleum bill. In a nation that is so developed on the African continent, and the global business we operate in the 21st century, a piece of legislation that took effect as far back as 1959 is not only obsolete but complete trash that cannot be practicable to develop our economy with.\n\n\u201cOf course, it may not be possible to avoid sentiments, but it is the belief of the leadership of the ninth House of Representatives that our sentiments must be tied to the mutual co-existence of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is our belief that our diversity should be our source of strength. It is our belief that our differences must not be translated into expressions of disunity among ourselves. If we look at all these things the best way they should be looked at, I believe that it will make Nigeria grow and continue to take the lead on the African continent.\u201d\n\nThe Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha, said petroleum had been a major part of the country\u2019s history, especially in its role to provide the much-needed resources for governance to operate at all levels.\n\nHe stated that since December 2008 when the PIB was first introduced into the National Assembly, it has not been passed into law, majorly because of the need to capture every interest.\n\nMustapha said in line with President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s desire to leave a lasting legacy by building a sustainable foundation for Nigeria\u2019s growth, he forwarded a revised Petroleum Industry Bill to the National Assembly. He said this was in line with a major aim of safeguarding the long-term macroeconomic stability of the economy.\n\nMustapha said it was gladdening that the passage of the Deep off Shore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contract Amendment Bill of 2019 served as a befitting signpost that the National Assembly would deliver on this promise.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs you finalise the bill, I would implore you to take a careful look at some of the areas that have proven contentious over time. These include; governance structure to balance community concerns of giving too much emphasis to oil companies and very little to host communities, oil and gas, royalty and taxes, provision of a favourable environment for future investment and the launching of new projects or increasing transparency in the operations of the Nigerian oil and gas sector. Because the truth about it is that every\n\ncommunity has claimed that they are not part of what is happening around them.\n\n\u201cSo, if there is increased transparency in the affairs of all the players in the oil and gas sector, we would have very little contentions like critical market reforms needed in optimal exploitation of the untapped potentials of the Nigerian oil and gas sector.\u201d\n\nMustapha assured the gathering of the federal government\u2019s continued support\n\nto the legislature and to look forward to a PIB that will put Nigeria on the path of\n\nsustainable economic growth.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

You have to applaud them if that\u2019s how they want to eat in Africa.\u201d\n\nSeun, who is the son of Fela Kuti, the late Afrobeat legend, also claimed that the media \u201cmisrepresent my dad for 58 years.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWizkid is a Grammy winner, nothing changes that for his music video. I was talking about music, like only four musicians have had their music nominated. No amount of Buhari\u2019s children\u2019s wailing can change that,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI have a friend who won a Grammy 20 years ago. He engineered a big hip-hop album and he\u2019s a Nigerian.\n\n\u201cThe Grammys is so wide. I was talking music and everyone wanted to [come at me]. Maybe, in their mind, they wanted to shade Wizkid and wanted to use me to achieve it. We can\u2019t allow their negative narrative to flourish.\n\n\u201cI saw the media misrepresent my dad for 58 years. If Nigeria\u2019s media got to the extent that they know they had a big interest in Nigeria\u2019s stability and the consciousness of young people, a lot of things happening will not happen.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaking a distinction between Afrobeat and Afrobeats while clarifying the reach of the latter, Kuti claimed Afrobeats thrived more in Nigeria because the elites spend more on entertainment than they\u2019re willing to on education.\n\n\u201cAfrobeats isn\u2019t just Nigerian; it\u2019s African pop music. Ghanaians play it. Nigerians are the biggest proponents. We\u2019re the major people putting it on the map. But let\u2019s not let our heads swell as Nigerian artistes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe think we\u2019re doing something special. It\u2019s special but we were only able to accomplish it because the Nigerian elites are the only elites I know that spend more on entertainment than they do on education. It\u2019s not a joke.\n\n\u201cIn Lagos alone, it\u2019s N5 billion every week spent for wedding parties. With this come event planners tailors, MCs, musicians. It\u2019s an amazingly booming sector, But UNILAG is still looking for a two billion Naira endowment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they found it. I saw the advert some months ago. You people should help UNILAG before your next party. Havard alone has a $65 billion endowment fund. It doesn\u2019t have to seek government aid to run grants.\n\n\u201cElites there knowing that perpetuating their own ideology is what secures their future. So they sponsor grants to shape the narrative. But, in Nigeria, our elites allow their narrative to be shaped by outsiders while they party.\u201d\n\nSeun also talked about his political party chairmanship bid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy restrictions are out of the way. I\u2019m about to do my new records, whatever comes next comes. Politically, we\u2019re working on MOP (Movement of the People), a political party. We need 24 reps in the states,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve raised 14. We have 1,500 volunteers now. It\u2019s growing faster than I thought. I\u2019m the chairman of the party. Chairman Seun. Now, I\u2019m pro tem. As soon as we have our convention, I can win the primaries and be confirmed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not running for office. The problem with Nigeria is that everybody wants to be in office. The real politics is party politics. That\u2019s where the policies and ideologies are developed and protected.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable. All rights reserved.

This comes more than two years after the last exercise.\n\nThis is an opportunity for Nigerians that are yet to register before to get their voters card, to enable them to participate in any election. The process is also open to people whose permanent voters cards (PVC) are damaged, stolen, or want to change their biodata.\n\nAs the voter registration exercise kicks off, INEC has announced guidelines to help people understand how the new process will work.\n\nHow can you register?\n\nThe INEC voter registration exercise will be done both online and in-person, according to Obo Effanga, Resident Electoral Commissioner at INEC in Rivers State.\n\nOnline registration: This can be done on a new INEC portal, where Nigerians can fill in all their details and print out the slip.\n\nINEC launched the dedicated portal last week. This is unlike the previous years where prospective voters queued in various centres to register and obtain their voter\u2019s cards.\n\nThe portal will help Nigerians start the registration process online and then make an appointment for a date and time to visit an INEC State or Local Government Area (LGA) office to give their fingerprints and complete the registration.\n\nWith the online portal, you can also apply to replace lost or damaged permanent voters cards or update your biodata. It is also open to people who have transferred their registrar or done any correction of names or other details.\n\nIn-person registration: After the online registration, you have to proceed to INEC offices at the local government area near you or any designated centre that INEC provides along with your printed slip. At the LGAs, a biometric capture will be done after which you will get temporary voter cards.\n\nINEC has warned Nigerians against doing double registration as the system would detect that and such a person\u2019s registration could be cancelled. They could also be liable to prosecution at the court and face the law.\n\nWho can participate in the Voter Registration?\n\nNigerian citizens up to 18 years who are yet to register\n\nRegistered voters that have issues with accreditation during previous elections can apply to have the agency fix the problems\n\nRegistered voters that want to transfer their voting points from one place to another\n\nRegistered voters whose voters cards have been damaged or lost can apply to replace them\n\nRegistered voters that wish to correct any information on their cards\n\nFor now, only the online exercise of the voters\u2019 registration has kicked off and INEC is yet to set a date for the physical registration.\n\nINEC has said it is targeting at least 20 million new voters to its existing 84 million voters as of 2019.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigerian businesses face an avalanche of losses as the Twitter ban continues",
          "text": "On Saturday the 5th of June, Wunmi*, a digital marketer lost a gig worth \u20a6600,000 ($1,200). The marketing campaign was to start the next day but she got a call from the client telling her they couldn\u2019t proceed anymore due to \u2018orders from above.\u2019 She was dumbfounded.\n\nThat same day, about 39 million Nigerians woke up to realize that they couldn\u2019t access Twitter except via VPNs. Internet Service Providers (ISP) in Nigeria like MTN and Airtel had blocked all access to Twitter.\n\nWhen Peju, owner of Abebi Organics, describes the day the ban was enforced, she recounts how the jokes kept coming until one by one people found that they could not tweet anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than two weeks since and the effects of the ban have been anything but humorous for businesses like hers who built their customer base on Twitter.\n\nThe ban happened a day after the Nigerian government announced an indefinite Twitter suspension. The minister of information had stated that the reason for banning Twitter was because the social media platform has \u201cconsistently made its platform available to those who are threatening Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nWhile still mourning the loss of the first job, Wunmi lost another one for the same reason.\n\n\u201cEverything felt like a waste. What was worse was another \u20a6700,000 ($1,400) deal ended up in the mud. The client paid \u20a6150,000 ($333) at least for the little job I had done,\u201d she said.\n\nThe effect on businesses\n\nFor many Nigerians, this ban has affected how they stay informed, build relationships and get opportunities. Businesses on the other hand have experienced a decline in engagements and sales.\n\nIn the case of Nifries, an online food delivery service that relies on Twitter to reach its audience, its customers aren\u2019t responding as they used to.\n\nFeranmi Ajetomobi, the founder of Nifries, explained that the Twitter ban has affected anon (short for anonymous) sales which drive about 20% of sales at Nifries. Anon sales happen when people surprise strangers or friends by buying goods for them without revealing their identity.\n\nHi @TereSagay_, Anon just opened a tab of N15,000 for you to pick whatever you want from our Menu! \ud83d\ude0d\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nKindly visit https://t.co/rmQIkQXPkD and send a DM of what you want \ud83d\udc9b \u2014 Sexy Suya Burgers \ud83c\udf54 (@ni_fries) June 15, 2021\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve realised that when we reach out to a few people and there\u2019s no response, It\u2019s either because they\u2019ve taken a break or the Twitter ban has affected them. How we know it\u2019s the ban is because when these people we reach out to come online, they attribute their absence to the fact that using VPN is confusing,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Habib who runs Smiley Socks, a clothing company that also thrives on the \u2018anon sales\u2019 phenomenon, sales via Twitter have been affected. He\u2019s also noticed that engagements with tweets have reduced.\n\nThis has made him turn to other channels. He\u2019s had to pay more attention to his Instagram page and work on his SEO for his e-commerce website to maximise conversations.\n\nHe\u2019s also started experimenting with TikTok and so far, the results have been astounding. One day after he opened a new TikTok page, it already had 100 followers. The few videos he\u2019s posted already have at least 500 views, with the highest being one with over 4,000 views.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy when you think about the fact that it\u2019s a new page and we are not following anyone. Despite the engagement, there\u2019s a bigger question of how we\u2019ll convert these numbers into sales. For now, we\u2019ll just do more influencer marketing and affiliate marketing as we figure out what works,\u201d said Habib.\n\nWunmi* who has lost two deals worth over $2,500 is now considering focusing on unexplored channels like IG Reels and TikTok.\n\n\u201cFor clients that do not mind me using VPN, I go ahead and use Twitter. Unfortunately, those clients are very few. No one wants to offend President Buhari at this time for fear of being blacklisted by the government or worse, getting forcefully shut down. Clients think of many negative scenarios of how the government can strike back, they sometimes seem hilarious, but can you blame them?\u201d she said.\n\nComparing Twitter to other platforms\n\nCharles Isidi, a growth marketer and digital consultant, agrees with the need to pivot to other digital marketing channels but has a word of caution. He has experienced the effect of the decline first-hand on his personal account. With followership of about 17,000, his monthly impressions have gone from as high as 3.8 million, to under 500,000.\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for April\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for May\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for June\n\nHe says the ban will affect advertising spend and results across other digital marketing channels because Nigerian Twitter users who are using VPNs will also have their locations skewed across every other app.\n\n\u201cIf your most valuable audience is in another country that you do not know, then how can you reach them?\u201d he said.\n\nHe also raised the question of whether people know how to use VPNs safely.\n\n\u201cQuite a lot of people use free VPNs. In the next six months, we might start experiencing a lot of theft. We\u2019ll have to be looking at how much we\u2019ve lost due to cybercrimes.\u201d\n\nBusinesses might need to move to other social media platforms but Twitter offers more favourable returns in terms of marketing efforts.\n\nCompared to other advertising channels, Twitter is a cheaper and less stressful channel.\n\nHe\u2019s been trying to run a billboard campaign for the past 3 months and has been stuck waiting for Lagos\u2019 paid advertising approval. For digital adverts, in less than an hour, the advert is approved and has started delivering value for the business.\n\n\u201cUnlike other social media platforms, take Facebook as an example. A typical page with 10,000 followers reaches 3% of your audience with a post. Meanwhile, on Twitter, an organic post can be retweeted. In terms of shareability and virality, there\u2019s a reason why people love Twitter. I can say something and even if I have just 100 followers, 3 million people can see that tweet.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s difficult on Instagram where you have to make the explore page or use a hashtag that people love to get a similar kind of result.\n\nHow much is being lost\n\nCiting a scenario, he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re currently managing a brand that has 20,000 followers, it\u2019ll get 1-3 million impressions on average. To be conservative, at a 0.1% conversation rate, the brand will have an average of 1,000 \u2013 3,000 new customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we put the average transaction value per customer at $3 dollars per month, that\u2019s an average of $3,000 \u2013 $9,000 dollars lost due to the ban. Let\u2019s put it across all the businesses in that range and you see that the number is massive.\u201d\n\nWith the Twitter ban, Nigerian businesses that have previously relied on the massive reach of the platform now face an avalanche of losses if the decision is not reversed soon.\n\nAnd if we were to be a little hopeful and imagine a world where the ban is lifted, how much irreversible damage has been done to the potential audience reach these businesses used to have? We\u2019ll find out soon enough.\n\n*Name changed to protect their identity.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Google, this week, announced the launch of two new initiatives to support African-founded startups and women-led businesses in underserved communities on the continent.\n\nThe programs include a $3 million Black Founders Fund for African startups and a $3 million Google.org grant to help women in low-income communities develop entrepreneurial skills and access funding.\n\nThrough the latter, Google is looking to support access to economic opportunity for women in sub-Saharan Africa with a $3 million grant to the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). The foundation will then provide entrepreneurship training, mentorship, coaching, and access to networks and key markets for at least 5,000 women via its annual entrepreneurship program.\n\nIn addition, seed capital in the form of one-time cash grants will be given to 500 African female informal business-owners in rural and low-income communities across Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and select francophone countries.\n\n\u201cWe believe this will enable and prepare these women who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to navigate their independent business journey through the critical start-up and early growth phase,\u201d Google said in a statement on its website.\n\nBlack Founders Fund debuts in Africa\n\nThe Google for Startups Black Founders Fund provides grants and technical assistance to early-stage startups led by black and diverse teams, with a goal of advancing the black community.\n\nLaunched in 2020 as part of a series of racial equity commitments to close a funding gap experienced by black entrepreneurs, the program has seen proven success in the United States, Brazil, and Europe, according to Google.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant has now expanded the initiative to Africa, a continent where indigenous startups are faced with insufficient starting capital and a lack of angel investors, and also find it difficult to secure financial support.\n\nAccording to Bosun Tijani, CEO of Co-Creation Hub (CcHub), which is partnering with Google on the Black Founders Fund Africa, the shortage of funding for African startups is driven by several factors.\n\n\u201cOn the demand side, there is an increase in the number of ventures emerging to solve the pervasive challenges that exist. As the number of ventures increases, the requirement for funding increases,\u201d Tijani told TechCabal.\n\nHe adds that while there has been improved investor confidence as a result of the success stories that have come out of the ecosystem, investors remain sceptical about the potential for huge exit opportunities. \u201cThis highlighted risk often dampens the quantum of funding commitment the ecosystem gets.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the number of African venture capital firms closing their funding rounds is not growing as quickly as the number of emerging ventures; institutions with long-term liabilities (such as insurance companies, pension funds, endowments) that match the VC asset class are not willing to support the development of the ecosystem because it\u2019s still nascent; and there are not enough government incentives required to encourage investments into the tech ecosystem.\n\nIn light of these challenges, Google plans to allocate the $3 million non-dilutive fund across a pipeline of 50 investable startups in Africa, with each firm receiving up to $100,000 in equity-free cash awards. Each selected company will also receive $220,000 in Google Cloud Credits and Ad Grants, as well as mentoring, technical, and scaling assistance.\n\nThe company is working with the CcHub, a leading tech community hub with a presence in Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda, to distribute the funding to the 50 selected companies across Africa.\n\nThe CcHUB team will be actively involved in the process providing insight and technical support from the selection process through to the final deployment of the capital, according to Tijani. \u201cWe will monitor and evaluate the performance of the companies that benefit from this catalytic funding,\u201d he said.\n\nWhich startups can apply?\n\nApart from having a black founder, the Black Founders Fund Africa (BFFAfrica) is looking for a startup that is headquartered in Africa or has a legal presence on the continent; building for Africa and a global market; creating jobs, has growth potential to raise more funding, and making an impact; has proven early traction (product in the market / pilots / MVP live / early revenue).\n\nThe founding team should be diverse, with at least one black C-level founding member; directly supporting the black community, and has the relevant expertise on board to be successful (either through their background or an assembled team).\n\nIn addition, Google is looking for technology startups with a live product in the market or businesses where technology is core to their ability to scale (not for consultancies or not-for-profits) as well as compatibility with Google products.\n\nThe inaugural funding for Africa is open to startups in 13 countries \u2013 including Botswana, Cameroon, C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.\n\n\u201cWe welcome all startups in these countries that meet the criteria to apply. Female-led startups that meet the criteria are also strongly encouraged to apply,\u201d Tijani said.\n\nApplications for the Fund are currently open until July 7th and eligible startups can visit goo.gle/BFFAfrica now to apply.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Nigerian Wealth management startup, Cowrywise Financial Technology Limited \u201cCowrywise\u201d, has secured an asset management licence from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe licence, dubbed the \u201cFund/Portfolio Management Licence\u201d, gives companies the right to manage funds and investment portfolios on behalf of retail investors. Per the SEC, only companies with such licence can develop and operate any product that pools investor funds.\n\nCo-founded by Razaq Ahmed and Edward Popoola in 2017, Cowrywise entered the digital wealth management space with the aim of giving more Nigerians access to a range of investment and savings products.\n\nHowever, SEC had not yet defined regulations for fintech companies playing in the investment space. Startups were left to take up the mantle of protecting investor funds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot being a fund manager itself, Cowrywise struck a partnership with a SEC regulated entity, Meristem Trustees Limited.\n\nThe company\u2019s plan to protect investors was to introduce a trustee who will act as a guardian to investor funds. According to the startup, this SEC-regulated trustee ensured that Cowrywise properly invested customer savings on its platform\n\nIn 2018, the company launched various retail investment schemes, and it says it now has up to 21 mutual funds with various risk categories, and up to three hundred thousand people now use Cowrywise in 2021.\n\nAccording to Ahmed, CEO of Cowrywise, the SEC licence not only validates the company\u2019s work, but it will help to improve investor confidence, and help it deepen its partnerships with other fund managers.\n\n\u201cWe can now decide to even build our own mutual funds, partner with other fund and portfolio managers to digitise their operations and expand their reach to first-time investors,\u201d Ahmed says.\n\nA public API\n\nThe Cowrywise app. Source: Supplied.\n\nAhmed says the company\u2019s plan is to capture 10 million first time investors by 2025 into regulated investments., and an important step going forward is to digitise the country\u2019s investment infrastructure.\n\nPer Ahmed, the company will be launching its public Application Programming Interface which other fintech companies and traditional fund managers can access to either launch their own wealth management products, or digitise their operations.\n\n\u201cWe want to help fund managers across the world access our services and open up more investment options to serve our customers in Nigeria better,\u201d Ahmed reveals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur investment API simplifies regulatory, compliance and technical hurdles. We\u2019ve been developing this for some time and the SEC licence eliminates the regulatory obstacles to launching such a product,\u201d he says.\n\nRecall that in January 2021, Y Combinator-backed Cowrywise raised $3m pre-Series A, led by Quona Capital which brought its total funding to $3.5 million since its 2017 launch.\n\nA closer look at SEC\u2019s licence\n\nImage by Daniel Bone from Pixabay\n\nIn Ahmed\u2019s opinion, this latest move signifies the SEC\u2019s interest in embracing the rise of fintech companies and giving their services the much needed regulatory backing.\n\nCowrywise\u2019s Fund/Portfolio Manager licence comes barely a week after SEC issued a sub-broker licence to Chaka, a startup that helped people trade stocks from companies like Amazon, MTN, and Airtel.\n\nHowever, the requirements for SEC\u2019s fund manager licence are more capital intensive.\n\nThe registration process involves four fees that cost a combined \u20a6800k ($2000). These include a filing/application fee, processing fee, registration fee, and sponsored individual fee.\n\nAccording to SEC\u2019s website, every fund manager must have, at least, three sponsored individuals with one serving as a regulatory compliance officer.\n\nThe commission requires a minimum paid-up capital of \u20a6150 million ($365k) This capital could either be in bank balances, fixed assets or Investment in quoted Securities.\n\nThe company would also be required to secure a current Fidelity Insurance Bond covering at least 20% of the minimum paid-up capital \u2014 \u20a630 million ($73k).\n\nInterestingly, SEC\u2019s January 2021 rule amendment states that fund managers must pay annual regulatory fees that amount to 0.25% of their total funds targeted at retail investors. They will also pay a 0.01% fee on their funds which are targeted at High Networth Individuals (HNIs).\n\nAnother section of this rule also states that fund managers can only develop or operate any product when the commission grants it prior approval or has no objection on that product.\n\nFlouting this rule could attract a \u20a6500k ($1200) fine and an additional \u20a610k ($24) for every day the violation continues.\n\nConsidering Cowrywise\u2019s position as a constantly innovative fintech company, it is not clear if this rule would be adjusted specifically for fintech companies.\n\nMeanwhile, the Commission has already given fintech startups without defined regulations until Q3 2021 to joins its incubation program, a very similar initiative to the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN\u2019s) regulatory sandbox.",

This acquisition could see Jiji strengthen trust amongst buyers as both companies\u2019 business models will be integrated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince Vladimir Mnogoletniy, Jiji Co-founder, said that vehicles have the largest listings on the platform, Cars45\u2019s network of inspection centres will ensure that vehicles are properly checked and evaluated.\n\nFind out more about the details of this acquisition and what it could mean for eCommerce in Africa.\n\nRead here: Jiji reportedly acquires Cars45 for an undisclosed amount\n\nLikely sign? Although questions have arisen about the viability of the classified eCommerce marketplace in Africa, past optimism expressed about this sector is most likely justified. This acquisition could be a sign of things to come. What do you think?\n\nNigeria begins online voter registration\n\nAfter the 2019 general elections held in Nigeria, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) announced on November 4, 2020, that another round of registration would begin in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nIn line with that announcement, an online Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) action is ongoing on INEC\u2019s continuous voter registration portal. It is set to go on for six months before the next general elections in 2023.\n\nThis registration is open to eligible voting citizens who want to get a voter\u2019s card for the first time or registered voters who need to review their voter registration, update information, or transfer voter registration to another polling unit.\n\nWhy now? Well, Mahmood Yakubu, INEC Chairman, stated that the aim is to enhance the voter experience by making the registration exercise faster, easier, and less crowded than before.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCould this be a sign? With this in place, it just might suggest that the country is closer to establishing a start to finish e-voting process on a large scale. Because, despite consistent calls from the National Assembly, the Nigerian Constitution hasn\u2019t been amended to fully adapt electronics in the election process.\n\nA good time to revisit this: Inside Nigeria\u2019s first-ever electronic voting exercise in Kaduna State\n\nOn the portal, you can pre-register for a PVC, update your information, apply for collection of your PVC, and request to replace a missing voter\u2019s card.\n\nI pre-registered today as a first-time voter, and the process was somewhat seamless and hurdle-free. But is that all there is to it?\n\nOur reporter, Victoria Fakiya, is trying to experience and document the process to make it easier for you; look out for a step-by-step guide.\n\nWill physical bank branches ever be irrelevant?\n\nIn the past few years, we have seen the rise of fintech startups lead to remarkable changes in how digital banking services are offered.\n\nBefore now, we have reported that in Nigeria alone, over 150 fintech startups generate annual revenues of over $5 million. And this has seen experts make optimistic projections about the sector.\n\nThe question of how relevant traditional commercial banks will be in the coming years is valid. Some experts have given their take on the possibility of physical branches becoming the dinosaurs of a very digital future.\n\nTemenos, a company that specialises in building software for banking services, partnered with The Economist Intelligence Unit to carry out a survey between February and March 2021 on the digitisation of banking.\n\nSixty-five per cent of the 305 senior global banking executives who filled the survey believe that branch-based banking will be dead in five years.\n\nThis might seem improbable, but one can argue that as technological innovations evolve and have a wider reach, there could be an existential threat to conventional banking models.\n\nBut, I suppose the uniqueness of the African market is something to be considered before making this assumption.\n\nWith a population of over 350 million unbanked adults in sub-Saharan Africa, the future of fintechs in Africa looks bright. It could have a tremendous impact on fostering financial inclusion in Africa. But, to make bank branches go extinct? Maybe.\n\nWhat next? A good option would be integrating digital innovation for financial services into traditional banking methods. Another 81% of the experts who took the survey believe that unlocking value from AI will be the key differentiator between winning and losing banks.\n\nLet\u2019s continue this conversation in the comment section.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nHow to set up an online store for your business on WhatsApp and Instagram in Nigeria.

Register to attend SME Clinic 2021 here.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that every serious business should have an online presence. This could be either a static or dynamic website for some, based on what is suitable for the kind of services you offer.\n\nIn recent times, social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp, have become important alternatives to owning an actual website.\n\nBuilding a website could cost between \u20a630,000 ($72.90) and \u20a65,000,000 ($12,150.67), depending on the agency approached for a costing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, the cost of maintaining a website depends on the hosting company and the hosting package.\n\nFor some, the pricing could be as low as \u20a610,000 ($24.30) for a year of hosting; however, the fluctuating exchange rate could have affected the cost.\n\nBeing present where your customers are is crucial, but for a small business trying to stay afloat, spending a lot of money on a website just might not be the priority.\n\nMore so when there are alternatives that arguably provide the same results in the social media-driven world we live in today.\n\nIn 2019, we wrote about small businesses in Nigeria preferring WhatsApp to Instagram. And while WhatsApp is still a favourite \u2014 especially with the introduction of WhatsApp Business and its Catalog feature \u2014 small businesses have also embraced Instagram to reach new customers.\n\nWith both platforms serving small businesses in Nigeria, here is a step-by-step guide on how to set up your own online store on WhatsApp and link it to your Instagram page.\n\nSetting up your WhatsApp Business profile\n\nBuilt with the small business owner in mind, WhatsApp Business is free to download and allows businesses to connect with their customers and highlight their products and services via a tool called Catalog.\n\nSetting up WhatsApp Business is pretty straightforward and can be done in a few steps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStep 1: Download and install the WhatsApp Business app from the App Store or the Play Store\n\nStep 2: Verify your business phone number\n\nStep 3: Create a profile\n\nStep 4: Create a catalog\n\nStep 5: Add item(s) to catalog\n\nStep 6: Copy catalog link for sharing\n\nLinking your Instagram to your WhatsApp catalog\n\nA while back Instagram introduced its Shopping feature, which allows businesses to tag their photos with products from their catalog, making it shoppable directly from Instagram.\n\nHowever, that feature has not yet been made available in Nigeria (you can see all the eligible markets here).\n\nBut this is where the magic happens. Following the steps below, you can seamlessly link your WhatsApp catalog to your Instagram account, making the photos on your page shoppable.\n\nStep 1: Create a Linkin.bio account\n\nSince you cannot add product tags directly to your photos, you need to create a central \u2018clickable\u2019 display of the photos on your feed. Using Later\u2019s Linkin.bio is the easiest way to do this. Here\u2019s how:\n\n1. Go to Later.com and create a free account (best done on a PC).\n\n2. Connect your Instagram profile.\n\n3. On the left panel, select \u201cLinkin.bio\u201d and set up your profile.\n\n4. Add your \u201cLinkin.bio\u201d link to your Instagram bio.\n\nStep 2: Linking your WhatsApp Catalog\n\nNow, when you share a photo on your Instagram profile with a product that you\u2019ll like to link to, you can follow the steps below:\n\n1. Post the desired photo on your Instagram profile.\n\n2. In the post caption, direct your audience to tap on the link in your bio to shop the product.\n\n3. Copy the corresponding WhatsApp catalog link for the photo.\n\n4. Go to your \u201cLinkin.bio\u201d page and select the photo you just posted on Instagram.\n\n5. Paste the link to the box on the left and click \u201cSave Changes\u201d.\n\nYour Instagram will now lead new customers and clients to the specific product on your WhatsApp catalog, where they can then reach you directly and make purchases.\n\nSo there you have it, a step-by-step guide to setting up an online shop on WhatsApp and Instagram.\n\n\n\nIf you already have one, please share how it has helped your small business in the comments section.\n\nJoin us at SME Clinic 2021 to learn more about how to market and grow your business online.\n\nSME Clinic by Techpoint is the largest training event for SMEs in Nigeria, attended by over 2,500 business owners.",

          "text": "In a scathing ruling, the Constitutional Court found former president Jacob Zuma guilty of contempt of court and sentenced him to a 15-month jail term, for his failure to comply with an order of SA\u2019s apex court to testify before the state capture inquiry.\n\nIn a majority judgment read by Acting Chief Justice Sisi Khampepe, the justices argued that it would defy logic to impose a suspended sentence in response to what has been a direct and calculated assault on the judiciary and SA\u2019s constitutional democracy.\n\nRead Also: What next after Zuma fails to shake off corruption charges?\n\n\u201cThere can be no doubt Zuma is in contempt of court. He failed to comply with an order of the Constitutional Court. Of course, society would receive benefit from Zuma\u2019s testimony at the state capture inquiry, given that the maleficence happened during his term. A cohesive order that is again defied would only further impune the integrity of the Constitutional Court.\n\n\u201cThe majority has no choice: this case is exceptional not because Zuma is being treated exceptionally, but as a result of the nature of Zuma\u2019s attacks on the judiciary,\u201d Khampepe said.\n\nThe full bench, led by Khampepe, heard arguments from the state capture inquiry in March. Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi for the commission urged the court to sentence Zuma to two years in jail. He discouraged the court from granting Zuma alternative relief, such as a suspended sentence or a fine.\n\nZuma has not opposed these contempt of court proceedings and has indicated no intention of participating in those proceedings.\n\nThe judgment by the court opens the way for the commission to force Zuma to comply with all lawfully issued summonses and directives of the commission and to appear and give evidence before it.\n\nThe Zondo commission, since it was first constituted in 2018, has heard through various testimonies from witnesses that during Zuma\u2019s years as the head of state, his close allies \u2014 such as the controversial Gupta family used their relationship with the former president for personal enrichment.\n\nThe verdict is likely to have major implications for the country and the governing ANC as Zuma sought to portray court rulings as part of long-standing ploy to discredit him. It is a strategy that served him well when he originally faced corruption charges related to the country\u2019s 1990s arms deal, with court appearances resembling political rallies. His strategy might also serve as a template for allies, notably secretary-general Ace Magashule, who are facing criminal charges and fighting for their political lives.\n\nOn January 28, the Constitutional Court ordered Zuma to comply with summonses to testify before Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. The ruling also directed Zuma to file affidavits and respond to questions at the commission.",

Most of our young people don\u2019t want to travel, but would like to remain here in Benin. We can source businesses here and create value in our state, and our young people will be excited.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to train between 10,000 and 20,000 software engineers in the next five years, to make us competitive like other countries, as well as position us as an emerging market in the area of technology.\u201d\n\nThe governor urged for more collaboration with the United Kingdom in the area of skills acquisition, fight against human trafficking, oil palm cultivation, forestry, forest conservation and regeneration.\n\nHe noted: \u201cWe just finished the first phase of Edo State Oil Palm Programme (ESOPP) where we gave out about 50,000 hectares of land to about eight Investors and groups. None of them was from the UK. As we make further investments, we look forward to working with you.\n\n\u201cWe would like to work with you in the area of forestry and forest conservation and regeneration. Our goal is to plant a minimum of one million trees a year over the next several years. We would like to collaborate and partner with groups to give them parcels of forest to manage for us, to preserve nature.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who commended the British government on the role played in the fight against human trafficking in Edo State, said the collaboration has drastically reduced the scourge and discouraged the youths from embarking on dangerous journeys abroad.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful for the assistance given to the state in tackling human trafficking, which has been a burden on us. We have made considerable progress that has led to taming the tide of human trafficking and discouraging our youths from taking dangerous journeys abroad.\n\n\u201cYour cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of offenders of human trafficking is encouraging, especially working with the state\u2019s task force.

We are here and have been talking to the governor and his team on how to bring economic development into Edo State, as well as supporting British businesses in the state.\n\n\u201cWe are also in discussion on various issues and challenges facing the state, like the issue of economic development, unemployment and human trafficking; how to tackle, prevent and support victims of trafficking.\n\n\u201cAlso, we are looking at cultural issues and artifacts scattered around the world, and the on-going dialogue to try and address the return and presentations of those artifacts to Benin City,\u201d he noted.\n\n...",

We are very happy that EdoBEST has gained global and local recognition.\n\n\u201cWe want to replicate the successes and achievements that we have made in EdoBEST to EdoBEST 2.0, which is meant to capture our secondary schools and higher institutions in our dear state.\u201d\n\nCommending the Chairperson, Edo State Universal Basic Education Board (Edo-SUBEB), Dr. Joan Osa-Oviawe, for ensuring the success of the initiative, Obaseki noted: \u201cI don\u2019t see how EdoBEST would have been successful if not for the person of Dr. Joan Oviawe and her team.\n\n\u201cYou have helped us build these children to primary six level, now, what is next? So, today we are going to unveil the EdoBEST 2.0, as a way to ensure that the gains of learning at the basic education level is sustained after the first six years.\n\n\u201cWe have made progress; we are not where we want to be yet but we need to accelerate. Our kids are now learning better; their level is about 70 per cent of their colleagues in Europe and Asia. They are far from where their colleagues in Nigeria are; that\u2019s not the standard.\u201d\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cWe want to be at 100 per cent: We want to extend this education transformation throughout the educational chain; basic education system, middle school, technical colleges and tertiary institutions.\n\n\u201cThe tertiary institutions are going to focus on producing certain kinds of manpower, particularly agriculture and healthcare, among others.\u201d\n\nObaseki further assured that his administration would make tertiary institutions in the state competitive globally, adding, \u201cour education system must deliberately work on our national values.\u201d\n\nOn her part, the Chairman of Edo-SUBEB said, \u201cTeachers attendance in Edo State today is 91 per cent, lessons completion rate as at today is 81 per cent and the focus is to achieve 100 per cent and perfection.\n\n\u201cWe also recorded 17 per cent increase in the enrollment into public schools in Edo State, which has amounted to 21,000 pupils coming into the system from the private schools.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic couldn\u2019t stop the progress of EdoBEST as teachers created over 7,000 visual classrooms to enable pupils continue with their learning, as contents were uploaded on our site to ensure continuity, despite global shutdown by COVID-19,\u201d she added.\n\nEarlier, in her welcome address, a pupil of Iguodala Primary School, Stephanie Osewengie, commended Governor Obaseki for improving the standard of education in Edo State, especially the basic education.\n\nShe said, \u201cEdoBEST has brought out the best in Edo children, putting them in the best position to compete with other children from well developed nations.

          "title": "Opinion: \u201cFarming can prevent Famine.\u201d -Daniel IGHAKPE \u2013 By DANIEL IGHAKPE",
          "text": "A Bible Chapter discussing about \u201cthe sign of Christ\u2019s presence\u201d \u2013 Chapter 24 of the Bible Book of Matthew, Verse 7 in particular, lists food shortages, or famine, among \u201cthe pangs of distress\u201d that will afflict mankind in \u201cthe time of the end.\u201d\n\nA recent newspaper report shows that 41 million persons are at risk of famine worldwide. Based on this report, \u201cThe World Food Programme (WFP), . . . warned that 41 million people in 43 countries \u201care teetering on the very edge of famine,\u201d up from 27 million two years ago.\u201d Conflicts, climate change, economic shocks, and soaring food prices have been identified as the main drivers of hunger. Currency depreciation in many countries has also been listed as a factor to the problem.\n\nThe World Food Programme (WFP), an agency of the United Nations (UN) said 584,000 people were experiencing famine-like conditions in Ethiopia, Madagascar, South Sudan and Yemen. Nigeria and Burkina Faso are also mentioned to be of particular concern.\n\nWhat can help with this threat of famine? David Beasley, the Executive Director of the United Nations World Food Programme, emphasized the urgent need for financial support. He said that the price tag to reach those 41 million people who are literally knocking on famine\u2019s door is about $6 billion. \u201cWe need funding and we need it now,\u201d he said.\n\nApart from funding, there is also a need to revive and transform our agricultural and food systems to, among other things, deliver improved nutrition. All stakeholders need to redouble their efforts in order to boost food sufficiency and improve nutrition. It is not just about feeding people, it is also about providing the necessary nutrients for a healthy life.\n\nAlso, Nigeria is currently grappling with security challenges, especially in the North-East and Middle-Belt areas of the country. This has also affected agriculture/farming in such areas, as many people are being hindered from planting or harvesting crops. In some cases, armed bandits insist on payments before farmers are allowed to have access to farmlands during the planting season. They return during the harvest season and extort money from farmers before any access to the farmlands is granted. This has contributed to scarcity of food and a surge in the prices of certain food commodities. This situation is made even worse by a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in which northern states such as Borno, Adamawa and Yobe, have recorded new cases. Also, what began as localized clashes between farmers and herders over access to land, has degenerated into a major conflict and loss of lives across northern Nigeria. If all these security challenges are properly addressed, it can reduce the high risk of famine.\n\nClimate change is another factor that contributes to famine. Climate change refers to the increase in temperatures of the atmosphere over a long period of time. How does climate change affect food supply? Floods and drought brought on by climate change make it harder to produce food. Erratic rainfall patterns can also severely disrupt local food production. As a result, the price of food increases and access becomes more and more limited, putting many at higher risk of hunger.\n\nThe primary cause of climate change is the burning of fossil fuels, such as oil and coal, which emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere \u2013 primarily carbon dioxide. Unless climate change is reduced by substantial reductions of greenhouse gases, it will greatly increase hunger and famine, especially in the poorest parts of the world.\n\nIt is also important to note that agriculture/farming can help to prevent famine. Preventing further spread of acute food shortages must start with producing food where it is needed the most. Prevention of famine must begin in the rural areas where people coping with high levels of food insecurity live. The focus in such areas should be on growing food where it is needed the most, and keeping animals alive. This can help to stabilize and increase local food production, in order to prevent a breakout of famine.\n\nIn more isolated rural areas especially, the critical role of local and backyard food production in keeping families alive cannot be overemphasized. The importance of sustaining livestock can also not be overstated. Also, just one cup of milk a day can make the difference between life and death!\n\nAdditionally, it is important that both private and public schools at all levels establish viable school farms. School farms are not just spaces for growing food items. They are complete learning zones, which largely succeed in taking learning to new heights. The knowledge obtained from practical sessions on the school farm helps not only to re-enforce what is taught in the classrooms. It also teaches pupils and students about eating healthy, about how food arrives our homes from the farms, and so on. It also equips the pupils/students with first-hand knowledge of agribusiness, which can help to prevent famine. Their learning should be brought right down to the community level, in terms of the most vulnerable people in the community. Some schools even encourage their children to do community service, and that is also a good experience for the children.\n\nGod\u2019s Word, The Bible, comforts us with the hope of a time when there will be no food shortage, or famine. Psalm 72:16 says: \u201cThere will come to be plenty of grain on the earth; on the top of the mountains there will be an overflow.\u201d (See also: Isaiah 49:10; and Revelation 7:16, 17).\n\nDaniel IGHAKPE (Mr.); (A Social Commentator).\n\nFESTAC Town, Lagos.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Mele Kolo Kyari, the group managing director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation has justified the plan to buy a 20 percent stake in the $11 billion Dangote refinery.\n\n\u201cThere is no resource-dependent country that will watch a business of this scale, which borders on energy security and has implications for fiscal security of the country, and you don\u2019t have a say,\u201d Mr Kyari said on Tuesday.\n\nHe spoke in an interview on Channels Television\u2019s Sunrise Daily, while also disclosing that the NNPC planned to borrow to pay for its shares.\n\n\u201cFor the Dangote refinery, we are not taking government money to buy it, which is the mistake that people are making,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are borrowing on the back of the cash-flow of this business.\n\n\u201cWe know that this business is viable, it will work and it will return dividends. It has a cash-flow that is sustainable because refinery business, in the short term, will continue to be sustainable.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why banks have come forward to lend to us, so we can take equity in this.\u201d\n\n\u201cDangote refinery will come into production by 2022. And what that will do is to deliver over 50 million litres of gasoline into, to be specific, our markets.\n\n\u201cWe are also working on our refineries, to ensure that we fix them. We have awarded the contract for Port Harcourt refinery rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cAnd ultimately we are going to close that of Warri and Kaduna very soon in July, so that all of them will work contemporaneously. The net effect is that you are going to have an environment where Nigeria becomes the hub of petroleum products and supply.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to change the dynamics of petroleum supply globally in the sense that the flow is coming from Europe today and it is going to be reversed to some other direction.\n\n\u201cWe will be the supplier for West Africa legitimately and also many other parts of the world.\n\n\u201cSo the meaning of this is, there is an opportunity that has been thrown at us. And I\u2019m not sure Mr Dangote wants to sell his equity in the refinery. I can confirm that it was at our instance that we started this engagement. He did not want to sell his shares in this refinery.\n\n\u201cAnd for us, as a strategy, we started this process long before Dangote started his refinery project. We take equity in very significant businesses that are anchored on the oil and gas operations: fertiliser, methanol plants, modular refineries and some other businesses that we are dealing with.\n\n\u201cIt is to expand our portfolio and also because we are the national oil company, we have the responsibility to guarantee energy security for our country. And there is no way you can have a say, except you have a seat on the board of these institutions. And that\u2019s why anyone that is going to construct a refinery that is in the excess of 50,000 barrels per day, we will talk to them, take equity in it, as long as we have the money to pay for it.\n\n\u201cFor the Dangote refinery, we are not taking government money to buy it, which is the mistake that people are making. We are borrowing on the back of the cash-flow of this business.\n\n\u201cWe know that this business is viable, it will work and it will return dividends. It has a cash-flow that is sustainable because refinery business, in the short term, will continue to be sustainable. That\u2019s why banks have come forward to lend to us, so we can take equity in this.\n\n\u201cWe are very proud that we did this. This is good for our shareholders, which includes all 200 Nigerians who will also be happily buying shares from this company if they had the opportunity. But now we have done on their behalf, so that ultimately the value will come to all of us.",

          "text": "Ahead of his defection to the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) Tuesday (today), the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has advised Zamfara state Governor Mohammed Bello Matawalle to reconsider his decision.\n\nSpecifically, the party said the governor stands to lose his seat in event of any defection.\n\nPDP National Publicity Secretary Kola Ologbondiyan stated this Monday while speaking to journalists at the party headquarters in Abuja.\n\nHe said Matawalle\u2019s planned defection is a decision to vacate office.\n\nOlogbondiyan said \u201cno law allows him to cross over to any other party with the governorship mandate statutorily given to the PDP through the ballot box, as already established by the provision of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and the standing judgment of the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cA combined reading of Section 221 of the 1999 Constitution as the pronouncements of the Supreme Court in Faleke v. INEC (2016) is clear in holding that it is the political party that stands for election, that votes scored in election belong to the political party and that the candidate nominated to contest at an election by his party, acts only as the agent of his party.\u201d\n\nThe PDP spokesperson also cautioned members of the National Assembly as well as members of the Zamfara State House of Assembly, \u201cnot to allow themselves to be pushed into losing their seats as the provisions of the constitution is very clear in barring lawmakers from cross carpeting, except in a situation of a division in the political party upon which platform they were elected.\n\n\u201cThere is no division in the PDP to warrant defection of any of our lawmakers. The PDP hopes that Bello Matawalle as well as members of the National and State Assembly from Zamfara state will take caution.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the National Working Committee (NWC) has approved the dissolution of the Zamfara State Executive of the party. The decision is in line with the provision of Section 29 (2)(b) of the PDP Constitution 2017 (as amended). All party leaders, critical stakeholders and teeming members of our party in Zamfara state should, by this, be guided accordingly.\u201d\n\nLawyers differ\n\nCommenting on the legal implication of Matawalle\u2019s move, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Yususf Ola-Olu Alli said several governors had cross carpeted to other parties in the past, saying what the governor was about to do was not new.\n\n\u201cI am not in a position to confirm or know what the governor will do next, but you must be aware that several governors have crossed carpeted to other parties before in this country and nothing happened,\u201d Ali said.\n\nWhen Blueprint further probed, the silk said: \u201cI won\u2019t provide any legal opinion on this matter.\u201d\n\nBut an Abuja-based lawyer and former Assistant Secretary of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Olatunji Salawu, cited the Supreme Court judgment in Amaechi versus INEC where the court ruled that Nigerians vote for parties and not individuals.\n\n\u201cIn Amaechi versus INEC, the Supreme Court expressly affirmed that Nigerians vote for parties and not individuals,\u201d he said.\n\nMy APC chair ambition intact -Yari\n\nMeanwhile, former Zamfara state Governor Abdul-Aziz Yari has described Matawalle\u2019s planned defection as a welcome development which won\u2019t jeopardise his ambition to lead APC.\n\nHe said the move indicated that APC was well built in Zamfara state, had more followership and doing better than other parties.\n\nHe spoke in Kaduna Monday after a consultative meeting with thousands of APC stakeholders from the 14 local government areas of the state to further push his ambition.\n\nYari said: \u201cWe welcome Matawalle to the APC. We hope his coming will be a good development and add value to the party in the state. As a party, we need as many people as possible to make the party bigger. We held this meeting to inform our people of our decision of accepting for the governor to be in our party.\n\n\u201cWhen the governor comes into our party I will call his attention to focus on developmental issues and insecurity in the state. I kicked against his joining the party initially because of the nature of the way the information reached us, but whatever my reasons are because of my people. Some of our people who I\u2019m representing are against his joining our party because they believe it would affect the oneness of the party.\n\n\u201cWe are welcoming him because it shows that we are doing the right thing and APC is well built in Zamfara state. Our performance in Zamfara, Bauchi, Kano, Borno and Lagos states is one of the things that attracted him. We hope it would come with a success for the party in future elections.\u201d\n\nOn his ambition to lead the party, the former governor said: \u201cIt is the people that chose me as their leader, it is not self-appointment. My aspiration is still in top gear, his joining APC will not jeopardise it. If the zoning favours my zone then it is 100%. Two things I am bringing to the party are reconciliation and unity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still pushing to be APC national chairman because I know I can do better than most of the people as former state party secretary, state party chairman, House of Representatives member, two-term governor and chairman Governors Forum.\u201d\n\nThe meeting was attended by ex-governor of Zamfara state, Alhaji Mahmuda Shinkafi, APC chairman in Zamfara state, former senators, former speaker of Zamfara state House of Assembly and other party chieftains.\n\nSenators Kabiru Marafa and Ikra Bilbis were however absent with apology.",

The contingent professionally and successfully dispersed the protesters and warned them not to embark on further protest and road blockade considering the existing warning against such action, issued by the Kaduna state Police Command a fortnight ago.\n\n\u201cHowever, at about 0930hrs, information has it that the students converged again and blocked the Gidan Waya-Kafanchan Federal Highway and were becoming unruly and riotous.\n\n\u201cAt a point the protesters blocked the convoy of a military sector Commander injuring him and one other. The situation resulted into a fracas where three protesters were injured in attempt to use minimal force to disperse the riotous students. The victims were taken to the hospital for medical attention but unfortunately one person died while receiving medical attention.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police Kaduna Command, CP UM Muri urged the students to embrace dialogue as it is best alternative way to express their grievances while assuring them of diligent investigation into the immediate and remote causes of the fracas that resulted to injuries to the students and the unfortunate loss of life.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not aware \u2013Provost\n\nIn his reaction, Provost of the College, Professor Alexander Kure told journalists the school was on mid semester break, saying he was unaware of the students\u2019 protest.\n\n\u201cThe incident happened on the highway. I was told by the security that one student was killed and another injured. I offered an ambulance to take the corpse to the mortuary, and the other person that got injured to the hospital for treatment.\n\n\u201cThe school was shut down yesterday for mid semester break and students are to resume next Monday. I don\u2019t know why they were protesting. The school was closed and we heard there was a protest on the road, and I am not privy to happenings outside the school,\u201d he added.\n\nNANS warns\n\nMeanwhile, NANS President Sunday Asefon, who received the news of the student\u2019s killing, registered the association\u2019s angst over the incident.\n\nHe said all organs and sister bodies of NANS nationwide had been put on alert to relocate to Kaduna state to further press home their demand from the state government.\n\nThe students\u2019 leader rejected in totality the recent spate of 1000% increment of school fees and other related fees in state-owned tertiary institutions in Kaduna state, saying, \u201cWe consider such increment at this time as insensitive, unreasonable, and unrealistic.\n\n\u201cNANS also rejected the attempt by the Kaduna state government, the Kaduna State University, or any other tertiary institutions to force an undertaken on parents and guardian of the students to remain in perpetual silence irrespective of the unfavourable policies of the government.\n\n\u201cThe governor should be ready to kill as many of us as he can through thugs and security and also build enough jail within the 21days that can accommodate thousands of Nigerian students.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, Comrade Asefon has led a NANS\u2019 delegation to a meeting with controversial Islamic cleric, Ahmad Gumi, to discuss matters of insecurity and incessant abduction of students.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Asefon said the students\u2019 body met Gumi on efforts to secure the release of Nigerian students in captivity.\n\nThe meeting came against the backdrop of some groups of students currently being held by bandits with little or no hope of return in sight.\n\nA breakdown of the groups revealed 136 pupils of Saliu Tanko Islamic school in Tegina in Rafi local government area of Niger state; eight students of Nuhu Bamalli Polytechnic, Zaria, Kaduna state; as well as some unspecified number of students of Federal Government College (FGC) Yauri, Kebbi state, were at the time of this report still in the kidnappers\u2019 den.\n\nOf recent, Gumi has been the lead negotiator for the release of innocent Nigerians, including students abducted by the bandits.\n\n\u2018Our meeting with Gumi\u2019\n\nSpeaking on the meeting with the popular Islamic cleric, Asefon said: \u201cI led the leadership of NANS to meet with Sheik Ahmed Gumi in Kaduna yesterday (Sunday). Our discussion centred on actions and efforts to ensure the safety and security of Nigerian students on all campuses and the release of innocent students in the captivity of their abductors.\n\n\u201cWe extracted commitment on continuous dialogue for the release of students in captivity and all-round efforts to ensure schools become safer so that our students can be free from the fear and trauma of kidnapping.\n\n\u201cWe must leave no stone unturned until our schools are free again.

          "title": "Why NNPC Is Borrowing To Acquire 20 Percent Equity In Dangote Refinery \u2013 Mele Kyari",
          "text": "\ufeff\n\nSolomon Elusoji, Lagos\n\nThe Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mele Kyari, on Tuesday explained why the national oil company is purchasing a stake in Dangote oil refinery.\n\nThe refinery is expected to begin production in 2022 with an installed 650,000 barrels per day capacity.\n\nIt has been touted as a groundbreaking project for energy security in the country and for the African continent.\n\nIn May, the NNPC announced that it plans to acquire a 20 percent equity stake in the private company led by billionaire Aliko Dangote.\n\n\u201cThere is no resource-dependent country that will watch a business of this scale, which borders on energy security and has implications for fiscal security of the country, and you don\u2019t have a say,\u201d Mr Kyari said on Tuesday while appearing on Channels Television\u2019s Sunrise Daily.\n\nHe argued that the decision was also driven by the profit potential of the refinery business.\n\n\u201cFor the Dangote refinery, we are not taking government money to buy it, which is the mistake that people are making,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are borrowing on the back of the cash-flow of this business.\n\n\u201cWe know that this business is viable, it will work and it will return dividends. It has a cash-flow that is sustainable because refinery business, in the short term, will continue to be sustainable.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why banks have come forward to lend to us, so we can take equity in this.\u201d\n\nWhat Mr Kyari Said\n\n\u201cDangote refinery will come into production by 2022. And what that will do is to deliver over 50 million litres of gasoline into, to be specific, our markets. We are also working on our refineries, to ensure that we fix them. We have awarded the contract for Port Harcourt refinery rehabilitation. And ultimately we are going to close that of Warri and Kaduna very soon in July, so that all of them will work contemporaneously. The net effect is that you are going to have an environment where Nigeria becomes the hub of petroleum products and supply. It\u2019s going to change the dynamics of petroleum supply globally in the sense that the flow is coming from Europe today and it is going to be reversed to some other direction. We will be the supplier for West Africa legitimately and also many other parts of the world.\n\n\u201cSo the meaning of this is, there is an opportunity that has been thrown at us. And I\u2019m not sure Mr Dangote wants to sell his equity in the refinery. I can confirm that it was at our instance that we started this engagement. He did not want to sell his shares in this refinery.\n\n\u201cThere is no resource-dependent country that will watch a business of this scale, which has bordering on energy security and has implications for fiscal security of the country, and you don\u2019t have a say. And for us, as a strategy, we started this process long before Dangote started his refinery project. We take equity in very significant businesses that are anchored on the oil and gas operations: fertiliser, methanol plants, modular refineries and some other businesses that we are dealing with.\n\n\u201cIt is to expand our portfolio and also because we are the national oil company, we have the responsibility to guarantee energy security for our country. And there is no way you can have a say, except you have a seat on the board of these institutions. And that\u2019s why anyone that is going to construct a refinery that is in the excess of 50,000 barrels per day, we will talk to them, take equity in it, as long as we have the money to pay for it.\n\n\u201cFor the Dangote refinery, we are not taking government money to buy it, which is the mistake that people are making. We are borrowing on the back of the cash-flow of this business. We know that this business is viable, it will work and it will return dividends. It has a cash-flow that is sustainable because refinery business, in the short term, will continue to be sustainable. That\u2019s why banks have come forward to lend to us, so we can take equity in this.\n\n\u201cWe are very proud that we did this. This is good for our shareholders, which includes all 200 Nigerians who will also be happily buying shares from this company if they had the opportunity. But now we have done on their behalf, so that ultimately the value will come to all of us.\n\n\u201cBut there is no way you can watch a business of this magnitude, of this sensitivity, to run without the involvement of the national oil company. No country does this.\u201d\n\nFuel subsidy\n\nMr Kyari also suggested that the inability to find an appropriate price for petrol has forced the continuation of the subsidy scheme.\n\nThe NNPC is currently the sole, official importer of petroleum products into the country.\n\nWhile its landing price is about N256 per litre, according to Mr Kyari, petrol sells for N162 to N165 in most parts of Lagos.\n\nIn March 2020, the Federal Government said it would allow market forces to dictate the pump price of petrol.\n\nBut after oil prices rose in the preceding months, the Federal Government decided not to adjust the price correspondingly under pressure from organised labour.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that we cannot afford it,\u201d Mr Kyari said.\n\n\u201cBut also the second reality is if you don\u2019t do something smart, you could end up throwing prices at Nigerians that are well above prices that they should pay for.\u201d\n\nThe NNPC chief said the government is still engaging with organised labour and other stakeholders on how to properly price the product.\n\n\u201cThe engagement is aimed at making sure there is a reasonable level of pricing that we can do that will recover the cost,\u201d he said.\n\nFuel smuggling\n\nMeanwhile, a huge chunk of the petroleum the NNPC pays for is being smuggled to neighbouring countries where they are sold at higher prices.\n\n\u201cPetroleum consumption in Nigeria is not up to 60 million litres per day, but we supply up to that,\u201d Mr Kyari said.\n\n\u201cWe always plan with 60 million litres, because anytime we do below that, there is a crisis.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged that there \u201care sharp practices which we are trying to control\u201d and \u201can organised cross-border smuggling of petroleum, which is associated with the price of petroleum itself.\u201d\n\nThe smuggling, he noted, is exacerbated by the fact that Nigeria shares borders with countries who have no choice but to transport petroleum by road.\n\nWhen borders were shut last year, the NNPC chief said, consumption fell to 52 to 53 million litres per day.\n\nAnd during the thick of the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, the number fell to about 42 million litres.\n\n\u201cIf everything works well and consumption is limited to our country, we are dealing with about 42 million litres,\u201d Mr Kyari said.",

          "text": "England will attempt to beat Germany in a major tournament knockout game for the first time since the 1966 World Cup final when they meet in Tuesday\u2019s Euro 2020 last-16 tie at Wembley.\n\nA relaxation of ticketing restrictions means 40,000 fans will be present, with both teams hoping to set up a Rome quarter-final with Sweden or Ukraine.\n\nThe Three Lions have only ever progressed from one Euros knockout tie.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible record really,\u201d said England boss Gareth Southgate.\n\nThat victory came on penalties against Spain in 1996, a tournament at which England eventually lost in the semi-finals on penalties to Germany. That defeat remains the only time England have been beaten in a major tournament on home soil.\n\n\u201cSomething we have spoken about over the last four years is that this team doesn\u2019t carry the baggage from previous eras,\u201d said Southgate. \u201cMany of them weren\u2019t even born when many of those things happened and it is an irrelevance for them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real opportunity to progress to a quarter-final, albeit against a team with pedigree and experience, but it is a game we are looking forward to.\u201d\n\nIf Germany lose \u2013 something they have not done in their past seven games against England at Wembley, winning five \u2013 it will be Joachim Low\u2019s last match as their manager. He is set to be replaced by Hansi Flick after the tournament.\n\nThe teams have had significantly different routes to the knockout rounds. England had a more comfortable group stage than Germany, beating Croatia and the Czech Republic \u2013 and drawing against Scotland \u2013 without conceding a goal to top Group D.\n\nGermany were six minutes away from being eliminated but Leon Goretzka\u2019s late equaliser against Hungary took them into the last 16 after a defeat by France and win over Portugal. All their group games were at home in Munich.\n\nSouthgate has a decision to make on midfielder Mason Mount and full-back Ben Chilwell.\n\nThe pair will be available for selection after completing their self-isolation period on Monday evening.\n\nThey had come into contact with Chelsea team-mate and Scotland player Billy Gilmour, who tested positive for coronavirus.\n\n\u201cThey are having to travel separate to the team and they have had individual training programmes this week,\u201d Southgate said.\n\n\u201cThe only sessions they have been able to do is join in with us when there hasn\u2019t been full team training, so they haven\u2019t been training fully with the team.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really complicated because there\u2019s the physical periodisation you want for a game like this, then there\u2019s the tactical side and they have been in a different room on Zoom for that having to dial in.\n\n\u201cBut they are young players who I think can get on with things pretty well, so that\u2019s the decision we\u2019ve got to make really, whether we think that what they\u2019ve been able to do will prepare them enough for the game.\u201d\n\nGermany defender Antonio Rudiger and midfielder Ilkay Gundogan are expected to be fit.\n\nChelsea\u2019s Rudiger (cold) and Manchester City\u2019s Gundogan (head injury) missed training on Sunday but were back for Monday\u2019s session in Bavaria before flying to England.\n\nThe German FA said the team were not allowed to train at Wembley on Monday.\n\nThomas Muller is expected to replace Leroy Sane after recovering from a knee injury.",

          "text": "Ethiopia\u2019s government declared an immediate, unilateral cease-fire Monday in its Tigray region after nearly eight months of deadly conflict as Tigray fighters occupied the regional capital and government soldiers retreated in a region where hundreds of thousands are suffering in the world\u2019s worst famine crisis.\n\nThe cease-fire could calm a war that has destabilized Africa\u2019s second most populous country and threatened to do the same in the wider Horn of Africa, where Ethiopia has been seen as a key security ally for the West.\n\nIt comes as the country awaits the results of national elections that Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed promoted as the centerpiece of reforms that won him the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nAbiy\u2019s transformation from making peace to waging war has appalled many observers since the fighting in Tigray erupted in November.\n\nSince then, the world has struggled to access much of the region and investigate growing allegations of atrocities including gang rapes and forced starvation. Thousands of people in the region of 6 million have been killed.\n\nEthiopia\u2019s statement was carried by state media shortly after the Tigray interim administration, appointed by the federal government, fled the regional capital, Mekele, and called for a cease-fire on humanitarian grounds so that desperately needed aid can be delivered.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement that he had spoken with the prime minister and \u201cI am hopeful that an effective cessation of hostilities will take place.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Mekele residents cheered the return of Tigray forces for the first time since Ethiopian troops took the city in late November and Abiy declared victory.\n\nThe Tigray fighters, loyal to the former regional ruling party that for years dominated Ethiopia\u2019s government before being sidelined by the new prime minister, undermined the declaration by waging a guerrilla war in the region\u2019s rough terrain.\n\nAs Tigray forces occupied the airport and other key positions in Mekele and broadcast a message telling residents to stop celebrating and go home, retreating Ethiopian soldiers shot at students at Mekele University, killing two and wounding three, said a nurse at Ayder hospital, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.\n\nEthnic Tigrayans, even those who didn\u2019t support the former ruling Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front before the war, say they have been targeted harshly for suspected links with the Tigray fighters. Ethiopia has denied it.\n\nBut Abiy in an interview aired last week alarmed observers by recalling that aid to Tigray during Ethiopia\u2019s devastating 1980s famine had bolstered the Tigray fighters who eventually overthrew the ruling regime. Such a thing will \u201cnever happen\u201d now, he said.\n\nMonday\u2019s cease-fire declaration signaled a new approach, at least for a while.\n\nThe cease-fire \u201cwill enable farmers to till their land, aid groups to operate without any military movement around and engage with remnants (of Tigray\u2019s former ruling party) who seek peace,\u201d Ethiopia\u2019s statement said, adding that efforts to bring Tigray\u2019s former leaders \u201cto justice\u201d continue.\n\nEthiopia said the cease-fire will last until the end of the crucial planting season in Tigray. The season\u2019s end comes in September.\n\nThe government ordered all federal and regional authorities to respect the cease-fire \u2014 crucial as authorities and fighters from the neighboring Amhara region have been accused of atrocities in western Tigray.\n\n\u201cThe government has the responsibility to find a political solution to the problem,\u201d the head of the interim administration, Abraham Belay, said in calling for the cease-fire, adding that some elements within Tigray\u2019s former ruling party are willing to engage with the federal government.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Tigray fighters, with whom Ethiopia had rejected talks. And there was no immediate comment from neighboring Eritrea, whose soldiers have been accused by Tigray residents of some of the worst atrocities in the war.\n\n\u201cIf Abiy has a genuine desire to find a political solution, first he has to undo the terrorist label against the elected government of Tigray,\u201d said Desta Haileselassie Hagos, who leads efforts to compile a list of those killed in the war. Abiy also needs to order the Eritrean soldiers to leave, he said.\n\nTigray in recent days has seen some of the fiercest fighting of the conflict. International pressure on Ethiopia spiked again last week after a military airstrike on a busy market killed more than 60 people, and after Doctors Without Borders said three staffers had been murdered in a separate incident.\n\nAmid the upheaval on Monday, the United Nations children\u2019s agency said Ethiopian soldiers entered its office in Mekele and dismantled satellite communications equipment, an act it said violated the world body\u2019s immunity. UNICEF last week warned that at least 33,000 severely malnourished children face \u201cimminent risk of death\u201d without more aid reaching Tigray\u2019s people.\n\nAt U.N. headquarters in New York, the United States, United Kingdom and Ireland called for an emergency open meeting of the Security Council. The U.N.\u2019s most powerful body has discussed Tigray behind closed doors but not in an open session. They need support from nine of the 15 council members to hold an open meeting.",

          "text": "Rescuers searching for a fifth day for survivors of a Florida condo building collapse used bucket brigades and heavy machinery Monday as they worked atop a precarious mound of pulverized concrete, twisted steel and the remnants of dozens of households.\n\nAuthorities said their efforts were still a search-and-rescue operation, but no one has been found alive since hours after the collapse on Thursday. Two more bodies were recovered Monday, bringing the confirmed death toll to 11. They were later identified as 50-year-old Frank Kleiman and 50-year-old Michael David Altman in a Miami-Dade Police news release that also named 52-year-old Marcus Joseph Guara as one of the bodies recovered on Saturday.\n\nMore than 150 others are still missing in the community of Surfside, just outside Miami.\n\nThe pancake collapse of the building left layer upon layer of intertwined debris, frustrating efforts to reach anyone who may have survived in a pocket of space.\n\n\u201cEvery time there\u2019s an action, there\u2019s a reaction,\u201d Miami-Dade Assistant Fire Chief Raide Jadallah said during a news conference. \u201cIt\u2019s not an issue of we could just attach a couple of cords to a concrete boulder and lift it and call it a day.\u201d Some of the concrete pieces are smaller, the size of basketballs or baseballs.\n\nUnderscoring the risks of the work, he noted that families who rode buses to visit the site on Sunday witnessed a rescuer tumble 25 feet down the pile. Workers and victims must both be considered, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen overnight. It\u2019s a 12-story building.\u201d\n\nRelatives continued their visits on Monday. From outside a neighboring building, more than two dozen family members watched teams of searchers excavate the building site. Some held onto each other for support. Others hugged and prayed. Some people took photos.\n\nThe intense effort includes firefighters, sniffer dogs and search experts using radar and sonar devices.\n\nEarly Monday, a crane lifted a large slab of concrete from the debris pile, enabling about 30 rescuers in hard hats to move in and carry smaller pieces of debris into red buckets, which are emptied into a larger bin for a crane to remove. The work has been complicated by intermittent rain showers, but the fires that hampered the initial search have been extinguished.\n\nJimmy Patronis, Florida\u2019s chief financial officer and state fire marshal, said it was the largest deployment of such resources in Florida history that was not due to a hurricane. He said the same number of people were on the ground in Surfside as during Hurricane Michael, a devastating Category 5 hurricane that hit 12 counties in 2018.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re working around the clock,\u201d Patronis said. \u201cThey\u2019re working 12 hours at a time, midnight to noon to midnight.\u201d\n\nAndy Alvarez, a deputy incident commander with Miami-Dade Fire Rescue, told ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that rescuers have been able to find some voids, or spaces, inside the wreckage, mostly in the basement and the parking garage.\n\n\u201cWe have been able to tunnel through the building,\u201d Alvarez said. \u201cThis is a frantic search to seek that hope, that miracle, to see who we can bring out of this building alive.\u201d\n\nOthers who have seen the wreckage up close were daunted by the task ahead. Alfredo Lopez, who lived with his wife in a sixth-floor corner apartment and narrowly escaped, said he finds it hard to believe anyone is alive in the rubble.\n\n\u201cIf you saw what I saw: nothingness. And then, you go over there and you see, like, all the rubble. How can somebody survive that?\u201d Lopez told The Associated Press.\n\nAuthorities on Monday insisted they are not losing hope.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue and work ceaselessly to exhaust every possible option in our search,\u201d Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said Monday.\n\nDeciding to transition from search-and-rescue work to a recovery operation is agonizing, said Dr. Joseph A. Barbera, a professor at George Washington University. That decision is fraught with considerations, he said, that only those on the ground can make.\n\nBarbera coauthored a study examining disasters where some people survived under rubble for prolonged periods of time. He has also advised teams on where to look for potential survivors and when to conclude \u201cthat the probability of continued survival is very, very small.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly difficult decision, and I\u2019ve never had to make that decision,\u201d Barbera said.\n\nAs time goes on, he said, teams will begin a process called \u201crapid delayering, where you take more risk by moving larger amounts of rubble, because you recognize you\u2019re running up against the time factor for survival.\u201d\n\nHow long a person can survive depends on a host of issues, including the availability of water, the severity of any injuries and the degree to which they are trapped, Barbera said.\n\n\u201cThe human dimension is huge \u2014 the uncertainty that you could be leaving someone alive behind by ending too early,\u201d Barbera said. \u201cFamilies continue to have hope, as do rescuers, which is why you continue to see them pushing so hard within these difficult conditions.\u201d\n\nThe ultimate decision to move into the recovery phase, he said, will have to be made \u201cwith the involvement of the political authority because they\u2019re the ultimate authority over this.\u201d\n\nThe building collapsed just days before a deadline for condo owners to start making steep payments toward more than $9 million in repairs that had been recommended nearly three years earlier, in a report that warned of \u201cmajor structural damage.\u201d\n\nA federal team of scientists and engineers are conducting a preliminary investigation at the site and will determine whether to launch a full probe of what caused the building to come down.\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology also investigated disasters such as the collapse of the twin towers on 9/11, Hurricane Maria\u2019s devastation in Puerto Rico and a Rhode Island nightclub fire that killed 100 people. Previous investigations have taken years to complete.",
          "summary": "Rescuers searching for a fifth day for survivors of a Florida condo building collapse used bucket brigades and heavy machinery Monday as they worked atop a precarious mound of pulverized concrete, twisted steel and the remnants of dozens of households.\nAuthorities said their efforts were still a search-and-rescue operation, but no one has been found alive since hours after the collapse on Thursday.\n\u201cEvery time there\u2019s an action, there\u2019s a reaction,\u201d Miami-Dade Assistant Fire Chief Raide Jadallah said during a news conference.\nThe work has been complicated by intermittent rain showers, but the fires that hampered the initial search have been extinguished.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue and work ceaselessly to exhaust every possible option in our search,\u201d Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said Monday.",
