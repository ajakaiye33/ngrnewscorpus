In September 2021, the Federal Government had estimated the cost of vandalised transmission equipment belonging to the TCN in Maiduguri, Borno State, at N1.7bn.\n\nAccording to Aliyu, the transmission infrastructure is being vandalised after every effort to install new ones; forcing the government to resort to alternative but less efficient ways to supply electricity to affected areas in Maiduguri. He added that TCN officials could not access some vandalised power infrastructure in Shiroro, Niger State, as they are situated within terrorist strongholds.\n\nAliyu, however, noted that his ministry was working closely with security agencies to access such areas and begin new power projects.\n\nGiving an on-the-ground detail of the vandalism, he said \u201cWe have a lot of challenges and it\u2019s not that we are sleeping over them. We have vandalism on our lines, vandalism on our stations, substations. We have those ones that affect us indirectly, and directly. Like vandalism around oil pipelines which affect gas and once you don\u2019t get gas to power, you don\u2019t get the megawatts. Once there is no power coming from the generators, you know what that means.\n\nThe second memo, he said, is to \u201cprocure power transformers and associated spare parts for the TCN to be deployed to six locations as follows: One is to Aiyede in Oyo State to MSSRS T and D technologies Limited. Offshore component is $1.8m. The onshore is N98m.\n\n\u201cThe second one is Gusau in Zamfara State, same project to MSSRS Basharri limited. The third one is Kankia in Katsina State, which is to enjoy the same project to be supplied by MSSRS Farmamade energy limited.\n\n\u201cThe next one is Minna, Niger State is also to enjoy some projects with MSSRS Crossworld global technology limited. Then the fifth one is to go to Okearo in Ogun to enjoy the same transformer.\u201d\n\nThe Minister said the total figure approved for the project amounted to $22,670,416.33 in offshore component and N5,141,924,927.2 in onshore component.",

Earlier today, we inaugurated the Vetland Junior International School, Agege which is the first modular, digitized school in the country. Our focus on education is in line with our belief that education is the fulcrum that would ensure a better society. Today\u2019s event is to promote merit and encourage healthy competition among our teachers.\n\n\u201cWhen we held the first edition last year, some people thought it was a fluke. Last year we gave out salon cars but now we are giving out 13 brand new sport utility vehicles. Recognising teachers is to help promote world class education in our state. I am happy to tell you that our huge investment in EkoEXCEL has been justified by the evaluation that was done.\n\n\u201cOver 15,000 teachers have been skilled up through local and international training. Also, our performance in WAEC exam has improved. In 2020, we had 38.79%, but in 2021, we had 81% which is inclusive of credit passes in English and Mathematics. We are not expecting anything less this year.\n\n\u201cIn February this year, we started the Comprehensive High School programme with 12 schools and we want the figure to hit at least 50 this year. The programme is meant to set our students on their career paths. We will continue to increase budgetary allocations to education and take the welfare of teachers as priority,\u201dhe said.\n\nThe governor also commended private school owners for the support.\n\nThe Guest Speaker, Mr Gbenga Oyebode, who is also the Chairman, Teach for Nigeria, said education has taken a new dimension with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe urged teachers to innovate and adapt to the new trend.\n\nThe Commissioner for Education, Mrs Folashade Adefisayo, lauded Governor Sanwo-Olu for living up to his promise of rewarding teachers in the state.\n\nShe said 3,529 applications were received out of which 22 got to the semi final stage.\n\nThe Chairman, Nomination Committee, Mrs Lai Koiki, explained that the applications were screened at four stages and the exercise done in transparent manner.\n\nShe announced that two of last year\u2019s winners went ahead to win national and international honours.",

Ibrahim Isiaka.\n\nIsiaka in his motion said he was jolted by the confirmation by the National Oil Spill Detection Agency (NOSDRA) on Saturday 25 June 2022 of a weeklong spill.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe oil leak is from Cawthorne Channel Well 15; an idle and isolated well on Oil Mining Lease (OML) 18. A large oil bloc located towards the south of Port Harcourt, Rivers State, operated by Eroton Exploration and Production Limited which has 45% stake in a Joint Venture (JV) agreement with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Limited atter Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) divested her interest in the bloc, in 2015. Informed that the Corporate Communications Lead of Eroton reported an oil leak. which eventually resulted to a blowout of crude oil and gas into the environment on 15th June, 2022. Whereas, NOSDRA\u2019s only reported the incident on 23rd June 2022 (10 days thereafter).\n\n\u201cAiteo Group, operator of another JV with NNPC, also reported an oil leak from its idle and isolated Santa Barbara oil well head 1 on OML 29 in Nembe Local Government Area (LGA) of Bayelsa State on 5th November, 2021. The leak, which persisted for 32 days, was alleged to have spilled hundreds of thousands of barrels of crude in the Santa Barbara River and its tributaries, which traverse three kingdoms in Bayelsa State destroying sources of drinking water, fishing and farming ecosystem. Over six months later, the cause of the oil leak on OML 29 is still unknown. Like OML 29, the unending phenomenon surrounding the current spill on OML 18 has not been conducted about 2 weeks after the occurrence.\n\n\u201cThe NAOC oil spill at OML 63 in Lasukugbena, Bayelsa State, which lasted over one month, yet the root cause analyses has not been officially determined till date. Curious about the postulation by industry professionals that in the light of current dwindling crude oil production output in Nigeria, up to 800,000 barrels of residual crude oil deposits can be obtained from idle and isolated wells across different oil fields in the country with huge economic benefit ta the country, similar to several oil producing countries around the world who have consciously developed a strategy in this regard\u201d.\n\nAdopting the motion, the House also asked the committees to ascertain the numbers of idle and isolated wells currently existing on Aiteo, Eroton and other indigenous and international oil companies oil fields across Nigeria, the condition of these wells and the status of their management and abandonment in compliance with statutory provisions and international best practice.",

I have since remained loyal to the Party both here at home and National level\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that despite our loyalty and efforts to prevail on the party for justice and fairness, the leadership of the party at the National HQ has continued to ignore our pleas and complaints that bother on the lopsided State Congresses, Local Government Elections, Party Executive Elections, the Delegate List, and recent Party primaries.\n\n\u201cThen, the refusal of the Ogun State Party Leadership to uphold the sharing formula as agreed by the various stakeholders and parties.\n\n\u201cIt is on this end that I have decided to resign my membership in the All Progressives Congress,\u201d the letter said.\n\nMeanwhile, there are speculations that Akinlade and other foot-soldiers of the former Governor might be on their way to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP.",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Esther Onyegbula\n\nIn a bid to reduce the high rate of unemployment in Nigeria, along with incessant ASUU strikes keeping millions of young people idle, Intelligent Innovations, an indigenous IT startup recently unveiled a youth-focused online training platform, SkillPaddy.\n\nSkillPaddy platform offers learners a three-month programme, and also assists participants to gain on-the-job experience and expand their opportunities with their partners and sponsors.\n\nAccording to the CEO of SkillPaddy, Kunle Erinle, the platform aims to not only address unemployment in Nigeria but help in bridging the productivity gap which presently exists in many industries. \u201cThe world is changing very fast. Today, eight out of the ten biggest companies in the world are in the tech industry. This translates to 10 million jobs in the digital technology space, with one million of these jobs open in Africa. Most of these jobs remain open year after year because people with the right skills are either not applying or nonexistent, it is a real challenge for us as a continent, and that is why SkillPaddy exists.\u201d\n\nThe platform will be officially rolling out its first batch of courses for roles that are in high demand in today\u2019s job market such as graphic design, mobile app development, business analysis, product management, software testing and many more. To further help our learners, our partnerships now extend to different fields including the Lagos State Employment Trust Fund, Honeywell Group, Chocolate City Group and others to help them transition into most industries that are now driven by tech. We are seeking more partnerships and hope to expand our array of courses and experts.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the event, the Special Adviser to the Lagos State Governor on Innovation and Technology, Olatunbosun Alake said that it is very important that companies like these are added to the education ecosystem to be able to deliver on competent talent so that the economy can grow. Talent is the actual component of economic growth. We have massive talent shortages, in manufacturing, technology, engineering, and medicine. So we need to increase the productivity of turning out talents. Companies like Skillpaddy are the missing link that needed to accelerate and implement what the universities are doing.\u201d\n\nExplaining further, Alake noted that the Lagos State Government through the employment trust fund has trained over 30,000 beneficiaries in different sectors. Specifically, in technology, we have trained about 4,000 tech beneficiaries who have benefited from the training that Lagos state has done. We have partners like skillpaddy that execute such training; it is these firms that help the government implement technology training. Apart from that, a lot of private companies also need to collaborate with academic institutions because academic institutions are structured, it is important that the private sector also partners with academia, in that way, we have a tripartite collaboration in education which will improve the output of talent in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe event which was held at the Oriental Hotel in Victoria Island, Lagos saw in attendance stakeholders from the public and private sector, as well as leading figures from Nigeria\u2019s IT industry.",

          "title": "Abducted train passenger shot in captivity The Nation Newspaper",
          "text": "By AbdulGafar Alabelewe, Kaduna and Nicholas Kalu, Abuja\n\nTerrorists have shot one of the remaining 50 kidnapped victims of the Abuja-Kaduna AK-9 train, identified as Mohammed Al\u2019Amin.\n\nThe negotiator, Malam Tukur Mamu, had raised the alarm about the deteriorating health conditions of the victims.\n\nHe said some have suffered from snake bites.\n\nAccording to Mamu, publisher of Desert Herald tabloid, the shooting occurred on Monday during \u201cfriendly exchanges of fire at the forest between the abductors that are guarding the victims and preventing them from possible escape\u201d.\n\nThe bandits had threatened to stop feeding their victims and start executing them within a week but there were pacified.\n\nMamu said though the shooting could have been accidental, \u201cit could also be intentional from them for the purpose of sending a message\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cKilling of their victims is something we know they can do. They have threatened to do that before.\u201d\n\nHe said the said Federal Government must take full responsibility if it did not act fast.\n\n\u201cThere has been communication constantly but government is yet to take a decision.\n\n\u201cI know what is in this crisis and that is why I keep emphasising that President Muhammadu Buhari must be prepared to take painful decisions, painful compromises if they are really committed to securing these innocent victims alive.\n\n\u201cWith what we have succeeded in doing, the windows and opportunity we opened, the government has the power to bring this to an end within three to four days.\n\n\u201cI assure them we can do it with their support and cooperation, and if it didn\u2019t happen, as long as the government does the needful, I will agree and accept to take full responsibility.\n\n\u201cCases of emergency such as this do not require unnecessary bureaucracy. I can confirm to you that the said passenger has been shot.\u201d\n\nMamu said he considered withdrawing from the negotiations for personal reasons, but pleas from family members of the victims, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi and government officials made him reconsider.\n\nHe said he pleaded with the abductors on Tuesday to free the shot victim so he can be treated in view of his critical condition, but the terrorists insisted they would not entertain any demand except the government met theirs.\n\nMamu urged the government to, in the alternative, deal with the abductors directly for a resolution.\n\nThe publisher fears for the hostages\u2019 survival unless urgent steps are taken.\n\nThe victims\u2019 families intensified their plea to the government to secure their release without further delay.\n\nTwo family members, who spoke on behalf of others during a visit to the House of Representatives yesterday, pleaded with the lawmakers to urgently intervene.\n\nThey were received by Bamidele Salam Manu Soro Masur, who represented 11 lawmakers that have been pushing for the release of the captives.\n\nThe wife of one of the kidnapped victims, Matilda Kabir, said it was shocking that one of the victims was shot.\n\n\u201cWe are here to plead with the House of Representatives. The news we are getting is not favourable.\n\n\u201cWe are here to beg them to help us. It is not funny again. The news we got this morning is that one person was shot. We don\u2019t know who is next.\n\n\u201cMy husband is there. We don\u2019t know if it would be any other person. Nigerians should help. My husband is in captivity.\n\n\u201cThey have been suffering. Imagine sleeping and standing there for 94 days. Please help us,\u201d she said.\n\nAminu Lawal Uthman said the news of one of the captives being shot was \u201cterrible\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are here to meet the right people to do the right thing to put more pressure on the Federal Government and security agencies to do more. Every second is very important,\u201d he said.\n\nSalam said it was horrifying to have children, the sick people and the elderly were being held in such a hostile environment.\n\nHe said they initiated contact with two persons directly involved with the negotiations on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe were talking to the government. We are also in talks with the negotiators, and we are very hopeful, that by the grace of God we would be able to get something tangible within the shortest possible time.\n\n\u201cI must also add that the Speaker met with family members some weeks ago and he is on the matter.\n\n\u201cWe are briefing him again on this matter to ensure he takes further steps to make government hasten to secure the release of the people.\u201d\n\nMasur said they would intensify the push in appropriate quarters to ensure the captives are freed.\n\n\u201dWe have heard and will continue to put pressure to get them free. We in the House will not stop. We share in their sorrow and pain.\n\n\u201cIt is our commitment not to leave any stone unturned in our effort to ensure the victims are released unhurt.\n\n\u201cWe will meet with the Speaker, the Chief of Defence Staff and other security agencies. We call on the Executive to do the needful.\n\n\u201cSecurity of lives and property is the primary responsibility of government. We have multiple efforts on the table,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Digital banking witnessed a huge surge in 2021, the World Bank has said in a report titled: \u201cGlobal Findex 2021 database\u201d.\n\nThe report, which was released yesterday, attributed the sharp rise in the use of digital banking services to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIt said Nigeria and other parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, experienced a continued rise in mobile money adoption, with 33 per cent of adults now having mobile money accounts \u2013 three times larger than the 10 per cent global average.\n\nWorld Bank Group President David Malpass said the digital revolution has stimulated increases in the access and use of financial services across the world and transformed the ways in which people make and receive payments, borrow and save.\n\n\u201cCreating an enabling policy environment, promoting the digitalisation of payments, and further broadening access to formal accounts and financial services among women and the poor, are some of the policy priorities to mitigate the reversals in development from the ongoing overlapping crises,\u201d Malpass said.\n\nThe Co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Bill Gates, one of the supporters of the Global Findex database, said the world has a crucial opportunity to build a more inclusive and resilient economy and provide a gateway to prosperity for billions of people.\n\nIn his reaction to the survey\u2019s report, Gates said: \u201cBy investing in digital public infrastructure and technologies for payment and ID systems and updating regulations to foster innovation and protect consumers, governments can build on the progress reported in the Findex and expand access to financial services for all who need them.\u201d\n\nThe database, which surveyed how people in 123 countries use financial services and fintech, unveiled the narrowing of the gender gap in account ownership.\n\nThe report indicated that \u201cas of 2021, 76 per cent of adults globally now have an account at a bank, other financial institution, or with a mobile money provider, up from 68 per cent in 2017 and 51 per cent in 2011. Importantly, according to the report, growth in account ownership was evenly distributed across many more countries, while in previous Findex surveys over the last decade, much of the growth was concentrated in India and China, pointing out that this year\u2019s survey, found that the percentage of account ownership increased by double digits in 34 countries since 2017.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic also led to increased use of digital payments\u201d, adding that \u201cin low and middle-income economies (excluding China), over 40 per cent of adults who made merchant in-store or online payments using a card, phone, or the internet did so for the first time since the start of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe same was true for more than a third of adults in all low- and middle-income economies who paid a utility bill directly from a formal account,\u201d saying, \u201c in India, more than 80 million adults made their first digital merchant payment after the start of the pandemic, while in China over 100 million adults did.\u201d\n\nAccording to results gleaned from the database, two-thirds of adults worldwide now make or receive a digital payment, indicating that the share in developing economies grew from 35 per cent in 2014 to 57 per cent in 2021.\n\nThe report said 71 per cent of developing economies have an account at a bank, other financial institution, or with a mobile money provider.\n\nIt said mobile money accounts drove a huge increase in financial inclusion in Sub-Saharan Africa. The survey also found that the gender gap in account ownership narrowed from seven to four per cent globally and from nine to six percentage points in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nHowever, despite the advances, many adults around the world still lack a reliable source of emergency money.\n\nIt said in Sub-Saharan Africa, the lack of an identity document is a barrier holding back mobile money account ownership for up to 30 per cent of adults.\n\n\u201dOver 80 million adults with no account still receive government payments in cash \u2013 digitalising some of these payments could be cheaper and reduce corruption. Increasing account ownership and usage will require trust in financial services providers, including confidence to use financial products, tailored product design, and a strong and enforced consumer protection framework.\u201d\n\nThe Global Findex database is produced by the World Bank every three years in collaboration with Gallup, Inc.\n\nIn Nigeria, the need to streamline payments and deepen financial literacy, has led the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to introduce series of measures and policies aimed at enhancing financial inclusion by encouraging people to open bank accounts rather than keeping cash at home.",

          "text": "By Gbade Ogunwale, Abuja; Uja Emmanuel, Makurdi and Rasaq Ibrahim, Ado-Ekiti\n\nEx-Ekiti governor insists power must shift\n\nBenue governor faults Atiku on Wike\n\nPoor attendance at Osun campaign council initiation\n\nThe post-presidential primary crisis that has engulfed the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) escalated yesterday.\n\nFormer Ekiti State Governor Ayo Fayose re-echoed the regional position on zoning, insisting that power should shift to the South.\n\nHe spoke a month after the party concluded its presidential primary in which Alhaji Atiku Abubakar was elected the flag bearer.\n\nAlso, Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom decried what he described as Atiku\u2019s \u2018insult\u2019 to Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike.\n\nHe said Atiku should explain why he did not pick the former presidential aspirant as his running mate.\n\nThe PDP candidate is from Adamawa State in the Northeast zone.\n\nAlso yesterday, the Osun State Governorship Election Campaign Council was inaugurated in Abuja with only two of 13 PDP governors present.\n\nMany leading lights of the 128-member council did not show up.\n\nThe poll holds on July 16 across 30 local governments in the Southwest state.\n\nThere were rumours on social media that PDP National Chairman Dr. Iyorchia Ayu had been suspended.\n\nBut, his Media and Communication Adviser, Simon Imobo-Tswam, urged the public to ignore the misinformation.\n\nHe attributed the report to the antics of mischief makers and idle minds.\n\nOrtom and Fayose had teamed up with Wike during the presidential primary.\n\nAlthough Wike was recommended by 14 of the 17-man committee set up by the party as running mate, Atiku later picked Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa.\n\nOrtom\u2019s interview with Arise Television gave a hint of a smouldering crisis.\n\nHe alleged that Atiku ignored the recommendation of the committee he set up to consider a suitable running mate for him.\n\nAccording to Ortom, 14 of 17 members, including himself, had recommended Wike.\n\nOrtom said: \u201cI was among the 17-member committee set up by Atiku and 14 of us in the committee said the person should be Wike. Unfortunately, Atiku picked Okowa. That is his wisdom.\n\n\u201cYou cannot ignore the decision of a committee you set up yourself and expect people to be happy. For now, I have gone into hibernation.\u201d\n\nWhen he was asked if he would support the Atiku/Okowa ticket, Ortom was non-committal.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am in hibernation. I am praying. When I finish the prayers and whatever God directs me, I will do. We expect Atiku to do more, but we are not seeing that.\u201d\n\nWhen it was pointed out to Ortom that Atiku has been making efforts to reach out to Wike, who has been avoiding the emissaries\u2019 calls, Ortom justified Wike\u2019s action.\n\nOrtom said: \u201cThey should stop that. Atiku should go to him. Why won\u2019t he ignore their calls? Is that not an insult?\n\n\u201cWike is a pillar in the party. Currently, nobody in the party has contributed more to the party to move forward than Wike.\n\n\u201cIf Atiku was not going to honour the decision of the committee, he should have called Wike earlier and informed him. He didn\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t do things anyhow and expect us to be happy.\u201d\n\nOrtom added: \u201cMy friend Wike deserves the vacation after what he has gone through.\n\n\u201cSome of us believe he (Wike) has the capacity and charisma to lift this country from bottom to top compared to what has been happening.\n\n\u201cWe have been taken from the top in 2015 to the bottom since this present administration came into power.\n\n\u201cSome of us believe that Wike has the capacity but Nigerians or let me say the PDP people did not give him the opportunity. Some of us rooted for him.\n\n\u201cI was amongst the 17-member committee that was set up by the candidate himself and the party and some of us said that for the vice presidency of the party, we needed Wike to be the vice president so that he can bridge the gap.\n\n\u201cWe (the committee) said it does not matter whether he supported the presidential candidate or not, all we are looking for is unity and how we can make things work.\u201d\n\nFayose: it\u2019s South\u2019s turn to produce President\n\nFayose insisted that it is the turn of the South to produce the next president after the expiration of two terms of eight years of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe believes it is in the spirit of equity, fairness and justice.\n\nThe former governor disclosed this in a statement via his verified Twitter handle (@GovAyoFayose).\n\nHe argued that Section 3(c) of the PDP Constitution provides for a rotational presidency.\n\nFayose, who did not mention the party and candidate he would be supporting in next year\u2019s election, urged Nigerians to await further details. He tweeted: \u201cThe PDP Constitution provides for a rotational Presidency. Section 3(c) provides that the Party shall pursue its aims & objectives by \u2018adhering to the policy of the rotation & zoning of Party & Public elective offices in pursuance of the principle of equity, justice and fairness\u2019.\u201d\n\nPoor attendance at Campaign Council inauguration\n\nThe chairman of the Osun Campaign Council, Governor Douye Diri, did not attend the ceremony.\n\nOkowa and his Taraba State counterpart, Darius Ishaku, were the only two governors that attended the inauguration.\n\nAlmost three weeks ago, PDP had failed to set up a similar campaign structure for Ekiti State ahead of the governorship election.\n\nAlso, PDP governors and national leaders refused to campaign for the candidate, Bisi Kolawole, who lost to the All Progressives Congress (APC) flag bearer, Governor-elect Biodun Oyebanji.\n\nWhile Okowa, who represented Atiku yesterday, explained that the presidential candidate was out of the country, Ishaku said he was representing Diri as deputy chairman of the Campaign Council.\n\nIshaku did not offer any explanations for Diri\u2019s absence.\n\nAyu did not attend the ceremony.\n\nThe Deputy National Chairman (North), Umar Damagum, stood in for Ayu, who was said to be on a two-week vacation and will be resuming on July 6.\n\nMembers of the National Working Committee (NWC) attended the ceremony.\n\nBesides the governors, most of the 128 members of the campaign council also did show up for the ceremony, which kicked off well over an hour behind schedule.\n\nDecrying the report on Ayu\u2019s suspension, PDP Spokesman Debo Ologunagba said: \u201cSuch report is completely false and a product of the imagination of mischief makers with the intent to destabilise our party, create an impression of crisis within our ranks and mislead the unsuspecting members of the public.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that the false report is the handiwork of vicious anti-people forces who are agitated by the stability, unity and soaring popularity of our party under the cohesive Sen. Dr. Ayu-led National Working Committee as well as the intimidating statures of our presidential and vice presidential candidates, His Excellency, Atiku Abubakar and His Excellency, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa respectively.\u201d\n\nOlogunagba said the party chairman has been on a short vacation outside the country and that he officially transmitted power to the Deputy National Chairman (North), Umar Damagum to perform his duties in an acting capacity.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is instructive to state that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was duly informed of the absence of our National Chairman and that Amb. Damagun will be performing the duties of the National Chairman in Acting Capacity pending Senator Dr. Ayu\u2019s return.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, the PDP and the NWC are united and Senator Dr. Iyorchia Ayu remains the National Chairman.\n\n\u201cThe NWC, therefore, urges all members of our great party, our teeming supporters, the media and the general public to disregard the said report as fake news,\u201d Ologunagba added.",

It is affecting revenue generation negatively and we want the honourable members to look into this.\n\n\u201cWe have a situation where two different types of evaluations are used on the same type of vehicle and you find a situation where, for example, you import a vehicle of N1 million and you are supposed to clear it with N500, 000. But because of valuation, you are now clearing the vehicle with N2.5 million.\n\n\u201cWe have a situation where some people have abandoned the vehicle they imported and go to the market to buy another vehicle with less the amount. As a result of this, some importers no longer want to bring in their vehicles through the Nigerian port.\n\n\u201cThe age limit for cars to be imported into Nigeria is 15 years. But Customs are not allowing that 15 years. They are giving us ten years and this is also affecting importation. You need to look into this.\u201d\n\nChairman of the Committee Leke Abejide assured the freight forwarders that the committee would ensure that a uniform procedure was adopted throughout the country to encourage importers to bring in their goods through Nigerian ports.\n\nAbejide described the \u201cstandard and no standard\u201d valuation method as illegal. He, therefore, called on NCS management to revert to one method of valuation for imported vehicles and other items.\n\nOn the recovery charge, Abejide said: \u201cWhat we will do is to invite the NPA authorities to come and explain what the charges are all about.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the e-valuation and VIN were aimed at improving NCS revenue generation and fast-tracking the process of clearing imported goods.\n\nThe chairman assured the freight forwarders that the House might ask for the suspension of the new clearing processes if they are creating more problems.\n\nHe said even though the law allows for the importation of vehicles that are not more than 15 years, the House might consider increasing their age limit.\n\nNCS Comptroller of the Western Marime Command, Abubakar Umar, told the committee members that the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes (UNODC) donated Video Teleconferencing (VTC) Cisco WebEx equipment \u201cthat aid our operations in the maritime industry.\u201d",

          "title": "2023: Cracks in PDP widen as party leaders blast Atiku",
          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo, Ndubuisi Orji and Okwe Obi, Abuja\n\nThere is no letup in the crisis rocking the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the emergence of former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, as presidential candidate and Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State as running mate has continued to draw the ire of some party leaders.\n\nThis is as plot to oust the National Chairman, Senator Iyorchia Ayu, thickens.\n\nWhile Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State said he was still praying for divine guidance from God before he decides whether or not to support Atiku, former governor of Ekiti State, Ayo Fayose, insisted that Atiku\u2019s emergence was a breach of the party\u2019s principle of power rotation between the north and the south.\n\nGovernor Ortom, who lamented that injustice was done to the Rivers Governor, said he can only support the presidential flag bearer if directed by God.\n\nWike had come second to Atiku during the PDP\u2019s presidential primary in May. Following Atiku\u2019s victory, a committee was set up by the party to choose his running mate. It was reported that among the three nominees presented to the committee, Wike scored the highest votes, but Atiku chose Governor Okowa, a decision that infuriated some of the governors who backed Wike for the position.\n\nThe PDP leadership had set up a committee with the mandate of nominating and submitting three names of probable candidates for the position of running mate to Atiku.\n\nAgainst widespread speculation that majority of members of the committee voted for Wike, the party had explained that the brief given to the committee did not include voting, but to nominate three names which would be forwarded to the standard bearer to choose from.\n\nAPC screens Tinubu, Amaechi, Umahi,... To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video APC screens Tinubu, Amaechi, Umahi, 9 others\n\nWhile announcing Okowa as running mate, Atiku said: \u201cIn arriving at the decision, I held wide consultations with various stakeholders in our party, including our governors, National Working Committee, Board of Trustees, and other leaders to seek their inputs and their wisdom. In these consultations, I made it clear that my running mate would have the potential to succeed me at a moment\u2019s notice, that is, a President-in-waiting. In other words, the person must have the qualities to be president.\u201d\n\nHowever, Ortom who spoke in a television interview, yesterday, said Wike was not consulted before the selection process despite his monumental support for the party over the years, even when other prominent faithful backed out\n\nHe said if Abubakar knew he had Okowa in mind, a panel should not have been set up in the first place to screen.\n\nOrtom said for peace to reign and for PDP to make a head way in next year\u2019s elections, the national leadership of the PDP should visit Wike and mend fences.\n\n\u201cWhen people ran away from this party, Wike was on the ground. Wike was the one that made me to return to PDP. Injustice was done to me in 2015, it was Wike that came here and convinced me to come to PDP. I came to PDP, we were working and you do injustice to him and you think he would keep quiet. This is not fair. I believe in justice, equity and fairness. It is not enough to say you will put a call to him, it is an insult to put a call to him, you go to him.\n\n\u201cThe party leadership at the national level should go to Wike and appeal to him. Wike is a pillar of this party, everybody knows. Wike was second to Atiku. Atiku should go to him but it is unfair to say that you just put a call to Wike. I have no problem with Okowa. Okowa is my friend. But Wike should have been consulted and spoken to. But the truth is that Wike should have been consulted in the first place even before the announcement because, like I said, 14 people said Wike should be the vice. If that was not going to work, he should have been told. The people at the leadership are to be blamed. They would have allowed Wike to have first hand information.\u201d\n\nHe said he was still praying for divine guidance from God before he decides whether or not to support Atiku.\n\n\u201cSome of us have resorted to prayers. I have been in hibernation. We\u2019ve resorted to prayer: \u2018Lord God, where do we go from here.\u2019 I believe as a Christian that power belongs to God. The Bible says a man can receive nothing, except it is given to him from above.\n\n\u201cI am praying. I have gone into hibernation. I am fasting and praying. So in the end, if God directs me that I should support Atiku, why should I not do it? After all, he\u2019s my party member. But I am waiting for him to do more. I expect him to reach out to Wike, who came second in the presidential primary\u2026I expect more explanations. I expect him to talk to Wike who we are supporting first. I expect him to reach out to some of us so that together we can work as a party.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, Fayose said on his official twitter handle that after having a president from the north for eight years, Nigeria\u2019s next president must come from the south.\n\n\u201cThe PDP constitution provides for a rotational Presidency. Section 3(c) provides that the party shall pursue its aims and objectives by \u201cadhering to the policy of the rotation and zoning of party and public elective offices in pursuance of the principle of equity, justice and fairness.\n\n\u201cThe current president of Nigeria is a two-term northern presidency, thus implying that it must be a Southern Presidency in 2023 or nothing. Awa \u2018South\u2019 lo kan\u2019. Nigerians should await details soon,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Group backs Atiku, berates Ortom\n\nHowever, the Centre for Integrity and Good Governance (CIGG) said the choice of who becomes running mate is the constitutional prerogative of Atiku.\n\nIn a statement by its convener, Mr. Waheed Aderibigbe and Co-convener, Mr. Obinna Ukariaku, it expressed shock that some Nigerians would jettison the provision of the constitution of the Federal Republic and choose to play to the gallery or even base their argument on emotional sentiments.\n\nIt cited Section 142 (1) of the 1999 constitution which states: \u201cIn any election to which the foregoing provisions of this Part of this Chapter relate, a candidate for an election to the office of president shall not be deemed to be validly nominated unless he nominates another candidate as his associate from the same political party for his running for the office of president, who is to occupy the office of vice-president and that candidate shall be deemed to have been duly elected to the office of vice president if the candidate for an election to the office of President, who nominated him as such associate is duly elected as President in accordance with the provisions aforesaid.\u201d\n\nThe group said Atiku in fidelity to the extant law exercised this power and privilege which the constitution vested in him, stressing that any input from the party stakeholders including the National Working Committee, the Board of Trustees (BoT), elders of the party, among others, is advisory.\n\nThe Centre faulted Governor Ortom, who said the party would have picked Governor Wike as Atiku\u2019s running mate.",

          "title": "Sule: Startups Need Resilience, Resourcefulness to Succeed \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "Finalist at the Visa CEMEA Everywhere Initiative and Managing Director, CarePay, Abayomi Sule, shares his experience as a tech startup providing solutions in the health sector and his emergence as finalist in the Visa competition. Emma Okonji brings the excerpts:\n\nHow will you describe the Visa Everywhere initiative programme, where tech startups like CarePay was given the opportunity to pitch their technology driven ideas and solutions?\n\nThe Visa Everywhere Initiative is an open innovation programme that helps startups unlock new growth and partnership opportunities. It also provides startups with a global platform to demonstrate their ground-breaking solutions. The process associated with the 2022 CEMEA regional finals was transparent and well organized. It was a delight for us at CarePay to have been selected as \u201cAudience favourite\u201d at the 2022 CEMEA regional finals.\n\nHow will such initiative from Visa help enhance the Nigerian Fintech ecosystem, especially in today\u2019s world of digital transformation?\n\nVisa is a global brand hence any initiative with the Visa imprimatur gives participating technology companies especially finalists and winners significant brand equity. It is noteworthy that about 450 fintechs of the over 1300 entries came from Nigeria and two Nigeria-based Fintechs were shortlisted among the five finalists with both participating Nigerian Fintechs taking home two of the three prizes up for grab at the finals. I think the significant participation and success of Nigerian Fintechs underscores the potential and impact of Nigerian innovators and the versatility and diversity of the Nigerian Fintech ecosystem. I expect that it will further buttress the attention and interest of local and foreign investors in supporting Nigerian Fintech players.\n\nYou were one of only five finalists chosen from more than 1,300 participants in the Visa CEMEA Everywhere Initiative. As a Nigerian startup, what exactly gave you an edge over the 1,300+ participants?\n\nI think our pitch and proposition were unique. We put forward our innovative healthcare merchant offers programme, which is probably the first of its kind in Nigeria and West Africa. The proposition allows subscribers enjoy discounts up to 37.5 per cent on their healthcare expenses at point of service across hundreds of healthcare merchants in Nigeria. The product has benefits to multiple stakeholders in the healthcare financing and payment ecosytem. We positioned the healthcare discount product as an enterprise loyalty benefit product which can drive affordability of healthcare services for Visa cardholders and drive increased revenues and brand equity for collaborating healthcare merchants, Visa partner banks and fintechs. Notably as well, in the post-pandemic era healthcare is a contemporary issue which requires all brands to do whatever they can to protect their employee and customers\u2019 lives and livelihoods \u2013 the healthcare merchant offers allows Visa and her partners to demonstrate their support and commitment to their customers/cardholders in this regard. In particular, the proposition and pitch must have struck a chord with the audience who voted us as the \u201cAudience favourite\u201d at the 2022 CEMEA finals.\n\nTell us more about CarePay solution, how it started, the challenges and the success stories from inception?\n\nCarepay is an aggregator of healthcare services for insured and uninsured individuals and households. CarePay exists to ensure that everyone, everywhere can afford the healthcare services they need. We want to provide everyone with a health cover. We innovated the healthcare merchants offers programme based on feedback from non-insured prospects which indicated they were undecided about health insurance and preferred to pay out-of-pocket. So, we engaged with healthcare merchants (pharmacies, clinics, medical laboratories and hospitals) to negotiate discounts off their standard pricing, which we aggregate, coordinate and pass on to subscribers and enterprises who partner with us. The greatest challenge was convincing tier 1 healthcare merchants to give us significant discounts on their standard pricing. Since launch we have seen significant uptake by individuals, households, and enterprises such as fintechs, banks and pension funds. The enterprises pass on the discounts to their customers as loyalty benefits to drive customer retention and increased use of their products especially debit or credit cards.\n\nStartups pass through a lot of huddles and challenges, before arriving at a solution that has real commercial values in the eyes of investors. How many times have you failed as a tech entrepreneur and what has been your motivating factor to succeed?\n\nFailure is the breakfast of champions. It is part of the process of success in entrepreneurship. I have had several failed ventures and projects. Slow growth of our allied business lines inspired us to engage with our non-customers and healthcare merchants who gave us insights into the drivers of their non-consumption of health insurance products. These insights led us to develop the healthcare discount card product.\n\nMy motivating factor to succeed has been the persisting drive to ensure that every Nigerian has access to the healthcare they need regardless of their financial status.\n\nMost tech startups will always say that finance is a great challenge towards achieving any form of success, but the investors who are willing to invest in startups, think otherwise. What is your take on this?\n\nIn our environment, the greatest obstacle is probably the time it takes to achieve product-market fit. The most important resource is the idea/product, which solves a social problem. If that product idea can solve/alleviate the problem of a significant number of people who are willing to pay partially or fully for the product, then the entrepreneur or startup has achieved product-market fit. Entrepreneurs and startups need resilience, resourcefulness and agility to press on or pivot until that product-market fit is achieved.\n\nHow will you describe Africa\u2019s growth in startup development, when compared with startups in developed countries of the world?\n\nThe development of the startups in Africa has been phenomenal. The rise of several unicorns in Nigeria and across Africa in the last five years attests to the development of the African startup ecosystem. These African unicorn startups are solving social problems and creating jobs and wealth at scale. Given that most countries in Africa are low-income economies, the average African startup is nimble, agile, and cost focused to serve the most people at the least cost. These startups have attracted a significant flow of foreign direct investment into the African economies as well. The African startup ecosystem might be nascent, but it is creating impact comparable to those in developed countries.\n\nHow can startup like CarePay contribute towards job and wealth creation of a nation?\n\nOur goal at CarePay is to ensure that people stay healthy or are restored to a state of good health with the most effective and efficient financial and payment means. We therefore help people to conserve their income by avoiding catastrophic expenditure on sickness. Our customers can be more productive at work, or they can earn more through investment of their financial resources and time which they might have otherwise spent on ill-health. We also work with healthcare merchants to grow their businesses through our demand aggregation products and liquidity products which provide them with access to working capital and asset financing. When the healthcare merchants earn more, they hire more medical and non-medical employees.\n\nSince the success of M-TIBA in Kenya, CarePay has opened its headquarters in Amsterdam to facilitate the international expansion of the platform to other countries, starting with Nigeria and Tanzania. How many countries do you think you can cover in the next five years?\n\nWe are poised to operate in at least five to 10 countries in the next five years. We have considerations to operate in additional African countries and we are actively exploring expansions to the Middle East, Europe, Latin America and Asia.\n\nWho is your role model, and what makes you unique and different from other startups?\n\nI have several role models however I would like to recognize one of them \u2013 Onno Schellekens, Group CEO at CarePay. I admire his impact before profit orientation. He is an effective mobiliser of human and financial resources who has been investing in African health systems and supporting African healthcare entrepreneurs for about two decades. He is also a dreamer and doer who never gives up. I am fortunate to work with him and others at CarePay.\n\nI find CarePay to be a unique startup as we are a multicultural organisation. We are also innovative and customer-centric in developing innovative mass market products, which make it easy and convenient for people to access and pay for healthcare services efficiently and conveniently.",

          "title": "Dikambi: Blockchain Technology Will Enhance Innovation \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "Key Executive at Binance, Carine Dikambi, speaks about the opportunities of blockchain technology and the need for its adoption and application in multiple industries. Emma Okonji presents the excerpts:\n\nWhat is BCAT2022 campaign all about and what does the campaign seek to address?\n\nBCAT 2022 is a blockchain and crypto awareness tour with the aim to drive blockchain adoption and increase awareness through offline connections and experiences highlighting blockchain impact, use cases and education. At a time when more Africans are seeking alternative means of transacting, as well as information about digital assets, we think it\u2019s important to provide the right information and adequate networks for young people to thrive. This is why Binance decided to sponsor the 2022 edition of the BCAT tour.\n\nWho are the target audience of the BCAT2022 campaign, and when is the campaign likely to cover all the geographical zones of the country, having started from Enugu in June?\n\nWith this tour, we are targeting crypto enthusiasts and newbies, some of which have heard about crypto but seek a deeper understanding. We are also welcoming to crypto operators and veterans who are keen on expanding their network of mission-driven blockchain professionals. In our industry, the importance of community cannot be overemphasized. The next few tour locations will likely be in Kenya, Uganda, Ghana and Cameroon. However, we will definitely have a few more in Nigeria in cities such as Lagos and Abuja.\n\nNigeria has a large population of youths with an innate potential to drive digital transformation. How do you intend to unlock such potential in today\u2019s digital era?\n\nAt Binance, we believe innovation, education and community are powerful ways to unlock this potential in today\u2019s digital era. This is why we consistently invest in talent, projects, infrastructure and education to provide a breeding ground for the innate potential to emerge. It is also why we are cultivating a strong blockchain community in Africa. There is a great opportunity to build world-changing applications when a pool of brilliant enthusiasts work together.\n\nGlobally, emerging technologies are transforming services in a way we\u2019ve not seen before and Nigeria and Africa at large cannot afford to be an exception. We also recognize the importance of resources in unlocking this potential and so, we invest in the continent through Binance Charity, our philanthropic arm.\n\nSometime last year, we also launched a $ 1 million fund for developers to aid building within the ecosystem.\n\nAs a leading blockchain ecosystem and cryptocurrency infrastructure provider, how can you empower Nigerian youths to take advantage of the opportunities that blockchain technology offers?\n\nAs a whole, African youths at large are provided with resources and tools to learn, build and scale through education and vocational initiatives. These youths are empowered through skills and education in order to become or remain employable globally.\n\nOur education initiatives have been very instrumental in this. In 2020, Binance rolled out the Binance Masterclass programmes across the continent to teach Africans the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies. The lessons are free to join and open to everyone. Currently, the masterclasses have helped to educate over 540,000 Africans, creating the educational infrastructure that Africans need to be financially free and informed.\n\nIn addition to training crypto users, Binance is equipping blockchain developers with the necessary skills to build solutions. For example, we hosted an eight-week masterclass where 1000 blockchain developers in Africa were trained in key skills. The participants also took part in a live demo showcasing newly built blockchain-based products.\n\nAside from blockchain technology, what other emerging technologies can you possibly deploy to boost job and wealth creation among Nigerian youths?\n\nWith the high rate of employment opportunities in Nigeria, I have seen more youth acquiring tech skills to be able to compete in the global talent market. At Binance, we focus on applications, infrastructure and skills within the blockchain industry as we are a blockchain ecosystem.\n\nHowever, emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (through chatbots, virtual assistants, for example), Virtual Reality and Cybersecurity Technologies also have numerous applications within the space and are being deployed in various capacities to boost wealth creation for young people.\n\nNigerian government is keen on diversifying the Nigerian economy to make it less dependent on oil. How will Binance contribute to the economic diversification, given your strong focus and belief in technology?\n\nBinance is committed to contributing directly and indirectly to economies across the world. This is why we are keen on blockchain education and infrastructure provision. As the biggest crypto educators on the continent, we\u2019ve seen how mainstream adoption, coupled with education has led people to earn a living within the industry \u2013 through employment, building on the blockchain, crypto trading and so much more. On discussions with policymakers, Binance is always willing to contribute and help in any way we can.\n\nCryptocurrency is one area that the Nigerian government frowns at because of the challenges in regulating it, yet several Nigerians and people worldwide are quietly benefiting from it. What is your take on this?\n\nCrypto is still relatively nascent and so regulators across the world have been trying to understand the technology. However, there has been some progress in that regard. For example, the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) in Nigeria recently published a set of regulations for digital assets while in Uganda the Central Bank has recently invited crypto firms to participate in a regulatory sandbox.\n\nI think the SEC working on regulations is a step in the right direction as it shows it is forward-thinking. Regulations go a long way towards building trust with consumers and institutions interested in the space.\n\nWe also welcome regulation as regulators share the same mission with us, protecting consumers while encouraging innovation as crypto users deserve safe access to emerging technologies and practices.\n\nHow will blockchain technology adoption complement other emerging technologies to drive digital transformation across multiple sectors?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, other emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality and Cybersecurity Technologies have numerous applications within the blockchain industry and are therefore complementary. The adoption of blockchain will provide an added layer of transparency and accessibility in a way people didn\u2019t previously have available to them.\n\nNigeria is preparing for the general election in 2023. How can blockchain technology enhance hitch-free electoral process?\n\nThe impact of blockchain technology on electoral processes is something I\u2019m excited about and look forward to being used in the future.\n\nAs the blockchain is a decentralised, secure, transparent and traceable network that allows people, companies, and governments to store and securely transfer information and records, it has several use cases for elections. Firstly, elections will become more transparent and easily auditable. This will reduce voter apathy as lots of Nigerians have lost faith in the country\u2019s electoral process as is evident by the constant decline in voter turnout through the years. Adoption of blockchain technology can also save costs as it reduces the high cost of ballot papers and security costs of insecurity and violence.\n\nBlockchain technology also offers benefits like increased efficiency, improved speed and a more accurate representation of eligible voters.\n\nDo you see the poor state of technology infrastructure affecting the successful deployment of blockchain technology in Nigeria and the rest of Africa?\n\nThe poor state of technology infrastructure can be a deterrent as well as an incentive for the adoption of blockchain. Across Africa, low uptake of traditional bank accounts and poor technology infrastructure are forcing people to find inventive, non-traditional ways of making money.\n\nHowever, poor infrastructure can also mean that Nigerians have limited, slow or no access to fundamental parts of the blockchain. This is why at Binance, we continue to build infrastructure across the blockchain ecosystem, bringing new services and financial opportunities to people around the world \u2013 and this includes Nigeria.\n\nAside poor infrastructure, what are other foreseeable challenges that could hinder the adoption of blockchain technology in Africa and how can they be addressed?\n\nSome challenges include users being frightened by technical jargon as well as susceptibility to scams. Our top priority is user safety and this is why we kicked off our education initiative \u2013 to teach crypto fundamentals, explain everyday use cases and ensure users know how to avoid scams. We also kicked off a campaign called My Crypto Life, an initiative that spotlights incredible crypto stories from people around the world, showing how crypto can be used by everyday people.\n\nTell us about yourself and your chosen career?\n\nCarine Dikambi is key executive at Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Carine is an avid blockchain and digital economy enthusiast and an accomplished fintech professional who began her career in investment banking in NYC. I obtained a Bachelors in Banking from Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes and a Master\u2019s degree in Management Sciences from Universit\u00e9 Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9. I also received a Certificate in Leadership Excellence from Harvard. After a successful career and over a decade spent in the financial epicenter of the world, I decided to move to Cameroon to focus on industrialisation initiatives and make an impact in the African tech landscape.\n\nI am the co-founder of Inoni Tech, a tech hub fostering innovation, entrepreneurial mindset and providing key resources and training to develop a tech-aware and financially literate population across Francophone Africa.",

          "text": "Emma Okonji\n\nThirty-eight of the world\u2019s 150 leading tech companies are on track to become carbon neutral by 2030, with several aiming to be carbon negative soon after, a report by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the World Benchmarking Alliance (WBA), has revealed.\n\nThe new report, Greening Digital Companies: Monitoring Emissions and Climate Commitments, documented the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy use of 150 of the world\u2019s leading tech companies.\n\nThe study strives to enable tech companies to adopt best practices, accelerate emissions reduction, and \u2018green\u2019 themselves to eliminate carbon-dioxide (CO 2) and other GHG output from their operations.\n\nAccording to the report, if other digital companies would emulate those currently leading in the quest for carbon neutrality, it could make information and communication technologies (ICTs) one of the greenest sectors of the global economy.\n\nITU Secretary-General, Houlin Zhao, said: \u201cTech companies are essential part of the global economy. This new study serves as a roadmap to drive all these companies towards net-zero emissions. This is the way to ensure today\u2019s digital transformation accelerates climate action \u2013 and to do so before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nOperational GHG emissions among the 150 companies accounted for 239 million tonnes in 2020, equivalent to 0.8 per cent of the world total. Yet digital companies \u2013 defined as those that produce and sell ICT equipment, operate telecommunication networks, and provide software and other information technology services, including data centres and cloud computing, have also become prominent in the race to eliminate harmful emissions.\n\nExecutive Director at WBA, Gerbrand Haverkamp, said: \u201cDigital companies and their innovative nature are indispensable drivers of change to build a future that is not only technologically connected, but also fair and sustainable for both people and the planet. This report is testimony that digital companies can and must play a notable role in the race to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and invest in solutions aligned to the Paris Agreement. We hope this research can incentivise companies themselves to learn from best practices, reduce their emissions, and improve their energy efficiency across all their operations.\u201d\n\nThe report further said from renewable power purchases and investments in carbon capture to issuing green bonds, these companies were at the forefront of global GHG reduction efforts. Digital companies accounted for seven of the top ten largest corporate purchasers of renewable energy in 2020, making up almost half of the renewables purchased globally that year.\n\nDirector of the ITU Telecommunication Development Bureau, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, said: \u201cIt is no secret that as we increase our use of technology services, networks and devices, energy consumption and emissions increase in tandem. But digital technologies can be part of the solution, too. They can directly address challenges related to climate change, help scale up renewable energy markets, support smart power grids and smart metering for buildings, and of course enable emissions reductions from our work through solutions like video conferencing.\u201d\n\nOverall, the 150 tech companies covered by the study consumed 425 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity in 2020, around 1.6 per cent of the world total. Of that amount, around one third was renewable.\n\nGiving details of renewable energy supply challenges, the report said low- and middle-income countries frequently face energy challenges, including limited electricity access or unreliable grids, resulting in over-reliance on dirty diesel-powered generator sets.",
          "summary": "The new report, Greening Digital Companies: Monitoring Emissions and Climate Commitments, documented the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy use of 150 of the world\u2019s leading tech companies.\nThe study strives to enable tech companies to adopt best practices, accelerate emissions reduction, and \u2018green\u2019 themselves to eliminate carbon-dioxide (CO 2) and other GHG output from their operations.\nAccording to the report, if other digital companies would emulate those currently leading in the quest for carbon neutrality, it could make information and communication technologies (ICTs) one of the greenest sectors of the global economy.\nITU Secretary-General, Houlin Zhao, said: \u201cTech companies are essential part of the global economy.\nDigital companies accounted for seven of the top ten largest corporate purchasers of renewable energy in 2020, making up almost half of the renewables purchased globally that year.",

          "text": "The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adamu Abdullahi has withdrawn from a suit filed against the Independent National Electoral Commission over the exclusion of former Senate Minority leader, Godswill Akpabio as the party\u2019s candidate in Akwa Ibom North West Senatorial District.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Akpabio had filed a case at a Federal High Court, Abuja, against INEC for excluding his name from the list of candidates for the 2023 general elections.\n\nAdamu who was said to be a party in the case withdrew on Monday after he realised documents allegedly presented by the former Minister were forged.\n\n\n\n\"Trouble started when words got to Senator Adamu Abdullahi that the documents filed in court were forged and that the Chairman was in for an embarrassment of monumental proportion that will expose both the National Chairman and the party to ridicule.\n\n\n\n\"The moment the APC National Chairman was drawn to the fact that Akpabio has once more approached the court with forged documents in his so-called Enforcement Suit, the party had to withdraw from the suit file on Friday last week.\n\n\u201cI can tell you authoritatively that Akpabio is on his own with the suit. He has caused more than enough damage to the APC in Akwa Ibom State and we can't aid him to wreak more havoc than he has already done,\u201d a source in the party alleged.\n\n\n\nResident Electoral Commissioner of INEC in Akwa Ibom State, Mr Mike Igini earlier said the commission would not recognise Akpabio as the party\u2019s candidate for the senatorial district.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on \"The Morning Show\", an Arise TV news and current affairs breakfast programme on Monday, Igini said it is the height of irresponsibility for the former Minister to fraudulently claim he emerged through a rerun election \u201cconducted by himself for himself in which he won.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to him, it is shameful that Akpabio can parade himself as a Senatorial candidate in an election that was successfully conducted and concluded on May 27, 2022, where one Udom Ekpoudom emerged.\n\nIgini accused the former Senate Minority Leader of taking his impunity a step further by tagging his illegality a rerun.\n\n\n\n\"Look, we are election managers, we know the meaning of rerun. A rerun election presupposes a previous election. And in a rerun election, the Supreme Court is very clear, it can only take place among those who were a part of the first exercise and Akpabio was never part of the exercise but at all material time a presidential aspirant,\u201d he stated\n\n\n\nHe also clarified that in spite of Akpabio's boasting that he has INEC in Abuja in his pockets and can therefore unilaterally substitute candidates as he pleases, the commission recognises only candidates who emerged from primaries it monitored.\n\n\n\nOn the crisis engulfing the state chapter of the APC which has resulted in the emergence of two factions, Igini said that based on the outcome of the APC State Congress held on October 16, 2021, INEC recognises Austin Ekanem as the authentic Chairman of the party who won with 1,278 votes while the candidate backed by the former Minister scored 006.\n\n\n\nHe alleged that Akpabio forged the original result and altered the result so that the candidate who scored 006 later scored 1,006 while that of Ekanem was falsified to read 278 instead of 1,278, and with the forged document, the criminality was taken to court where they fraudulently got a judgement that Ntukekpo won the election.\n\n\n\nThe INEC boss noted that though the process of conducting the primary or congress of political parties is the exclusive right of the parties, its duty is only to monitor and write a report, but that the report of the commission has consequences if due process was not followed.\n\n\n\n\"Our report can be very decisive. It cannot be ignored,\" he warned.\n\n\n\nThe INEC REC noted with dismay that despite that a Court of Appeal ordered a stay of execution, the APC National Chairman went ahead to swear in Ntukekpo as State Chairman in flagrant disregard of the court order.\n\n\n\nHe declared that as far as INEC is concerned, the APC did not conduct any governorship primary in Akwa Ibom and to date, neither Akpabio nor his faction has been able to name the Abuja INEC officials who monitored the illegal midnight primary that allegedly produced Akan Okon as Akwa Ibom APC candidate.",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date.

          "title": "\u201cThe future of work for African startups is in distributed offices\u201d and other ideas from VivaTech, one of Europe\u2019s largest tech conferences",
          "text": "May 14\n\nAt about 5:45 PM CET on May 14, I arrived at the Gare du Nord station in Paris, France. It was rowdy, with a mix of different people who had just arrived in the city or were about to leave. A typical sight at one of the city\u2019s 6 large mainline railway station terminals.\n\nI had travelled to Paris for VivaTech, one of Europe\u2019s largest tech conferences. Founded in 2016, VivaTech has hosted 36,000 startups, 3,300 investors, and numerous business leaders and innovators such as Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Ma and Tim Cook.\n\nI planned to arrive a few hours earlier for the Viva AfricArena event at Station F, but a 90-minute train delay made it impossible.\n\nMy first stop was Rue Montorgueil, a street lined with restaurants, caf\u00e9s, bakeries, fish stores, cheese shops, and wine shops. About 100 VivaTech attendees filled the street chatting and drinking at Viva Night, a networking event.\n\nTo satisfy my hunger, I bought shawarma\u2014starting with familiar food\u2014and a drink, before going on to chat with a few startup founders from Africa and Europe.\n\nExhausted from a long day of dragging my suitcases around, I decided to book an Uber to my Airbnb, so I wouldn\u2019t have to keep asking people for directions.\n\nOver the course of the 45-minute ride, I had a light-hearted conversation with the driver who lives in Paris but is from Algeria. His English wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was good enough for him to dish out some words of advice on why I should get married soon.\n\n\u201cJe parle Anglais,\u201d was a standard disclaimer I gave to almost everyone who started speaking to me in French, telling them that I only speak English. Growing up, I had learnt French at every level of my education but was never in the right environment long enough to practise speaking it.\n\nLater, as I settled into my Airbnb room, I made an attempt to watch TV but embarrassingly caught myself scrolling through the stations, looking for an English-speaking channel. So much for using not being in the right environment as an excuse for my incapacity with French. I didn\u2019t bother turning on the TV after that day.\n\nMay 15\n\nAt 9:59 AM, I arrived at the Paris Expo Porte de Versailles. There was a large crowd outside the venue waiting to enter. I was about an hour late because I had to get a SIM card to wean myself off my dependence on public WiFi.\n\nThe conference started on a high note with a teeming crowd and positive energy. After a bit of queuing, I got inside and was fascinated to see more than 100 African startups present\u2014most of them serving francophone African countries.\n\nIt felt odd that there was no Nigerian booth at the conference, considering that countries like Egypt and South Africa had booths. I later learned from someone involved in trying to organise a Nigerian delegation that the current focus on the 2023 election cycle was a major reason why the government didn\u2019t sponsor a delegation.\n\nOver the next few days at the conference, talking to many of these startups made me more aware of the francophone African tech ecosystem and the different people and organisations working to make it thrive.\n\nConversations and sessions\n\nWith startups stationed in shared 3-by-3-metre booths all over the conference venue, I walked to different booths seeking to learn more about what they did.\n\nI spoke to Julien Herbin of Kayfo Games, a startup based in Senegal, who explained that making games from Dakar had a few limitations as he couldn\u2019t monetise the business through in-app purchases because Senegal didn\u2019t have an agreement with Google and Apple on taxation and revenue share, thereby limiting his revenue streams to only advertising.\n\nFinding a place to park in African cities can often be a hassle. Senegalese Lamine Ba of Parcsmart, explained to me that solving the problem of parking in Senegal and other African cities could lead to more efficient use of land and how parking can be a significant revenue stream for businesses.\n\nYanick Kemayou of Kabakoo Academies (Mali), whose edtech solution is helping youths acquire critical competencies such as programming and design, for success in a fast-moving world, was generous in explaining his business model and later helping me get a city transport card to aid my movement around the city.\n\nI also chatted with Singaporean-French serial entrepreneur and now investor, Lin Dejean Yun of Transcendence VC, who explained why she\u2019s bullish on francophone Africa: it\u2019s an untapped market.\n\nOn different occasions, I listened to a pitch by Lew Kam of Easy Matatu (Uganda)\u2014one of the 3 finalists in the Climate Tech Awards\u2014on how they are reducing carbon emissions by streamlining mobility.\n\nDr Rasha Rady of Chefaa (Egypt) spoke about learning to pitch to investors as a female founder on a panel session about women in tech.\n\nCameroonian tech founder and investor, Rebecca Enonchong, gave a passionate talk on her struggles as an entrepreneur and why African entrepreneurs are better adapted to surmount new challenges.\n\n\u201cStartups in Africa, in my opinion, are less risky than startups in other parts of the world because of our resilience as entrepreneurs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe [African entrepreneurs] are very adapted for challenges, and we\u2019re able to surmount challenges unlike any other ecosystem entrepreneurs that I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Here\u2019s a 2-minute clip of her speech.\n\nI also listened to a panel on the future of work. Gregoire Schwebig, CEO AfricaWorks, suggested that maybe Africa doesn\u2019t need to rely on Western ideas of going fully remote due to its current infrastructural problems. The future he suggested is in distributed offices: rather than having one office, companies could have offices all-around cities, closer to employees. The idea rings nice to me, but I wonder how affordable it is.\n\nSince it was launched in 2018, the D\u00e9l\u00e9gation G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 l\u2019Entreprenariat Rapide des Femmes et des Jeunes (DER) has granted 60 billion FCFA (~$96,424,000) out to startups and helped transform the Senegalese tech ecosystem. Mame Aby Seye, General Delegate for Youth and Women Entrepreneurship, spoke about the achievements of the Senegalese tech ecosystem and the support given by the DER to make this possible.\n\nFood\n\nAfter eating shawarma on my first day in Paris, I had more sandwiches, croissants, and pizza over the next 2 days, and then I started craving Nigerian food\u2014I was tired of meals with flour. Fortunately, I ate sea bass, Turkish food, which made my taste buds come alive.\n\nOn Friday evening, I got to eat some Nigerian fried rice cooked by a Nigerian friend who was also at the conference.\n\nOutside African tech\n\nIndia was recognised as Country of the Year at VivaTech, a special recognition given due to the contribution of Indian startups to the world. India has 100 unicorns\u2014one out of every 10 unicorns comes from India.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, and other notable innovators and leaders were also present at the conference.\n\nFour years ago, Huawei launched its app gallery to the rest of the world, making a concerted effort to move beyond Google and build its own ecosystem of products that tie together. During a session by Huawei, the company shared that it has over 432 billion downloads and over 580 million monthly average users (MAU), as of 2021\u2014and that less than 10% of those came from Europe. The number of users from Africa wasn\u2019t shared, most likely because the session was more relevant to a European audience. The Huawei operating system has 5.4 million registered developers and over 187,000 apps are already integrated into it.\n\nThat\u2019s a small figure compared to Google, which had 3.48 million apps on Playstore as of Q1 2021, and 111.3 billion apps downloaded as of 2022. But still, it is a sign that Huawei has made progress over the years. The company also displayed some of its machine learning capabilities. Here\u2019s a video of a demonstration of that.\n\nFashion and tech\n\nAmid the 2,000 exhibitors at the conference, I learned that fashion and beauty brands like Fendi, Bulgari, and Dior were doing more than just creating outfits in the metaverse. Bulgari had an interactive display that enabled clients to create a 3D image of a piece of jewellery in the metaverse, which can then be minted into an NFT. Christian Dior partnered with Lucibel, a French company that designs and manufactures new-generation lighting products and solutions based on LED technology, to create this mask that uses cold red light to stimulate and regenerate skin cells within 12 minutes, without the risk of burning. I didn\u2019t get to try it, but someone who did mentioned that it\u2019s like a substitute for Botox, given that it tightens the skin and straightens out wrinkles.\n\nFendi teamed up with a startup to create an interactive game that gave users the ability to recreate a limited edition bag in order to experience how it was created by craftsmen in Italy. It took 900 hours to create one bag.\n\nSome of these demonstrations were a strategy to get the attention of passers-by, and others were meant to build affinity with the brand by asking users to create fashion items virtually.\n\nLa fin\n\nSaturday, May 18 was the hottest day of the year so far in France, and I felt every degree of it. Many people stayed indoors, and those who went outside were dressed lightly. At its peak, temperatures rose to about 32\u00b0C\u2014Lagos was 26\u00b0C. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder how the heat from Lagos followed me to Paris.\n\nSaturday was mostly dedicated to conference sessions held in French\u2014most sessions without translators, presenting me with the perfect opportunity to visit more booths and meet more people.\n\nLater in the evening, after 4 days of learning about tech and showcasing tech products and services, VivaTech 2022 came to an end with music from French DJ Hadrien Federiconi, better known by his stage name Feder. The Africa Tech section hosted ace Congolese guitarist Olivier Tshimanga, who dished out some melodic tunes. The Congolese delegates sure do know how to end a conference in style.\n\nVivaTech 2022 recorded about 91,000 in-person visitors and 300,000 online visits from 146 countries. There were 1,800 startups and 700 investment funds.\n\nAfter an exhilarating week, the next day, I made sure to visit the Eiffel Tower before leaving Paris.\n\nAs I got closer, I didn\u2019t find the Eiffel Tower impressive, seeing that it was one tall structure made up of connected metals. But as soon as I made it to the top, my opinion changed; the experience was beautiful.\n\nAu revoir, mes amis!\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Abeg\u2019s future lies in its rebrand to a social commerce platform",
          "text": "Payment app, Abeg, has rebranded and will now be called PocketApp, a move that underlines its transition from a payment app to a social commerce app. In addition, Abeg, a subsidiary of Piggytech Global Limited, secured approval-in-principle (AIP) for a mobile money operator (MMO) license application from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to expand the scope of its social commerce operations across the country.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Dare Adekoya, Muheez Akanni, Patricia Adoga and Eniola Ajayi-Bembe as a platform that allows users, mostly Gen Z, to send and request money through a wallet-based system, it enjoyed some virality on Twitter due to its catchy name\u2014derived from a Nigerian slag used to ask for favours. It got downloaded 5,000 times in its first 2 weeks. However, it didn\u2019t gain massive prominence until it became headline sponsor of Big Brother Nigeria (BBN), the most-watched reality TV show in Africa, in 2021. Abeg was acquired by Piggytech Global just before the show began airing, and while it entered the show with 20,000 users on its newly launched app, it claimed to have amassed almost 2 million users by the time the show ended. But after blitzscaling to millions of users in a couple of months, its success was trailed by questions about whether it could retain those users.\n\nPiggytech Global co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Joshua Chibueze told TechCabal that PocketApp is the answer to that question. \u201cSo, what we did last year was to get everyone to get the app first. It was very successful, we got over a million users. But this time around, we are going for retention, we\u2019re trying to create a brand or an app that everyone can use. But for now, we\u2019re targeting small micro-businesses and people who sell on Instagram and WhatsApp.\u201d\n\nPocketApp will support seamless payments and online commerce throughout the country by adding new functionalities for users to buy and sell items via virtual Pocket shops.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty much focused on people being able to open a pocket shop and sell online for free. Over 65% of Piggvest\u2019s current users sell something, it made sense for us because we\u2019re trying to create extra value for our current customers,\u201d Chibueze told TechCabal.\n\nPocketApp has expressed interest in tapping into Nigeria\u2019s social commerce market which is estimated to reach US$23.8 billion by 2028.\n\nThe MMO license will allow the PocketApp to issue e-money, create and manage wallet creation, enable USSD, recruit, manage and pay money to its agent, and manage pool accounts\u2014all of which are central to expanding social commerce.\n\nPocketApp, like MTN and Airtel, who have received similar approvals-in-principle in the past year, also voiced its support to the Nigerian government\u2019s goals for financial inclusion. \u201cPocketApp affirms its commitment to the financial inclusion agenda of the CBN and the Federal Republic of Nigeria and will continue to make it easier for our teeming young population to seamlessly carry out their transactions while saving them costs and giving them more access to get paid,\u201d it said in a statement sent to TechCabal.\n\nPocketApp COO, Patricia Adoga, said that the PocketApp infrastructure has been in the works for over 18 months to enable secure social commerce because social commerce thrives better in a more trusted environment. \u201cSo we added escrow to our payment infrastructure, protecting buyers and sellers and many other features, ensuring a smooth shopping experience on the app,\u201d Adoga said in a statement.\n\nThe company said in a statement that as a full social commerce app, it will connect buyers and sellers across Nigeria, and soon, other African countries. \u201cPeople can discover you from anywhere, as long as you do honest work and you have a smartphone,\u201c Chibueze told TechCabal.\n\nChibueze explains that PocketApp hopes to break through geographical limitations and connect sellers and buyers in different parts of the country. \u201cA strawberry trader in Lagos can buy strawberries from a vendor in Jos who has a pocket shop. That way, the price will be way cheaper because you\u2019re dealing with the vendor directly,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Nigeria where e-commerce is nascent and people are more comfortable with buying goods physically, e-commerce companies have to build trust with their users. He explains that trust is one of PocketApp\u2019s major offerings. \u201cSo what we\u2019ve solved for commerce is trust. Anybody can sell anything online in the safest way possible. And anybody can sign in now with confidence. Because if you pay for an item, and you\u2019ve not gotten what you want, you\u2019ve got to deliver whatever it is, and always ask for your money back.\u201d\n\nCommenting on PocketApp\u2019s approval-in-principle, co-founder and COO of Piggytech Global, Odunayo Eweniyi, said in the aforementioned statement, \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly pleased that PocketApp has been granted an approval-in-principle as a Mobile Money Operator in Nigeria. We will now work closely with the Central Bank to meet all its conditions to receive the full operating license, enabling us to continue growing and expanding the scope of our social payments, social commerce and other digital financial products to reach millions of Nigerian micro-entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

Comrade Philip Shaibu, has condemned the killing of a Catholic Priest, Rev. Fr. Christopher Odia, in Ikabigbo, Etsako West Local Government Area of the State.\n\nShaibu, who led other government functionaries and heads of security agencies in the state, on Monday, to Ikabigbo, called for calm among residents in the community.\n\nThe acting governor also commiserated with the Head of Ikabigbo Community, Aleghe Braimah; family of a member of the Edo Vigilante Network who lost his life in an attempt to rescue the priest, Yusuf Nurudeen, and the Ogieneni of Uzairue, Kadiri Omogbai.\n\nShaibu said he was in the area to commiserate with the Uzairue people and get first-hand knowledge of the incident, noting, \u201cThe unfortunate attack resulted in the killing of Rev. Fr. Christopher Odia at St. Michael Catholic Church, Ikabigbo in Etsako West Local Government Area. I received briefs from eyewitnesses in the community and assured the troubled community that the assailants will be brought to book and made to pay for their crimes.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cWe are pained by the loss of both the reverend father and the member of the vigilante group, who was killed but I am particularly happy with our youth and the vigilante group and the hunters. We also commend the police and the military for their prompt action. We\u2019re very saddened that we lost our loved ones.\n\n\u201cI insisted that we must come to see what has happened for ourselves. We have gotten some information already. Last night, I insisted that the military should remain in the bush to comb the forest. As we speak, they\u2019re still there because we want to make sure that none of the culprits escapes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will also look at what has happened here critically because Edo State has been relatively peaceful. We will not allow these miscreants to come into our state and disrupt the peace that we\u2019re already enjoying. Edo will be too hot for them. We will assess what has happened to know how to correct them,\u201d Shaibu noted.\n\nThe Edo State Commissioner of Police, Abutu Yaro, assured the community members and relatives of the casualties that the security outfits will not rest until the criminals are brought to book.\n\nHe implored the community to partner with the Police and charged anyone taking actions to work within the ambits of the law to ensure that they do not run afoul of the law.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Equally, the Nigeria Foreign Affairs Minister has been engaged here, so that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs takes steps to provide diplomatic support for our colleague.\n\n\u201cBecause this issue is already in court, we have limited opportunity to discuss beyond what we have done so far.\n\n\u201cBut I want to ensure the family of our colleague, Senator Ike Ekweremadu and Nigerians, that the Senate will continue to engage with our ministry of foreign affairs as well as our high commission in London.\n\n\u201cThe High Commission has done so much but we still expect that it will continue to provide any other further consular services.\n\n\u201cWe have also mandated our committee on foreign affairs to engage with the British high commission here in Nigeria, to find more details on this case, as as far as the high commission is involved.\n\n\u201cThere will be a delegation to London to see Senator Ike Ekweremadu and his wife. A delegation from the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Senate will leave in the next two days to London for that purpose.\n\n\u201cI want to urge all federal government institutions that can do anything to ensure that justice prevails in this case, that they do so.\u201d",

          "text": "The House of Representatives on Wednesday resolved to set up an ad-hoc committee to investigate the petroleum products subsidy regime from 2017 to 2021.\n\nThe resolution followed a motion by Honourable Sergius Ogun who stated that component costs in the petroleum products subsidy value chain claimed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) is highly over-bloated while the transfer pump price per litre, used by the NNPC in relation to Petroleum Pipeline Marketing Company (PPMC), is underquoted.\n\nThe lawmaker described this as fraudulent while also expressing worry that the subsidy regime has been used by the NNPC and other critical stakeholders to subvert the nation\u2019s crude oil revenue to the tune of over $10 billion.\n\nThe committee is to report back to the House within eight weeks for further legislative action.\n\nWednesday\u2019s move by the lawmaker came on the same day that the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Mele Kyari ruled out the possibility of a subsidy for diesel.\n\nHe made the comments while appearing before the House of Representatives Committee on Downstream, alongside the CEO of Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), Farouk Ahmed, among others.\n\n\u201cIn our country today, we do not produce AGO and we regret that our refineries are not working,\u201d he said. \u201cAre we doing anything about it?

          "title": "Why FG cannot subsidise diesel \u2013 NNPC",
          "text": "The Federal Government has said It is regrettable that Nigeria\u2019s petroleum refineries are not working and the possibility of introducing subsidies on Automotive Gas Oil, also known as diesel, is unlikely.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mele Kyari, who made this known in Abuja on Tuesday stated that the government cannot afford the payment of subsidies on diesel.\n\nHe made the comments while appearing before the House of Representatives Committee on Downstream, alongside the CEO of Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), Farouk Ahmed, among others.\n\nThe lawmakers had summoned stakeholders in the oil and gas sector, including Kyari and Ahmed, to an investigative hearing over the scarcity and the rising cost of Premium Motor Spirit (also known as petrol), diesel, and Liquefied Petroleum Gas, LPG (also known as cooking gas) in the country.\n\nIn his presentation, the NMDPRA chief suggested three measures to be taken to address the challenges with the supply and distribution chain.\n\nHe said the \u201crequired amount of forex for importation of the petroleum products (should) be made available to the genuine importers at CBN official rate.\u201d\n\nAhmed also asked the government to \u201cencourage the establishment of more local refineries and LPG processing facilities to meet domestic demands,\u201d adding that \u201can increase in the LPG supply from major domestic producers, including NLNG, BRT processing, CNL, LPG, FSO,\u201d would resolve some of the issues.\n\nThe NMDPRA boss stated that in addition to the three suggested solutions, \u201can extensive consultation is required among key stakeholders towards lessening the present tension being generated by the global high oil prices.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresently, Nigeria is a net importer of refined petroleum products, including AGO, as the country imports about 100 per cent of AGO consumed locally,\u201d he said. \u201cAn average of 12 million litres is also being consumed daily based on average truck-out quantity.\n\n\u201cThe upswing in international price, combined with the prevailing naira/US dollar exchange rate, contributes about 80 per cent of the product price at the pump. While the official naira/US dollar exchange rate has remained relatively stable at about N415/US dollar since the beginning of the (Russia-Ukraine) war to date, the parallel rate on the other hand has increased considerably.\n\n\u201cThe challenge with this is that petroleum products importers are unable to access the required amount of forex at the official rate and, therefore, rely on the parallel market to complement their forex US dollar requirements. In addition, the monitored price of AGO currently ranges between N710/litre and N750/litre in the coastal areas, while the LPG price is about N800/kg.\u201d\n\nOnly One Solution\n\nWhen asked to be specific on the immediate solution, he stated that the respite to cushion the effect of high price was to make foreign exchange available for marketers to import AGO at the official exchange rate of N415 to a dollar.\n\n\u201cWe have only one solution if I can say it; make forex available to importers to import at the official exchange rate. If we do not do that, I do not see any other solution. Even if our refineries are back on stream, they are buying crude at the official international price,\u201d Ahmed proposed.\n\nAccording to him, the transportation industry heavily relies on AGO to move goods and services and as such, diesel is a major factor in the distribution of PMS being presently regulated.\n\n\u201cOne of the major reasons for the scarcity being witnessed in the our country is as a result of the rise in the price of AGO,\u201d said the NMDPRA boss who hinted that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved the upward review in freight rates by N10 to alleviate the challenges, effective June 1.\n\nThis, he explained, was in the effort to alleviate the challenge resulting from the upswing in the global price of AGO and the implication on the cost of the distribution of PMS nationwide.\n\nIn their separate presentations, representatives of oil marketing bodies, the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), the Depot and Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (DPMAN), and the Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), sought the government\u2019s intervention regarding forex with hopes that functional refineries would resolve some of the issues.\n\nNo Guarantee\n\nBut the NNPC chief, in his remarks, faulted some of the suggestions from the NMDPRA and the marketers.\n\n\u201cIn our country today, we do not produce AGO and we regret that our refineries are not working,\u201d he said. \u201cAre we doing anything about it? Yes. I have heard the honourable members lamenting; yes, they (the refineries) are not working.\n\n\u201cThis is the truth. I don\u2019t want to bore you with why they are not working, but they are not working; I admit they are not working but we regret it. I will invite this committee at your convenience to join us to see how much work we have done to get them back to work, but they will not come back tomorrow.\n\n\u201cThey will not! You cannot start it tomorrow. We regret this; we regret this situation, and we are doing everything possible. As a matter of fact, we have decided to do a quick fix for the Warri refinery. The reason is very simple: we don\u2019t even want to go the long route of doing comprehensive turnaround maintenance because we are concerned.\u201d\n\nThe NNPC boss disclosed that Saudi Arabia\u2019s Aramco recently bought a large amount of AGO and stockpiled it. \u201cWe were very surprised that Saudi Arabia would do this.\n\n\u201cNo one knows what will come tomorrow. No one can guarantee the security of supply. That is why people are resorting to self-help. People are preserving the excess volumes that they have,\u201d he said.\n\nKyari, however, decried that Nigeria imports almost every commodity \u201cperhaps, maybe with the exception of food.\u201d He added that while the country does not export, it cannot have foreign exchange.\n\nAs a result, he believes the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the governor, Godwin Emefiele, might not be able to provide forex intervention.\n\n\u201cThere is a limit to what he (Emefiele) can do because as long as we are not productive, the only way you can cover FX gap is for you to go and borrow FX, and no one is going to lend you money to put on a subsidy; it does not happen anywhere in the world. No bank will lend you FX to go and put it into consumption.\n\n\u201cWhen Nigerians living in the diaspora used to be a very great source of forex. They can no longer send back because many of them are out of employment. So, they can no longer send money even to their parents. So, you cannot have it in your banking system,\u201d he stated.\n\nNo End In Sight\n\nOn the way forward, the NNPC boss stated that the first step was to restore crude oil production.\n\nHe stressed that the current crude production, including condensate, was 1.4 million barrels while the budget level was 1.8 million.\n\nHe added, \u201cSo, we can\u2019t meet it today. It is not possible. Today, we have over 205 illegal refinery sites. There are over 295 insertions on our crude oil production line. No oil company will continue to work; they will have no necessity or obligation.\u201d\n\nKyari further said in part, \u201cWe have a problem, no doubt. I don\u2019t want to bore you with why AGO prices are very high. They are very high today. At the risk of being repetitive with what Farouk said about what is happening globally, I think it is good to emphasise that the world has never seen this level of uncertainty around supply and demand. Even in 2012 and 2013, when we had crude oil prices reaching $143 (per barrel), the uncertainties are not like what we are seeing today.\n\n\u201cToday, countries are stockpiling petroleum products. Today, refineries are shutting down across the globe for reasons probably not connected with the Ukrainian war; for the very simple reason that the world decided that we will have an energy transition to eliminate fossil fuel.\n\n\u201cFrom that decision, many oil and gas companies have stopped investing in their plants and facilities because it does not make any further sense to do so. Shortly before COVID-19 (pandemic) \u2013 it did not start today \u2013 the world was already facing three million barrels of undersupply of crude oil in the market.\n\n\u201cCOVID came, yes; it brought down the consumption. But shortly after COVID, today we have an undersupply of up to four million barrels of oil in the market today. So, there is simply no end in sight to declining crude oil prices within the next one to two years. Even if you decide to invest in oil today, you cannot bring oil on the table as you wish.\u201d",

          "text": "The All Progressives Congress has set up a task force to commence immediate registration of students and revalidation of its members across the country.\n\nThe inauguration of the task force, which took place on Wednesday at the party headquarters in Abuja, was believed to be a response to the cult following of the former Anambra State governor and Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, on social media.\n\nObi had dumped the Peoples Democratic Party for Labour Party to keep the dream of his presidential ambition alive.\n\nHis growing profile and frugal lifestyle have ignited calls among his youthful supporters who have taken over the social media space with calls for a peaceful revolution through mass registration for permanent voters\u2019 cards, jingles, and door-to-door campaigns ahead of the 2023 election.\n\nWorried by the trend, the National Youth Leader of APC, Dayo Israel, on Wednesday announced the formation of a task force to immediately commence the registration and revalidation of students and youths in the country.\n\nThe task force has former Kwara State Commissioner for information, Ben Duntoye; APC Deputy National Youth Leader, Jamaldeen Kabir, and Director of National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons, Imaan Sulaiman-Ibrahim as co-chairmen.\n\nOthers include former Member of the APC Board of Trustees, Rinsola Abiola; Commissioner of Federal Character Commission, Ginika Tor; Chief of Staff to the Minister of State, Mines and Steel, Kelechi Ekugo; Ogban Ogban, Senior Special Assistant to Governor Ben Ayade; Aminu Uba, Special Assistant to Senator Orji Uzor Kalu; Irinoye Omolayo, Senior Legislative Aide to Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege; North Central Zonal Youth Leader, Zubair Aliyu; North East Zonal Youth Leader, Jason Baba Kwaghe; North West Zonal Youth Leader, Abdulhamid Umar Mohd; South South Zonal Youth Leader, Ebimobowei Oyas; South East Zonal Youth Leader, Ikenna Anyalewechi and South West Zonal Youth Leader, Lawal Kolade Paff among others.\n\nIsrael disclosed that the task force has been mandated to coordinate the registration and revalidation exercise of students and youths-led support groups into a recognisable structure.\n\n\u201cThe structure will be strongly aligned with the objectives and strategic imperatives of the National Working Committee under the distinguished leadership of Senator Adamu Abdullahi.\n\n\u201cI have assembled these respected voices and party loyalists as members of APC Youth Wing National Special Task Force on Revalidation and Registration of APC youths and focused support groups.\n\n\u201cThe revalidation of the affiliated youths and student support groups will be opened for a period of one month starting from Friday 1 to July 31. This move would also enable effective coordination, disciplined harmonization of activities in alignment with the party\u2019s goals, aid provision and accountability, as well as efficient management and enhanced operations,\u201d he said.\n\nThe APC national youth leader disclosed that as part of their task, the newly inaugurated team will collect phone numbers and email address lists of registered members and groups after validation of their PVCs, party membership cards and attestation from two guarantors.\n\nWhen asked by our correspondent to confirm if the recent move is to neutralise the threat of the \u2018Obidient\u2019 movement on social media, Israel said that he didn\u2019t really consider Obi\u2019s growing supporters as a serious threat.\n\n\u201cA lion is not threatened by the noise of the rat in his backyard. You must understand that as a party, we have continued to play our part as youths. The APC youth wing will always rise when the occasion demands because we are passionate about change.\n\n\u201cWhile we are not threatened, we are not sitting on our oars. We are taking responsibility because we have the structure. The future of this party belongs to us. Our own response as APC generals is to wake up all our battalions and garrison commanders in our party support groups across the nation and bring them together.\n\n\u201cWe want to document all our support groups and create programmes, activities and empower them with skills acquisition. The ultimate aim is to mobilize Nigerian youths in states and zones for the victory of APC,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nMinister of Mines and Steel Development, MMSD, Arc. has called on Civil Servants to be dedicated to duty for improved productivity.\n\nAdegbite made the call during the celebration organized by the ministry to commemorate the 2022 African Public Service Day in Abuja.\n\nHe expressed satisfaction working with staff of the ministry due to their commitment to duty which he stressed should be sustained to take the ministry to enviable heights.\n\nDelivering her speech at the ceremony, Permanent Secretary, of the Ministry, Dr Oluwatoyin Akinlade, revealed that efforts were on to ensure that the ministry blaze a trail in the service-wide project of work-process automation.\n\nAkinlade who hailed the passion of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, HCSF, Folashade Mejabi Yemi-Esan, for improved productivity and welfare of civil servants, said the theme of the day, \u201cPerformance Management System, PMS: Impact on productivity in the Nigeria Public Sector\u201d was most apt as it summarises the vision of the HCSF to make the service a world class system that drives optimum productivity through effective and efficient performance management.\n\n\u201cShe has vigorously pursued the full implementation of the new Performance Management System through training of various categories of officers. This is complemented by the deployment of the Human Resource Module of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System, IPPIS, the Federal Civil Service Strategy Implementation Plan and the reinforcement of the Innovation Division in all Ministries, Departments and Agencies, MDAs.\n\n\u201cLEAD-P and SMART-P trainings have also been consistently carried out to realise this laudable vision of the HCSF.\n\n\u201cMMSD is among the first set of MDAs to receive these facilities and efforts are on to ensure that we blaze a trail in the service-wide project of work-process automation. We have achieved a major improvement in the ACTU rating from about 26.5% to 74.5% compliance and have also surpassed our revenue projections,\u201d Akinlade said.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary disclosed that efforts had also been made within the ministry\u2019s limits of available resources to provide facilities that would enhance productivity and welfare of Staff, adding that in that regard, \u201cwe now have a clinic that can provide basic health services to all staff to ensure that our health is given the priority that it deserves\u201d.\n\nShe said many may be unaware that within the few months of operation of the clinic, health crises had been averted for some staff just through routine check by the medical team in the clinic.\n\n\u201cAlso, we can easily see the massive deployment of ICT infrastructures within office complex aimed at achieving the full automation of the work processes in the ministry,\u201d she added.\n\nCongratulating the members of management and staff of the ministry on week-long activities being commemorated, Akinlade craved their indulgence over the delay in the commemoration which was being held this week instead of last week that was officially set aside to mark the event, adding that it was due to exigencies of duty.\n\n\u201cSince 1999 when the African Union, AU, set aside 23rd June, as the \u201cAfrica Public Service Day, APSD, Nigeria has consistently\n\ncommemorated the day annually with series of activities and we are grateful to God for the opportunity to be part of this year\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cIn her characteristic style of celebrating civil servants, the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation approved a full package of week-long activities for this year including Jumat and Church Services, Keep-fit/aerobics session, a Town-hall Meeting and Special Awards to selected officers for outstanding performance,\u201d she continued.\n\nShe told the workers that the occasion also affords the opportunity to specially acknowledge members of staff that have distinguished themselves through outstanding performance.\n\nSpeaking further, she said, \u201cAs usual, one person was nominated from each department out of which three were selected and forwarded to OHCSF. I want to therefore congratulate all the recipients of this year\u2019s award and appreciate them for their diligence.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly congratulate Engr. Umar Adamu Tsoho who was honoured with the \u201cPresidential Public Service Award\u201d by the OHCSF for outstanding service. He made it to the top ten among the nomination from all the MDAs. We are proud of you and we thank you for bringing honour to this Ministry.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the HCSF, I want to congratulate and specially thank all the retiring staff for the year 2022. It is indeed a noble achievement to successfully exit the Federal Civil Service through retirement. It is the beginning of new life for you and we wish you good health of mind and body as well as a fulfilling life after retirement from public service.\u201d\n\nAlso Member of staff and retirees of MMSD were rewarded with gift items and plaques for the outstanding dedication to duty.",

Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison Wednesday for leading a decades-long effort to recruit and trap teenagers and women for sex.\n\nJudge Ann Donnelly handed down the term in the Brooklyn federal court nearly a year after the 55-year-old Kelly was convicted by a New York jury.\n\n\u201cThe verdict is in: R. Kelly has been sentenced to 30 years,\u201d the US attorney\u2019s office for the Eastern District of New York said in a tweet.\n\nThe prosecutors had urged the court to put the \u201cI Believe I Can Fly\u201d artist behind bars for at least 25 years, saying he still \u201cposes a serious danger to the public.\u201d\n\nIn September, the fallen superstar was found guilty on all nine charges he faced, including the most serious of racketeering.\n\n\u201cHis actions were brazen, manipulative, controlling, and coercive.

          "text": "R Kelly has been sentenced to 30 years in prison in the long-awaited conclusion of his federal sex trafficking case in New York.\n\nLast September, a jury found the disgraced singer guilty of all counts, which included one charge of racketeering related to the sexual exploitation of children, kidnapping, and forced labor, as well as eight charges of violating the Mann Act, which outlaws the transportation of a person across state lines for illegal sexual activity.\n\nKelly was arrested in 2019, and during his time in jail he\u2019s gone broke, been attacked by an inmate, and complained of gaining weight. This past February he caught COVID-19.\n\nHis case has encountered numerous delays and setbacks, most recently when he hired attorney Jennifer Bonjean, who had successfully overturned the conviction against Bill Cosby, and fired the rest of his legal team. On June 14th, Bonjean asked Judge Donnelly to sentence Kelly to the 10-year mandatory minimum.\n\n\u201cOur position is that the mandatory minimum sentence is appropriate in this case,\u201d Bonjean said. \u201cThere is significant mitigating evidence, particularly related to his extremely traumatic childhood that shaped him as an adult.\u201d Bonjean filed this sentencing memorandum under seal, suggesting that the document included intimate details about sexual abuse Kelly suffered as a child.\n\nMeanwhile, prosecutors asked for a sentence exceeding 25 years due to his \u201clong and pervasive history of enticing children to engage in sexual activity.\u201d\n\nIn a 31-page sentencing filing, prosecutors wrote, \u201cHe lured young girls and boys into his orbit, often through empty or conditioned promises of assistance in developing a career in the entertainment industry or simply by playing into the minors\u2019 understandable desire to meet and spend time with a popular celebrity.\u201d\n\nThis is hardly the end of Kelly\u2019s legal troubles. He\u2019ll stand federal trial in Illinois, where prosecutors allege that he helped fix the 2008 trial for child pornography that ended in his acquittal.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday, met with 22 angry senators of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in an attempt to stop their planned defection. The meeting was held at the Council Chambers of State House, Abuja.\n\nThe affected senators included Smart Adeyemi, Frank Ibezim, Danladi Sankara, and Ibrahim Oloriegbe. They were led to the meeting by Senate Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor-Kalu.\n\nThe president noted the concerns of the senators, who failed to secure the party\u2019s return ticket to the Red Chamber. He said their exit would affect the future of the ruling party, saying, however, that he praised the senators\u2019 effort to find a solution.\n\nThe president assured them that as the leader of the party, part of his role was to create the environment for members to ventilate their grievances.\n\nEmphasising that there must be a winner and loser in any contest, Buhari revealed that he had been inundated with complaints over the primaries, assuring that he would continue to address the challenges through the party machinery.\n\nUrging party members to exercise restraint, as justice would be done, the president told the senators, \u201cI thank you for the decision to approach me with your concerns over the future of the party and for pursuing solutions approach for the challenges thrown up by the recent election-related activities particularly, the primaries.\n\n\u201cAs the leader of the party, one of my primary role is to ensure that our culture of internal democracy and dispute resolution is strengthened by creating the opportunity for members to ventilate their opinions, views and grievances at different levels.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the fact that we have accomplished 23 years of an uninterrupted democratic governance, our journey is still in a nascent stage and we continue to learn from our challenges and mistakes.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, our party is still evolving in its culture and practice and it is my expectation and hope that we should attain a mature level in our internal conduct.\n\n\u201cI have noted your grievances, particularly, as it concerns the just concluded processes, the cost to the nation, the threat to the majority position held by our party in the legislative chambers, and likely consequent causes to the electoral fortunes of the party as we approach the general election. We must not allow these dire threats to come to pass.\n\n\u201cI must acknowledge that in every contest, there must be a level-playing ground, just as there would be grievances at the end. That is the test of our democratic credentials, systems and practices.\n\n\u201cI have since the conclusion of the process been inundated with various reports and complaints. In keeping with our ethos, therefore, I shall continue to address the ensuing challenges and grievances through the party machinery while paying keen attention to the outcomes.\n\n\u201cI must also remind you of the primacy of justice in all our actions. If justice is denied, its outcome is usually unpleasant. This is because you, the members, keep the party running.\n\n\u201cI should add that as part of the policy of using the party machinery for effective resolutions of conflict, the chairman and some members of the National Working Committee visited the National Assembly recently to dialogue with our legislators.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the party is currently addressing the outcomes as part of the way forward. I am encouraging all the party functionaries to adhere to the truth and to be fair to all parties in any dispute. This is important because our strength and victory in the election lies in the unity of the party and our ability to prevent or heal any injustice perceived unfair.\n\n\u201cI urge you and all party members to exercise restraint and continue to demonstrate commitment to the ideals while we continue to build and develop the party and the country.\n\n\u201cFinally, Let me assure you that justice shall prevail, aggrieved members shall be assuaged in the interest of the party and the nation shall be protected.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the leader of the delegation and Senate Chief Whip, Kalu, said at least 22 senators and members of the party were unhappy with the outcome of the primaries in their states, noting that they felt disenfranchised by the process.\n\nHe said the legislators had made sacrifices for the growth of the party and democracy in the country, and asked for the president\u2019s intervention.\n\nResponding, Kalu stated, \u201cMr President, in the Senate, we have worked hard and consistently sold your programmes beyond party lines. Be assured always of our support.\u201d\n\nIn a statement after the meeting, Kalu said the lawmakers told Buhari that they were disenfranchised by the process of the primary and that Buhari urged them to exercise restraint and change their decision to defect from the party.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe aggrieved senators would no longer pursue their defection plans from the APC. Our meeting with Mr President was successful and the issue of defection from our party has been laid to rest.\u201d\n\nNo fewer than six APC senators, including the Senate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, had dumped the party, citing poor internal politics during its recent primary elections.\n\nDeji Elumoye and Sunday Aborisade in Abuja",
