          "text": "NO fewer than 400,000 Nigerians applied for the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission 200 job slots.\n\nThe recruitment exercise was said to have begun early 2020 but was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe ICPC spokesperson, Mrs Azuka Ogugua, disclosed in a statement on Thursday that the commission had received approval to complete the process.\n\nShe said, \u201cFor a recruitment approval for less than 200 officers, the commission received almost 400,000 applications from Nigerians. Subsequent to COVID-19 pandemic, government suspended the process.\n\n\u201cIn mid-2021, the commission obtained approval to complete the process. In order to give every applicant a fair chance and at the same time get the best, ICPC decided to apply online tests to prune down the number of applicants, using international best practices.\u201d\n\nThrough the service of a consultant, the commission said it had so far conducted a number of online tests, including some repeat tests to accommodate numerous complaints of non-receipt of notification of tests emails, spam of notification emails, complaints of timing-out of test portal, non-submission of fully completed or half completed tests, loss of access to registered email address of applicants, forgotten passwords, and so on.\n\nIt asked applicants with further complaints to forward them to [email protected]\n\nThe commission explained that at no extra cost, it decided to notify applicants by SMS of the dates of tests and advised that they should check their mails and spam folders for the test email.\n\nFollowing this step, it noted that only successful applicants \u2013 including those with specialised skills that were shortlisted would further be invited for follow-up tests, which may be virtual or physical with effect from September, 2021.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cThe pruning down process will continue until the commission arrives at a manageable number of qualified applicants that may be further processed by one-on-one interviews, certificate verification, health certification, character profiling and other assessments befitting of a law enforcement agency.\n\n\u201cApplicants and the general public are, therefore, advised to bear with the commission in this process. Please, note that the entire process is at no cost to applicants and the general public.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "2023: Group warn Senator against instigating public unrest, insurrection against AKSG",
          "text": "A Nigerian Senator has been warned against instigating public unrest, inciting the masses against the person and office of the Governor and any unconstitutional act of insurrection that may derail the prevailing peace in the State.\n\nThe Ibom Democratic Forum, IDF, stated this in a statement made available to newsmen in Uyo on Tuesday 24 August 2012 According to the press release signed by the group\u2019s President and Secretary, Chief Solomon Andem and Adede Ifiok Asikpo Esq, the group noted with dismay that stoking the fire of division, blackmail, character assassination and violence has been the trademark of Senator Akpan, warning that Akwa Ibom people will no longer tolerate his anti-democratic antics any more.\n\nThe statement read in parts, \u201cThe recent press statement against the Special Assistant Media to the Governor by Senator Bassey Akpan is just a smokescreen of his agenda for the 2023 battle. We know that the main target in the failed propaganda was the Governor whom he tried to incite the people against. These unjustifiable act capable of derailing the prevailing peace and unity in the State is totally unacceptable and unjustified, very unbecoming of a man who is aspiring to occupy the office of Governor of the state\u201d.\n\nThe group warned that the Ibom born Senator is always fond of issuing false alarm whenever an election circle draws near, through the release of baseless and unsubstantiated allegations just to curry favour and Pity from the electorate.\n\n\u201cWe recall in 2014, prior to the 2015 election when Senator Bassey Albert raised his usual false alarm against Governor Godswill Akpabio, accusing the then Governor of wanting to kill his elder brother, Ime Albert in order to implicate him. This was him in his usual element all in a desperate bid to whip public sentiment, sympathy and votes, a gimmick that failed even before it began\u201d.\n\n\u201cSenator should realize by now that blackmail, intimidation and threats won\u2019t give him the Governorship ticket and that he cannot stampede or hold the Governor to ransom through falsehood to compel the Governor to endorse him for 2023. If he feels he is popular, then he should be ready to face other candidates in the field at the primaries where he can test his so-called popularity rather than get his proxies in the media to launch needless attacks against the Governor, the Government or appointees of the Governor\u201d.\n\nIt could be recalled that Senator had in a press release dates August 21, 2021, titled, \u201cPIB Analysis; Attention Rev Richard Peters\u201d, falsely accused the Media Assistant to the Governor of making very erroneous input as regards the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) recently passed by the 9th Senate and signed into law by President Buhari, while on Air during XL106. 5 Fm breakfast current affairs programme \u201dPress Club\u201d.\n\nBut it turned out Rev Richard Peters, was not even a guest on the radio program and could therefore have made the alleged statement.\n\nThe release stated that \u201cIn particular, his comment on the current serving House of Representatives Members and Senators was quite disparaging, incoherent, subjective and mostly not based on informed perspectives as he must understand that as against the hoax media claim that the Senators from Akwa Ibom State and indeed South-South Senators were not present to vote during the passage of the bill is NOT true as there is a video evidence of what Distinguished Senator, for instance, said before he voted alongside other Akwa Ibom Senators as the bill was later passed\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is also not factual for him to insinuate that the Senators, especially from Akwa Ibom and indeed South-South Nigeria, did nothing about pushing for an increment of the 3percent benefiting fund for oil-producing communities as he is not in the know of the legislative undercurrent in the Senate before the bill got through especially as regards harmonizing divergent interests. Analysts on the said radio programme must understand that the Senate is a makeup of Nigeria with 109 Distinguished Senators, as such the interest of Nigerian Senate overrides any personal or sectional interest\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat is interesting at the moment is the fact that the 9th Senate has succeeded in getting the bill passed and assented to President Buhari after a very long brainstorming session of so many years\u201d.\n\nThe statement continued, \u201cKudos must be given to the 9th Senate joint committee on Petroleum Resources to include: Upstream, Downstream and Gas Resources of which Distinguished Senator is a Co-Chair, the House of Representatives counterparts and indeed the entire National Assembly for a job well done\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe 3 per cent derivative for host communities can be more if the communities are supportive of the activities of the oil companies especially as regards the social responsibilities obligations even as it is germane to reason that it will be achievable\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe must say that Distinguished Senator, his colleagues and the House of Representatives Members in the current National Assembly have put in their best in giving effective representation to Akwa Ibom people and Nigeria in their capacities so far\u201d\n\n\u201cThe public by this statement are implored to discountenance the misinformation spewed by Richard Peters and the other analysts on the radio programme in question\u201d, the statement read.\n\nThe group called on the Governor not to be distracted but to remain focus in his quest to ensure he leaves behind an industrialized state with massive infrastructural projects that will aid the realization of his Industrialization policy for the good of Akwa Ibom people, assuring him of the continuous support and solidarity of the group and Akwa Ibom people come 2023.\n\nThe group called on the Senator to call his \u201cattack dogs\u201d to order and always verify his claims before rushing to the press in order to spare himself avoidable embarrassment. IDF also advised him to stop further attacks on MPM as the people have embraced peace and will never go back to the dark days when insecurity, killings and state-sponsored assassination was prevalent in the state.",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nGovernor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State.\n\nThe Lagos State Government on Thursday, charged traditional rulers on conflict resolution, fostering communal peace and economic development in their domains.\n\nThe Commissioner for Local Government and Community Affairs, Dr Wale Ahmed, gave the charge at a Retreat, organised for traditional rulers in Lagos state.\n\nThe theme of the retreat is: \u201dThe Role of Traditional Rulers in Conflict Resolution and in Fostering Communal Peace and Economic Development in Lagos State\u201d.\n\nAhmed said that traditional rulers in the state, had continued to be development catalysts and respected agents of mobilisation for policy implementation, monitoring and review of policy options.\n\nHe said the role of traditional rulers was beyond being custodians of tradition and culture and could never be overlooked in the scheme of things in the state.\n\nAccording to him, peaceful coexistence is paramount to economic progress of the state, hence, the traditional rulers should ensure promotion of peaceful coexistence.\n\n\u201dConflict resolution is a long-standing traditional engagement of our royal fathers. This has been passed from generations and effectively replicated in our contemporary society.\n\n\u201dThis role has contributed to the peaceful coexistence among people of different backgrounds and beliefs in our state, resulting in remarkable economic progress.\n\n\u201dWe thank you for this but still request that you do more, especially at this period of challenges and unprovoked aggression among people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe commissioner said that traditional rulers had a special responsibility to uphold, not just traditional values, culture and customs but to also ensure that information dissemination flowed to all nooks and crannies.\n\nHe said the traditional rulers should ensure that residents in each community, understood government policies and programmes in the simplest form, using preferably the indigenous languages.\n\nAhmed said it was expected that as royal fathers and opinion leaders, they would properly and adequately educate their subjects, including youths, on how they could play their parts, to help the government deliver more dividends of democracy.\n\n\u201dAnd as the closest to the grassroots, the constant interaction with them puts you at vantage position, to get the message across to them and to get their support and cooperation for meaningful development.\n\n\u201dThis is not optional, but our collective responsibility to strengthen our cooperation for communal peace and security.\n\n\u2018Retreat such as this, is used to consolidate the interwoven synergy between the state and traditional rulers, in greasing the wheel of progress ,\u201d he said.\n\nThe commissioner said the retreat would offer the opportunity for purposeful engagement on these issues and how they could leverage existing peace and stability in the state, to connect higher economic prosperity.\n\nHe urged them to be open-minded and profound in their submissions and to map out ways for improved administration, especially at the grassroots; one that would stir toward the \u201dGreater Lagos Dream\u201d.\n\nCommending them for their efforts in assisting government in their domains, Ahmed urged the traditional rulers to continue to cooperate with the government and to support its effort at moving the state to the next level.\n\nSpeaking on the overview of the Obas and Chiefs of Lagos State Law 2015, Director, Legislative Drafting of Ministry of Justice, Mrs Aderinsola Olanrewaju, said selection, appointment and recognition of recognised and unrecognised chiefs in Lagos state were guided by law.\n\nOlanrewaju said the idea was to familiarise the Obas with what the law said, particularly about how declarations were made, the power to suspend and the power of the governor under the law.\n\nShe said it was to acquaint the Obas, on what they should do in case of impersonation, offences under the law, how to amend declarations, so that they would be able to relate to all these in respect of the law.\n\nIn his presentation on \u201dConflict Management and Conflict Resolution Technique\u201d, former Dean of the faculty of Law, University of Lagos, Prof. Akin Ibidapo-Obe, said the role of the Obas and chiefs were mainly mediation and arbitration.\n\nIbidapo-Obe, a professor of law, said that the primary function of the traditional rulers was to resolve conflicts by mediation and there should be an institute or council of traditional mediators.\n\nHe said the council would not only serve the immediate community of the Oba, but could as well, offer their services elsewhere.\n\nIbidapo-Obe also advocated the need to recognise the important roles that traditional rulers played in mediation and arbitration and provision of a platform that would enhance their skills and give them basis to reach out even beyond their domains.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Council of Obas and Chiefs, Oba of Lagos, HRM, Oba Rilwan Akiolu, commended the state government for prioritising the intellectual empowerment of traditional rulers in Lagos state, which was evident in the retreat.\n\nAkiolu implored traditional rulers in the state to continue to commit themselves to and ensure they played their roles in ensuring that communal peace in their domains, engendered economic development in the state.\n\nOther speakers included, the Permanent Secretary, Lagos State Primary Health Board, Dr Akinwunmi Mustapha and the Commissioner for Justice, Mr Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN).",

We reiterate that the struggle for the \u2018soul\u2019 of Nigeria, that is presently ongoing, will not be won by ethnic cleansing, nepotism, kidnapping and banditry but by love, fairness and equity, common good and patriotism.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, enjoin the government and all Nigerians to toe the path of justice and conciliatory dialogue and see themselves as agents of peace and development in order to ensure a harmonious and united nation.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to God that we still exist as one nation. This is in spite of sundry agitations and struggles for self-determination. We observe that the agitations and tensions are mainly as a result of bad governance, injustice, inequity, and unfairness in appointments and distribution of resources to parts of the country. We recognize the rights of peoples to self-determination; yet we emphasize that the exercise of such rights must be within the confines of the rule of law.\n\n\u201cWe as a church are keenly interested in the political situation of our country. Although the Church does not support any political party, she supports every government that prioritizes the welfare of the citizens.\u201d\n\nThe Church also condemned government policies that do not promote development and the common good.\n\nThey called for a fair and credible election in 2023 as it appealed to the National Assembly to rescind its decision against electronic transmission of results, stressing that that will create room for rigging of votes.\n\n\u201cWe insist that there is an urgent need for a fair and credible electoral process, through which our political leaders emerge. We, therefore, state loud and clear that the recent voting by the National Assembly against electronic transmission of results of elections will create an opening for further manipulation of electoral votes and lay the foundation for more conflicts in future elections.\n\n\u201cWe call on the National Assembly to reconsider its position in the light of world best practices,\u201d the communique added.",

          "text": "Doctors, under the aegis of the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (NARD), have unanimously decided to continue their strike which began on August 2.\n\nThe association said Federal Government\u2019s alleged insincerity in addressing the demands of its members, coupled with its ex parte injunctions and the misinterpretation of the ruling of the National Industrial Court of Nigeria (NICN), are among the reasons it continued the strike.\n\nNARD\u2019s National Executive Council (NEC), which met on August 25 with over 60 of its members, noted that over 140 days after it signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with the government, nothing had been done to meet the demands.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, NARD President Okhuaihesuyi Uyilawa said: \u201cThe NEC noted the nonchalant attitude of appointees of the government to the suffering of Nigerian doctors.\n\n\u201cThe NEC noted that despite the ongoing strike action of 23 days, its members in 23 centres under the GIFMIS platform are yet to be migrated and captured on the IPPIS platform with payment of an outstanding backlog of three to four months.\n\n\u201cThey observed with dismay that despite the express instructions given by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to the Federal Ministry of Health to sidestep all technicalities in resolving the issues of dispute between us and the government, not one item on the table has been resolved.\n\n\u201cThe NEC was also embarrassed by the misinterpretation of the court ruling by the Federal Ministry of Labour, thereby misinforming the public that the National Industrial Court (of Nigeria) had ordered that the strike should be suspended.\n\n\u201cThe NEC painfully observed that issues bedeviling most of our state tertiary health institutions are left unattended to, despite the ongoing strike. They noted that these issues can be solved through the National Council on Health.\n\n\u201cThe NEC was disappointed but not surprised at the Governor of Abia State for failing to offset the 19 months\u2019 salary arrears being owed our members in his state, which he promised to pay over 23 days ago. They also frowned at the actions of the Governors of Imo, Ekiti and Ondo states, who are still owing our members 10 months, six months and four months respectively.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe NEC noted that 114 House Officers are yet to be paid their one to six months\u2019 salaries.\n\n\u201cIt was surprising to the NEC that despite the unanimous disapproval and call for the withdrawal of the circular removing the House Officers from the scheme of service, the Lagos State government has gone ahead to implement the same circular in the state.\n\n\u201cThe NEC reiterated its displeasure over the paltry N5,000 Hazard Allowance given to doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers.\n\n\u201cNEC recognised the public outcry occasioned by the ongoing industrial action. The association is, however, constrained as the families of the 19 members who died during the COVID-19 outbreak while providing healthcare services are yet to get their death-in-service insurance.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAfter critical appraisal of the actions of both the Federal and state governments on all the issues affecting the welfare of our members, as observed above, and the perpetual insincerity from government, as evidenced by the reckless ex parte injunctions sought by the government, and the ambiguity in the interpretation of the ruling of the NICN, the NEC unanimously agreed, via votes, to sustain the ongoing industrial action until its demands are met, as contained in the MoA signed more than 140 days ago and the recent MoU signed between the government and the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA).\n\n\u201cThe NEC reiterated its position that the circular from the Head of Service (of the Federation) removing house officers from the scheme of service must be withdrawn.\n\n\u201cThe NEC demanded that an emergency meeting of the National Council on Health be convoked to discuss these health emergencies and to fashion out ways to universally resolve all the issues affecting the state health institutions in the country.\u201d",

          "text": "Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe Petroleum Product Pricing and Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) on Thursday told the House of Representatives Committee on Finance that there were no records of the volume of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) consumed daily in the country.\n\nAddressing the lawmakers at the interactive session on the 2020-2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and Fiscal Strategy Paper (FSP), the agency\u2019s Director, Finance and Administration, J.T Peters said the only records available to them which the NNPC also had access to was the record of PMS discharged at the various depots nationwide and the volume trucked out of those depot.\n\nHe told the committee that the issue of volume of PMS consumption in the country had been a major challenge even in the Ministry, leading to the setting up of a special committee known as Operation White.\n\nHe said that the issue of smuggling had \u2070pmade it difficult to determine the volume of PMS consumed in the country daily, hence the inclusion of the Nigeria Customs Service in the committee.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe issue of daily consumption has been an issue in the Ministry and based on the challenges in determining the issue of consumption, the Ministry decided to form a committee known as Operation White. Members of that committee are drawn from PPPRA,NNPC, DPR, Nigeria Customs Service and Civil Defence. The most challenging factor that makes national consumption very difficult is the issue of smuggling.\n\n\u201cThat is why Customs are present in the committee. So, the figures that is used most time for consumption is the truck out figure from the various facilities nation wide. That figure comes mainly from PPPRA. That was the figures we gave you on Tuesday for 2018, 2019 and 2020. Because of the principle used in determining administrative charges and subsidy, the figures normally used is the discharged figure which the PPPRA, DPR and the representatives of the parties determine. Discharge is what is discharged at the various facilities while truck out is what leaves those facilities nationwide. The consumption is based on truck out while charges is based on discharge at the port or depot.\u201d\n\nResponding, Chairman of the Committee on Finance, Hon. James Faleke said PPPRA was important to determining the volume of PMS consumed in the country on a daily as well as revenue from that.\n\nHe said, \u201cthe other day, NNPC told us that they don\u2019t have records of their on and that they pick records from PPPRA. He said the only records of volume NNPC has is what leaves their depot. They records NNPC presented to us was gotten from PPPRA. So, PPPRA is so critical to the determination of what volume of PMS we consume in Nigeria and of course, in relation to their IGR because for every litre that is consumed, PPPRA has a fee it collects. Before now, it was 30 kobo. It was later increased to N1.23 kobo in July. Two days ago (Tuesday), PPPRA made a presentation to us and when we took a glance at the presentations, we observed some contradictions in the figures and it got to a stage when we asked the DFA to confirm those figures and he requested for another day and we are here today.\u201d\n\nFaleke thereby directed the Fiscal Responsibility Commission (FRC) to scrutinize all revenues and transactions PPPRA since 2018.\n\nHe also asked the FRC to scrutinize and determine all the unremitted outstanding revenue based on the levy collected on billion of litres of Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS) since 2018.\n\nFaleke noted that the directive was necessary looking at the conflicting revenue figures claimed by the agency and the outstanding remittances running into billions.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says invasion won\u2019t deter military\u2019s resolve to end criminality\n\n\u2022Commiserates with victims\u2019 families\n\n\u2022DHQ orders probe, denies staff slept on duty\n\n\u2022FG needs political will to deal with terrorists, says Okowa\n\nDeji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh, Michael Olugbode, Adedayo Akinwale, Udora Orizu in Abuja, Ugo Aliogo in Lagos and Benjamin Nworie in Abakaliki\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, said Tuesday\u2019s attack on the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), Kaduna, had provided grounds for more urgent measures to rid the country of \u201cvermin\u201d and emancipate the polity. Buhari stated this in a release by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina.\n\nThe president declared that rather than demoralise the country\u2019s Armed Forces, the attack would strengthen their determination to make a decisive end to criminality in Nigeria. He urged his critics to desist from politicising the terrible act.\n\nThe Defence Headquarters has ordered an intensive probe of the audacious invasion of the strategic military training institution. But it denied stories making the rounds that officers in charge of the Closed-circuit Television (CCTV) at the academy slept on duty while the criminals conducted the assault.\n\nBut Delta State Governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, called on the federal government to muster the political will to deal decisively with bandits, criminals, and kidnappers, regardless of their ethnic group, religion, or status. Okowa spoke yesterday in Lagos while delivering a keynote address at the 2021 Ripples Nigeria Dialogue, with the theme, \u201cRebuilding Trust in a Divided Nigeria: Advancing the Conversation,\u201d organised by the Ripples Centre for Data and Investigative Journalism.\n\nThat was as more groups continued to condemn the development, which they said had grave implications for the country\u2019s fight against terror.\n\nBuhari, in the release, said the attack, which resulted in loss of lives and the kidnap of an officer, \u201ccame at a time that the military had put insurgents, bandits, kidnappers, and other types of criminals on the retreat.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe heinous action would accelerate the total uprooting of evil in the polity, which members of the Armed Forces are solidly resolved to accomplish in the shortest possible time.\u201d\n\nWhile commiserating with the families, who lost loved ones in the attack, and praying God to comfort them, the president \u201cvowed that the deceased would not die in vain, as the degenerate act would have consequences that will eventually clean the country of vermin, and emancipate the polity from deliberate, targeted and contrived atrocious acts.\u201d\n\nBuhari thanked Nigerians, who valued and appreciated the efforts of the military to root out criminality from the whole country. But he urged those playing hateful politics with the base assault on the military academy to desist from such. The president said rather than resort to recriminations, \u201cthis is the time for all patriots and people of goodwill to support and encourage those who are in the vanguard of the battle against wickedness in the land.\u201d\n\nThe Defence Headquarters, which said search and rescue operation for the missing personnel was on-going, directed the management of the military institution to constitute a board of inquiry to look into the incident.\n\nA statement signed by the Director, Defence Information (DDI), Major General Benjamin Sawyerr, said the board, whose membership was ordered by the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor, was not disclosed, but it would ascertain the remote and immediate causes of the security breach.\n\nThe board, according to Sawyerr, was also expected to sanction personnel found culpable and make recommendations to prevent a future occurrence.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cLet me use this opportunity to reiterate that the NDA authorities, acting on the directive of the Chief of Defence Staff, has constituted a board of enquiry to ascertain the remote and immediate cause(s) of the breach of security with a view to sanction any personnel found culpable and also prevent future occurrence.\n\n\u201cLet me also assure that we shall continue to update the general public as events unfold as we are all aware the search and rescue of the abducted officer is still on. Troops of the Armed Forces of Nigeria will continue with its operations to ensure all those involved in the dastardly act are brought to justice.\u201d\n\nDenying reports that personnel on duty at the CCTV monitoring room were asleep, when the bandits attacked the officers\u2019 residential quarters, the statement explained, \u201cThe Nigerian Armed Forces wishes to state categorically that the allegation is untrue and hence challenge the publication to publish forthwith a verifiable proof of personnel sleeping during the incident.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, imperative to caution the publication to guard against being used as a propaganda tool by enemies of our dear country.\n\n\u201cIt should not consciously or unconsciously collaborate with these unscrupulous elements to spread unverified stories on the unfortunate event that occurred at NDA Kaduna while tarnishing the good image and reputation of personnel of the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN) in the eyes of the civil populace.\u201d\n\nDefence Headquarters noted that the Nigerian Armed Forces was a professional force consisting of highly trained personnel, who were dedicated to their duties of protecting lives and property of all Nigerians.\n\nAs the attack on the elite military university continued to elicit shock and anger from Nigerians, the Delta State governor called on the federal government to summon the political will to deal decisively with armed criminality in the country, regardless of the ethnicity, religion or status of the culprits.\n\nHe lamented that the war on terror was being seriously undermined by the payment of ransom to criminal elements, saying there is need for the deployment of modern security architecture anchored on technology to win the war against insurgency.\n\nOkowa explained that the herdsmen/farmers conflict was fast becoming the greatest threat to the country\u2019s unity and economic wellbeing, adding that the nomadic Muslim Fulani pastoralists and Christian farmers of various ethnicities have continued to clash resulting in loss of lives as well as economic crops and cattle.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThis threat to our country\u2019s stability and unity needs to be addressed urgently by our federation. It is my opinion that ranching and cattle colonies with support by the federal government are a way out of this challenge.\n\n\u201cThe federal government must urgently tackle this challenge to reduce the level of insecurity and ensure food security. Criminal herdsmen must be dealt with within our laws and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) need to be resettled in their homes.\u201d\n\nThe Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives also decried the escalating acts of terrorism and banditry across the country, particularly, the invasion of the NDA. In a statement by its leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the caucus lamented that hardly a day passed without the country being jolted by reports of gruesome killings, abductions, arson, and mindless plundering by terrorists and bandits, who now freely operated on highways, schools, and communities.\n\nThe lawmakers demanded immediate action by the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led federal government to check the ugly trend. They called for forensic investigation into the circumstances that enabled the invasion of the NDA and subsequent killing and abduction of officers.\n\nThe caucus also called for investigation into the concerns raised by some groups, including the Arewa Youths Consultative Forum (AYCF), about the handling of insurgents by the authorities.\n\nHowever, the lawmakers urged troops involved in the fight against terror not to be deterred but to remain firm in their commitment, promising to intensify legislative action that would support genuine effort towards restoring peace in the country.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cThe Minority Caucus notes the heightened attacks on military formations and mindless killings and maiming of innocent Nigerians by bandits and terrorists in various parts of the country, despite the assurances of the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration.\n\n\u201cThe situation has become extremely horrifying in Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna, Kano, Yobe, Benue, Borno, Niger and other states across our nation, where killers and kidnappers are now having a field day raiding communities and killing our compatriots.\n\n\u201cOn yesterday night, 35 Nigerians were reportedly massacred in Yelwan Zangam in Jos, Plateau State, barely a week after innocent travellers were ambushed and brutally murdered in the state.\n\n\u201cOur caucus is distressed that every day, families are deprived of their breadwinners, scores of children are orphaned, wives are turned to widows, husbands turned to widowers, parents are made to bury their children hacked down in their prime, with others languishing in their captors\u2019 dens and family source of livelihood destroyed.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Executive Secretary of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Tony Ojukwu, condemned the attack on the NDA, describing it as an affront on Nigeria\u2019s security, which is highly unacceptable. Ojukwu, who expressed shock and disappointment in his reaction to the attack, said in Abuja that the NDA was a pride of the country, where people from other parts of the world came to train.\n\nThe NHRC executive secretary stated, \u201cThe invasion of the institution with high international repute, where very intelligent military officers are produced is most unfortunate, unexpected and condemnable.\u201d\n\nOjukwu said the attack on the military institution was bad in itself, and worst of all, officers were killed and abducted. He said, \u201cThis is the worst form of human rights violation of our time.\n\n\u201cMilitary officers, like other security personnel, are entitled to carry out their duties in relative safety and security. They are fathers and mothers of their families, who are entitled to go to work and come back alive.\u201d\n\nHe called on the military to leave no stone unturned in its efforts to rescue the abducted officer and fish out the abductors to face the wrath of the law, saying, \u201cThis will discourage further attacks on other national critical assets and infrastructure.\u201d\n\nOjukwu commiserated with the families of the gallant men of the Nigerian military, Lieutenant Wulah and Flight Lieutenant Okoronkwo, saying they paid the supreme price in the service of their fatherland and their sacrifice would not go in vain.\n\nCondemning the attack, too, the youth wing of the highest Igbo sociocultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Wordwide, described the assault as an affront.\n\nNational Youth Leader of Ohanaeze Youth Wing, Damian Okafor, who stated this on Wednesday, while briefing journalists in Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State capital, noted that the group was solidly behind the position of the southern governors that open grazing be banned across southern Nigeria. Okafor said the attack was an affront on Nigeria\u2019s security architecture, stressing that open grazing has triggered conflicts between host communities and migrant herders, resulting in several deaths in states across the country.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIgbo youths condemn in its entirety the invasion of NDA, Afaka, where two army officers were shot dead and another abducted. Igbo Youths World Wide calls on the federal government to commence immediate investigation with a view to exposing the perpetrators of this heinous crime against the Nigeria Army and (they should) be made to face the wrath of the law.\n\n\u201cThe Igbo youths stand by the unanimous decision of the 17 southern governors made known to the general public through a communiqu\u00e9 on May 11, 2021, resolving to ban open grazing of cattle in their states. We don\u2019t want to lose more innocent lives in Igbo Land. Enough of this carnage!\n\n\u201cWhoever that is subscribing for opening grazing in Igbo Land should know that our 17 southern governors are not stupid to have defended their people through that resolve. That person should know that he/she is the core enemy of Igbo Land and shall be treated as such.\u201d\n\nOn its part, the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) said the invasion of the NDA indicated apparent loss of control, explaining that it is a key indicator of a failed state under the present administration. The group, in a statement issued Wednesday by its spokesperson, Mr. Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, said the attack signified a dangerous loss of control of the nation\u2019s territory by the government.\n\nIt said while effective governments provided core guarantees to citizens in the three inter-related realms of security, economics, and politics, the current administration in Nigeria had assumed the reputation of the most insensitive in the country\u2019s history, with the level of waste and impunity exhibited at the recent wedding of the president\u2019s son in Kano.\n\nThe northern group lamented that the polity had disintegrated to a point, where basic conditions and responsibilities of a sovereign government no longer functioned properly.\n\nCNG stated, \u201cThis apparent loss of control by the government has given rise to widespread corruption allegations, and escalating criminality, rampant intervention of non-state actors with the attendant sharp economic decline, proliferation of refugee settlements and the involuntary movement of populations, which are key indicators of state failure.\n\n\u201cThe effect of the apparent erosion of legitimate authority to make collective decisions on such serious matters as national security, despite the more than N5 trillion said to have been invested and another N1 billion put in the purchase of arms, has invariably raised serious questions of credibility and probity against the administration.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The family of Apostle Joseph Dominic Agboli, the founder of The Victorious Army Ministries International, Acme Road, Ogba, Lagos State, has alleged a foul play in the death of the cleric.\n\nAgboli died last Wednesday at the age of 58 after a brief illness.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the cleric was not able to preach on the pulpit on Sunday in the church as he was said to be sick.\n\nHowever, a top source in the Pastor\u2019s family alleged that his wife might have been the source of his death adding that she had hatched a plot to flee from Nigeria before the burial.\n\nThe source claims the pastor's wife, Blessing, had a boyfriend she had been seeing and already purchased a house in Canada where she planned to move to with her children.\n\nShe was also said to have received donations from well-wishers to the tune of N17million to fly Agboli abroad despite his demise.\n\nThe source said, \u201cShe has bought a property in Canada and she is trying to move with her children (who are currently in London) to relocate to Canada since they all have dual citizenship.\n\n\u201cShe is collecting funds of N17million for flying him abroad knowing fully well he's dead. She knew about the death before now but she's playing so smart.\n\n\u201cShe sacked all the domestic staff just immediately before the man passed on. All the reliable and loyal people around him, she chased them away with her attitude, including Baba Agboli\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cThe woman has a boyfriend she is secretly dating and she has two children from different fathers before marrying Papa Agboli and she did that with the help of a well-grounded charm and even when her children came for holiday, Papa Agboli didn't see them because they all went clubbing with their boyfriends.\u201d\n\nThe church has, however, confirmed the death of Agboli on the pastor\u2019s Facebook page, with his obituary displayed.\n\n\u201cGlory to God, It\u2019s with a heavy heart, but unreserved submission to the will of God that the Victorious Army Ministries International announces the departure unto Glory of God\u2019s servant, the Apostle, Joseph Dominic Agboli, who slept in the Lord on Wednesday, August 25th, 2021.\n\n\u201cOur confidence and joy is that he is, without doubt, resting in glory with Jesus, the Author and finisher of his faith.\n\n\u201cHe is survived by a wife and five children. Funeral rites will be communicated in due time. Shalom.\u201d",

          "title": "Nigerian fintech apps users confident despite regulatory crackdown",
          "text": "On August 17, a court in Abuja granted an order to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to freeze bank accounts belonging to four startups, which allow Nigerians to invest in foreign securities, for 180 days.\n\nThe crackdown by the apex bank could result in severe unintended casualties for the companies; but above all, it puts at risk what is arguably their most valuable asset \u2014 customers\u2019 trust.\n\nThe global finance industry is built on the foundation of trust. And in Nigeria, where more than 80 million citizens live below the poverty line, trust is even more paramount. Most Nigerians are likely to be skeptical about storing their hard-earned Naira with a digital-only company for extended periods.\n\nAnd the fintech platforms affected by CBN\u2019s move \u2014 Trove, Risevest, Bamboo, and Chaka \u2014 know this.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBeyond offering financial products with attractive investment returns, the startups have invested in building a customer trust and loyalty bank. This has mostly been through providing consistent financial literacy and transparent communication over the years, primarily via emails and Telegram channels.\n\nEach of the fintech firms has thousands of members in its respective Telegram community \u2014 Risevest (+12,000), Chaka (+5,000), and Trove (+3,000) \u2014 where inquiries and queries are responded to in real-time with opportunities to further educate their users.\n\nNews of the embargo on their bank accounts would ordinarily have sparked a frenzy among customers and it did for a moment. Some users took to social media to express their shock and others made moves to withdraw their funds, exhibiting a natural human instinct to fight or take flight when faced with a crisis or an unexpected situation.\n\nBut the majority of users have held on, helped by their trust in the companies, which quickly communicated the suspension to customers while assuring them their funds were safe.\n\n\u201cI got an email from Risevest before I even read in the news that their accounts were barred. So I was already calm knowing that my money was safe,\u201d Motunrayo Koyejo, a software engineer and Rise Vest user, told TechCabal. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have this much confidence if I didn\u2019t get that email.\u201d\n\nRise Vest\u2019s email to users after the suspension.\n\nWhile the suspension affected four retail trading apps, there is a tendency that such clampdown can result in contagion; a situation where a crisis affecting some companies spreads to other players in the industry.\n\nStephanie Osaji, who uses Cowrywise for savings said after seeing news of the court order, she was \u201cscared, thought about my funds and was wondering what would happen to my money\u201d if the platform suddenly shut down.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I considered withdrawing my money. I remember logging into the app and checking when my next due date for withdrawal was,\u201d Osaji said. \u201cBut then I just told myself that they would figure it out. I mean Nigerian startups almost always have a way of figuring things out.\u201d\n\nAnother Cowrywise user, Mosopefoluwa Okeowo, told TechCabal she thinks fintech startups will always find a solution. \u201cI honestly believe in them totally.\u201d\n\nThis sort of consumer confidence is one that takes years to build. Communicating with customers and stakeholders at the very early stages of a mishap is crucial to reassuring their confidence.\n\nSe the money I have in risevest yh, even if it will go like that we go die there. Thats how much I believe in Eke \u2014 Sani Yusuf (@saniyusuf) August 17, 2021\n\nSem. Sem. Started investing with Eke so long ago. Before he even started coming this way and we had never met until years later.\n\n\n\nRise will survive. https://t.co/a42wEDeVAW \u2014 Gossy (@gossyomega) August 23, 2021\n\nNigerians embracing investment-tech amid economic uncertainty\n\nAfrica\u2019s bustling fintech ecosystem has been increasingly defined by payments specialists and digital banks.\n\nBut a crop of wealth management startups has emerged in recent years, the majority helping Nigerians invest in foreign stocks and assets easier than ever before.\n\nInvesting in reliable financial assets appeals to many millennials in the country who are keen on hedging their future wealth against the unstable Naira, amid broader economic uncertainty.\n\nWith \u20a61,000 (around $2), anyone with a smartphone and internet can register on Chaka and browse through over 11,000 shares publicly listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and stock exchanges in the U.S.\n\nSavings and investment apps also boast superior returns on deposits. Compared to less than 5% interest rates on fixed deposits offered by Nigerian banks, Rise Vest offers a guaranteed 10% annual return on its fixed-income offering.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safer to save money with banks but one gets little or nothing in return,\u201d Koyejo said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an option in this economy.

          "text": "Ethiopia has begun developing its own social media platforms to rival Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Zoom, as per Reuters.\n\nAccording to the state communications security agency on Monday, the government wants its local platform to \u201creplace\u201d existing platforms, although it does not plan to block the other services.\n\nThe director-general of the Information Network Security Agency (INSA), Shumete Gizaw has accused Facebook of deleting posts and user accounts that he said were \u201cdisseminating the true reality about Ethiopia.\u201d\n\nIn June, Facebook pulled down fake accounts targeting opposition figures ahead of Ethiopia\u2019s House of Peoples\u2019 Representatives election, a move that didn\u2019t sit well with the incumbent Ethiopian government. In a local media outlet on Friday, Shumete accused Facebook of blocking users who were \u201cpreaching national unity and peace\u201d.\n\nIn the past year, the Ethiopian government has been criticized for shutting down access to internet and social media services, including Facebook and WhatsApp, due to unrest in the Tigray region and during the election. The government has not commented on those shutdowns.\n\nSince November 2020, Ethiopia, Africa\u2019s second-most populous country with about 115 million people, has been engulfed in a civil war between the federal government and the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), which controls the Tigray region in the country\u2019s north.\n\nSupporters of the different sides have taken the conversation over to social media.\n\nTo build these platforms, Ethiopia is relying solely on local expertise. While Shumete declined to share further details about its social media rival project, he proudly asserted that Ethiopia won\u2019t be the first to rely on local talents to build its social networks.\n\n\u201cThe rationale behind developing technology with local capacity is clear \u2026 Why do you think China is using WeChat?\u201d he said.\n\nDrawing such a parallel with the social messaging app WeChat is a bit troubling. WeChat, which is owned by China-headquartered Tencent Holdings, is widely used in the country and is considered to be a strong tool by Chinese authorities for monitoring its population.\n\nAffected by the pandemic, the Ethiopian government has a lot on its plate as it works towards economic recovery. It\u2019s looking to raise money via sales of telecom licenses and obtaining an additional $1 billion debt.\n\nThis begs the question of whether investing in state-owned social network platforms should be on its list of priorities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

You can find out what to expect here and check out 3 reasons not to miss SME Clinic 2021.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019ll let you read the testimonials of three participants from SME Clinic 2020.\n\n\u201cRunning a business in Nigeria is really not easy, and for me as an entrepreneur, attending SME Clinic by Techpoint Africa in 2020 played a pivotal role at the early stage of my business. At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time. Today, we have gone on to get a place of our own, and we\u2019re growing each passing day.\u201d \u2014 Onyekwere, CEO, Queen\u2019s Fruits.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me, there are a lot of things that make a business thrive. And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised. During the lockdown, I was still able to onboard offline customers to our, at the time, new online platform, and this helped me reach more people and especially, made for ease of interaction with offline clients.\u201d \u2014 F.

          "title": "I want more women to become angel investors \u2014 Yemi Keri on angel investing and building Rising Tide",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

The initial amount is N2 billion; we are making available N2 billion for MSMEs in Edo State.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we have a N165million fund, as part of the first tranche from the Edo State Government. It will be made available to small businesses, which are currently domiciled in our production hub. The money is to support and encourage them to grow their businesses. Edo State Government provided N1 billion, while BOI provided the other N1 billion, making it N2 billion, with an attractive interest rate.\u201d\n\n\u201cBOI has the capacity and resources to support this kind of programme. We are also partnering with Konga, utilizing the opportunity to empower our youths in the state,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cFrom this N2 billion fund, we estimate that we can impact as many as 50,000 businesses in Edo State. We have other facilities with other institutions like the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). This is a start-up fund, as we expect it to continue to grow: If you start with N50,000, now and when you do well tomorrow in your business, you will need N200,000.\n\nBorrowing is part of business, provided you continue to grow,\u201d the governor stated.\n\nObaseki said, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, his administration remains committed to improving the livelihoods of the people and creating opportunities for the youths to thrive.\n\nHe stated: \u201cWe have continued to create opportunities for Edo youths as our administration is open, transparent and competent in all we do. We urge Edo people to trust us, as all the opportunities that we present are real, and life-transforming for Edo people.\u201d\n\nThe governor, who reassured on the realization of the government\u2019s Making Edo Great Again (MEGA) agenda, stated: \u201cWe needed information to transform the state. As such, we embarked on the collation of data through our youths with the Data for MEGA project.\n\nIn Oredo Local Government Area (LGA), we have 11,152 small and medium businesses. In Owan West LGA, we have 501 small and medium businesses; the same data were collated across the state.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, BOI, Mr. Olukayode Pitan, noted that \u201cin a quest to grow and develop MSME businesses in the country, BOI has resolved to continue to collaborate with existing enterprises, as well as reputable local and international partners.\n\n\u201cThe MSME fund is aimed at providing business loans to enterprises located within the state, while the second fund is the N165m Edo Production Hub Fund, financed by the Edo State Government. The Edo Production Hub Fund is managed by the BOI and is to support businesses located within the state-owned production hub.\u201d\n\nThe governor was also taken on a guided tour of the Edo Production Hub, along with his wife, Betsy; MD of BOI, Pitan; Secretary to the Edo State Government, Osarodion Ogie Esq. and the Chief of Staff to the Governor, Hon. Osaigbovo Iyoha, among others.\n\nThe team also commissioned the new Bank of Industry Building in Benin City, the Edo State capital.\n\n...",

          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nNigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 5.01% year-on-year in real terms in the second quarter of 2021, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) has disclosed.\n\nThe NBS disclosed this in the latest report on the nation\u2019s GDP entitled Nigerian Gross Domestic Product Report (Q2 2021) released on Thursday.\n\nIt explained that the increase in the GDP index marked three consecutive quarters of growth following the negative growth rates recorded in the second and third quarters of 2020.\n\n\u201cThe Q2 2021 growth rate was higher than the -6.10% growth rate recorded in Q2 2020 and the 0.51% recorded in Q1 2021 year-on-year, indicating the return of business and economic activity near levels seen prior to the nationwide implementation of COVID-19 related restrictions,\u201d the report read.\n\n\u201cThe steady recovery observed since the end of 2020, with the gradual return of commercial activity, as well as local and international travel, accounted for the significant increase in growth performance relative to the second quarter of 2020 when nationwide restrictions took effect.\n\n\u201cYear to date, real GDP grew 2.70% in 2021 compared to -2.18% for the first half of 2020.\u201d\n\nBut the real GDP (quarter-on-quarter) grew at -0.79% in Q2 2021 compared to Q1 2021, indicating slightly slower economic activity than the preceding quarter due largely to seasonality.\n\nIn the quarter under review, the NBS revealed that the aggregate GDP stood at N39,123,713.32 million in nominal terms \u2013 higher than the second quarter of 2020 with aggregate GDP of N34,023,197.60 million, indicating a year-on-year nominal growth rate of 14.99%.\n\nIt added that the nominal GDP growth rate in Q2 2021 was higher than -2.80% growth recorded in the second quarter of 2020 when economic activities slowed sharply at the outset of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe Q2 2021 nominal growth rate was also higher than 12.25% growth recorded in Q1 2021,\u201d the agency said.\n\nIn the oil sector, the NBS disclosed that the average daily oil production stood at 1.61 million barrels per day (mbpd) in Q2 2021, saying the value was -0.19mbpd lower than the average daily production of 1.81mbpd recorded in the same quarter of 2020, and -0.10mbpd lower than the 1.72mbpd recorded in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nIt stated that the real growth of the oil sector was \u201312.65% (year-on-year) in Q2 2021, indicating a decrease of \u20136.02% points relative to the growth rate recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2020.\n\nData from the report showed that growth decreased by \u2013 10.44% points when compared to Q1 2021 which was \u20132.21%.\n\n\u201cFor the first half of 2021, real GDP was recorded at -7.13%, compared to -0.80% for the first half of 2020, the performance reflecting lower oil output.\n\n\u201cQuarter-on-quarter, the oil sector recorded a growth rate of -20.35% in Q2 2021. The Oil sector contributed 7.42% to total real GDP in Q2 2021, down from figures recorded in the corresponding period of 2020, and down compared to the preceding quarter, where it contributed 8.93% and 9.25% respectively,\u201d the report said.\n\nIt added, \u201cThe non-oil sector grew by 6.74% in real terms during the reference quarter (Q2 2021). The Q2 2021 growth rate was higher by 12.80% points compared to the rate recorded in the same quarter of 2020 and 5.95% points higher than the first quarter of 2021.\u201d\n\nThe NBS explained that during the quarter, the sector was driven mainly by growth in Trade, Information and Communication (Telecommunication), Transportation (Road Transport), Electricity, Agriculture (Crop Production) and Manufacturing (Food, Beverage & Tobacco), reflecting the easing of movement, business and economic activity across the country relative to the same period a year earlier.\n\n\u201cIn real terms, the non-oil sector contributed 92.58% to the nation\u2019s GDP in the second quarter of 2021, higher from shares recorded in the second quarter of 2020 which was 91.07% and the first quarter of 2021 recorded as 90.75%,\u201d the report said.",

          "text": "BEDC Electricity Plc (BEDC) has said it inaugurated several projects to improve power availability to customers in its franchise despite the disruption caused by the Covid 19 pandemic. The company also said it has metered about 40,000 customers under the National Mass Metering Programme (NMMP) of the Federal Government as at July 31, 2021.\n\nManaging Director/CEO of BEDC, Mrs Funke Osibodu, who disclosed this during a media briefing at the company\u2019s head office in Benin recently, listed some of the projects commissioned by the company to boost network infrastructure to include UNIBEN Ekenwan 15MVA injection substation to stabilise power supply to the University of Benin and environs as well as a 33KV injection substation at Evbuabogun in Benin to reduce the duration of interruption in electricity supply to commercial customers and communities in that location and the Evbuoriaria axis.\n\nMrs. Osibodu said BEDC also commissioned the 7.5MVA, 33/11KV injection substation to serve the Delta Development and Property Agency (DDPA) and Ugborokoko communities in Warri. The project, she said, will create separate feeders and improve power availability to a steady supply of between 12 and eight hours minimum respectively.\n\n\u201cBEDC has taken delivery of 54,198 out of the 75,870 meters for distribution to customers under the NMMP Phase 0 level while we have completed the installation of nearly 40,000 meters across the four states that we cover as at July ending. BEDC is installing meters on poles to reduce the incidence of bypass and other forms of energy theft which is prevalent in the network\u201d, she said.\n\nShe disclosed that between 2019 and early 2021, the company reconnected 108 transformers back to the national grid across its franchise, noting that out of this figure; 34 were in Edo State, 55 in Delta State and 12 in Ondo State while seven of such transformers were reconnected in Ekiti State.\n\nThe BEDC MD listed some of the beneficiary communities to include Woghiren-Ugbor in Etete, Iguadolor in Evbuotubu, Iyanamo and Ohoghobi Phase 2 in Etete, all in Benin City. Communities including Ijelu-Ekiti, Ijero-Ekiti, Omu-Ekiti, Erinmope and Hospital 2 in Ekiti State also benefitted, she said.\n\nIn Ondo State, the beneficiary communities included Graceland 2 Estate, Akure, Imoru and St. Catherine in Owo town, Oke-Ile, Odibo, Ikuyemi, Okelusi, Ikota, Ibuji and Erigi, all in Igbara-Oke, Ondo State. Communities in Delta State that benefited included Odibo layout in Warri, Idumu Ogo in Asaba, Okiirigbagha in Sapele, Aladja, Ogbe Ijoh in Otor-Udu, Finger of God Estate and Ugboba, Ugbolu in Asaba.\n\n\u201cRecognising the financial difficulties that customers are going through, especially during this period of Covid-19 pandemic, BEDC has begun a Debt Rescheduling Scheme (DRS) for customers in its coverage areas,\u201d she said.\n\nShe explained that this was a soft-landing approach for customers to settle outstanding debts on electricity consumption as it offers discount ranging from five to 25 percent and down payment of 25 percent with balance payable up to 45 years or provision of an additional five percent discount where a customer pays off such outstanding instantly.\n\nMrs. Osibodu said BEDC shall soon begin the introduction and enrolment of customers on its Electronic Billing (E-Billing) platform, adding that electronic billing reduces the risks of lost statements, improves reconciliation while providing history. The platform also reduces identity frauds as no third party is involved, among other benefits, in addition to being Covid 19 compliant as no physical handling is required,\u201d she said.\n\nMrs. Osibodu explained that since the commencement of the Service Reflective Tariff (SRT), the company has been improving on the power supply arrangement to the five classes of customer categorisation except for occasional tripping caused by faulty and aged equipment and worsened in the rainy season.",

          "text": "Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun, has listed kidnapping and cultism as the biggest security challenges confronting Ogun state.\n\nAbiodun made this known while hosting the new Assistant Inspector General of Police in charge of Zone 2, Johnson Kokumo in his office at Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta.\n\nHe said the state with many federal roads would require huge manpower and equipment to monitor criminal activities.\n\nThe governor lauded the Air Wing of the Police Force for helping in combating criminal activities, especially kidnapping in the state.\n\nHe commended the AIG for his initiative to provide security at Kara and under the Long Bridge axis of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway.\n\nAbiodun explained that the Nigerian Army, through its General Officer Commanding (GOC), had pledged to support the state by deploying tracking equipment to track kidnappers, urging men of the Nigeria Police to work in synergy with the Army to achieve the set objective.\n\n\u201cThe biggest issues we have today in Ogun State are that of random kidnapping and cult activities.\n\n\u201cI believe that the cult activities have abated now because of the joint efforts of the Nigeria Police, the State Security Services and the Nigerian Army.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are still struggling and dealing with issues that relate to kidnapping of contractors, farmers and innocent Ogun State residents. We sincerely hope that as we go along in our relationship, we will collaborate to ensure that we reduce this incident of kidnapping to absolute zero\u201d, the governor said.\n\nWhile describing insecurity as an act of sabotage, he said Ogun has been proactive in the area of security by rejigging the State Security Trust Fund, which according to him, had helped in providing patrol vans, communication and other gadgets to enable security agencies carry out their functions effectively.\n\nAbiodun, however, thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for approving the use of a Nigeria Police helicopter that has been working and providing air surveillance in the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe use of that helicopter greatly assisted us in reducing the response time to kidnap situation and consequently reduced kidnap situations. I understand that the helicopter has been re-assisgned for use somewhere else, it is my hope that AIG, you will use your good office to ensure that the helicopter is redeployed back to Ogun State.\n\n\u201cYou will note that Ogun has an unusual amount of federal roads compared to other states. We have the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, Epe-Ijebu-Ode, Sagamu-Ikorodu and the Lagos-Ota-Abeokuta road, all these are federal roads. We find out that 80 to 90% of the stretch of these roads are in Ogun State and it is humanly impossible for the men of the Nigeria Police to patrol all those roads as adequately as they require\n\n\u201cBut each time we have a distress call on any of those locations, either from Yewa, meaning Imeko, Ipokia all the way to Ogun Waterside or Ijebu-Igbo, the helicopter was able to respond swiftly to the distress calls while your men now move in, thereby ensuring that the kidnappers are not able to leave the immediate corridor before the men arrive. I want to use this opportunity to implore that you help us to discuss with your men of the Air Wing to ensure the speedy return of this helicopter\u201d.\n\nSpeaking earlier, AIG Kokumo said Zone 2 comprising Ogun and Lagos States police commands was planning a joint operation between the two commands to fight criminals, particularly at Kara and Under the Bridge along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway.\n\nThis, according to him, is to ensure that adequate security is provided for companies, industries and individuals operating along the axis.\n\nThe AIG who hinted that he was in the state on a familiarisation visit, noted that the Zone was working on a synergy between the Marine Olive Units of Lagos and Ogun State command to provide security in the coastal areas.\n\nKokumo also appreciated the Abiodun-led administration in the state for providing the necessary working tools to the police force, noting \u201cwithout the commitment of the governor, policing the state would have been difficult\u201d.",

We are in close contact with our US and other NATO allies at an operational level on the immediate response to this incident.\u2019\n\nThe explosion will inevitably prompt speculation over whether rescue flights out of the country will be able to continue ahead of the deadline for the withdrawal of US forces on August 31.\n\nThe blast came after Boris Johnson had warned that time is running out to rescue people from Afghanistan ahead of Joe Biden\u2019s exit date.\n\nThe Prime Minister had said at lunchtime that the UK will continue with airlifts \u2018for as long as we can\u2019 and insisted \u2018we have got the overwhelming majority\u2019 of eligible people out.\n\nArmed Forces Minister James Heappey this morning delivered the stark admission that the UK will not be able to rescue everyone who is eligible.\n\nMr Heappey said the \u2018window of opportunity to evacuate people is closing\u2019 and \u2018there will be people on your TV screens over the weekend that have been left behind\u2019.\n\nThe UK was due to run 11 evacuation flights today but Mr Heappey would not be drawn on whether there will be more tomorrow.\n\nMr Biden rejected calls from Mr Johnson and other NATO allies to push back his withdrawal deadline to provide more time for the humanitarian airlifts.\n\nThe UK is scrambling to get as many eligible people out of the country as possible amid fears those who worked for Britain could face reprisals under the new Taliban regime.",

So we have received this order and this is it.\n\n\u201cAnd in line with the constitution of the peoples democratic party, and I quote \u201d functions of a deputy national chairman, there shall be two deputy national chairman, one shall come from the northern part, while the other from the southern part of the country.

Like you know, in the absence of the deputy chairman south, I take full charge, so I am hereby calling for an emergency NEC meeting on the 27th August, 2021, 10 am prompt to deliberate.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe all the leaders of this party, the owners of this party, will be in attendance are our governors, former presiding officers will be part of the NEC meeting to deliberate all pending issues.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question on whether there is now a division in the NWC, Senator Nazif said \u201cLet me make this very clear that this meeting was called for 2 pm and like I said, the deputy national chairman south has been incapacitated and did not attend any meeting in the last 9 to 10 months as far as NWC is concern. He has not been in communication with any member of the NWC for the last 10 months. And like I said this party must continue its process.\n\n\u201cAnd if I am not available someone else will take over. If the national chairman is not available someone will take over, if the deputy national chairman south is not available, the deputy chairman north will take charge.\n\n\u201cThis is the resolution that was passed by the expanded caucus. And this was the resolution passed by the NWC in our last meeting and we all agreed that there will be a meeting today, meeting that was supposed to be presided over by the National Chairman, unfortunately the court order came from a competent court and stop the chairman from acting as chairman of the party.\u201d",

This is the highest research grant ever. It has never gone beyond 200. We have 217 research grants that have recently been approved,\u201d Bogoro said.\n\nSpeaking on the recent special allocations by the TETFund\u2019s Board of Trustees,BoT, Bogoro revealed that N5 billion each was approved for University of Lagos,UniLag, and Ahmadu Bello University, ABU,Zaria, for massive infrastructural projects\u2019 development.\n\nThe TETFund boss said N1 billion was also approved as funds for the completion of special intervention projects for Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife and another N1 billion for Imo State Polytechnic, Umuagwo, adding that more tertiary institutions would benefit from the special allocations in not too distant time.\n\nBogoro said TETFund is also providing support to boost research activities in Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria,DICON, among others, to address the nation\u2019s security challenges.\n\nOn TETFund\u2019s intervention in the health sector, Bogoro stated that the Fund has provided N1 billion to one university each in the six geo-political zones for medical research as well as providing facilities for treatment of major ailments like prostate cancer, kidney problems, among others.\n\n\u201cWith the Urology and kidney facilities made available, we are expecting a number of our teaching hospitals to come up with the capacity, granted that the equipment we provided, they should be able to do kidney transplant etc, in our universities.\n\n\u201cWe intend to continue strengthening some in terms of cancer facilities, urology research clinical facilities and heart facilities,\u201d he said.\n\nThe forum also provided Bogoro an opportunity to explain that the Board of TETFund has approved the review of overseas masters and PhD courses/specialization.\n\nAccording to him, more emphasis would now be placed on masters or PhD programmes that are science based.\n\nAmong the overseas masters and PhD courses specializations with effect from August 2021 includes: Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering, Biosciences, Biomedical Engineering, Material Science and Engineering, Industrial Systems and Engineering, Geosciences, Behavioural Sciences, Nuclear Engineering, Oceanography, Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, among others.\n\nThe highlight of the event was the presentation of allocation letters to the beneficiary institutions.",

          "text": "The Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) has described Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom\u2019s latest comments on President Muhammad Buhari\u2019s administration as rantings of a failed governor.\n\nAccording to the group, the latest attack is not unexpected, because the Governor has a habit of launching unguarded verbal attacks on the President at the end of each month when he should be working on paying workers\u2019 salaries and pensions.\n\nIn a statement signed by its Chairman Niyi Akinsiju and Secretary Cassidy Madueke, BMO said Governor Ortom\u2019s reaction to the President\u2019s move to restore over 300 grazing reserves in 25 states was just a diversionary tactic.\n\n\u201cGovernor Ortom has expectedly publicly come out to challenge the ongoing move by the Federal Government to revive grazing reserves by making unguarded comments against the President.\n\n\u201cWe are however surprised that his latest tirade on national TV came within days of indicating his interest in challenging the government\u2019s plan in court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo we have every reason to agree with many Nigerians who have said the Governor has a habit of using the media, at the end of each month, to attack President Buhari on his perceived Fulanisation agenda when he knows he won\u2019t be paying civil servants their wages.\n\n\u201cHere is a Governor who ranks as the worst in performance among his peers, according to the Tiv Youth Council worldwide, yet he prefers to slander the President rather than provide good governance for the people of Benue State in the last six years\u201d.\n\nBMO added that Ortom\u2019s position on President Buhari\u2019s support for open grazing is at variance with the realities on ground.\n\n\u201cHow could the Governor in one breath accuse the President of supporting ranching in Katsina State to the detriment of others, and in another breath claim that Buhari is bent on imposing open grazing across the country?\n\n\u201cWhich is why we see his open attack of the move to retrieve grazing reserves from those who have taken them over as a reflection of his incoherence. It is clear that he responded without having a full grasp of the issues at stake, even after the Presidency had made President Buhari\u2019s stance on open grazing public.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe know that Governor Ortom has absolutely nothing to show for his six years in office so we urge him to pay more attention to doing something worthwhile for Benue people rather than his regular show of open hostility to a President that has continued to ignore his tirades.\n\n\u201cIt would be a shame that after eight years in office, the only legacy he would be leaving will almost certainly be his anti-Buhari posturing, not projects, unlike some of his colleagues, even in the same shipwreck that is the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\n\u201cWe however need to remind the Benue State Governor of the promise he made several weeks ago that he would be inviting the President to commission a number of projects. Like many Nigerians, we hope it won\u2019t be a case of \u2018Waiting for Godot!\u2019 because we are all keen on seeing what Ortom has been doing in the last six years\u201d.\n\nBMO also urged Governor Ortom to speak more on how he has improved on what he met in 2015, rather than his constant desire to hug the limelight with his anti-Buhari rhetorics.",
