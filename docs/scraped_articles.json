          "text": "United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has said about 8,000 children have been recruited in fighting the war against Nigeria since the start of the Boko Haram crisis in the North East in 2009.\n\nThe UN agency, while calling for a step-up of effort to protect child victims and witnesses in terrorism-related proceedings in Nigeria, said that reports have shown that some boys and girls were increasingly being used as human shields and to detonate bombs.\n\nA statement on Wednesday read, \u201cAccording to United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime\u2019s report from the Handbook of Children Recruited and exploited by terrorist and violent extremist groups, since 2009, about 8,000 children have been recruited and used by Boko Haram in Nigeria. \u201cSome boys have been forced to attack their own families to demonstrate loyalty to Boko Haram, while girls have been forced to marry, clean, cook and carry equipment and weapons.\u201d\n\nThe statement added that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights received consistent reports that some boys and girls were increasingly being used as human shields and to detonate bombs, citing that in May 2015, a girl about 12 years old was used to detonate a bomb at a bus station in Damaturu, Yobe State, killing seven people. Similar incidents were reported in Cameroon and Niger Republic.\n\nThe statement further said that the recently released propaganda video by Islamic State\u2019s West Africa Province, showing children being taught military skills to train them for fighting and the latest attack on the Chibok community in Borno State by ISWAP are reminders of the importance to step up the efforts aimed to protect children from terrorist groups.\n\nThe statement revealed that UNODC, working closely with national counterparts, have recently started to provide support aimed at preventing and responding to violence against children by terrorists and violent extremist groups, under a new European funded project called \u201cSTRIVE Juvenile.\u201d\n\nProject Manager of STRIVE Juvenile, Bianca Kopp, said UNODC acknowledged during the opening of a recent capacity building workshop that \u201cwe have all sadly become familiar \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 with the phenomenon of child recruitment and exploitation by terrorist groups, noting that \u201cindeed, the kidnapping of the Chibok girls was probably the first event that brought global attention to the brutality of these groups towards children and, even more crucially, it showed how children play a key role in their criminal tactics.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "How Fountain is changing the face of education in Nigeria -Isaac Audu",
          "text": "Isaac Audu\n\nBy Joseph Erunke\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic, insurgency, terrorism and banditry resulting in destruction of education facilities, killing and kidnapping of school children and teachers have tremendously fueled the crisis in the education sector in subsahara Africa. Again,the poor number of qualified and employed teachers has left school children at the mercy of the few,some of whom are less capable to handle the surging population of children in primary and secondary schools in the subregion today.\n\nAt the moment,the region is projected to need an additional 15 million primary and secondary teachers by 2030 for the education system to recover from the COVID pandemic. How can this be achieved is the question that is in the lip of every principal actor of the region\u2019s education recovery efforts. While many are out there tasking their brains on how this could be solved, Fountain,an education and community development initiative, through its programme, Fountain Empowerment and Development, FEED, has provided the answer.\n\nREAD ALSO:2023: Group advises political parties on zoning presidency\n\nApart from rewriting some hardcopy text books to simpler form to help school children read and assimilate easily, the organisation,no doubt,has come up with an innovative measures that would see few teachers impacting knowledge to hundreds of school children at a given period, through digital devices,thus saving authorities of the need to source for millions of physical teachers.\n\nThe measures encapsulated in the Fountain\u2019s FEED programme, according to the Programme Coordinator, Isaac-Audu, has seen the conversion of written materials or hard copy texts to digital format. So far, hard copy text books in 29 subjects have made into simplified key notes.\n\nThe FEED programme is an offspring of Fountain Integrated Services, a business entity with status of a Non-Governmental Organisation, NGO,which core mandate is remodification of teaching and learning not just in Nigeria but Africa as a whole.\n\nThe development of the education materials which started in 2012,saw the launch of ten books in 2015, according to Isaac Audu.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to achieve the SDG goal number 4 for quality education, that is the first goal that we have. We are hopping that that would lead us to achieve goal number 10 which is to reduce inequality. When somebody is properly educated, it bridges the gap of inequality. It may not necessarily mean the income level but the gap is reduced a bit. When inequality is reduced,it brings us back to goal number one which is to alleviate poverty. Educate them,reduce inequality and poverty is alleviated and we can\u2019t do this without goal number 17, which is partnership. That is why we call on partners to join us so that we can do this together.\n\nAfrica can be a better place, the narrative can change if we come together to achieve this,\u201dhe told Vanguard.\n\nAudu spoke further on his organisation\u2019s activities thus:\u201dBasically, we are into education. We are also extending to community development. We started in 2012 to develop these educational materials and in 2015,we had a book launch with ten subjects. From that 2015 to now,we have published 29 books in all and we have also given back to the society through our social corporate responsibility. \u201c\n\nHe, however,regretted that the activities of the organisation were not documented from the beginning.\n\n\u201cWe noticed that what we have done over the years was not being documented. We would just go out,give these materials to some NGOs and so on.So for us,we now thought of how best we can package this,structure it very well and make sure that the people who we are targeting get the best.\n\nThat is what made us come up with the FEED.\n\n\u201cThe FEED programme is designed in such a way that we are taking these materials that we have prepared and are approved to the rural communities.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, many of them would not be able to afford the kind of materials that we have made here,both the audiovisual and the hard copies of our books. So we designed this programme so that we will be able to take these groups to the rural communities,\u201dhe explained.\n\nOn how far the programme has gone,he said:\u201dSo far,we started with a suburb here in Abuja ,then we went to Karu in Nasarawa and we have been to two communities in Toro Local Government Area of Bauchi and then to Akamkpa in Cross River State.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have been to Gembu Community of Taraba State as well. The feedback we have gotten from these communities was enormous. They are expecting us to do more. That is why we are calling on partners to join us in this campaign,to bridge the gap in education. Our motto is is to equip these children for the future-one child at a time.\u201d\n\nAnswering question on whether he would go into collaboration with some agencies,he said:\u201dWe have written letters to various organisations but we are yet to get feedback.\n\n\u201cSome have promised us that they want to have meetings with us but we don\u2019t want to wait for them. When you have a vision and it is boiling inside you, you can\u2019t wait for everybody to join the train before you start. That is why you see that with the little resources that we have,we have started. So when they join us,when they are ready to give us audience, we will show them what we have started,\u201dhe added.\n\nOn how the programme is adding value to the society,he explained:\u201dThere was this report that Africa needs about 15 million teachers to be able to meet up with the millennium goals by 2030. The question is that where are you going to find 15 million teachers to be able to bridge that gap? Now,if you look at the statistics of the annual budget in most Sahara Africa,its just about five percent that most government are signing for education. If you check, you will see that more than half of children in those communities are out of school. So by bringing this programme, we are adding value in the sense that we are reducing the cost,even for the government because if you have quality teachers teaching and you prepared it in a documentary form,it\u2019s like having one teacher teaching 10,000 students at the same time. That is a lot of value you are adding to the society. While you are engaged in the audiovisual, you have materials right in front of joy that you can also take down. So we are combining the two in a very fugal innovative way to get this result.\u201d\n\nHe spoke further:\u201dSo far,for the educational materials that we are working with, we have reached out to 20 states already. Our materials are already in 20 states as at the last count and quite a number of schools are using those materials. I\u2019m not talking about audiovisuals here because our audiovisuals are reserved for the FEED programme. We are not putting our audiovisuals online for sale,they are specifically for the FEED programme. Over 20 schools across the country have these materials and the feedback has been tremendous.\n\nOn why the organisation was targeting only secondary schools,he said:\u201dThere is always a starting point for every idea,you don\u2019t just carry the entire burden at once. So,right now,even among the secondary schools, we are starting with those preparing for their final year exams. So this first phase would give us the opportunity to learn and study how the programme will be most effective and beneficial to these young ones. So,as we make progress and as we see the achievements and resources of the programme, we will even take it down further to the primary schools and then up higher to the tertiary institutions.\u201d",
          "summary": "The development of the education materials which started in 2012,saw the launch of ten books in 2015, according to Isaac Audu.\n\u201cOur goal is to achieve the SDG goal number 4 for quality education, that is the first goal that we have.\nWe are hopping that that would lead us to achieve goal number 10 which is to reduce inequality.\nWhen inequality is reduced,it brings us back to goal number one which is to alleviate poverty.\nEducate them,reduce inequality and poverty is alleviated and we can\u2019t do this without goal number 17, which is partnership.",

          "text": "Dr. Celestine Ugochukwu Chukwunenye is the Chief Medical Director/Chief Consultant, Optimal Specialist Hospital, Surulere, Lagos. His wife and two children also studied medicine. JOSEPH ESHANOKPE reports.\n\nBackground\n\nI was born on March 31, 1960 to Chief and Mrs Alphonsus O. Chukwunenye in Ebute Meta, Lagos. My parents are from Izi-Achi in Imo State.\n\nGrowing up\n\nThe early years were ok until the war broke out in 1967 and we had to return to the village where our standard of living dropped. I remember\n\nthat we had to fetch water and wood, things that I had not done. Yet, I considered them very interesting.\n\nMy daddy, who had a Standard Six certificate, started life as a shipping clerk at a Greek shipping company. From here he veered off\n\ninto trading. When he discovered that it was more lucrative, he stayed put and made it big as he became one of the major distributors of\n\nNigerian Breweries, Guinness and Coca Cola Company, among others.\n\nHe also went into long-distance haulage. The father of the late Chief Emeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, a notable haulage merchant in those days, I\n\nlearnt, had a great impact on my father. In those days, unlike now, the Ibo in Lagos belonged to one group. It was there that they met.\n\nMy mother\n\nAfter attaining Standard Three, she got married and came to Lagos.\n\nInitially, she was a full-time house wife who assisted her husband in his business. Later, she built a bakery, Christy Country Bakery and\n\nfor many years a producer of the popular brand of Agege Bread until her old age.\n\nEducation\n\nI attended St. Paul\u2019s Primary School, Costain, Lagos, continued at the village and returned to the school after the war to complete my\n\neducation. I didn\u2019t like going to school because of the early morning cold bath. I remember crying to school. But I did well. I topped the\n\nclass in primary six with distinction in the Primary School Leaving Certificate Examination.\n\nI proceeded to Baptist Academy, Obanikoro, Lagos. I was there from January 1973 to 1977. On the first day I was left in the dormitory. It\n\nwas a fearful night. I didn\u2019t want to stay because I was in the midst of strangers. I woke up in the morning into a regimented life but\n\ngradually I adjusted. At the end I emerged the best graduating student with Grade One, Aggregate Seven.\n\nDespite this achievement, however, none of us was made a prefect as the school\u2019s management felt we were too rarefied or \u2018\u2019too hot to\n\nhandle\u2019\u2019 as they termed us. But, we called ourselves the great set as we set a record.\n\nFor my university education, I was at the then University of Ife (UNIFE), now Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) where I studied\n\nMedicine. Earlier I had fallen in love with the University of Ibadan (UI). But at OAU, we had beautiful reports about the campus, and the\n\ngreat lecturers such as Professor Wole Soyinka. We also had strong academic programmes.\n\nOne reason I loved UNIFE then was that it had no age limit in its admissions policy unlike other universities. Once you are good and you\n\nare 14 years old, the university would admit you unlike other universities that would not admit a student except he is 17 years old.\n\nThat criterion really attracted me to Ife.\n\nWithout being modest, I was one of the university scholars in the six of my seven-year programme. It was later taken over by the Federal\n\nGovernment and put under its scholarship scheme.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWhy I chose Medicine\n\nI was attracted by the white dress that medical students wore which I saw on TV. I was qualified to read anything anyway. When my parents\n\nlearnt of the course of study I chose, they were very happy and encouraged me.\n\nSchool life was fine. We worked hard, yet played well. Indeed we played little students politics. We had measured interest in politics\n\nand philanthropic activities. I narrowly missed a first class in Medicine. One big achievement of our set was that we changed the\n\nseven-year medical programme at OAU to six. We fought for it, arguing with what was happening in the medical schools in other universities.\n\nThankfully, the Senate of our university agreed.\n\nAfter university education, expectedly I went for youth service and worked as a junior doctor before I returned to Ife to specialise in\n\nobstetrics and gynaecology. This was around 1989 and 1995. In 1996, I worked at Imperial Medical Centre, Ebute Meta and Motayo General\n\nHospital before I became a consultant.\n\nHappily, I was one of the students offered lectureship by the then University of Ife. But I turned down the offer. However, I had to beg\n\nto be let go.\n\nAt the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), a similar scenario played out as I was also offered a lectureship position. I have been\n\nin private practice since 1997 when we established the Optimal Specialist Hospital. We can look back and say in the last 24 years, we\n\nhave done well as no woman has died there.\n\nMy wife\n\nI met my wife during housemanship at Ilesha. She too studied medicine.\n\nBut she specialised in pediatrics. Three years later, we were married in Ibadan her home town.\n\nChildren\n\nWe have two sons Uzoma and Nonso. Initially, they said they would not study medicine. However, when the first son bought the Joint\n\nAdmissions Matriculation Board (JAMB) form, I was surprised that he filled in medicine. They have always followed each other. So, when\n\nthe first one filled in medicine, I knew that the second would also go for medicine.\n\nPlan\n\nWhen they return from their fellowship training this year, I would retire.\n\nAdvice\n\nI am grateful to God for the achievement. For the young ones, I will advise them to be obedient to their parents, guardians and teachers.\n\nThey should also listen to their advice. Those things are profitable in life.\n\nFor the adults, it is time to make fundamental changes to leave Black Africa in a better state than we met it. Africa and blacks practically\n\nhave no reckoning in the scheme of things. I feel it is our duty to reverse the trend. By doing this, things would change. It is high time\n\nwe encouraged oneness of various black people and indeed the world and down play the things we think that divide us.\n\nDoctor-to-patient ratio\n\nWe have never had enough doctors. At the rate we are going, in the next 25 years, we will not. That is the truth. It is wrong for the\n\ngovernment to peg admissions into medical schools. The problem is not in the numbers. But in providing the enabling environment for the\n\nindustry to prosper. For example, if we produce as many doctors as Europe demanded and enough to meet local demand, the problem of brain\n\ndrain would not be there. The first problem is finance. You shouldn\u2019t leave the health industry to be struggling. Unfortunately, it can\u2019t be\n\ncommercialised like the banking and brewing sectors. Healthcare is largely socially humanitarian. To solve the problem, the government\n\nshould create special funds or banks for the health sector. There should be low interest loans or grants for thriving hospitals. At the\n\nend, it is the people would benefit from it.\n\nAnother aspect is the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). It should be unacceptable to the government that since 2005 when the\n\nObasanjo government started it, it has less than five per cent coverage. The tariff of NHIS is not encouraging. There is the need for the Health Maintenance Organisations (HMOs) to have a strong health maintenance that can reach out to the people.",

          "title": "Sylva Doubts Nigeria\u2019s Petrol Consumption Figures, Says Numbers Crazy, Opaque",
          "text": "\u2022Elumelu raises concerns over $4bn oil theft, insists its national disgrace\n\nJames Emejo and Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Minister of Petroleum Resources, Mr Timipre Sylva, yesterday expressed doubts over Nigeria\u2019s daily petrol consumption figures, describing them as crazy and opaque.\n\nThe minister who appeared on the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), a government-owned broadcast station, in apparent frustration, noted that there\u2019s nothing that needed to be interrogated that had not been questioned on the subsidy matter.\n\nAlso, the Founder/Chairman of Heirs Holdings Limited, Mr. Tony Elumelu, yesterday said incessant oil theft in the Niger Delta region remained a major national challenge requiring urgent attention by the country\u2019s leadership. Elumelu, while delivering the National Defence College, Course 30 Lecture titled: \u201cStrategic Leadership: My Business Experience,\u201d further described the activities of oil thieves as a national disgrace which requires national seminar and dialogue to address.\n\nSylva agreed that figures released by concerned authorities were questionable, stressing that the best solution to the issue would have been to completely remove the subsidy.\n\nNigeria\u2019s subsidy regime has for decades remained a subject of controversy, with the figures from the authorities ranging from between 50 million litres per day to around 103 million litres.\n\nAs at today, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) is the sole importer of the product, since private businessmen exited the scene due to non-availability of foreign exchange years ago.\n\nHaving backtracked on its plan to remove fuel subsidy as dictated by the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the executive arm of government is set to approach the National Assembly to approve the N3 trillion for the payment of subsidies in 2022. The government last week extended the implementation by 18 months.\n\nThe minister alleged that a few persons were holding the rest of the country to ransom, explaining that the rich rather than the most vulnerable in the country gain more from the payment of subsidies than the poor.\n\nSpeaking on the dynamics of rising consumption figures and increasing subsidy payment, Sylva explained that although there was something fishy about the data, there\u2019s nothing that hadn\u2019t been done in the past to muscle those bleeding the country without success.\n\n\u201cThere have been efforts at controlling some of the smuggling. And then something dramatic happened. When we had the deregulation discussions, and the price moved up to N162 from N145 where I met it, we realised that the consumption dropped to less than 50 million litres or to the 40 million.\n\n\u201cSo, later on, once the exchange rate also now moved up a little bit and swallowed the gains we made from the N162 move, the figures increased again.\n\n\u201cAnd sometimes, the figures you hear are crazy. I mean, when they tell you 90 million litres a day, I mean, they\u2019re crazy figures. So I mean, so for me what is the sum total of all this? We\u2019ve been interrogating these numbers for 20 years.\n\n\u201cWe continue to interrogate these figures because we all know that there is a problem here, it\u2019s opaque . The opportunity, the premium is not coming to government and it is not going to the poor people. It is going to a select people who are feeding fat on these things.\n\n\u201cSo why don\u2019t we just get rid of this thing? Okay, we should interrogate this thing, but I mean, to me that is not the solution. Why don\u2019t we get just get rid of this whole subsidy so that we know that this problem is over once and for all.\n\n\u201cI know when people say the figures are\u2026 I mean, we agree that the figures are all opaque. We agree. That\u2019s why we are saying look, let\u2019s stop all the shenanigans. Let\u2019s stop all this discussion.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s leave all this opaqueness, all this corruption in the subsidy, let us move away from subsidy and go on higher ground. And then they say no, no, no. There\u2019s been trial of subsidy thieves. Oh, we\u2019ve gone on television to say okay, these are the template, these are the components of the templates,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe minister was reacting to the insistence by a co-guest, Prof. Yinka Omorogbe, an energy law expert and President Nigerian Association of Energy Economists (NAEE), that Nigeria must investigate how many litres it consumes, among others.\n\nThe minister maintained that even labour which is against the removal of the subsidy knows the issues, adding that Nigeria continues to hemorrhage because the subsidy regime persists.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just get out of it? Okay, there has been some corruption. So we can always deal with the corruption issues. We can always deal with all the opaque issues. But should we allow Nigerians who are not benefiting from this thing as you agree with me, to continue to be hemorrhaging?\n\n\u201cBecause we need to get out of this, because look at it, N3 trillion budgeted. You can imagine if this N3 trillion were to be budgeted for something else. Who\u2019s going to be benefit from it? I\u2019m not into the downstream, I\u2019m not going to benefit,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe argued that even the Dangote refinery would not survive in a subsidised environment, reason the businessman carefully planned it as an export facility around the Export Free Zone (EFZ) in Lagos.\n\n\u201cIt is by his port, because he was not refining to sell at a loss as the other refineries were designed to do. He designed his to sell at a profit internationally. If we are to buy from him, we will also buy at the international market. The only saving we will make as a government in that case, is the cost of freight,\u201d he argued.\n\n\u201cSo, you find that that it was his own model, it is still not going to function under a subsidy regime, even Dangote refinery will not function. So, it is agreed that no refinery in the world can survive in a subsidy regime,\u201d Sylva added.\n\nOn the issue of pipeline maintenance and repairs, the minister stressed that under the PIA, the refineries will be managed distinctly from the crude oil pipelines.\n\nDescribing it as a very thorny issue, he expressed the view that the PIA will be the solution to some of the current problems with managing the pipelines.\n\nHe pointed out that before now, the midstream in the industry was grossly under-developed because the fiscals were not there.\n\n\u201cIf you have a situation where somebody owns a refinery and then at the same time is expected to run a pipeline that is 600 kilometres long, then it becomes difficult for him to run.\n\n\u201cHe should focus on running a refinery if it\u2019s a refinery operator, then you must have somebody who also focuses on running the pipeline and it becomes his business.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, in Nigeria, we never saw the pipeline as a business. So the pipeline was always an attachment to a refinery. It was becoming very sub-optimally managed because the refinery operators could not manage the pipelines.\n\n\u201cSo what we are now doing is to decouple the pipelines from the refineries, outsource those pipelines to people who can now focus on managing the pipelines. So it will be a different ballgame after the fixing of the refineries, he assured\u201d\n\nOmorogbe had in her comments, said that the reforms in the industry were unnecessarily slow, with the PIA taking over 20 years to bring to fruition.\n\n\u201cThe downstream has been in a mess for a long time. Any downstream operator will tell you that off the record, and will tell you that it\u2019s worsening.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just in pains to know how we can implement the petroleum industry act. But I think a lot of the problem is that Nigerians have never really interrogated what this subsidy is, if it\u2019s there to cushion us against the different price effects of importing petroleum products.\n\n\u201cWhat are the components of what is being paid for subsidy? When you look at landing cost, what are the components of that landing costs? How much of it is the demurrage for example?\n\n\u201cWhy are we paying for the incompetence of the system? If the government would get out of this area, I can see that many things would be wiped out, even though one is talking about temporarily having the price shoot up, it\u2019ll come down.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s competition. No private person will pay for some of the things that are happening right now. That\u2019s why I say I really don\u2019t know where to start. But we should just sit down and interrogate that subsidy, subsidy price and see what we are paying for it and what\u2019s in the landing costs.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s interrogate and say, how many litres do we use in Nigeria every day? Statistics in the downstream is incredibly opaque,\u201d she argued\n\nElumelu Raises Concerns over $4bn Oil Theft, Says Its National Disgrace\n\nAccording to Elumelu, who is also the Chairman of the United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA), between January and September last year, Nigeria lost over $4 billion to oil thieves\n\nwho don\u2019t pay tax but use their illicit proceeds to acquire more lethal ammunition and continued to pose threats to the country\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nHe expressed worry that the development had put so much money in the hands of those who don\u2019t pay tax and who are not regulated, making the country unsafe.\n\nElumelu said, \u201cWe produce sometimes about 87,000 barrels per day, and thieves take 50,000 per day.\u201d\n\nHe said addressing the sordid situation required strategic as well as resilience of leadership adding that, \u201cthings can\u2019t continue that way. The country should wake up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe look forward to men and women of this country to help remove this national disgrace,\u201d Elumelu added.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe theft in the Niger Delta is a national challenge. To me, it requires national seminar and dialogue. It is in my viewpoint, one of the lethal threats to our country, because it is so much money in the hands of people who don\u2019t pay tax, people we don\u2019t regulate and the country is not safe.\n\n\u201cNigeria in the last three quarters of last year from January to September lost over $4 billion to thieves who don\u2019t pay tax and they use it to pile more lethal ammunition and pose threats to our corporate existence.\u201d\n\nHe also attributed the growing youth restiveness in Nigeria and Africa to the absence of strategic leadership principles which he said among others required setting priorities, execution of goals, setting of timelines and milestones as well as clarity of purpose.\n\nHe said these leadership principles had helped shape his focus and eventual successes in the private sector, stressing that they are as well applicable to the public sector if results must be achieved.\n\nElumelu in the course of his lecture also touched on the need for leaders to match words with actions so people don\u2019t lose interest in their leadership.\n\nHe also emphasised the need to pay attention to merit and ensure that the most qualified persons are appointed to positions of authority.\n\nOn the role of private sector in fighting terror and promoting peace in the continent, the founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation said he had been a proponent of African capitalism which he believes would lead to long-term investment to address endemic poverty.\n\nHe argued that people who have economic hope do not take to extremism, saying only jobless persons are susceptible to social vices.\n\nHe said governments must get serious with eradicating poverty and creating economic opportunities for the growing youth population in order to avert a greater catastrophe.\n\n\u201cUnless we get serious on our continent, it\u2019s just starting, \u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere can\u2019t be peace when people are hungry. It\u2019s an imposed peace and it\u2019s only a matter of time before it explodes.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, what African youths need is economic opportunity and not interested in handouts adding that they presently lacked such opportunity.\n\nElumelu said government must wake up and realise that the young ones would someday hold them accountable.\n\nHe said the fact that 60 per cent of the Nigeria\u2019s population lived below the poverty index had more to do about leadership.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe can correct these things. We need to do more. Poverty is the reason we have problems in the world.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

According to agency reports, possible casualties were unclear.\n\nThe resurgence of military coups on the continent is forcing some analysts to call for the establishment of an Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) military force in the form of ECOMOG, to protect democracy in the sub-region.\n\nA security source told journalists in Bissau that at the government\u2019s palace, an unknown number of people were hit by gunfire with two persons killed. But it was unclear who the casualties were.\n\nIt was also learnt that Sissoco Embalo held an extraordinary cabinet meeting at around 10 a.m., entering the building with a heavy security detail.\n\nImmediately after the incident, the normally busy streets around the palace were deserted in the afternoon, with an unverified video shared on social media appeared to show a man standing outside the compound firing a rocket-propelled grenade.\n\nThe government has however been silent about the incident as no official statement has been made.\n\nThe West Africa region has been mired by military take-over in the last 18 months with military take over in Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso.\n\nGuinea-Bissau is not new to coup d\u2019etat as for decades, there has been history of nine coups or attempted coups since independence from Portugal in 1974.

It was largely supported by personnel and resources of the Nigerian Armed Forces, with sub-battalion strength units contributed by other ECOWAS members which included Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, The Gambia, Liberia, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, among others.\n\nWhile the protocol on Mutual Defence Assistance was signed in Freetown, Sierra Leone, on May 29, 1981, Anglophone ECOWAS members were established ECOMOG in 1990 to intervene in the civil war in Liberia (1989 to 1996).

          "text": "\u2022Dangote pledges private sector support\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari launched a N62 billion trust fund yesterday in Abuja aimed at curtailing the scourge of the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in Nigeria. The fund would also help to place more people living with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) on treatment annually.\n\nChief Launcher and Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, promised strong support for the private sector-led fund.\n\nSpeaking at the launch of the HIV Trust Fund of Nigeria (HTFN), Buhari pledged that his administration would continue to prioritise health interventions to address killer diseases and public health emergencies.\n\nAccording to a statement by Special Adviser to the President (Media and Publicity), Femi Adesina, Buhari said, \u201cEnding AIDS as a public health threat in Nigeria will require increased domestic funding. We have continued to make good our commitment of placing more people living with HIV on treatment annually using national resources.\n\n\u201cAt the last United Nations General Assembly High Level Meeting on HIV/AIDS, I made a call for a renewed global action to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa.\n\n\u201dHowever, strong domestic resource mobilisation with an enduring partnership and shared responsibility is required to sustain the response to HIV and other emerging public health emergencies.\u201d\n\nBuhari noted that Nigeria\u2019s focused partnership with the private sector in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic provided a readily available financing solution to leverage on to sustain the HIV response. He commended the National Agency for the Control of AIDS (NACA) and the Nigeria Business Coalition Against AIDS for their efforts in establishing the HIV Trust Fund of Nigeria to secure a generation of babies free of the virus.\n\nBuhari also expressed delight at the attendance in person of key global players in the HIV response and notable private sector personalities at the event and the pledges made.\n\n\u201dGoing forward, I hope the HIV Trust Fund of Nigeria will galvanise more of the private sector and other partners to surpass the target of N62 billion in the next five years,\u201d the president added.\n\nIn his remarks, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, disclosed that since 2005, about $6.2 billion had been spent on HIV response in Nigeria.\n\nMustapha stated, \u201dAbout 80 per cent of the funds were contributed by external donors, mainly the US President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The private sector contributed 0.1 per cent to 2 per cent of total funds with the rest of funds provided by the Nigerian government.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging NACA\u2019s efforts to promote resource mobilisation to complement existing external support, Mustapha said the federal government had sustained the treatment and financing of 50,000 People Living with HIV (PLHIV) annually. He said the launch of the HTFN would guarantee funding from private sector-led resources for HIV interventions, especially for the elimination of the Mother-to-Child transmission of the virus.\n\nDangote said the mission of the fund, proposed by NACA alongside the Nigeria Business Coalition Against AIDS (NiBUCAA), was to ensure mobilisation of resources towards eradication of AIDS in Nigeria, starting with the Prevention of Mother-to-Child transmission of the virus.\n\n\u201dI am reminded that we have two million of our compatriots living with HIV/AIDS and it is our collective responsibility to bring this number down to zero,\u201d he said.\n\nDangote, who is Africa\u2019s richest man, appealed to individuals and corporate organisations in the country to donate generously to the Fund.\n\n\u201dWe would like the private sector to work in partnership with the federal government on a 50-50 basis, which we believe will help us eliminate Mother-to-Child transmission of HIV/AIDS in Nigeria,\u201d Dangote said.\n\nChairman of Board of Trustees of the fund and Group Managing Director of Access Bank, Mr. Herbert Wigwe, in his remarks, said the aim of the initiative was to ensure sustainable mobilisation of resources from the private sector towards eradication of AIDS in Nigeria, beginning with the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of the HIV virus.\n\nWigwe stated, \u201cWe have a responsibility to safeguard the future of our country, our workforce, and our children yet unborn. With your support, we can change the narrative; put an end to mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Nigeria, eradicate AIDS and, ultimately, put a stop to the transmission of HIV in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWigwe said the HIV Trust Fund of Nigeria become imperative to help bridge the existing, as well as projected funding shortfalls that will occur once international donor funding began to exit.\n\nAccording to him, the HIV Trust Fund \u201cwould be a unique opportunity to proactively take decisive steps to avoid a potential HIV/AIDS crisis in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn his welcome speech, Director-General of NACA, Dr. Gambo Aliyu, thanked Buhari for his commitment and support for HIV response in the country. Aliyu said as a direct result of the president\u2019s intervention, NACA now procured HIV commodities at manufacturers\u2019 rate, and more Nigerians living with HIV had been placed on treatment from domestic resources.\n\nHe said within the last three years, the agency had identified and placed on treatment an additional 900,000 persons living with HIV, bringing the total number of Nigerians on HIV treatment to 1.7 million.\n\nAliyu stated, \u201cThis unprecedented feat puts Nigeria on a fast-track lane to control HIV spread by 2023. However, despite these achievements, our national coverage of prevention of mother-to- child transmission is less than 50 per cent, leading to about 22,000 cases of mother-to-child transmission of HIV every year in the country.\u201d\n\nThe director general said providing life-long treatment to all PLHIV even after successfully stopping new HIV infections would require a domestically sustainable financing mechanism.\n\nKey development partners present at the unveiling of the fund included Executive Director, UNAIDS, Ms. Winnie Byanyima; Executive Director, Global Fund, Mr. Peter Sands; and US Ambassador to Nigeria, Ambassador Mary Beth Leonard.\n\nOther members of the fund\u2019s Board of Trustees are Managing Director of TotalEnergies Exploration and Production Nigeria, Mr. Mike Sangster; Chairman, Board of Trustees of Dangote Foundation, and President of the Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote; Managing Director, The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC) and Country Chair, Shell Companies in Nigeria, Engineer Osagie Okunbor; Managing Director/CEO, Julius Berger Nigeria Plc, Dr. Lars Richter; and Director General of NACA, Dr. Gambo Aliyu.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Venture capital investments into startups in Africa hit a record high in 2021 as companies raised over $4.3 billion in venture capital (VC) investments \u2013 2.5x the amount raised in 2020. Startups in Nigeria, Egypt, Kenya and South Africa (collectively referred to as the \u201cthe big four\u201d) raised over $3.4 billion, representing 81% of the total funding raised on the continent.\n\nOui Capital, an Africa focused, sector agnostic VC firm known for their early investments in agency banking giant TeamApt, and freight forwarder, MVX, made a total of eight new investments across Africa \u2013 the most they\u2019ve ever done in a single year.

A desire to sell an \u201call-in-one\u201d software solution to the businesses they sought to serve, led the founders to build a platform that enables businesses to tailor such software to their needs. Oui Capital led Quabbly\u2019s pre-seed round, with participation from Ben Tossell, founder of Makerpad (sold to Zapier).\n\nAiFluence is an AI powered influencer marketing platform that enables organizations to coordinate, launch, and manage influencer marketing campaigns in Africa.

          "text": "Globally, cryptocurrency industry funding has been growing increasingly fast in the past couple of years. Last year alone, crypto startups raised over $27 billion in venture capital in 2021 \u2014slightly higher than the past 10 years combined. And just last month, despite a dip in the price of cryptocurrencies, American VC, Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s crypto arm launched a $2.2 billion fund, one of its biggest efforts to fund crypto startups. The firm is reaffirming its commitment to crypto with its third and largest industry specific fund, after investing $850 million last year between 2 rounds of investments. This shows that institutional investors are getting more comfortable in putting their money in crypto\u2014an entirely different experience 4 or 5 years ago.\n\nIn Africa, Web3\u2014powered by crypto, is becoming a large industry, and it is not surprising because Africa is the fastest adopter of cryptocurrency in the world, consequently, investors are pumping money into the industry on the continent.\n\nOn a mission to further deepen crypto adoption in Africa is Nigerian crypto startup Nestcoin which is building out Web3 products. Today, Nestcoin announced that it raised a $6.5 million pre-seed round. Since launching last year, in November, with a promise to \u201chelp Nigerians first, then other Africans, exit the status quo by offering them access to wealth using crypto technology or elements of web 3.0 like NFT, DAOs and DeFi,\u201d Nestcoin has made tremendous progress.\n\nFounded by former Binance director Yele Bademosi and former Bundle Africa CTO, Taiwo Orilogbon, Nestcoin has made good on its promise to create crypto-native products beyond trading and investments, with a focus on driving the adoption of crypto in Africa.\n\nLast year, it launched Breach, a media arm to simplify complex crypto topics to a global audience. It later launched one of Africa\u2019s earliest play-to-earn crypto games, Metaverse Magna (MVM), which it says will allow members of its gaming community to earn as much as $1,000 monthly. It has invested in Lazerpay, a crypto startup that allows businesses to accept payment in crypto, and collaborated with fintech, Bitsika and its music superstar partner Davido to launch the Echoke social token. Nescoin has hinted that it is developing several other products to \u201cprovide compelling use cases for crypto\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are excited that our investors are backing this ambitious plan to create a future where billions of people in frontier markets have access to the opportunities that crypto brings. With this financing, we will continue to grow our diverse team, which already spans 9 countries, expand our product offerings, and invest in more ventures aligned with our vision,\u201d says Nestcoin\u2019s CEO, Yele Bademosi, in a statement.\n\nThe company, which boasts of a global network of investors, had its round led by Distributed Global, Alter Global, Serena Ventures, Alameda Research, and A&T Capital. Other institutional investors include MSA Capital, 4DX Ventures, Raba Capital, Goat.vc, Old Fashion Research, CMT Digital, Electric Capital, Social Capital, CoinFund, gumi Cryptos Capital, DeFi Alliance, among others.\n\nNestcoin, in a statement, says that the new funding will enable it to expand its global operations and invest in building products that will help accelerate crypto adoption and financial freedom for people in frontier markets.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Tiger Global and Greycroft lead $15m Series A round in Nigeria\u2019s Bamboo",
          "text": "Bamboo, an investment platform that allows Nigerians buy and trade US stocks in real-time from their mobile phones or computers, has raised $15 million in a Series A funding round led by American venture capital firms Greycroft and Tiger Global. Motley Fool Ventures, Saison Capital, Chrysalis Capital, and Y-Combinator\u2019s Michael Seibel also participated in the round, the company said.\n\nLaunched in January 2020 by CEO Richmond Bassey and COO Yanmo Omorogbe, Bamboo has rapidly grown in popularity with retail investors, claiming over 300,000 accounts in Nigeria. Its users can access all equities available on the US stock exchanges, that is, the stocks of roughly 6,000 companies.\n\n\u201cOur goal is simple: we want to give Africans and their asset managers easy, fast and secure access to global investment options that will allow them to earn real returns,\u201d Bassey said in a statement released Monday.\n\nWith the new funding, Bamboo plans to further accelerate its growth, doubling down on unlocking new markets and launching more products, it said while Bassey told TechCabal in an emailed response that Bamboo will be providing more asset classes and investment opportunities for its users.\n\n\u201cBamboo is enabling Africans to build wealth by creating an investing platform that is helpful to both experienced investors and to those new to the stock market. We are thrilled to support the innovative, user-first approach the Bamboo team is bringing to market,\u201d Greycroft Partner Alison Lange Engel said on the investment.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLast year, the company launched Powered by Bamboo, its API solution that allows asset managers, fintech companies, and other financial institutions to plug into Bamboo\u2019s API to provide their customers access to global securities. The company has been testing the product with a small group of companies and expects to onboard more this year.\n\n\u201cEveryone building for African investors is welcome. We plan to add other products and tools that offer greater access and make global investing simpler from Africa,\u201d Bassey said. \u201cWe\u2019re building the technology infrastructure powering financial services in Africa.\u201d\n\nIn April 2021, Bamboo announced plans to launch in Ghana and has since seen more than 50,000 Ghanaians join the waitlist, according to the company. In the near future, Bamboo plans to expand into more markets such as Kenya and South Africa, Bassey said.\n\nCompared to developed markets such as the United States, investing in stocks is relatively new in Nigeria, and Africa at large. For instance, nearly 75% of Bamboo users have never traded stocks before.\n\nThus, the company has had to put significant effort into educating its users on how to invest and become better investors, using a mix of regular educational content published on its social media, a stock market course, an investment bootcamp, newsletters with investing tips and exclusive value-added services from top investment advisors like The Motley Fool and MyWallSt.\n\nThese efforts appear to pay off, going by Bamboo\u2019s figures. In 2021, repeat depositors made up 85% of deposits on the platform, an indication that Bamboo users are rapidly gaining confidence in trading US stocks.\n\nBut with the US equities market experiencing its worst January in well over a decade\u2014since 2009\u2014how are Bamboo users reacting to the downturn?\n\n\u201cEven though they are new to stock investing, Bamboo users tend to handle their emotions like more seasoned investors,\u201d Bassey said. \u201cWe saw this during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic crash and we\u2019re seeing it again now.\u201d\n\nBamboo allows Nigerians buy and trade US stocks in real-time from their mobile phones or computers.\n\nAfrica\u2019s wealth management market remains largely underdeveloped but holds high potential. According to data cited by Bamboo, Africans account for over 16% of the world\u2019s population, yet they own less than 1% of global wealth.\n\nBut that is expected to change over the next decade, with private wealth in the continent expected to increase by 30% to reach $2.6 trillion by 2030, according to AfrAsia Bank.\n\nBassey is upbeat platforms like Bamboo will play a major role in realising the projected growth, by helping to develop an investing culture among Africans.\n\n\u201cWe think investing in stocks has a bright future in Nigeria. Nigerians are hungry to earn a return on their investments and build wealth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are bullish on platforms such as ours in bringing more Nigerians into the world of investing.\u201d\n\nWithout revealing many details, Bamboo says in the statement it plans to make it seamless for African investors in the diaspora to discover the best investment opportunities on the continent.\n\nIn August, Nigeria\u2019s central bank received court approval to freeze the bank accounts of Bamboo and other similar Nigerian fintech platforms for a six-month period. However, Bassey confirmed the company received a court order unfreezing its accounts. \u201cAll have been unfrozen now,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What do blockchain, NFT, DAO and crypto mean?",
          "text": "Do you need a guide for all the big tech terms people are throwing about on the internet? What do blockchain, NFT, DAO and crypto mean?\n\nOver the past couple of years, there\u2019s been an influx of words that explain certain tech concepts. Some of them like crypto, or even NFTs, have been around for a while. In fact, NFT\u2014as a word\u2014was first used in 2014 and now, 7 years later, it\u2019s still a concept that escapes a lot of us. Others like DeFi or DAOs are fairly new, but they\u2019re still getting thrown around a lot.\n\nWhether you\u2019re new or old to tech, reading about concepts can feel like learning a new language. So TechCabal is creating a guide\u2014short explainers\u2014for common tech terms. In this, you\u2019re sure to find simple short explanations that can help you understand NiFTy concepts.\n\n1. Blockchain\n\nA few of the concepts we\u2019ll explain here are based on blockchain so it\u2019s important this goes first.\n\nBlockchain is a record-keeping tech that\u2019s designed to make it impossible to hack the system or forge the data stored on it.\n\nHow it works: Standard databases store data in rows, columns and files, but blockchain stores data in blocks that are chained together. The data on the blocks are continuously updated, encrypted, and stored on several computers so there\u2019s no single computer to hack or control the data from.\n\nIn explaining blockchain, Buchi Okoro\u2014CEO and co-founder of African cryptocurrency exchange Quidax\u2014said: \u201cImagine a book where you write down everything you spend money on each day. Each page is similar to a block, and the entire book, a group of pages, is a blockchain. With a blockchain, everyone who uses a cryptocurrency has their own copy of this book to create a unified transaction record. The software logs each new transaction as it happens, and every copy of the blockchain is updated simultaneously with the new information, keeping all records identical and accurate.\u201d\n\n2. Cryptocurrency\n\nImage source: Aceris Law\n\nWe all know what currencies are\u2014dollars, pounds, shillings. Well, cryptocurrencies are digital currencies. You can\u2019t hold it the way you\u2019d hold fiat currencies like CFA coins or naira notes, but you can still spend it on things you love.\n\nHow it works: Cryptos are digital currencies created on blockchain technology. If you got a sense of what blockchains are, then you\u2019ll understand what we mean when we say that cryptocurrencies are decentralised; no one person or government controls them. They are created by algorithms and used to award engineers\u2014called miners\u2014who carry out maintenance on the blockchain.\n\nUnlike fiat currencies which derive their value and validity from states, cryptocurrencies derive their value and validity from the blockchain.\n\n3. Non-fungible token (NFT)\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by its mushroom-sounding title, NFTs are in fact inedible, even the NFT flavours. NFTs are unique digital assets created on a blockchain.\n\nHow it works: To put it simply, NFTs are digital works that exist on blockchain. They can be images, sounds, game skins, or even clothes for your digital avatars. These digital works are impossible to duplicate or forge; they\u2019re one of a kind and that makes them valuable. If you\u2019re asking yourself why a screenshot of an NFT isn\u2019t as valuable, it\u2019s because NFTs have been embedded with code which is what makes them exist on the blockchain.\n\nThink of it this way, when you go to a museum and take photos of artefacts, what you have is just a photo which isn\u2019t quite valuable. The museum still has the original valuable artefact.\n\nIt\u2019s similar with NFTs. We can take screenshots of Niyi Okeowo\u2019s $2,800 Indigo Child (below) but it doesn\u2019t mean we own the asset. The original copy\u2014the property rights and certificate of authenticity\u2014belong to the buyer.\n\nNiyi Okeowo\u2019s \u201cIndigo Child\u201d\n\n4. Web3\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen tech bros throw the word \u201cWeb3\u201d around a lot. It\u2019s the answer experts give to questions from \u201cWhat is the future of the internet?\u201d to \u201cWhat does Spiderman navigate the internet with?\u201d\n\nBut what exactly is Web3? To put it simply, Web3 is taking democracy to the internet.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at Web3\u2019s ancestors, Web1 and Web2, so we can understand what it\u2019s all about.\n\nWeb1 was the earliest version of the internet, which existed between the 1900s and the early 2000s. In this version, content was delivered via texts and graphics to users who could only consume the content but not interact with it.\n\nWeb2 is what we have now, an interactive and social web where companies can build revolutionary apps that allow users to become creators. It\u2019s centralised, i.e. controlled by companies or governments who can decide when websites, apps or content can be taken down with little input from users.\n\nOn Web2, apps are only available for as long as the company that owns them decides. Streaming sites can shut down, online games can upload patches users don\u2019t like (yes, I\u2019m looking at you Riot Games), and traditional banks can freeze bank accounts when the government demands it.\n\nHow Web3 works: Web3 will be built on the blockchain working independently from different parts of the world.\n\nOn Web3, decisions regarding the design and operation of products and funds\u2014including crypto\u2014will be made by communities of people called Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs), and not governments or companies. So if you find an app or product you like, you can join the DAO of that product, buy shares and vote on which changes should be made.\n\nFor example, if you joined TechCabal\u2019s DAO, you\u2019ll get to decide how we upgrade or downgrade depending on how much shares you have in the DAO.\n\n5. Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)\n\nDAOs or Decentralised Autonomous Organisations are social communities that will create rules and regulations which will be embedded in programming codes.\n\nHow it works: Unlike conventional organisations like TechCabal, which have managers and boards of directors that govern it, DAOs are governed by communities\u2014who don\u2019t have to be developers of the product. DAOs are created by developers who decide on a set of rules and embed it in\u2014digital contracts on blockchain that are executed when certain conditions are met.\n\nThe communities decide what happens to the products attached to that DAO, what upgrades to make and when to make it. Each DAO will have its own token which will be sold to its community members, and the more tokens you have, the heavier your stake and voting rights.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "How Untapped Global backs growth stage African startups by using smart asset financing",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring his presidency, Donald Trump aggressively pursued an \u201cAmerica First\u201d strategy as he sought to \u201creturn\u201d the US to its place as the dominant power in the world. Consequently, there was a reduction in aid to developing countries.\n\nIn 2021, the United Kingdom also announced that aid to African countries would be reduced by 66%. This followed a trend of less money in aid flowing to developing countries, including African countries.\n\nFor a long time, discussions about development in Africa usually revolved around aids. That approach has not particularly paid off, with experts believing it has fostered a culture of dependency. However, African tech seems to be changing all that with venture-backed investments increasing due to amazing levels of innovation across the continent.\n\nAs a volunteer in Nigeria with Doctors Without Borders \u2014 a non-profit organisation committed to providing medical personnel to underserved areas \u2014 Jim Chu believed that volunteering with development organisations was his way of impacting the world. However, he soon realised that helping businesses access the funds they need to grow their operations was a better option. That realisation led him to start Untapped Global in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe created Untapped to fill a hole that I saw as an investor and as an entrepreneur over and over again in Haiti, Kenya, South Africa, and other places. Some people call that hole \u2018The valley of death\u2019 or \u2018The missing level\u2019, but it\u2019s the space where you\u2019re no longer a very early startup, but you\u2019re also not a very well established company. You\u2019re in-between, and companies at this stage find it difficult to raise capital; it\u2019s even harder if you\u2019re outside the traditional investment thesis,\u201d Chu says.\n\nDemocratising prosperity using smart asset financing\n\nWith most venture capital going to companies that can scale at astronomical rates, such as fintech, other companies find it challenging to raise funds even though they can create great value. Untapped Global was founded to fill this gap. Unlike typical investment strategies, Untapped Global funds assets that can create economic value.\n\nFor example, imagine a young man, Taiwo, from a village in Southern Nigeria, who has just moved to Lagos. Without an education, he is unable to get a good job. Also, his lack of credit history means he cannot get a loan to start a business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlexClub is one of Untapped Global\u2019s portfolio companies\n\nUsing data from IoT devices, a company backed by Untapped Global could give Taiwo a tricycle for commercial transportation. The tricycle would be monitored to know how well Taiwo utilises this asset. If he does not use it profitably, the company retrieves it and gives it to someone else. Untapped Global invests in these companies and, in return, receives a percentage of the business\u2019 revenue.\n\nChu explains how Untapped Global works.\n\n\u201cThe conventional way of managing risk is, \u2018Show me your balance sheets. Show me the assets you have.\u2019 So you have a house, and you take a loan against the house, and we sign a lot of papers so that if you don\u2019t pay me back, we send a lot of lawyers to make sure you pay me back or I take over your house.\n\n\u201cNot everyone has a house or asset that can be collateralised, but everyone has the energy. So what we do, instead, is we use data to say, \u2018Okay, you don\u2019t have a house, but you can drive a motorcycle. The asset we give you is the motorcycle, and we use IoT to track that motorcycle using the data you generate from it to manage the risk.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the firm does not only use smart asset financing as an investment tool, having made equity investments in startups like Opibus, an electric vehicle company in Kenya; Nigerian fintech startup, Paga; Flexclub, a car financing company in South Africa; Eden Life; OnePipe; Inspira Farms; and Asaak, a company providing financing services for motorbikes in Uganda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow much does Untapped Global invest?\n\nWith a slightly different investment model, Untapped Global has no average ticket size. Instead, it invests between $50,000 and $3 million in its portfolio companies.\n\n\u201cThere is no average ticket size because our due diligence process is tied up in the ticket sizes,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Water ATM in Kenya\n\nTypically, after a company indicates interest in being funded by an investor, the investor carries out a due diligence process to ascertain if the company is worth investing in. Untapped Global does this differently.\n\nInstead of a regular due diligence process, the firm launches a pilot where it finances a business\u2019 assets, starting with $50,000 or more. The pilot could last for a few weeks, and they make an investment decision based on the data gotten from the process.\n\nBiggest mistakes startups make\n\nDeciding to start a business is signing up for uncertainty. As a result, even the most experienced founders could make mistakes. Chu believes that one of the biggest mistakes African founders make is not knowing what type of capital they need for their business.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of startup founders make the mistake of using equity capital when they should be using non-dilutive debt or other kinds of non-equity capital to run their business. If you\u2019re a software startup, you don\u2019t need that much CapEx, but if you\u2019re an asset-heavy company using equity investments, you\u2019re going to run out of cap table at some point.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn bad investments, missed opportunities, and successes\n\nEven with strict adherence to a due diligence process, venture financing can still go wrong. With several businesses not making it to the five-year mark, many businesses funded by venture capitalists are likely to fail. Untapped Global\u2019s unconventional investment methods means that it could detect a bad investment within weeks by testing the waters before making a permanent commitment.\n\n\u201cOur data helps us to detect a bad investment in as little as a few weeks, and because we give out small amounts of money, we can cut off the financing whenever we like,\u201d Chu reveals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, traditional VC firms may have to wait a few months before realising that an investment won\u2019t go according to plan. While Untapped Global has been funding startups for barely two years, Chu lists FlexClub, Paga, and Asaak as some of their biggest successes.\n\nMost investors in Africa invest in various industries, but Chu says Untapped Global is focused on mobility, water infrastructure, and energy. Its investment method also means that its investments are not tied to particular funding rounds.\n\nSo, if you have a business that already generates revenue in any of these industries, you can apply to get funded by sending an email to deals@untappedglobal.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nAfrican startups have picked up where they left off in 2021 regarding funding. January gave us the first $100m+ round as InstaDeep raised $100 million. With over $4.3 billion raised in 2021, the bar is set very high, but only a few will bet against African startups living up to last year\u2019s numbers.\n\nSo, today we\u2019re discussing:\n\nBuilding a pipeline for African tech talent\n\nImproving digital lending through tech\n\nSimplifying the blockchain\n\nAmitruck\u2019s plans for East Africa\n\nBuilding a pipeline for entry-level tech talent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you were given a dollar for every time an African startup founder complained of difficulty hiring software engineers, you would be sitting on a small fortune in no time. The truth is, it\u2019s hard to hire for any role in Africa, thanks to an educational system still stuck in the 60s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThrow in that software engineers essentially work with programming languages roughly 30 years old, and you can understand why it is challenging to hire for technical roles.\n\nSo what\u2019s been done about it? Depending on who you ask, a lot or very little. Startups like Andela (for a few years), Decagon, Gebeya, amongst others, have created training programmes for software engineers, but that is not nearly enough.\n\nThe U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the demand for software engineers will grow 22% between 2020 to 2030. This is significantly higher than the 4% projected for other careers.\n\nOver the last few years, the focus has been on senior engineers, but there will always be a need for entry-level and mid-level engineers. Armed with this knowledge, AltSchool Africa is building a pipeline for entry-level talent in Africa.\n\nYesterday, the startup announced that it had raised $1 million in pre-seed funding from investors, including Paystack Founder, Shola Akinlade; Flutterwave Founder, Olugbenga GB Agboola; Pledges; ODBA VC; Nestcoin; Nigerian entertainer, Folarin Falana (Falz); and rapper, Akitoye Balogun (Ajebutter).\n\nRead more: Techpoint Pitchstorm alumnus, AltSchool Africa bags $1m pre-seed to plug Africa\u2019s shortage of entry-level talent\n\nImproving digital lending through data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYvonne Johnson, CEO and Co-founder, Indicina.

Without going into the details of how they got my contact details, this is a far cry from what the lending landscape looked like only a few years ago.\n\nFor a long time, minimal lending was done by financial institutions in Nigeria. When it happened, it was often after a lengthy process that could discourage applicants. In addition, you needed collateral to guarantee that you received your loan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnter fintech startups.\n\nUsing machine learning, fintech startups changed the way the game was played.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May 2017, Nigeria\u2019s Vice President, Prof Yemi Osinbanjo, signed two bills into law: the Secured Transactions in Movable Assets Acts (Collateral Registry Act), 2017 and the Credit Reporting Act, 2017.\n\nFor Bayode*, a struggling painter in Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State, this meant that he could register his movable assets \u2014 like his Toyota Lexus 2009 or his secondhand Syinix Single Door Fridge \u2014 on the National Collateral Registry as collateral to secure loans from banks and other financial institutions.\n\nIt also meant that because of the Credit Reporting Act, if he had previously taken a loan from any lending institution, his information would be available to serve as credit history for him in subsequent loan applications.\n\nA year later, in 2018, Techpoint Africa found that the Credit Reporting Act was already being implemented, although not in real-time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEssentially, like so many laws before them, the two laws were not solving the problem they were meant to \u2014 helping to provide credit history information for banks and lending institutions while improving the credit score of the average Nigerian.\n\nWith its API-based platform, Nigerian fintech, Indicina, has set out to solve this problem by building products that enable lenders throughout the credit lifecycle. From when loans are requested to decisioning, disbursement, and collection.\n\nEnter Indicina\n\nAfter her stint at First Bank leading the strategy department, Yvonne Johnson, Indicina Co-founder and CEO, thought it was time to step back and solve the consumer lending gap challenge in Nigeria.\n\nWith a degree in computer science and mathematics from the University of Toronto and a belief that technology is a powerful tool to solve this market\u2019s biggest financial challenges, she founded Indicina in 2018 with her Co-founders, Yemi Ajao, Jacob Ayokunle, and Carlos del Carpio.\n\nIndicina uses a data-driven approach to help lending institutions provide credit underwriting at scale. Using artificial intelligence, the company gives insights on future customers and de-risking unsecured loans. This also empowers lenders to drive new uses of data beyond predicting default, for example, managing churn, and marketing campaigns, among others.\n\nAccording to Johnson, \u201cIndicina does not have a balance sheet or compete on lending. We offer API-driven software to digitise the lending business. Our flagship product, Originate, is an analytics-driven approach to lending. It empowers clients to unpack the credit value chain and digitise each step, including identity verification, credit decisioning/analytics, and disbursements and collections.\u201d\n\nEmploying a Software as a service (SaaS) model, the company makes its money by providing B2B2C solutions to lending institutions \u2014 bank and non-bank. From what Johnson tells us, this enables wider distribution by allowing for a more cost-effective adoption of their technology.\n\nBut what separates Indicina from competitors?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIndicina\u2019s competitive advantage is a deep understanding of the financial services industry across key emerging markets \u2013 LatAm, Africa, and Asia. We understand the business of credit and how technology \u2013 specifically end-to-end credit journeys \u2013 can drive the profitability of consumer loan portfolios.\n\n\u201cInnovation has placed demands on traditional lending business models. How do you expand consumer credit to under-/unbanked populations in a prudent manner while shortening time-to-decision? Taking a cue from FinTechs, leading banks have embraced the digital-lending revolution, bringing \u201ctime to yes\u201d down to five minutes, and time to cash to less than 24 hours.\u201d\n\nWith Indicina\u2019s API that gives lending institutions access to this essential data, Johnson believes their business model is quite solid. According to her, for most of the company\u2019s customers, this is the first time they are integrating machine learning tools in their stack.\n\nSticking through the thorns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYvonne Johnson, CEO and Co-founder, Indicina. Source: Supplied\n\nThe flip side of having newbie customers is client education.\n\n\u201cClient education (on the development and proper use of AI within banking) is a hurdle we have to cross.\n\n\u201cThis includes the readiness of their technology infrastructure to deploy our solution. Fortunately, executives in this particular industry have shown to be very conscious about these problems, and we are seeing stronger commitment toward improvements. It\u2019s the only way to become a data-driven business.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the critical factor of a solid and vision-oriented team.\n\n\u201cThe founding team worked very closely on product strategy and execution in the initial phase of our journey. This was very important in confirming our theory around market demand. It helped that each of us had a strong product mind. Once we achieved a certain level of traction, we then expanded the engineering and data science teams.\u201d\n\nSo far, all of this has paid off, with the company serving over 50 different customers, covering banks, non-bank lenders, and startups.\n\nWhat the future looks like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tumisu on Pixabay\n\nAt the heart of Indicina\u2019s vision is equipping anyone building a digital financial services product with cutting-edge infrastructure so that they can reach a broader set of customers.\n\n\u201cEffective economic inclusion goes beyond customer onboarding. Identifying the right product at the point of need means end customers get real value.\n\n\u201cA thriving consumer credit industry is a powerful catalyst for economic inclusion on the continent. Indicina wants to provide the analytics infrastructure that will enable consumer credit at scale.\u201d\n\nWith teams in the US, UK, Nigeria, and Kenya, Indicina plans to expand into East African countries, Uganda and Kenya in the third quarter of 2022.\n\n*Fictional person\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Saudi Aramco, the largest national oil company in the world is aggressively charting its path out of fossil fuel, with the announcement of a $1 billion diversified growth fund tagged \u2018Prosperity7\u2019.\n\nOn the other hand, its counterpart, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), spent N100 billion ($241million) on refineries in 2021 with little to show for it.\n\nAt the ongoing LEAP technology conference organised by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, in Saudi Arabia, Ahmad Al Khowaiter, Aramco\u2019s chief technology officer noted that the company now views itself primarily as a technology company.\n\nThe company has so far developed five billion data points generated from its operations across the Kingdom, as well as access to millions of engineering drawings, and inspection and maintenance data most of which it has leveraged to become the world\u2019s lowest emitting company.\n\nRead Also: NNPC fails revenue target, generates N2.99trn\n\nNow Aramco is looking even further into the world of technology ventures across many verticals.\n\n\u201cThrough the breadth of the Saudi Aramco ecosystem, its vast resources, and its far-reaching footprint across geographies and sectors, Prosperity7 can prevent unparalleled opportunities for scalability and impact,\u201d Al Khowaiter said. \u201cThis potential would be instrumental in creating stronger foundations for success for its portfolio companies.\u201d\n\nThe fund which is named after Dammam Well-7, the first oil well to strike commercial oil in Saudi Arabia, also known as the \u2018Prosperity Well\u2019 is expected to connect the dots through big ideas, top talents and disruptive technologies from around the world.\n\nThe fund will look beyond the energy value chain to target startups in healthcare, education, and blockchain with viable solutions to the world\u2019s most pressing challenges.\n\nThe latest announcement is part of a long-term strategy by Aramco to diversify from oil and explore new economic opportunities. Over the years the company has deepened its footprints in technology, achieving some significant milestones including launching one of the world\u2019s top ten supercomputers.\n\nThe supercomputer known as Damman-7 features sophisticated imaging and deep-learning algorithms which allows it to run very detailed 3D earth models, improving Aramco\u2019s ability to discover and recover oil and gas while reducing exploration and development risks.\n\nThe company also launched a supercomputer data centre \u2013 Damman 7 Centre \u2013 with the goal of deepening data digitisation and quality.\n\nTeams of data scientists design and implement complex analytics at Aramco\u2019s 4IR Center (4IRC) in Dhahran. This advanced research and operations hub brings together a suite of digital technologies under one roof.\n\nEvery day, the 4IRC receives more than 5 billion data points, generated from Aramco\u2019s operations across the Kingdom, as well as access to millions of engineering drawings, and inspection and maintenance data.\n\nCombining this operational big data with the available computing power, state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence and machine learning tools, the Centre is able to translate the data into actionable insights, which help predict and improve asset performance, safety and reliability.\n\nThe case is, however, different for NNPC which is still battling to convince 200 million Nigerians that the future of oil revenue doesn\u2019t come with subsidy. The government recently postponed the removal of subsidy by 18 months to give more time for the education of the populace and address projects that will help ease the cost burden on people.\n\nThe total cost of rehabilitation of the refineries in Nigeria comes at $1.559 billion. The last time the refineries used up to 25 percent of their installed capacity was in 2011.\n\nSince then there has been a significant decline in refining activities and in the last three years, 2019, 2020 and 2021 the refineries have produced almost nothing. The refineries have reportedly lost an average of N328 billion every year between 2014 and 2018.\n\nThese discussions are now mundane for South Arabia which appears to be in a hurry to innovate and be the leader in the future of energy.\n\nDuring a fireside chat on Wednesday at the ongoing LEAP technology conference, Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud, minister of Energy said hydrocarbon will continue to be used for quite a few decades. However, the country is looking to be the leader in hydrogen investments.\n\n\u201cWe are here for all options and all solutions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see ourselves seriously in green hydrogen and as the biggest competitor in that market. We are testing and piloting C02.\u201d",

          "title": "Africa\u2019s economic rebound from pandemic lies in trade, investment",
          "text": "The scramble to accelerate economic growth in Africa following the pandemic-induced slump will be swift if countries in the continent utilise local resources, trade, and technological advancement.\n\nTop industry experts unanimously agreed Tuesday at the ongoing Africa Business Convention 2022 organised by BusinessDay that the African continent needs to explore emerging opportunities and be updated with global trends and developments to abate the impact of the pandemic, leveraging trade and technology.\n\nShubham Chaudhuri, Nigeria\u2019s country director, World Bank, said Africa needs to explore options to attract investments and grow its trade portfolio to achieve accelerated recovery post-pandemic.\n\nMore than a year after signing the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement, countries in the continent with a GDP size of over $2.69 trillion are yet to start reaping from the initiative that could place Africa as one of the world\u2019s power economies.\n\nFor example, exports from Nigeria, the continent\u2019s largest and most populous nation, to Africa fell by 25 percent in the first six months of 2021 compared with the same period the previous year. This decline in African exports sufficed despite the commencement of AfCFTA in January 2021.\n\nMost of Africa, according to Shadrack Kubyane, co-founder, Coronet Blockchain, SA, is built around extraction not synergy, and as a result, the continent was now faced with an infrastructure deficit across the supply chain.\n\n\u201cIt is a lot easier to move things from China and Europe into Africa than it is to move things within Africa, and we need to repair that,\u201d he said.\n\nTo solve the problem, the blockchain expert said the solution does not revolve around infrastructure rather government policies to probe innovation.\n\n\u201cWe need a mindset shift for a successful free trade. Africa cannot continue to maintain the ideology that the winner takes all to repair trade in the continent. Countries need a mindset shift; also, blockchain is creating a level playing ground for all players in African trade, especially MSMEs,\u201d he said.\n\nKunle Elebute, chairman, KPMG Africa, believes countries in Africa cannot maximise the trade agreement exchanging commodities in raw forms, saying, \u201cAfrican countries need to learn how to attract the market, boost capacity for manufacturing, and increase value addition practices.\u201d\n\nAccording to the chairperson of the Netherlands-based institution, an alternative to the exchange of commodities is manufactured products. \u201cUnfortunately, the local manufacturing sector has not fared well over time, which calls for the need to put in place enabling policies and infrastructure for manufacturing outfits to thrive,\u201d Elebute said.\n\nTo improve trade relationships, Kelvin Uwaibi, managing director, Edo State Investment Promotion Office (ESIPO), said sub-nationals in African states must commence trade with each other, as this will fuel the drive to trade across the region.\n\n\u201cSub-nationals need to look at how they can start to produce locally and also trade with each other. Interstate trading should be groomed before going to the continent,\u201d he said.\n\nKubyane said too much bureaucracy interferes with African international trade, which affects the process and discourages participation.\n\nTechnology is the tool that could serve as the one currency needed to bridge the lapses faced by trading in Africa, Hanu Fejiro Agbodje, the founder of Patricia Technology, said.\n\n\u201cThe blockchain and cryptocurrency already solved the problem of one currency in the continent, we just need to tap into it,\u201d Agbodje said, adding that technological innovations were what was needed to ease the pains of smooth trading in Africa.\n\nAcknowledging that the innovations around blockchain and the likes are disruptive and which was the case when the internet, railways, and others were first established, the industry players said Africa needs to visit the \u2018dentist.\u2019 In this case, the \u2018dentist\u2019 is the blockchain.\n\n\u201cFor us to move upward and forward, we need to be a bit uncomfortable and face the truth,\u201d Kubyane said.\n\nStill recovering from the impact of COVID-19, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects sub-Saharan Africa to grow at 3.8 percent in 2022, higher than the 2.7 percent growth projection for Nigeria.\n\nWhile the impact of the pandemic can be easily blamed for the slow growth in Africa, especially in some of its biggest economies like Nigeria, an evaluation of micro-economic indicators of the continent\u2019s largest economy before the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, shows the recent challenges only made what was already a bad situation worse.\n\nLagos State governor, Babajide Sanwoolu, in his opening remarks at the Business Convention described the pandemic as a dangerous virus that was yet to be completely managed.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to develop capacity and establish the necessary infrastructure, which will create buffers against such occurrences in the future,\u201d he said.\n\nExplaining how some of today\u2019s world power economies were able to scale economic growth and development, Birgitte Andersen, founder/CEO, Big Innovation Centre, UK, said China, for example, managed to get 800 million people out of extreme poverty in 30 years by focusing on infrastructure development. With a different approach, she said India focused on the supply chain and became a supply chain to the rest of the world. The US, according to her, focused on the internet revolution and talent system. Europe leverages big companies to become catalysts and accelerators. The Middle East focused on real estate and the building of big cities.\n\n\u201cLooking at Africa from the outside, it can get everybody online and be able to create a system. It can look at the talent to generate growth and it can leverage the AI system to achieve its goals,\u201d she said.\n\nThe World Bank is of the view that increased investment in human capital translates to higher economic prosperity.\n\n\u201cWith the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is even more important to understand why countries should invest in human capital (HC) and protect hard-won gains from being eroded,\u201d the World Bank economists said in a report.\n\nKingsley Moghalu, founder, Sagato Strategies LLC and former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, said at the BusinessDay Africa Convention that Nigeria needed to change its education curriculum to one that will be based on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).\n\n\u201cWe need to have a leader who can relate to younger people and has a passion for their future,\u201d he said. Industry experts unanimously agreed Tuesday at the ongoing Africa Business Convention 2022 organised by BusinessDay that the African continent needs to explore emerging opportunities and be updated with global trends and developments to abate the impact of the pandemic, leveraging trade and technology.\n\nShubham Chaudhuri, Nigeria\u2019s country director, World Bank, said Africa needs to explore options to attract investments and grow its trade portfolio to achieve accelerated recovery post-pandemic.\n\nMore than a year after signing the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement, countries in the continent with a GDP size of over $2.69 trillion are yet to start reaping from the initiative that could place Africa as one of the world\u2019s power economies.\n\nRead also: FX scarcity, insecurity, declining foreign investments pose threat to Nigeria\u2019s economic prospects \u2013 NESG\n\nFor example, exports from Nigeria, the continent\u2019s largest and most populous nation, to Africa fell by 25 percent in the first six months of 2021 compared with the same period the previous year. This decline in African exports sufficed despite the commencement of AfCFTA in January 2021.\n\nMost of Africa, according to Shadrack Kubyane, co-founder, Coronet Blockchain, SA, is built around extraction not synergy, and as a result, the continent was now faced with an infrastructure deficit across the supply chain.\n\n\u201cIt is a lot easier to move things from China and Europe into Africa than it is to move things within Africa, and we need to repair that,\u201d he said.\n\nTo solve the problem, the blockchain expert said the solution does not revolve around infrastructure rather government policies to probe innovation.\n\n\u201cWe need a mindset shift for a successful free trade. Africa cannot continue to maintain the ideology that the winner takes all to repair trade in the continent. Countries need a mindset shift; also, blockchain is creating a level playing ground for all players in African trade, especially MSMEs,\u201d he said.\n\nKunle Elebute, chairman, KPMG Africa, believes countries in Africa cannot maximise the trade agreement exchanging commodities in raw forms, saying, \u201cAfrican countries need to learn how to attract the market, boost capacity for manufacturing and increase value addition practices.\u201d\n\nAccording to the chairperson of the Netherlands-based institution, an alternative to the exchange of commodities is manufactured products. \u201cUnfortunately, the local manufacturing sector has not fared well over time, which calls for the need to put in place enabling policies and infrastructure for manufacturing outfits to thrive,\u201d Elebute said.\n\nTo improve trade relationships, Kelvin Uwaibi, managing director, Edo State Investment Promotion Office (ESIPO), said sub-nationals in African states must commence trade with each other, as this will fuel the drive to trade across the region.\n\n\u201cSub-nationals need to look at how they can start to produce locally and also trade with each other. Interstate trading should be groomed before going to the continent,\u201d he said.\n\nKubyane said too much bureaucracy interferes with African international trade, which affects the process and discourages participation.\n\nTechnology is the tool that could serve as the one currency needed to bridge the lapses faced by trading in Africa, Hanu Fejiro Agbodje, the founder of Patricia Technology, said.\n\n\u201cThe blockchain and cryptocurrency already solved the problem of one currency in the continent, we just need to tap into it,\u201d Agbodje said, adding that technological innovations were what was needed to ease the pains of smooth trading in Africa.\n\nAcknowledging that the innovations around blockchain and the likes are disruptive and which was the case when the internet, railways and others were first established, the industry players said Africa needs to visit the \u2018dentist.\u2019 In this case, the \u2018dentist\u2019 is the blockchain.\n\n\u201cFor us to move upward and forward, we need to be a bit uncomfortable and face the truth,\u201d Kubyane said.\n\nStill recovering from the impact of COVID-19, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects sub-Saharan Africa to grow at 3.8 percent in 2022, higher than the 2.7 percent growth projection for Nigeria.\n\nWhile the impact of the pandemic can be easily blamed for the slow growth in Africa, especially in some of its biggest economies like Nigeria, an evaluation of micro-economic indicators of the continent\u2019s largest economy before the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, shows the recent challenges only made what was already a bad situation worse.\n\nLagos State governor, Babajide Sanwoolu, in his opening remarks at the Business Convention described the pandemic as a dangerous virus that was yet to be completely managed.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to develop capacity and establish the necessary infrastructure, which will create buffers against such occurrences in the future,\u201d he said.\n\nExplaining how some of today\u2019s world power economies were able to scale economic growth and development, Birgitte Andersen, founder/CEO, Big Innovation Centre, UK, said China, for example, managed to get 800 million people out of extreme poverty in 30 years by focusing on infrastructure development. With a different approach, she said India focused on the supply chain and became a supply chain to the rest of the world. The US, according to her, focused on the internet revolution and talent system. Europe leverages big companies to become catalysts and accelerators. The Middle East focused on real estate and the building of big cities.\n\n\u201cLooking at Africa from the outside, it can get everybody online and be able to create a system. It can look at the talent to generate growth and it can leverage the AI system to achieve its goals,\u201d she said.\n\nThe World Bank is of the view that increased investment in human capital translates to higher economic prosperity.\n\n\u201cWith the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is even more important to understand why countries should invest in human capital (HC) and protect hard-won gains from being eroded,\u201d the World Bank economists said in a report.\n\nKingsley Moghalu, founder, Sagato Strategies LLC and former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, said at the BusinessDay Africa Convention that Nigeria needed to change its education curriculum to one that will be based on science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).\n\n\u201cWe need to have a leader who can relate to younger people and has a passion for their future,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Depending on how Nigeria\u2019s major political parties decide on their choice of presidential candidates, observers say the polity could be heated up as the issue of zoning has been a sensitive and contentious one that could disrupt the 2023 electoral process.\n\nWith just about a year to the 2023 general election, one of the key issues that has dominated discussion across Nigeria, in recent times, is perhaps zoning, which raises questions as to the region that should produce a successor to President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nNigeria\u2019s two major political parties, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have not taken a categorical stand on which section of the country their presidential ticket would be zoned. However, the issue has been on the front burner and may go a long way in shaping permutations in the coming months ahead of the presidential primaries.\n\nSince the advent of the Fourth Republic in 1999, there has been a rotation of the presidency between the South and the North as was practiced during the 16-year rule of the PDP.\n\nThough not constitutionally backed, political leaders say that due to the heterogeneous nature of the country, power rotation arrangements had become necessary to address complaints of marginalisation and domination and to give equal power to Nigeria\u2019s various ethnic groups.\n\nThere are some Nigerians who are of the view that citizens should rather vote for competence than consider the region where the candidate hails from.\n\nFormer military dictator, Ibrahim Babangida and President Buhari\u2019s nephew, Mamman Daura, had, in recent time, openly kicked against power rotation, saying the arrangement had failed and that there was no need to zone the 2023 presidential ticket to any part of the country.\n\nThey had argued that rather than zoning the ticket, competence should be given priority in the choice of the presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWe have to make a choice either we want to practice democracy the way it should be practised or the way it is being practised, or we define democracy according to our own whims and caprices.\n\n\u201cIf we are going to do it the way it is done all over the world you allow the process to continue, it is through the process that you will be able to come up with a candidate that will lead the country,\u201d Babangida said.\n\nBut political leaders from the South, especially South-Eastern Nigeria, have consistently insisted that power must rotate to the region after the two terms of eight years of President Buhari in 2023.\n\nThey argue that to save the country from crisis, political parties and politicians must allow the South-East to produce the country\u2019s president in 2023.\n\n\u201cThere is no region that does not have competent people to preside over Nigeria. If the country can survive the current leadership for close to seven years now, there is no leader that would be as disastrous. The country may be thrown into a serious crisis in the next few weeks if this issue of zoning is not well addressed,\u201d a source, who craved anonymity, said.\n\nLeaders of the apex Igbo social-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, had warned political parties that the region would only support and vote for the party that fielded a presidential candidate from the South-East.\n\nLast week, the group rejected former Vice President Atiku Abubakar\u2019s proposed single four-year tenure if elected as president in 2023, in which a candidate from the region would be his running mate, describing Atiku\u2019s proposal as a hoax.\n\nOhanaeze secretary-general, Okechukwu Isiguzoro, said the remark was a collective disrespect to the people of the South-East, declaring that Igbos will reject the vice-presidential slot, stressing that the region should be allowed to produce a president in 2023.\n\nSpeaking recently in an interview with BusinessDay, Chekwas Okorie, a former national chairman of the defunct Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN), warned that the two major parties in the South-East were tired of being used and abandoned.\n\nHe said it would not accept any position other than the presidency from the two major parties, saying, \u201cWe have resolved that any party that gives the presidential ticket to Igbo man in 2023 would get the votes of Igbos massively across the country and that is our priority ahead of the 2023 election.\n\n\u201cEverything looks favourable for the South to be considered for the APC ticket. But when you now talk about the South, the Yoruba\u2019s have had their turn when Obasanjo ruled for eight years, after that we had Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and Goodluck Jonathan tenure, we know that Jonathan moved on to rule for six years.\n\n\u201cSo, it is only the South-East and, for the interest of equity, it is appropriate that the region gets the president slot in 2023. But the way I am seeing it, the PDP may not zone the presidency to the South-East in 2023.\u201d\n\nSimilar sentiment has been shared in the South-West among some political leaders who say that the region deserved to produce Buhari\u2019s successor.\n\n\u201cIt is the Yoruba turn to rule after Buhari; I know power would be zoned back to the South, but I don\u2019t agree when you say it is South-East time. I don\u2019t see APC giving the ticket to someone from that region,\u201d a chieftain of the APC said.\n\nIn the meantime, it is apparent the two major parties are playing a hide-and-seek game on each other in terms of where their presidential ticket would be zoned.\n\nImpeccable sources within the two leading parties indicate that despite efforts from several top party leaders for the presidential ticket to be zoned to a particular region, it may be thrown open for anyone interested to contest.\n\nRead also: 2023: Shuaibu endorses Osinbajo for president\n\nIn the last few months, several individuals have publicly declared their interest to vie for the nation\u2019s number one seat in the two major parties, some of the aspirants are: Bola Ahmed Tinubu, former governor of Lagos State, Anyim Pius Anyim, former Senate president, Samuel Ohuabunwa and Kingsley Moghalu former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), among others.\n\nHowever, observers say that for the sake of equity and fairness, to give everyone a sense of belonging it is important that regions that had not produced a president since the return to democracy in 1999 should be given a chance.\n\nSuch a view was shared by Adelaja Adeoye, former national publicity secretary of the Action Democratic Party (ADP), noting that it would be unjust to continue to deny the South-East and North-Central the presidency when other regions had their chance to rule.\n\nAccording to Adeoye, \u201cOur focus should be on character, the capacity and competency of the person. However, one of the attributes can be found in any zone. For the fact that Buhari has stayed for eight years and the North-West have ruled, Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan also ruled, meaning that the South-East have not been given opportunity in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAll the actors must calm down and give South-East and North-Central a chance to rule the country. What we do today would come back and wait for us tomorrow, so that we can move the country forward.\u201d",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Government has deplored attempts by some mischief-makers to create the false narrative that there is a \u2018crisis\u2019 in the Edo State House of Assembly, noting that the exercise is being orchestrated by elements who lost out in the last governorship election in the state.\n\nSecretary to the State Government, Osarodion Ogie Esq., in a statement titled, \u201cThe Full Story Regarding the Edo State House of Assembly: The Danger of a Single Fraudulent Narrative,\u201d said the people of Edo State have continued to enjoy the benefit of good governance with the three arms of government at peace with one another and working for the common good.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe Edo State Government has noticed that in the past few weeks, a vigorous media offensive appears to have been launched by some characters who lost out in the politics regarding the governorship of Edo State in the last election.\n\n\u201cThe issue of particular interest has been an attempt to create the narrative that there exists a \u2018crisis\u2019 in the Edo State House of Assembly and that such a crisis has been orchestrated by the Executive Arm of Government.\n\n\u201cThese persons seek to take advantage of the somewhat short attention span and memory of some unwary persons which make the obvious factual inaccuracies in their narrative seductive.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, necessary to recount for purposes of posterity the sequence of events that led us to where we are now.\u201d\n\nOgie continued: \u201cOn the 9th of March, 2019, an election was conducted into the Edo State House of Assembly, in which all 24 seats were won by the candidates of the then All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\u201cIn line with the provisions of section 105 (3) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (As Amended), His Excellency, the Governor of Edo State, Mr. Godwin Nogheghase Obaseki, on the 14th Day of June, 2019, issued a proclamation for the first session of the Edo State House of Assembly to be held on the Monday, 17th Day of June, 2019.\n\n\u201cThis proclamation was duly publicized in official gazettes and in the print and electronic media circulating in Edo State and across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is a requirement of the law that all elected members present themselves to the Clerk of the Assembly, bringing along copies of their declaration of assets upon which they would be sworn-in by the Clerk of the House of Assembly and would subsequently proceed to elect their principal officers.\n\n\u201cOn the said date, 17th of June, 2019, nine elected members presented themselves forswearing-in in accordance with the law, while the others (for reasons best known to them), chose to stay away.\u201d\n\nThe government scribe further noted, \u201cThe members present therefore were administered with the relevant oath and proceeded to carry on with the business of the House of Assembly.\n\n\u201cIt must be pointed out that the validity of these proclamation and inauguration were challenged before the Federal High Court in suit noFHC/PH/CS/159/2019 and in a considered judgement, His Lordship, the Honourable Justice J.K Omotosho, not only validated the aforestated proclamation and inauguration of the House of Assembly, but restrained the Governor of Edo State from issuing any other proclamation in that regard.\n\n\u201cSubsequently, two other members presented themselves for swearing-in and were duly sworn in to take their places in the Edo State House of Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe rogue members-elect of the House of Assembly at the behest of their political patrons relocated to Abuja, living large in five-star hotels under the sponsorship of their said patrons whilst they instituted various cases including suit no B/81/OS/2019 and also invited the two arms of the National Assembly to unlawfully intervene and truncate the smooth running of the Edo State Government.\n\n\u201cIt is a matter of public record that these attempts to secure a political coup d\u2019etat ultimately failed because of the heroic resistance of the people of Edo State.\n\n\u201cAt the expiration of 181 days of continuous absenteeism and failure to present themselves for inauguration as prescribed by the constitution, the seats of these delinquent members-elect were declared vacant by the Speaker of the Edo State House of Assembly, who subsequently called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct by-elections into the now vacant seats in order to ensure that the citizens of the affected constituencies have representation in the Edo State House of Assembly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese same recalcitrant members-elect immediately again filed an action at the Federal High Court in Abuja in suit no FHC/AB/CS/1582/2019, seeking to restrain INEC from conducting the said by-election and also seeking to reverse the decision to declare their seats vacant,\u201d he added.\n\nNoting that the absentee members-elect and their sponsors have resorted to spinning a false narrative of unlawful exclusion and illegality after they lost in their attempt to continue the stranglehold of their godfathers on the governorship of Edo State, Ogie said, \u201cIn consequence of these numerous actions, the absentee members-elect have ensured a stalemate in the resolution of the representation of their constituencies arising from their selfish interests.\n\n\u201cIn the run-up to the last Edo State Governorship election, these same members-elect notwithstanding the numerous court actions they had themselves instituted came to Benin under armed police escorts from Abuja and attempted to physically and violently seize control of the Edo State House of Assembly.\n\n\u201cWhen they failed in this attempt, they retreated to the residence of one of their sponsors in Benin City, whereat they purported to proclaim their own House of Assembly and even went ahead to elect their own Speaker and principal officers.\n\n\u201cBefore their illegal activities fizzled out into insignificance, they issued orders to banks and other financial institutions, attempting to shut down the activities of the Edo State Government.\n\n\u201cWhen they and their sponsors finally lost in their attempt to continue the stranglehold of their godfathers on the governorship of Edo State, they again retreated into their shells and have only recently embarked on a whirlwind tour of media houses and other public establishments in an attempt to spin a false narrative of unlawful exclusion and illegality.\n\n\u201cOne would have expected that persons who submitted their disputes to duly constituted courts in line with the dictates of all civilized societies would pursue their claims before those courts diligently rather than the constant twists and turns by which they attempt to seek extra-judicial sympathy, remedies and political resolution of straightforward legal issues.\u201d\n\nThe statement further read: \u201cIt has become necessary to make this statement in order to set the record straight and to avoid a situation where lies and fraudulent untruths are repeated so often that they begin to appear like truth.\n\n\u201cThe Edo State Government wishes to assure all concerned that the state is in good health, safe, secure and welcoming of all law-abiding citizens, investors and visitors and this attempt to falsely create an impression of crisis and conflict is not supported by the facts on ground.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, in the absence of these mischief-makers and their godfather, the generality of the people of Edo State have continued to enjoy the benefit of good governance with the three arms of government at peace with one another and working for the common good.\u201d\n\n...",

Bello Mandiya (APC-Katsina) on the floor of the Senate.\n\nThe point of order was on the \u201cUrgent need for the Federal Government to take drastic actions to bring to an end the act of banditry and kidnapping in Faskari Local Government Area of Katsina\u201d.\n\nRelying on Order 41 and 51 of the Senate Rules, Mandiya noted that the act of banditry and kidnapping had become a daily incidence in Katsina with huge consequence of loss of lives, means of livelihood and displacement of communities.\n\nThe lawmaker recalled that, \u201con Sunday, 31st Jan., gunmen struck Ruwan Godiya, a Community in Faskari Local Government Area of Katsina State where 38 members of the community were kidnapped.\n\nHe stated that the Federal Government had made frantic effort in curbing the menace by setting up Operation Sharan Daji and Inter-Agency Task Force to tackle cases of banditry, cattle rustling and kidnapping in the state.\n\n\u201cWorried that the continuous security challenges and related attacks by bandits on towns, villages and communities in Faskari Local Government Area have meted untold hardship on the people.\n\nMandiya said that if the menace was not drastically and promptly addressed, the consequence was going to be huge on food sufficiency since the affected communities were mostly farmers.\n\nContributing, Sen. Kabir Barkiya (APC-Katsina), faulted the inability of the military to contain the situation despite several calls for it to act.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough. What is happening in Katsina shows that we don\u2019t have to only condemn it, we have to do something very serious.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Sen. Adamu Aliero (APC-Kebbi) said, \u201cit is indeed a national disgrace that this thing is happening on daily basis.\n\n\u201cSomething needs to be done urgently and our security forces have to be encouraged and supported.\n\n\u201cWe have provided support to the security agents. I remember last year alone, there was a Supplementary Appropriation.\n\n\u201cWe approved over N865 billion and this year\u2019s budget, I know we have close to about N1 trillion and we are getting little in terms of the outcome.\n\n\u201cBy now, we are supposed to have a very peaceful country. Unfortunately, on daily basis, we have people being kidnapped, killed.\n\n\u201cThere is need for security agents to do whatever is seemingly possible to calm this situation,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Sen. Abdul Kwari (APC-Kaduna) said: \u201cThe issue of banditry in this country has assumed a very alarming proportion.\n\n\u201cThe testimonies we have being receiving around the country are really testimonies that should get us moving.\n\n\u201cWhere are the Tucano Fighter Jets that were recently acquired by the Federal Government and heavily celebrated by all of us that these bandits have come home to roost.\n\n\u201cThe whole nation should rise and get whatever that is needed to be gotten for the use of this fighter jets on this bandits for us to move forward,\u201d Kwari said.\n\nIn his remarks, President of the Senate Ahmad Lawan, in his remarks said the repeated cases of kidnappings and killings made it imperative for the military to \u201cwake up\u201d to protect Nigerians.\n\nHe wondered why full scale action was yet to be carried out by the military in spite of increased funding for security in the 2022 budget by the Executive and National Assembly.\n\nHe said, \u201cthe expectation of this Senate is that there is supposed to be a remarkable difference in success in terms of the fight against insurgence, banditry and militancy in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhen we declared the bandits as terrorists, my understanding was they are going to be dealt with ruthlessly now. I wonder whether that is the case.\n\n\u201cThe military like some of our colleagues have said, need to wake up. We want to see a difference because we have made a difference in terms of funding.\u201d\n\n...",

However, the idea of crowdfunding Obi\u2019s campaign did not appeal to some.\n\nThe PDP has not publicly decided to pick its candidate from any part of Nigeria. But some of its most popular candidates are from the North.\n\nAlready, former senate president Bukola Saraki, former speaker and current governor of Sokoto State Aminu Tambuwal, both from the North, have already declared for presidency.\n\nAtiku Abubakar, a former Nigerian vice president to whom Obi was a running mate in the 2019 general election, is expected to run again despite his age. He is opposed by Bauchi State governor Bala Mohammed who advised the former vice president to support a younger candidate.\n\nObi said he is grateful to have been chosen as Atiku\u2019s running mate in the 2019 election, which was won by President Muhammadu Buhari, and that he will not oppose PDP\u2019s choice of where it picks the 2023 presidential candidate from.\n\n\u201cAt least in 2019 when I was involved, where I can say Atiku Abubakar chose me as his running mate, for which I remain grateful, the party decided that the candidate should come from the North,\u201d the former Anambra governor said.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe that the party owes it a duty to declare their stand.

          "text": "The Senate, on Wednesday, confirmed seven nominees appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari as National Commissioners and Resident Electoral Commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nThis is despite protest by civil society organisations (CSOs) against the confirmation of one of the nominees, Engr. (Prof.) Rhoda H. Gumus from Bayelsa State as National Commissioner representing South-South.\n\nHuman Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) had in a January 26, 2022 petition to the leadership of the National Assembly alleged that Prof. Gumus \u201cis a card carrying member of the All progressives Congress (APC),\u201d saying her nomination was in breach of the 1999 Constitution and the Electoral Act 2010 (both as amended).\n\nSimilarly, Concerned Nigerians Group in another petition signed by its convener, Deji Adeyanju, said: \u201cdespite the criticism that trailed Ms. Onochie\u2019s nomination, we are deeply worried to note that the president, has, once again, nominated another card carrying member of the APC, as INEC commissioner. This is a direct threat to the nation\u2019s electoral process and the ultimate security of Nigeria as a democratic nation.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, the confirmation of the nominees followed the consideration of a report presented by the Senate Committee on INEC chaired by Senator Kabiru Gaya (APC, Kano South).\n\nChairman of the Senate Committee, Senator Gaya, in his presentation, recalled that the confirmation request was made by President Muhammadu Buhari in compliance with the provision of Section 153(1)(f) of the Constitution, and pursuant to the provision of Section 154(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended).\n\nHe, however, acknowledged that the Committee received only one petition from the Taraba Elders Forum against the nomination of Maj. Gen. A. B. Alkali (Rtd.) over \u201cthe seeming inconsistency in the rotation of the nomination\u201d.\n\nAccording to Gaya, the Taraba Elders Forum stated that the nomination started from Taraba (2003 \u2013 2008), Adamawa (2008 \u2013 2015) and Gombe (2015 \u2013 2021).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe added that petitioners observed that it was the turn Taraba State to produce the nominee against the backdrop of the principle of rotation.\n\nGaya, however, explained that the Committee resolved that all the states (Taraba, Adamawa and Gombe) had been nominated between 2003 and 2021, therefore, it was the prerogative of the President to pick his nominee from any of the three states.\n\nOthers nominees confirmed include: Mal. Mohammed Haruna (Niger \u2013 North Central, National Commissioner); Mrs May Agbamuche-Mbu (Delta \u2013 South South, National Commissioner); Ukeagu Kenneth Nnamdi (Abia \u2013 South East, National Commissioner); and Major General A. B. Alkali (Rtd) \u2013 Adamawa (North East, National Commissioner).\n\nAlso confirmed were Mr. Sam Olumekun (Ondo \u2013 South West, National Commissioner); and Olaniyi Olaleye Ijalaye (Ondo \u2013 South West, Resident Commissioner).\n\nLawmakers, including the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege and Senator James Manager, spoke highly of the competence and credibility of the President\u2019s nominees.\n\nThe Senate President, in his remarks after the nominees were confirmed, congratulated them while noting that the 2023 general election would be a \u201cbaptism of fire\u201d to test their efficiency.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe added that the National Assembly would support the electoral body to ensure the conduct of free and transparent elections in 2023.\n\nLawan said, \u201cThey (confirmed nominees) would have a baptism of fire because 2023 is just by the corner.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the process has already started, as INEC may soon announce the dates of elections and then the subsequent process.\n\n\u201cWe expect nothing less than excellence from our electoral body.\n\n\u201cThis Senate has confirmed National Commissioners and Resident Commissioners before.\n\n\u201cWe have done this today, and INEC now has full compliment of the people that need to do the work.\n\n\u201cINEC also gets the support of the National Assembly through appropriations and, therefore, it would have no reason not to perform.\n\n\u201cWe are also expecting that the Electoral Bill amendment will be signed, and if that happens, INEC would have a document to guide it through, even in the off season before the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cTherefore, Nigerians are expectant that INEC will perform creditably well.\n\n\u201c[And] for us in the National Assembly, we will always be there for INEC because we believe that it is in the interest of Nigeria and our citizens to have free and transparent elections to determine the leadership of this country at all levels.\u201d",

          "text": "By Okafor Ofiebor/ Port Harcourt\n\nRivers State Executive Council led by Governor Nyesom Wike on Wednesday gave approval for the State to access N15 billion facility from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Infrastructure Fund, in order to accelerate the completion of three critical projects.\n\nThe three major projects are the Oyigbo -Okoloma Road; Chokocho-Igbodo Road and construction of the 10th flyover by Governor Nyesom Ezenwo Wike\u2019s administration at Rumuokwurushi-Elimgbu.\n\nBriefing journalists at the Government House, Port Harcourt after the Executive Council meeting, the Commissioner for Finance, Isaac Kamalu said the State government felt that one way it could fast track the completion of these projects would be to access the CBN Infrastructure Fund, considering that the facility has a very low interest rate of 5 percent.\n\n\u201cCouncil in her deliberations at the Executive Council meeting today (Wednesday) approved that the Rivers State Government should access the Central Bank of Nigeria Infrastructure Support Facility to the tune of N15billion.\n\n\u201cThis will be utilised as further support for the critical infrastructure that the State is embarking and presently prosecuting, which are the Chokocho-Igbodo Road in Etche Local Government; the Oyigbo-Okoloma Road in Oyigbo Local Government Area and the Rumuokwurushi -Elimgbu flyover.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that prior to now, the Rivers State Government had accessed funds for these projects. However, these funds even if put together will not be able to accomplish these three critical projects mentioned. And so, government felt that one way it could fast track the completion of these projects will be to participate in this Central Bank Infrastructure Facility, considering that the facility has a very low interest rate of 5 percent, repayable within 20 years with three years moratorium,\u201d he said.\n\nKamalu expressed optimism that the N15 billion facility would be very good support to ensure that these projects are delivered on time and serve the interest of the State.\n\nThe Council also took the decision to recover dilapidated government quarters from civil servants and illegal occupants within Old and New Government Residential Area (GRA), Port Harcourt and reallocate them to competent private individuals.\n\nThe Commissioner for Information and Communications, Paulinus Nsirim, explained that the Council took this decision because some of these properties were fraudulently acquired by retired civil servants through dubious processes of allocation and sale.\n\nAccording to him, some of these government properties also fell into utter deterioration due to the abject neglect and lack of maintenance by the occupants.\n\n\u201cThe properties were totally in uninhabitable condition and were converted into commercial and business uses; in some cases, they were sublet to private tenants, as well as the use of the premises for poultries, fish ponds, barbing saloons, and other unauthorized uses.\n\n\u201cThe Task Force set up by the Rivers State Government to look into this matter found out that some of these properties were found to be under illegal occupants by non-civil servants, some of whom are non-indigenes.\n\n\u201cThis has therefore necessitated the recovery of these properties as part of government\u2019s urban renewal programme, with the civil servant \u2013 occupants being reallocated to alternative private properties through financial support provided by the State government.\u201d\n\nNsirim said the recovery of these properties and their subsequent reallocation will form part of the first phase of the ongoing urban renewal programme of the Rivers State Government within the Old and New GRA, Port Harcourt.",

Gumus, a card-carrying member of the All ProgressivesCongress (APC), as a National Electoral Commissioner, by the Nigerian Senate.\n\nA few weeks ago, we wrote a letter to the President of the Nigerian Senate, Alhaji Ahmed Lawan, urging him, in the interest of democracy, to resist the attempt by President Muhammadu Buhari to appoint a card carrying member of the All Progressive Congress, Prof. Rhoda Gumus, as a National Electoral Commissioner. In that letter, we itemised the dangers associated with such an action.\n\nHowever, in a clear case of partisanship over national interest, the Nigerian Senate has proceeded to confirm her nomination. We outrightly condemn this confirmation and state that it has set our electoral system 23 years back. We are alarmed that every step taken by the Nigerian president and the Nigeria National Assembly, suggest in clear terms, that there is no intention to conduct a free and fair election in the year 2023.\n\nIt is shameful and embarrassing that the Nigerian Senate, whose duty, amongst others, is to protect the Constitution, has chosen the inglorious path of violating the Constitution. Even under the military rule, the military rulers had respect for their own laws. The present crop of lawmakers have demonstrated beyond argument that they have learnt nothing from the incidents that led to the collapse of previous democratic governments in Nigeria even as coups are happening all around us in West Africa. We hope that this lesson will not be learnt when it is too late.\n\nWe must warn of the danger that lies ahead if the political actors continue to resist an attempt to enshrine a transparent electoral system in Nigeria. The nation\u2019s democratic institutions rests on a transparent electoral process. We must, therefore, refrain from such actions, like the confirmation of Prof. Gumus, that threatens our electoral system.\n\nCOMRADE DEJI ADEYANJU, LLB.",

We have similar and parallel positions in government. I have even held more sensitive positions than him,\u201d he said, jocularly, emphasizing that he is \u201clooking forward to having\u201d the governor as a worthy successor, who is eminently qualified to run for the highest office in the land should he chose to do so.\u201d\n\nHe added that he was ready to support Governor Tambuwal if he opts to seek PDP\u2019s ticket to be its flag bearer, provided he will be a \u201cpan Nigerian that will be just.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can reach out to all Nigerians across the geographic and other divides in our bid to support him.\n\n\u201cThis does not suggest that we are beggars hungry for power.

          "title": "El-Rufai cries out to Buhari: Give us North West Theatre Command to tackle terrorists",
          "text": "Kaduna state Governor Nasir el-Rufai has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to create a theatre command in the North West region to tackle banditry, noting that nine people were kidnapped daily in Kaduna state on the average.\n\nFollowing the pronouncement of a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja declaring bandits, kidnappers and gunmen as terrorists, the federal government gazetted the order.\n\nWith this, security agents would now deal with this set of criminals as terrorists.\n\nEl-Rufai\u2019s worry\n\nSpeaking while receiving the 2021 Kaduna state Annual Security Report and the Fourth Quarter 2021 Security Report presented by the state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, Governor el-Rufai said there was need for a theatre command to tackle the rising wave of terrorism in the North-west region of Kaduna, Kebbi, Sokoto, Kano, Katsina, Zamfara and Jigawa states.\n\nThe governor reiterated his administration\u2019s position that there is nothing like repentant bandits.\n\nTo him, anybody who can take up arms to threaten the lives and property of Nigerians has sinned against the country and does not deserve to live or benefit from any concession whatsoever from the country.\n\nLamenting the increase in the number of deaths, those kidnapped and those injured by bandits in 2021 in relation to 2020, the governor also expressed dismay over the escalation of ethno-religious strife in Zangon Kataf chiefdom and spilling into Chawai in Kauru local government.\n\nHe, however, lauded the Emirs and chiefs in the state for \u201cbeing the leading and influential anchors of peaceful coexistence in our various communities.\n\n\u201cThe report presented today shows that in 2021, an average of 9 persons were kidnapped daily across Kaduna state, mostly in the Kaduna Central senatorial district. There is also an escalation in the number of persons killed by a whopping 255 compared to those sadly killed by banditry and criminality in 2020 in spite of our best efforts in supporting the federal security agencies to bring an end to this phenomenon.\n\n\u201cKaduna state government appeals to the Federal Government to create a Theatre Command similar to the situation in the North-East to confront the insurgency that has clearly emerged in five states of the North-West and Niger state with continuous and contiguous forest ranges.\n\n\u201cThe creation of such a Theatre Command will enable holistic approach to counter-insurgent operations across the six affected states and the enhanced coordination of the resources of the Armed Forces, the Police, the SSS, our respective State Vigilance Services, hunters and other local volunteers to fight the insurgents.\n\n\u201cWe do not believe that there is any phenomenon like \u2018repentant bandits\u2019. Any person that makes a conscious decision to secure arms, challenge the authority of the Nigerian state, and threatens the lives and property of Nigerians does not deserve to live, or be granted any concession by the society. There are no immediate or remote causes to justify terrorist conduct.\n\n\u201cThose that hide behind these are either ethnic jingoists, religious apologists or fail to recognise that no legitimate government can survive by tolerating terrorists or negotiating with those that menace law-abiding citizens. While acknowledging their efforts and sacrifices l, we urge our military, police and other security agencies to ensure coordinated actions and intensify simultaneous kinetic operations against these terrorists until they are decimated to the point of surrender.\n\n\u201cWe are in no doubt that there must be an urgent national effort to strengthen our security forces. The military and police need modern technology, advanced armaments, equipment and more boots on the ground. The security of our communities depends on the robust projection of state power, and that can only be done with sufficient security personnel to overawe and deter criminals. The prerogatives of the state need to be asserted, not merely proclaimed.\n\n\u201cThe people we put in uniform must never be placed in avoidable danger, outgunned or outnumbered by non-state actors. While the security agencies keep trying their best, the peacemakers on the ground should not be discouraged. Peace is worth every effort, despite the setbacks encountered.\n\n\u201cWe note with sadness the escalation of violence in Zangon Kataf Chiefdom, which appears to be rapidly spilling into the Chawai part of Kauru Local Government. We condemn the disregard for human life and the violations of law that are fuelling the crisis. We sympathise with the affected communities. This outbreak of violence is a serious challenge to the community level peace process initiated by His Highness, the Agwam of Zangon Kataf and community leaders in the area.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to the security agencies, particularly the Army, Air Force, Navy, Police, Civil Defence, SSS, our State Vigilance Service and KASTLEA for constant collaboration with our Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs in the hard work of securing the state.\u201d\n\nHighlights of the reports\n\nPresenting the report to the governor, Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan said the state lost 1,192 residents to bandits\u2019 attacks across the state in 2021, 3,348 citizens were kidnapped, while 891 sustained various forms of injury during the attacks under the period.\n\nThe report further said 13,788 cows were rustled across the state within the 12 months covered by the report.\n\nAruwan said: \u201cThere is growing threat of food insecurity in the state as farmers found it difficult to access their farms for key farming activities, having been kidnapped or for fear of being abducted.\n\n\u201cMany farmers were also killed, just as bandits extort taxes from farmers before they could access their farms. Birnin Gwari, Igabi, Giwa, Zaria, Chikun, Kauru, Kajuru, Kachia, Kagarko, Zangon Kataf, Jema\u2019a and Sanga local governments were most affected.\u201d\n\nThe Report further said the state recorded 182 cases of farm destruction either by cattle under the watch of itinerant herders or herds rustled by bandits which destroyed farms during escape, especially in Birnin Gwari, Giwa, Igabi, Chikun, Kajuru, Jema\u2019a, Kaura, Kauru and Zangon Kataf local government areas.\n\nIt further said 50 children were among those killed, as 1,038 were men and 104 women, with Kaduna Central senatorial zone recording the highest number of death of 720, followed by 406 in Kaduna South and 66 in Kaduna North.\n\nThere were 340 children kidnapped, while 2,023 of the figure were men and 985 were women. Kaduna Central zone also led in the area of kidnapping with 2,771 abducted from the zone, while 397 citizens were kidnapped from the Southern senatorial zone and 180 from the Kaduna North zone.\n\nAbout 544 residents of Kaduna Central zone sustained injury within 2021, while Kaduna South zone recorded 253 and Kaduna North zone recorded 94.\n\nThe Report further stated that \u201c10,261 cows were stolen in Kaduna Central zone, 1,941 and 1,586 cows were rustled in the Southern and Northern senatorial zones respectively.\n\n\u201cThere were increase in the various figures as the death rate of 937 recorded in 2020 paled to that of 1,192 recorded last year, also 1972 people were kidnapped on 2020 while 3,348 were kidnapped last year. The 7,935 cows stolen in 2020 almost doubled to 13,788 cows rustled in 2021.\u201d\n\nAruwan lamented the growing interaction between the bandits in the state and terrorist groups such as Boko Haram, ISWAP, and Ansaru, a development he said, had become a source of concern to the state.\n\n11 security operatives slain in Niger\n\nIn a related development, the Niger state government Tuesday confirmed bandits killed 11 security agents and several villagers in separate attacks between Friday and Saturday in Shiroro and Paikoro local government areas of the state.\n\nBut residents of the areas said at least 32 persons were killed overall across the affected communities.\n\nSpeaking through his Chief Press Secretary, Mary Noel-Berje, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello said: \u201cThe terrorists, numbering over 100 invaded the community in broad daylight, killing about 11 Joint Security Taskforce members, several villagers and leaving many injured.\u201d\n\nHe said scores of the gunmen were also said to have been neutralised.\n\nBello said the attacks on Galadiman Kogo and other villages in Shiroro council area could have been averted if the locals had alerted the security forces on time.\n\nResidents said the attacks occurred Saturday and Monday with 20 people immediately confirmed killed in Shiroro and another person in Paikoro.\n\nAdded to the official figure of security casualties, the number of the dead is now 32.\n\nChairperson Shiroro local government area, Suleiman Chukuba, had earlier confirmed the incident to Premium Times but said he could not confirm the number of casualties.\n\nBut the chairperson, Concerned Shiroro Youth Groups, Yusuf Kokki, in a statement Monday had also said 20 residents were killed and that many residents were yet to be accounted for.\n\nHe said several communities in the area had been deserted.\n\nKokki blamed the attack on the withdrawal of security personnel from their Galadima Kogo base in Shiroro for the attacks.\n\n\u201cThis decision taken by Government, notwithstanding the accompanying reason (s), is reckless and insensitive in its entirety, especially to the plights of innocent and unarmed law-abiding citizens already ravaged by incessant insecurity.\n\n\u201cConsidering how porous, prone to insecurity and vulnerable to deadly attacks by the rampaging hydra-headed, venomous murderous and heartless terrorists, Galadima Kogo is, one can easily conclude that withdrawal of security personnel at this material time is a deliberate attempt to further jeopardize people\u2019s lives and put them in the line,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn view of the calamity at hand, the Concerned Shiroro Youths Of Niger State hereby call with the loudest voice on the authorities concerned to restore the withdrawn security personnel and also deploy additional security personnel to other areas prone to insecurity with immediate effect or risk our reactions,\u201d Kokki stated.\n\nBut the governor on Tuesday said the withdrawal of the soldiers \u201cwas tactical, in order to restrategise.\u201d\n\n\u2018Looting, abducting and killing\u2019\n\nResidents said the gunmen also raided Paikoro, a neighbouring council area, killing one person Monday afternoon.\n\nA resident, Salisu Sabo, told this newspaper that the gunmen, on Monday morning, were moving from one community to another, looting shops, shooting, and abducting people.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey have so far invaded Ammale, Dakalo, Kuchiri, Kurmin Giwa, Goto Reshidat, Yanki and Goto Sarki communities. One person has been killed, while the injured victims are receiving treatment in Kafin Koro General Hospital.\u201d\n\n\u2018Attack could have been averted\u2019\n\nIn the official statement, Governor Bello said the attack on Galadiman Kogo would have been unsuccessful if villagers from Galape and Kudodo in Allawa had alerted the security agencies when they noticed the movements of the terrorists towards the town.\n\nHe urged villagers in the affected communities to endeavour to provide credible information to the Joint Security Taskforce stationed in the area, adding that \u201csecurity agencies cannot perform effectively and efficiently without getting appropriate support and intelligence from the people.\u201d\n\nThe governor called for calm and urged the fleeing communities in Galadiman Kogo and Kuchi in Shiroro and Munya local government areas to await a swift and immediate response from the Joint Security Taskforce, stressing that their earlier withdrawal was tactical in order to re-strategise.\n\n\u201cThe state government has already secured the order and clearance of President Buhari to carry out intensive military operations in the affected axis, assuring that ground and airstrikes would continue to comb the areas, so as to flush out those miscreants.\n\n\u201cWe have really run out of patience with the terrorists and we\u2019ll use every means possible to bring an end to these incessant bloody attacks on innocent people. We\u2019ll do everything to stop the killings and return normalcy to the affected communities.\n\n\u201cThe governor prayed for the reposed souls of the Joint Security Taskforce members and villagers who lost their lives during the attack on Galadiman Kogo and directed the State Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA) to urgently provide succour to the injured and displaced,\u201d the statement said.",

          "title": "#EndSARS Protest: Senate Calls For Holistic Reform Of Police Force",
          "text": "The Senate on Wednesday advised the Federal Government to evolve and implement holistic reforms in the Nigerian Police Force.\n\nIt believes employing more able-bodied personnel, injecting more financial resources for the purpose of procuring arms, ammunition, and other policing gadgets, as well undertaking regular training will ensure efficient policing in the country.\n\nThis formed part of the recommendations contained in the 69-page report of the Joint Committee on National Security and Intelligence; Defence; Police Affairs; Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters on the mayhem visited on the ancient city of Calabar during the #EndSARS protests on October 23 and 24, 2020.\n\nIn his presentation, Chairman of the Joint Committee, Senator Ibrahim Gobir, said that investigative hearings by the lawmakers revealed that the violence in Calabar metropolis during the protests, which led to the looting and destruction of private and government-owned properties, was \u201clargely spontaneous with no identified goals, leaders, sponsors or financiers\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt was a free reign for amorphous groups, gangs, and criminals,\u201d Senator Gobir was quoted as saying in a statement by Senate President Ahmad Lawan\u2019s media aide, Ezrel Tabiowo.\n\nHe disclosed that one of the victims of the protest, Senator Bassey Henshaw, who appeared before the committee, narrated his ordeal, saying it took a miracle to get him, his wife, and daughter out from the mob which vandalised its way right into his bedroom.\n\nSecurity Forces Overwhelmed\n\nHenshaw, according to Gobir, stated before the committee that the attacks were deliberately orchestrated by some politicians who perceived them as political enemies.\n\nHe attributed the violence to the displacement of the people of Bakassi as a result of ceding their homelands to the Republic of Cameroon, a situation that turned some of them into militants.\n\nREAD ALSO: Senate Confirms Six New INEC National Commissioners, One REC\n\nThe former lawmaker said that the #EndSARS protest was used as an opportunity by militants to unleash mayhem on the city of Calabar, adding that he lost properties worth over N9.3 billion to the attack.\n\nIn addition, the joint committee stated in its report that a total of 41government properties were vandalised by hoodlums during the #EndSARS protests around Calabar municipal and neighbouring Bakassi, Odukpani, and Akpabuyo Local Government Areas of Cross River State.\n\nIt revealed that at the time of the invasion of homes, the security agencies failed to promptly respond to distress calls from victims and several victims got hints of the planned attacks before the actual acts.\n\nAccording to the panel, the police, Department of State Services (DSS), and the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) were overwhelmed by the sheer number of the hoodlums who unleashed mayhem on the city of Calabar.\n\nThe joint committee said it was also alleged by the police before it that the force lacked adequate personnel, vehicles, arms, ammunition, and other tactical equipment for effective policing of the Calabar.\n\nIt stated that the police claimed that 106 suspects were arrested, 90 per cent of whom were indigenes of Akwa Ibom extraction, including two females.\n\nThe panel observed that the Internally Displaced Persons of Bakassi peninsular have not been resettled by the Federal Government, neither has any kind of respite been given to them.\n\nIt added that among those notable leaders whose property and businesses were attacked were former governors of the state \u2013 Senator Liyel Imoke and Donald Duke, as well as serving and former senators such as Senator Gershom Bassey, Senator Victor Egba, Senator Henshaw, and a member of the House of Representatives, Etta Mbora.\n\nThe joint committee disclosed that the financial value of the vandalised property/items were also submitted by the affected persons and verified by the committee set up by the governor amounted to over N73 billion.\n\nAccording to it, Cross River State Governor, Ben Ayade, wrote to President Muhammadu Buhari requesting support/funds in the sum of N73,069,634,615.70 to enable the state to rebuild, reconstruct, and compensate individuals and groups who had lost property.\n\nCall For Help\n\nAccordingly, the Senate in its recommendations underscored the need for regular and purposeful training of personnel of the security agencies in line with international best practices.\n\nIt called on the Federal Government to give priority in terms of security to Cross River, considering the peculiarity of the state with a very large landmass.\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe lawmakers stated that the over 6,000 Cameroon refugees, the influx of Ambazonian army at the border with Cameroon, the large number of militants and those granted amnesty by the state government but yet to be integrated into the National Amnesty programme, constitute an imminent threat to the state\u2019s security.\n\nThey recommended that the Federal Government should evolve and implement holistic reforms in the police, to be in tandem with international best practices.\n\n\u201cThese will ensure and guarantee effective and efficient policing and coverage of the polity\u201d, the chamber said.\n\nThe Senate also recommended that educational programmes and curricula should be geared towards inculcating functional education in individuals, as well as empowering them with academic, technical, and vocational capabilities.\n\nIt also advised the Cross River State government to hold regular State Security Council meetings to ensure the total safety of its citizens and their property, as well as treat the regular intelligence report of the DSS with utmost dispatch.\n\nThe lawmakers urged the amnesty office and the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to provide relief materials and assistance to the victims of the mayhem.\n\nThey advised the state government to support its security bureaucracy financially, and with equipment to make it more purposeful and effective.\n\n\u201cThere must be a synergy between the state government and all the Federal Government security agencies domiciled and operating in the state for robust interchange and comprehensive deliverables,\u201d the Senate said.\n\nIt also resolved to transmit the cost of N34,255,427,822.44, and N10,927,321,757.50 to the Cross River State government as an amount to defray the cost of rebuilding and reconstructing vandalised and looted property belonging to private individuals and Federal Government agencies, respectively.",

Over the past two years there have been military takeovers in Mali, Chad, Burkina Faso and Guinea, as well as further east in Sudan.\n\nAs events in Guinea-Bissau unfolded, the regional political and economic block Ecowas, as well as the United States, issued condemnations.\n\nBut one thing these coups is making clear is that there\u2019s very little international bodies can issue in the way of deterrents.\n\nEcowas has issued sanctions against Mali and Burkina Faso but they haven\u2019t stopped the wave of coups in the region. Guinea-Bissau has also been subject to sanctions over the last decade.\n\nIn a recent interview, the head of Ecowas\u2019 commission said that sanctions on Guinea-Bissau had been effective because they\u2019d helped the country return to peace. That assessment now seems to have been premature.\n\nSoldiers in the region have seized upon popular discontent with corrupt and ineffective governance to justify their actions. In Burkina Faso and Mali, their actions have been welcomed with joy from some parts of the population.\n\nBut analysts worry the democratic gains made in the region over the past two years are being undermined, and that what was once known as Africa\u2019 Coup Belt could well be earning that name again.\n\nBBC",
