Likewise, some men with normal sperm counts are unable to father children.\n\n\u201cEven if you have enough sperm, other factors are important to achieve a pregnancy, including normal sperm movement.\u201d\n\nBut the consultant urologist, while speaking with PUNCH HealthWise, said there may be no such thing as a normal sperm count as research in which he participated in found that men with an average of 4 million per millilitre, were still able to impregnate their wives normally.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as normal sperm count because we did a research about 35 years ago, where we examined male lecturers in Ahmadu Bello University.\n\n\u201cWe found that the lecturers\u2019 sperm count was at an average of three million to four million and they impregnated their wives normally.\n\n\u201cNobody knows what a normal sperm count is. Just that on the average, you say a normal sperm count is from three million and above, but we know men who have three million and they are impregnating their wives.\u201d\n\nHe, however, warned that the ability of a man to produce sperm does not always translate to fertility, as men naturally produce sperm.\n\nHe noted that other factors that can influence fertility in men include sperm motility and potency.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

He noted that immunity from childhood vaccines could wear off over time.\n\nThe Head of Geriatrics Unit, National Hospital, Abuja, said vaccination reduces the incidence of the disease among populations, as well as the social and economic burden on communities.\n\nShe said, \u201cEvery year, thousands of adults in Nigeria become severely ill and are hospitalised because of diseases that vaccines can help to prevent.\n\n\u201cMany adults even die from these diseases. It is harrowing when I see young Nigerians die from liver disease, which could be prevented through the Hepatitis B vaccine.\n\n\u201cBy getting vaccinated, a lot of people can help protect themselves from much of this unnecessary suffering.\u201d\n\nDr. Osiogbu, listed some adult vaccines to include Hepatitis A and B vaccines, Tetanus vaccine, Meningitis vaccine, Pneumococcal vaccine, Human Papillomavirus Vaccine, among others.\n\nAccording to her, vaccination is one of the most convenient and safest preventive care measures against diseases.\n\nShe appealed to the three levels of government to evolve strategies that would bridge adult vaccination gaps by resolving issues of vaccine affordability to encourage more adults to get vaccinated.\n\nAccording to her, this can be done through a national immunisation programme for adults, or coverage of the vaccination through the National Health Insurance Scheme.\n\nOsiogbu noted that mass vaccination was pivotal to achieving Sustainable Development Goal three, to reduce unnecessary hospitalisation and assist the Nigerian population to live a longer and healthier life.\n\n(NAN)",

          "text": "\n\nDelta Governor, Sen. Ifeanyi Okowa, on Thursday, said the School of Marine Technology, Burutu, would soon be upgraded by the state government.\n\n\n\nOkowa disclosed this during the inauguration of three legacy projects executed by the Hon. Godknows Angele led administration in Burutu, headquarters of Burutu Council Area.\n\n\n\nThe inaugurated projects were the legislative residential quarters, Head of Personnel Management (HPM) residential quarters and Treasurer to Local Government (TLG) residential quarters.\n\n\n\nThe Governor who was responding to requests by the community, noted that the problem with School of Marine Technology was that it was previously under the supervision of the State Ministry of Transport, adding that as part of effort aimed at repositioning the school, it has been moved from the Ministry of Transport to the Ministry of Higher Education.\n\n\n\nWhile saying that a substantive Provost would soon be appointed for the institution, Governor Okowa assured the people that the state government was mobilising action for work on the permanent site of the school.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI want reassure you that we are going to look into the various requests that you have made and that we will do our best possible.\n\n\n\n\u201cFirst of all, l must apologise that we have not taken much action on the School of Marine Technology but you would have realised that the school, in my opinion, has been slowed down from growth because it remains in the Ministry of Transport.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut recently, we have moved it from the Ministry of Transport to the Ministry of Higher Education. That is a first step to upgrade the institution and we are committed about the school. Very soon, a substantive Provost will be appointed for the school,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nGovernor Okowa applauded Hon. Angele for being very focused, adding that he was quite glad that the council chairman did not disappoint him.\n\n\n\n\u201cI pleaded with our leaders to allow Hon. Godknows Angele to become chairman of the local government council. I know that as l did that, l was putting a lot of burden on him.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur leaders agreed and l must thank them and the people of Burutu for allowing him to be the local government chairman. I am glad to see the things that l see here today.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat he has a befitting legislative quarters which matters a lot to me. The reason why it matters is that it will enable our councillors to reside in Burutu at least for some part of the week.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo that people will not continue to stay in Warri and Ughelli and rule over the affairs of this local government from elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat is very thoughtful of him and l am glad that he has quarters for the councillors, the Head of Personnel Management (HPM) and Treasurer to Local Government (TLG).\n\n\n\n\u201cl must thank you for this foresight and l thank you for the very good stories l have continued to hear about you from your people,\u201d the governor said.\n\n\n\nEarlier in his welcome address, Chairman of the Council, Hon. Godknows Angele said the legacy projects were embarked upon by his administration to provide shelter for councillors, HPM and the TLG in Burutu, the local government headquarters.\n\n\n\nAngele disclosed that the project which earned him award among three other local government areas out of the 774 local government areas in the country has also placed Delta State among the three states out of the 36 states of the federation to be so recognised.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, besides the legacy projects, there are other projects spread across the nooks and crannies of the local government area which are at various stages of completion, adding that when completed, they would be inaugurated for the benefit of the people in the area.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo achieve further development, we need the cooperation of all and sundry. I, therefore, wish to appeal to everyone to please give this administration the much needed support in this second tenure,\u201d the Chairman said.\n\n\n\nWhile noting that apart from Kiagbodo town, no other town in the area is linked to the national grid, he said \u201cwe provide electricity supply to stimulate economic growth and encourage the development of small and medium scale enterprises.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt cost my administration N6,000,000 monthly to fuel the two generators providing electricity to Burutu, headquarters of the local government area,\u201d he added, even as he appealed to the governor to prevail on the relevant authorities to come to their aid by connecting Burutu to the national grid.\n\n\n\nIn an address presented by the Chairman of Burutu Community, Mr. Herman Ekisah, the people who applauded the landmark achievements of the governor in different parts of the state, appealed to him to change the status of the School of Marine Technology from monotechnic to polytechnic, even as they called for the appointment of a substantive Provost for the School as well as the development of the permanent site of the institution among other requests.",

In the letter, LERSA questioned why tolling should resume on the 1.5km bridge in view of the harsh economic situation in the country.\n\nSigned by the President and General Secretary of the association, Olorogun James Emadoye and Mr. Gbemi Adelekan, respectively, the letter stated that the resumption of tolling will impose great financial hardship on users of the bridge.\n\n\u201cYour excellency, graciously permit us to exemplify our fears as follows: For a couple living off Freedom Way, Lekki 1, husband working in Obalende and wife working on Osborne Road, Ikoyi. Husband with SUV at N400 per trip (return) at day 30 days a month totals N24,000. Wife with a Toyota Corolla at N250 per trip (return) at day 30 days a month totals N15,000. Family annual budget for tolling is N468,000. We believe this is extremely unfair to us in Lekki.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that other infrastructure in other parts of the state were also funded through borrowing. We, therefore, do not understand why Lekki people must be the people to pay construction debts through tolling. We, therefore, implore the state government to reconsider the decision to reopen tolling.\n\n\u201cWe pray that the government will have a rethink on this matter and listen to the yearnings of residents and road users to rescind the toll payment that LCC is planning to perpetuate on peaceful, long-suffering taxpayers of this axis. We are also calling for an enlarged stakeholders\u2019 meeting to provide opportunity for a proper re-evaluation of this matter,\u201d LERSA said.",

          "text": "From Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nThe United Kingdom (UK) has advised against travel to seven northern states.\n\nThe states listed by the United Kingdom included Borno, Yobe, Adamawa, Gombe, Kaduna, Katsina and Zamfara.\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nForeign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) gave the warning in its travel advisory on northern Nigeria posted on its website.\n\n\u201cFCDO advise against travel to Borno, Yobe, Adamawa, Gombe, Kaduna, Katsina, and Zamfara states. Violent attacks are frequent and there is a high threat of kidnap.\n\n\u201cOn March 26, gunmen launched an attack against Kaduna airport, killing, at least, one airport official in a series of attacks by gunmen in the northern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOn the evening of March 29, an apparent improvised explosive device attack took place against a train travelling from Abuja to Kaduna. Reports suggest that a number of people were killed and that others were abducted by gunmen. Train services are now suspended between Abuja and Kaduna,\u201d the FCDO said.\n\nThe FCDO further said there is a threat from extremists linked to Boko Haram or the Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) in Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states in particular.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cThe threat level in North East Nigeria, including around Maiduguri is increasing, particularly around transport hubs, religious areas and large gatherings. Kidnaps have taken place on the roads in and out of Maiduguri. As the dry season starts in October, this risk is expected to increase even further.\n\n\u201cIf the security situation in Maiduguri were to deteriorate any further, there is a significant likelihood that it could be extremely difficult for you to leave the city. We do not advise travelling by road.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cFCDO advise against all but essential travel to: Bauchi, Kano, Jigawa, Niger, Sokoto states; and within 20km of the border with Niger in Kebbi State. There is a high risk of violent attacks and inter-communal tensions can lead to outbreaks of violence. There is also a threat of kidnap,\u201d FCDO said.\n\nFCDO also said anyone who travels to areas to which it advised against travel, that person is particularly at risk and will need a high level of security.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re working in northern Nigeria you should make sure your employers provide an adequate level of security where you live and where you work. Make sure they regularly review security arrangements and familiarise yourself with those plans. You should avoid regular patterns of travel or movement, and aim to travel only during daylight hours. Westerners have been kidnapped from protected compounds,\u201d FCDO said.\n\nThe FCDO recalled that from September 3, 2021, the Nigerian Communications Commission mandated all telecommunication operators in Nigeria to stop extending services to Zamfara State.\n\n\u201cThis included the suspension of all mobile telecommunications, including WiFi. A number of other state governments, including Kaduna, Katsina, Sokoto, Kebbi and Niger also implemented a partial shutdown of telecom services. There are reports that some of these restrictions have been lifted, with Nigerian media reporting that communications in Kaduna and Zamfara states have been restored as of December 2021.\n\n\u201cDespite the reported restoration of communications in some states, future shutdowns may happen at short notice and may also be extended to new areas without advanced notice.\n\n\u201cAlthough not officially included in the suspension, there is a possibility that areas of neighbouring states to Zamfara, including state border regions with Sokoto, Kebbi, Niger and Kaduna may also be affected by the telecommunications black-out.\n\n\u201cRegular military operations are ongoing in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states. If you live or work in Nigeria, you should monitor developments in these states and announcements by the state governments as there is an increased threat of retaliatory attacks elsewhere in Nigeria as a result of these military operations. There has been an increase in insurgent attacks in Borno State. Since October 2019, there has been an increasing trend of terrorist groups constructing illegal vehicle checkpoints on major supply and commercial routes in northern Nigeria and attacking vehicles travelling on major roads into Maiduguri, Borno State, including the A3 Maiduguri-Damaturu road. These attacks have directly targeted civilians, security forces and aid workers. Furthermore, 2020 has seen increased activity by terrorist groups and related violent incidents in the immediate vicinity of humanitarian hubs. A humanitarian hub was targeted during an attack on Monguno town on June 13, 2020. This was followed by negative propaganda about humanitarian activity in the North East. In July 2020, shots were fired at a UN humanitarian helicopter in the region. Local humanitarian staff were executed in an unrelated event.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in the North East against FCDO advice, keep in touch with the authorities and the wider community on the security situation and make sure your procedures and contingency plans are up to date.\u201d",

Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nThe leaders made a strong demand on political parties, especially the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), to zone their presidential tickets to the South East.They said the zone had the candidates with the capacity, patriotism and passion to govern Nigeria.\n\nThe event chaired by Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu had an array of Igbo leaders, including the Obi of Onitsha, Igwe Alfred Achebe, Prof. Anya O. Anya, Senator Ben Obi, Prof. Uche Azikiwe, Mrs. Beatrice Ekwueme and Dr Okwesilieze Nwodo.\n\nOthers were Chief Achike Udenwa, Prof. ABC Nwosu, Chief Dubem Onyia, Senator Az Agboti, Prof. Onyenji, Prof. Uzodinma Nwala, Chief Onyema Ugochukwu, Maj. Gen. Collins Ihekire (retd), Maj. Gen. Godwin Ugwuoke (retd), Dr. Joe Nworgu and Chief Onyemauche Nnamani.\n\nIn an 11-point communiqu\u00e9, the leaders said their demand was predicated on the fact that the zone had not produced a president in Nigeria, except for only six months, adding that \u201cIt has also not produced an elected Prime Minister or President since Nigerian Independence in 1960.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cThe South East has suffered monumental marginalisation of the zone since after the civil war.

Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cThe South East leaders noted that Nigeria has a zoning and rotational culture for the presidency of Nigeria. This agreement on rotational presidency was reached at the 1995 Constitutional Conference. That rotation favours Southern Nigeria at the end of Gen. Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tenure in 2023. When that presidency rotates to southern Nigeria, the zone that most deserves it is the South East, as other zones have occupied the seat before.\u201d\n\nThe Igbo leaders said a president from the South East would usher in unity, peace and progress in Nigeria and guarantee the cessation of agitation by youths for the breakup of the country.\n\nThey charged citizens of the zone across all parties to work in unity to achieve the objective of a South East presidency in 2023.\n\nIwuanyanwu recalled all the efforts and contributions of Ndigbo and their sacrifices for the unity of Nigeria and called on other Nigerians to obey and honour the unwritten agreement on the rotation of the presidency.\n\nSenator Ben Obi said the main aim of presenting the South East case, was to passionately appeal to Nigerian citizens, to support their quest to produce the next Nigerian President in 2023.",

          "text": "\u2022Accuses Citibank of falsifying documents\n\nUdora Orizu and Juliet Akoje\n\n\n\n\n\nThe House of Representatives Ad-Hoc Committee on the recovery of N1.2 trillion unclaimed funds in commercial banks; Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of government; and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) said it had discovered over N300 billion since the beginning of its investigation. Chairman of the committee, Unyime Idem (PDP, Akwa Ibom) disclosed this yesterday after a session with Citibank.\n\nIn a related development, the House Committee on Public Accounts on Tuesday demanded documentary evidence of assets imported by MTN, which amounted to the total sum of N2.6 trillion capital allowances collected by the telco from the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS). Chairman of the committee, Hon. Wole Oke, made the demand during an investigative hearing on the audit queries issued by the office of Auditor General of the Federation (oAuGF) following allegations of tax evasion.\n\nIdem stressed that the committee was mandated, after a resolution of the House on January 26, to investigate and recover the N1.2 trillion due to the federal government that was trapped in commercial banks, MDAs, and other places. He said the trapped funds were in dormant bank accounts in domestic and foreign currencies, accounts without Bank Verification Number (BVN), failed contracts, and excess unremitted funds.\n\nDuring the investigative hearing, the lawmakers alleged that Citibank owed the federal government N99 billion from accumulated failed transactions and hanging funds.\n\nIdem stressed, \u201cA situation where we have been borrowing money to fund major capital projects while we can get such within is unacceptable. So far we have discovered N300 billion, which is just a little percentage of what we are trying to recover.\u201d\n\nHe said the committee was still studying documents and reports sent to it by banks and government agencies, adding that this would help the committee to recover more funds.\n\nAccording to Idem, \u201cThe commercial banks are regulated by government and they cannot refuse us. This assignment is crucial. We will not allow any government agency or commercial bank to undermine our power.\n\n\u201cIf the commercial banks fail to appear, the next line of action will be to summon.\u201d\n\nMembers of the adhoc committee had raised the alarm over the differences in the documents submitted by Citibank, which showed dissimilar figures and number of customers from the previous documents submitted by the bank.\n\nHon. Mohammed Bio alleged that the action of the bank was criminal and insisted that the representative of the financial institution should be put on oath to explain the difference.\n\nBio stated, \u201cThey (Citi bank) had earlier submitted an account record of customers without BVN with a number of 11 people with huge sums of money but today they made another submission on the content but the figures and number of customers stood at seven, with just little money to their names, which makes it curious.\n\n\u201cWhat are they trying to hide or could this be an afterthought that they had to bring this new documents.\u201d\n\nResponding to the lawmakers\u2019 queries, Executive Director, Operations and Technology, Citibank, Mrs. Ngozi Omokeme, who represented the bank, said the financial institution had nothing to hide and the documents submitted were not falsified.\n\n\u201cWith all due respect, we are not here to change any documents,\u201d Omokeme said, adding, \u201cAlso, I am not here to falsify any documents. The documents are consistently the same.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the House Committee on Public Accounts demanded evidence from MTN to justify N2.6 trillion capital allowances it collected from FIRS.\n\nThe chairman of the committee, however, acknowledged the communication sent by MTN\u2019s accounting officer, which was delivered by a delegation led by its Head, Public Affairs, Mr. Anas Galadima.\n\nThe letter read, in part, \u201cWe refer to your letter on the above subject matter dated March 24, 2022 inviting us to furnish the House of Representatives Public Account Committee with additional documents on or before Tuesday, March 29, 2022 and appear before the committee on Wednesday, March 30th, 2022.\n\n\u201cWe are currently reviewing the content of the letter and require more time. In this regard, we therefore request for your kind consideration to revert to the committee on April, with our position.\u201d\n\nThe committee chairman expressed concern over the misgivings surrounding the investigative hearing on the alleged tax evasion by MTN, but assured the company and all the stakeholders that the committee had no intention of witch-hunting anyone.\n\nOke said, \u201cLet me state very clearly why we invited MTN. We invited MTN based on the infractions spotted by the office of the Auditor General of the Federation on non-presentation, evaluation of certificates of acceptance of capital allowances. That is the query issued by the Auditor General of the Federation.\n\n\u201cIf you are not a financial person, you may not know or understand the implications. I want to clear this so that there is no ambiguity over the presentation in any medium of media platform.\n\n\u201cWe are investigating tax evasion; tax evasion is possible through abuse of fiscal regulations. The committee has not come to conclusion to say that MTN has evaded payment of taxes.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Industry came here, made submission. MTN also made submission; they have claimed total capital allowances from inception to date up to N2.6 trillion. So the question we are asking Federal Ministry of Industry is to adduce records, evidence that they inspected their (MTN) assets based on which they issued the certificates, which MTN has taken to FIRS to secure tax rebate.\n\n\u201cIt is expected of the Federal Ministry of Industry to have inspected the assets before they issue the certificates. If the ministry is in default, then we might be thinking of collusion between the beneficiary of the certificate and Federal Ministry of Industry, which will amount to undermining Nigeria; which will amount to loss of revenue.\u201d\n\nHe said further, \u201cWe also asked for proof, the dates because you cannot enter MTN premises without records. The assets claimed by MTN can be categorised into two: you have the local content and you have the foreign content. We have written Nigeria Customs to give us records of the imports, the assets imported by MTN and proof of duty payment. Because if they (MTN) don\u2019t pay the duty as expected, it also amounts to loss of revenue to the federation.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Amid the crisis rocking the industry, telecommunication operators, including Globacom, Airtel, MTN and others, have threatened to raise tariffs within seven days if the Nigerian government does not find a solution.\n\nThe position of the companies was made known by Gbenga Adebayo, the Chairman of the Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), during a press briefing on Thursday.\n\n\n\nAdebayo highlighted the seizure of cellular sites in Kogi, concerns about degrading quality of services in Abuja, high cost of diesel, inflation and safety of telecom workers as part of the issues presently bedevilling the telecoms industry.\n\nAccording to him, over 70 sites within Kogi State and environs have shut down causing members' inability to access and maintain them amid the disputes arising from taxes and levies demanded by the Kogi State Government through the Kogi State Internal Revenue Service (KIRS).\n\n\u201cThe action by KIRS was hinged on an ex parte court order obtained by the KIRS over unsubstantiated allegations that our members are in default of tax payments to the state government (which is not the truth) and access to these critical telecom sites has been denied.\n\n\u201cThis issue is likely to lead to a total communications blackout in the entire Kogi State, parts of Abuja the Federal Capital Territory and possible impact on service availability in some parts of the following States: Nassarawa, Benue, Enugu, Anambra, Edo, Ondo, Ekiti, Kwara, Niger States.\n\n\u201cThese are states sharing borders with Kogi State,\u201d the ALTON\u2019s chairman, who also doubles as the joint spokesman for all the telecom operators, said.\n\nHe also said the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA), the office of the Director for Signage and Advertisement had refused to grant telecommunication service providers a permit to build infrastructure in the Federal Capital City.\n\nThis, he said, was affecting the quality of services around FCT and Abuja.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe problem is created by the governing authorities in the FCT. Telecommunications services drive on the terrestrial infrastructure. We hereby call on the Federal Executive Council to prevail on the FCDA in granting approval/permit to our members to deploy infrastructure.\n\n\u201cALTON and its members will no longer tolerate discriminatory charges against the sector. The industry is planning to begin a study on varying tariffs to some of the unfriendly telecommunications states in other to accommodate their demand.\u201d\n\nALTON also expressed concerns about the rising cost of diesel and its implications on the general high cost of business.\n\nAdebayo said, \u201cWe are concerned that unless there is an intervention to save this sector, operators will have no choice but to begin a process of price review.\n\n\u201cThe state of security in our country is of concern, while we commend all our security agencies for the work they do to keep us all safe, the impact of the general state of security in the country is that we are not able to provide 24/7 support in certain areas as it is unsafe to send out service personnel to some parts of the country and at certain times of the day.\u201d",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal is set to launch a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Ire Aderinokun is helping to shape Helicarrier's culture",
          "text": "The search for remote work has increased by 490% since the beginning of the pandemic. This means more companies, including big tech ones, have had to move their operations online.\n\nRemote work comes with its own advantages including a reduction in overhead costs with this Stanford report stating that companies can save between $2,000 to $11,000 per employee when they switch to remote work.\n\nIt also expands a company\u2019s reach and allows them to employ global talent, as well as expand to other regions and markets. In 2021, there were a number of product/market expansions on the continent that were fueled by raises and eased by remote work options. This includes Zuri Health\u2019s expansion into Senegal, MarketForce\u2019s entry into Tanzania, Uganda, Ghana and Ethiopia, and even Mono\u2019s expansion into Ghana.\n\nRemote work, however, comes with its own disadvantages including decreased work/life balance, decreased employee visibility, a lack of team synergy, all of which can lead to harmful or stoic work culture.\n\nSo, how can founders, managers, and team leads build remote teams with healthy and sustainable cultures? How can companies manage distributed teams during their growth phase?\n\nIre Aderinokun, COO and VP, Engineering, at Helicarrier has a few answers. In the eighth episode of TechCabal\u2019s Building From Ground Up, Aderinokun speaks to TechCabal\u2019s Managing Editor Koromone Koroye and shares how she\u2019s helping Helicarrier manage its remote team.\n\nFounded in 2017 by Timi Ajiboye, Tomiwa Lasebikan and Ire Aderinokun, Helicarrier was originally Bitkoin Africa, a website for peer-to-peer (P2P) Bitcoin trading. Upon getting into Y Combinator in 2018, Bitkoin Africa morphed into BuyCoins with a number of product offerings including crypto trading. Last year, the trio created Helicarrier as the parent company to house all its products including BuyCoins, Sendcash, Sendcash Pay, and more.\n\nTomiwa Lasebikan, Ire Aderinokun, and Timi Ajiboye at Y Combinator in 2018\n\nWhile the team started with just 5 members, it quickly grew to 10 in its first year. Now, 5 years after launch, Helicarrier boasts of over 50 employees across 4 countries, all of whom are fully remote. So how does Aderinokun, whose office handles operations and staffing, manage her distributed team?\n\nUsing tools to build trust\n\nFor Aderinokun who studied psychology but ended up a software engineer, one of the most important ways Helicarrier has managed its remote team is by using no-code tools everyone can easily learn.\n\n\u201cWe rely a lot on the tools we use. Basecamp is our primary project management tool, and it allows us to keep track of what everyone is doing. But it also allows us to build trust,\u201d Aderinokun said.\n\nHelicarrier operates an asynchronous work structure. A synchronous work mode means that everyone is working simultaneously, and tasks or comments are responded to in real-time and without delay. It\u2019s the method employed by most companies globally. An asynchronous work structure, on the other hand, does not require all hands to work at the same time. This structure allows employees to maximise productivity by working when it best suits them, within reason of course.\n\n\u201cHaving an asynchronous work structure only really works when you have trust in the team, and enabling our team with tools has helped us do just that.\u201d\n\nFor a distributed remote team like Helicarrier\u2019s, asynchronous work also helps to address the difference in time zones. While most of Aderinokun\u2019s team is based in Lagos, Nigeria, a few are based in Ghana, Kenya, and even the UK.\n\n\u201cWe do have a working day, 10 AM to 5 PM and any team meetings we have are usually within this period. But we\u2019re not particular about when people get things done. If someone wants to do 4 hours of work in the middle of the night, that\u2019s fine with us. As long as you\u2019re achieving the set goals, you can work on your own time.\u201d\n\nAccording to Aderinokun, Helicarrier also tries to be sensitive toward its employees\u2019 needs. The company pays its employees dollar stable coins and also pays for daily lunches and internet subscriptions.\n\n\u201cFor our Nigerian-based staff, this helps keep them above water with the increasing inflation rate. It also helps the team understand our vision and value. We\u2019re a crypto company, paying our employees in crypto.\u201d\n\nSmall teams mean tighter bonds\n\nPaying salaries in crypto is not the only unconventional thing Helicarrier does.\n\nUpon hiring new team members, the company offers a one-month paid trial period that helps both employer and employee see if there\u2019s a culture fit. \u201cWith this method, they can see how we work and stay if they\u2019re comfortable. We\u2019ll also get to measure their skills up,\u201d Aderinokun said.\n\nOn building and maintaining company culture, Aderinokun states that most of the team members have direct relationships with 2 of the 3 co-founders.\n\n\u201cEven as we grow, one of the ways we install the company culture is by building direct relationships. So, everyone on the team works directly under one of the 3 co-founders. But we\u2019ve created a system where all team members can have a relationship with another co-founder they don\u2019t work under.\u201d\n\nBecause Helicarrier is still a small team of 50, its solution is feasible. As more team members get hired, though, Aderinokun believes that the team will have to find a sustainable method.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Andela expands its tech talent pool beyond software engineers",
          "text": "To date, Andela has helped companies build their remote engineering teams by giving them access to vetted software engineers from over 100 countries, counting among its clientele leading companies like GitHub, Goldman Sachs, and Cloudflare.\n\nBut on Wednesday, the global talent company said it is expanding its offering beyond engineering talent to include matching in new practice areas: specifically design, data, and product management.\n\n\u201cHaving worked across the continent and beyond, we know that the tech ecosystem does not just need only engineering talent,\u201d Agnes Muthoni, Director of the Andela Learning Community, said on the move. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare that software engineers work entirely independently. It takes a variety of skill sets and expertise to make technical solutions that work.\u201d\n\nThe onboarding process for the new set of technical talent will be similar to Andela\u2019s existing model, consisting of English language and soft-skills assessments, technical assessments, and a portfolio review. But within the latter two, there will be some variance.\n\n\u201cWhere a software engineer will typically complete a coding challenge and peer code review, a designer may complete a project or do a portfolio walk-through and critique,\u201d Muthoni told TechCabal in an interview.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe expansion of Andela\u2019s offering coincides with the launch of its new platform for talent matching, which the company says is designed to create a \u201cmore direct and personalised hiring experience\u201d for both talent and recruiters.\n\nTill now, Andela has employed a hands-on matching process to help clients scale their technical team, which involves sifting through resumes and screening calls, and typically takes several weeks to complete.\n\nCompanies now have the option of using the self-service platform which, according to Andela, cuts down the hiring lifecycle for hiring managers and recruiters to as little as 48 hours.\n\n\u201cThe need to build scalable teams that can grow together when miles apart is increasingly apparent. Using the platform, hiring managers can find and hire their ideal candidate in two days or in less than two weeks, 70% faster than traditional in-house recruitment,\u201d Muthoni said.\n\nAndela\u2019s new website.\n\nHiring managers simply have to create a company profile, post a job, and can see curated and vetted candidates instantly. Talents can also see how well their skills match up to roles, with both parties having access to visualise compatibility, including overlap in skills and preferences.\n\n\u201cEach assessment and onboarding path gives a better indication of the kinds of teams they will be successful in,\u201d Muthoni said. \u201cTechnologists only need to test once instead of for each client or role, allowing hiring managers to focus on team fit instead of skills reviews. It simplifies the time commitment on both sides and increases the likelihood of a successful match.\u201d\n\nAccording to Andela, the matching accounts for depth and breadth of skill requirements, timezone and working hour overlaps, industry expertise, and team fit. In addition, the platform uses data-driven technology and algorithms to make smart match recommendations.\n\n\u201cThe Andela platform is constantly learning, helping to refine its personalised recommendations. As users accept or reject recommendations, they are also asked for specific feedback. With each bit of feedback, the platform becomes more personalised,\u201d the company explained in an official statement.\n\nWhen it comes to platforms, personalisation has become a \u201cbasic expectation\u201d, notes Jeremy Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Andela.\n\n\u201cAmazon, Apple, and Netflix have changed every aspect of our lives\u2014from how we shop to how we consume culture and everything in between. This is why we\u2019ve built our new platform\u2014to help talent find jobs that match their technical skills and careers that match their lives,\u201d he said.\n\nOn whether Andela plans to phase out its initial model permanently, Muthoni noted that there will always be a need for a hands-on human-first matching process with the self-service platform launched only to give clients an option that helps them move through the recruitment cycle quickly.\n\n\u201cWhat this means is Andela\u2019s clients can now choose their preferred service \u2013 the existing white-glove hands-on supported approach or rapid self-service through their new platform.\u201d\n\nAlongside its expanded offerings and new platform, Andela has also unveiled a new brand identity meant to \u201cbetter reflect the evolution of both the company as well as the global talent industry that it has helped to spawn.\u201d\n\nThese announcements come 6 months after Andela closed a $200 million Series E. The round\u2014led by Softbank Vision Fund 2, the venture capital arm of Japanese conglomerate SoftBank\u2014valued the company at $1.5 billion, cementing its place as one of Africa\u2019s unicorn startups.\n\nLaunched in Nigeria in 2014, Andela started as an African-focused software developer training and outsourcing company. Notorious for being harder to get into than Harvard, Andela grew to become a premier source for talented, well-rounded developers in Africa thanks to its curriculum and developer training methodology.\n\nThrough its Andela Learning Community, it claims to have provided training and career opportunities for over 175,000 engineers globally at different stages of their careers.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nOsun state governor, Mr. Adegboyega Oyetola, on Thursday announced the upgrade of the state College of Education, Ilesa, to a full-fledged university.\n\nHe said the decision was arrived on after painstakingly and carefully examining the request made by prominent sons and daughters of Ijesaland to that effect.\n\n\u201cLet me say that, having looked into and examined carefully the request made by prominent sons and daughters of Ijesa Land, and the Owa, our highly-revered Royal Father, His Imperial Majesty, Owa Obokun Adimula of Ijesaland, Oba (Dr.) Gabriel Aromolaran, Government has decided to upgrade the Osun College of Education, Ilesa, to a full-fledged University,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have also engaged one of the nation\u2019s best corporate Consultants, KPMG, to work out the sustainability plan of the upgrade\u201d, he said.\n\nThis is even as the Governor inaugurated the Ijesa community funded Geriatric Centre.\n\nThe newly-inaugurated Geriatric Centre was funded and built by prominent Ijasa sons and daughters.\n\nInaugurating the Centre, which is a product of the magnanimity of the Ijesa people through the Ijesa Health is Wealth Project, Governor Oyetola noted that the initiative was another testament to the generosity and abiding passion of the great Ijesa people to add value to the lives of the people.\n\nHe said the gesture would go a long way to complement his administration\u2019s sustained investment in the health sector as government has devoted unprecedented attention to revitalizing the health sector in the last three years.\n\nAccording to him, the concerted development has given birth to the revitalisation of 332 primary health centres across all the wards in the state, improved welfare of medical workers, construction of a 120-bed ward, construction of 30 units of doctors\u2019 quarters at the State Specialist Hospital, Asubiaro, Osogbo, among others.\n\nOyetola, who noted that his Administration has successfully put Osun on the world map of quality healthcare provision, said, \u201cThis is an intervention that other well-meaning indigenous groups should emulate and be counted to become frontline contributors to the development of our State\u201d\n\nGovernor Oyetola expressed gratitude to the sons and daughters of Ijesaland for their unflinching support in general and for contributing significantly to the development of the State.\n\nHe said the newly- inaugurated health facility would further help to bring quality healthcare service delivery to the people.\n\n\u201cConsidering our nation\u2019s growing aged population and the absence of the requisite medical care for our senior citizens, this project is certainly excellently well-thought-out and has definitely come to fill a much-needed void.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the Ijesa Geriatric Centre is a welcome development as it brings closer to our people a specialised geriatric care. This is against the background of the truism that being old is not a disease and that senior citizens have a right to medical care as indeed the younger population.\n\n\u201cRealising their invaluable role in the development of the society, our senior citizens should deservedly be treated with warmth, utmost respect and be provided a truly-enabling environment where they can interact with healthcare professionals with dignity.\n\n\u201cDoing so is instructive, as it shows that our senior citizens are valued for their contributions to the development of our society. This is the need that this Geriatric Center has come to fill, and we cannot thank you enough for making it possible, only ten months after its construction was commenced.\n\n\u201cWorth a billion Naira, this Centre is an expansive facility that comprises the general outpatient building, administrative building, ophthalmology and dental building, physiotherapy, theatre complex, inward among other essential facilities that will provide the best of medical care for our senior citizens.\n\n\u201cI consider this project absolutely complementary to our administration\u2019s sustained investment in the health sector. You will recall that in the last three years plus of our administration, we have devoted unprecedented attention to revitalizing our health sector\u201d, he added.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Owa Obokun of Ijesaland, Oba Gabriel Adekunle Aromolaran, thanked all illustrious and eminent Ijesa people both home and in the diaspora for the initiative, support, commitment and the degree of responsiveness to the developmental agenda of Ijesaland.\n\nAccording to the reverred monarch, the project has once again attested to the commitment of Ijesa people to igniting the contagious relentless efforts towards breaking the paradigm for community development.\n\nOba Aromolaran, who commended Governor Oyetola for his tremendous achievements in the various sectors of the economy, said it was a thing of joy that the new health facility was constructed to complement his monumental strides in the health sector.\n\n\u201cIt is noteworthy to openly declare that the primary concern of the entire Ijesa people through the Ijesa Community Development Assembly is the smooth, efficient, effective and prudent management of the Ijesaland Geriatric Centre and where necessary the people of Ijesa would always provide complementary support for the sustainability of effective service delivery to the elderly people\u201d, the monarch added.\n\nAlso speaking, the Asiwaju of Ijesaland, Olayinka Fasuyi, expressed gratitude to the the sons and daughters of Ijesaland for the successful actualisation of the project.\n\nHe attributed the success of the project to the timely support and donations from the people of Ijesaland saying, \u201cthe meeting we held yielded bountiful results as we were able to put in a number of strategies to finally arrive at a total cost of the project.\n\n\u201cStrategizing and Mobilising funds for the project implementation have been the most harrowing challenge imaginable. Indeed, it is better imagined than experienced.\n\n\u201cIt is important to salute the unparalleled commitment and dexterity of the Ijesa to their community development as generously demonstrated in these last two projects black-to-back.\n\n\u201cToday, Ijesaland has successfully built and delivered the second geriatric centre in the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate you for heeding our age-old prayers of upgrading the 44-year-old College of Education, Ilesa, to a full fledged University.\n\n\u201cMr. Governor, You have honoured us, God will continue to honour you. You have listened to our requests and our overdue agitations. God will not forsake you. You have rekindled our hope as Ijesa people and you have made us proud with this declaration. You shall continue to be celebrated. I want to assure you that Ijesaland shall vote massively beyond your imagination in return of your kind gesture to us. It is only God in His infinity that will compensate you, \u201c he noted.",

          "title": "NURTW stakeholders, TOOAN call for calm, say loyalty to Tinubu, Sanwo-Olu not negotiable",
          "text": "Adebayo Obajemu\n\nThe leadership of the Tricycles Owners and Operators Association of Nigeria (TOOAN) and principal officers of National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), in a press conference, Thursday, said the Union and all its affiliates, under Lagos State chapter, are fiercely loyal to the Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu presidential bid and the re-election of Governor Babajide Sanwoolu as Lagos State Governor.\n\nThe leaders who gathered to offer their solidarity for Asiwaju for 2023 include, Alhaji Rafiu Akanni Olohunwa, former Chairman NURTW, Lagos Council, Comrd. Seyi Bankole, Secretary NURTW, Lagos State , Alh. Muritala Lawal(Epo) former Chairman TOOAN Lagos Council, BOT TOOAN other top NURTW leaders, all promising to mobilise their grassroot support base for the realisation of the presidential ambition of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu in 2023 General Election and that of Governor Babajide Sanwoolu\u2019s second term bid come 2023\n\nThey also restated their commitment to the continued existence of the NURTW in Lagos state, insisting that they are never part of any body or group calling for the dissolution of NURTW in the state.\n\nThe leaders used the occasion to offer their support for Chairmanship of Alh. Abiola Azeez, Istijabah as the TOOAN Lagos State Chairman.\n\nAccording to them, Asiwaju Tinubu more than any other candidate deserves the support of Nigerians because of his sterling contribution to national development, his modernisation policies while he was Lagos State Governor;and his perspicacity and nose for picking his successors in the state.\n\nSpeaking to all the members of the association across Lagos state, Alh. Abiola Azeez, Istijabah, Lagos State Chairman TOOAN, stated that the association under his administration has pledged total support to the administration of Babajide Sanwoolu of Lagos State, adding that the tricycles association would back his second term bid , declaring that their support for Tinubu, Sanwoolu was not negotiable.\n\nHe further reiterated that the association was doing well in the state, saying \u201cWe are doing a Union job and we will continue to do the union job.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t know about the value of the union then you are not part of us . Nobody can drive us away from the job.\n\nAlhaji Istijabah assured members to be calm, saying that the current crisis would soon be resolved, while pledging his loyalty to Alhaji Ibikunle Baruwa, National President of the National Union of Road Transport Association of Nigeria.\n\nHe said that those behind the contrived crisis in the state are not God , adding that those who God can not arrest, He has not created. Nobody can take away our job. He urged everyone to be calm. He said some people have decided to pull out of the union, \u201chaving eaten too much, and are not ready to abide by the regulation of the national body; but on our own at TOOAN, we are still with the national body.\n\nIstijabah while stating reasons why TOOAN and NURTW are offering support for the reelection of Sanwoolu in Lagos State disclosed that the administration\u2019s commitment to road rehabilitation and construction, improved welfare of the people in the state, containment of the Covid-19 in Lagos state as well as the recent release of over 500 mini buses and 1000 new GAC cars to ensure efficient intra-city transportation and employment creations in the state , are some of the reasons why he should be considered for reelection in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cSanwoolu has done well, his administration is a good one, he has done well in road construction. I heard recently that some unions said they will not support Sanwoolu\u2019s second term, but TOOAN and NURTW are ready to support him. He has done well.\n\nLagos Alhaji Rafiu Olorunwa also at the press briefing called for calm, while tracing the genesis of the crisis to Alhaji Musiliu Akinsanya\u2019s unwillingness to abide by the arbitration of the national headquarters of the NURTW, and instead declared that he had pulled out Lagos chapter from the national body.\n\nComrade Bankole Oluwaseni, the state secretary of NURTW further shed light on the position of Olorunwa, he stated that the whole issue was between Alhaji Akinsanya and the Board of Trustees of TOOAN.\n\nAccording to him, Akinsanya was imposing his own people who were not members of the tricycles association on TOOAN, while the authentic members and founding members were shut out of the affairs.\n\nIt was the intervention of the national headquarters that weighed in, according to the Lagos State NURTW Secretary , the directive from Baruwa ordered Akinsanya to allow Alhaji Istijabah to run the Lagos chapter of TOOAN, but Akinsanya refused, an action that informed his suspension by the national headquarters.\n\nMany who spoke at the press conference said the appointment of the new state chairman of TOAN was the problem. Oluomo, they said was not ready to countenance Alhaji Istijabah and series of meetings convened by Baruwa -led national body to iron out the differences failed as a result of the alleged intransigence of Alhaji Musiliu Akinsanya, MC Oluomo.\n\n\u201dBefore the administration of Akinsanya, it was learnt that the Board of Trustees of TOOAN normally nominated their chairman. He said, \u201cWe have the state chairman of NURTW, and also there\u2019s the state chairman of TOOAN.\n\n\u201cIt is the Board of Trustees of TOOAN that was always in charge of the nomination of chairman, and not even the headquarters. It was when Akinsanya was imposing his will on us that we decided to petition the national headquarters\u201d, Oluwaseyi said.\n\nOn his part, Comrade Muritala Lawal, Epo, former Lagos State Chairman of TOOAN, said that, as the pioneer Chairman of TOOAN in Lagos state, the leadership of the association as an affiliate of NURTW stands with authentic leadership of the NURTW in Lagos state.\n\nHe noted that the Association is never in support of anyone or group who would want to destroy the success of the association since it was created. He further said that since such a person had been suspended there is no need for the state government to continue to take him seriously.\n\nHe said TOOAN joined NURTW after a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with the NURTW. He noted that this coordination was prompted by the policy of the government to encourage cohesion among road transport unions in the state.",

          "text": "After five years of legal brawl, a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja Thursday discharged and acquitted Andrew Yakubu, a former Group Managing Director (GMD) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) of $9.8 million money laundering charges.\n\nJustice Ahmed Mohammed gave the verdict while delivering judgement in the alleged fraud- related matter that had spanned years of legal scuffle between the prosecution and Yakubu\u2019s defence team.\n\nBy the development, the trial court has finally acquitted Yakubu on the two remaining charges slammed against him.\n\nBlueprint earlier reported that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), had in 2017 stormed Yakubu\u2019s residence at Sabon Tasha in Kaduna where $9.8 million was found and seized from him.\n\nThe cash allegedly found after the operation, according to the anti-graft agency, was $9,772, 800 and \u00a374,000 neatly kept in a safe.\n\nConsequently, on the 16th, March 2017, the agency slammed a six-count charge bordering on money laundering and other offences against Yakubu.\n\nThe ex-NNPC helmsman was thereafter docked before Justice Mohammed of the Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nWhile ruling on a no-case submission filed by the defendant, the Court of Appeal dismissed the other four charges leaving counts 3 and 4.\n\nThe verdict\n\nDelivering his judgement, Justice Mohammed described Yakubu\u2019s evidence as credible and reliable, declaring that the prosecution failed to establish the necessary ingredients of the charges to warrant his conviction.\n\n\u201cThe evidence of the defendant (Yakubu) was not only credible but reliable,\u201d the judge said, adding, \u201cthe prosecution failed to contradict the evidence as required by law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe EFCC ought to have investigated Yakubu\u2019s claims that the monetary gifts found in his home came from his friends, but unfortunately for reasons best known to it, the prosecution did not do that,\u201d the judge said.\n\n\u201cTo worsen the situation, the prosecution assumed that the money was accepted in one fell swoop as against the evidence of the defendant that he got the money in piecemeal as gifts from his friends when he retired from service in 2014.\n\n\u201cIt is a huge error that the prosecution did not tender the money as Exhibit throughout the trial, but made futile efforts after it had closed its case,\u201d the judge noted further.\n\n\u201cIn all, Yakubu\u2019s evidence cast a huge doubt on that of the EFCC and the doubt must be resolved in his favour,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nThe judge also agreed with the defence that the funds were received as gifts in aggregate form and not as a \u201cwhole\u201d that could have offended the Money Laundering Prohibition Act of 2011.\n\nThe trial judge equally dismissed the EFCC\u2019s claims that the funds were proceeds of crime for not going through a financial institution.\n\nConsequently, the trial judge ordered the immediate refund of the confiscated sum of $9,772, 800 and \u00a374, 000 to the defendant.\n\nThe trial\n\nOn March 16, 2017 specifically, the EFCC brought Yakubu before the court on six counts of money laundering and related offences.\n\nAfter calling its seventh prosecution witness, Suleiman Mohammed, an operative with the commission, the prosecution closed his case on October 17, 2018.\n\nHowever, while also delivering ruling on the matter on May 16, 2019, the Judge struck out two of the counts.\n\nBut dissatisfied with the refusal of the court to dismiss all the counts, the defendant proceeded to the Court of Appeal.\n\nOn April 24, 2020, the Court of Appeal in Abuja also struck out two additional counts, asking the defendant to defend only counts 3 and 4.\n\nThe two counts upon which judgement was delivered on Thursday was pegged at the defendant\u2019s inability to make full disclosure of assets to EFCC upon his arrest, receiving cash without going through a financial institution in alleged violation of Section 1(1) of the Money Laundering Act, 2011 and punishable under Section 16(2) (b) of the Act.\n\nSubsequently, the Federal High Court had on June 17, 2021,threw out request for the amendment of the charges, insisting that granting the application would amount to breaching the decision of the Court of Appeal that had specified the charges on which the defendant should be tried on.\n\nYakubu had earlier denied the charges while testifying for himself as a defence witness in the case.\n\nThe defendant insisted that the money seized from his home was an accumulation of gifts he received at different times after leaving office.\n\nEFCC moves to appeal\n\nResponding to the judgement, the EFCC said it would go on appeal, insisting the trial judge erred in discharging the former NNPC boss.\n\nEFCC Head, Media & Publicity, Wilson Uwujaren, made the commission\u2019s position know in a statement Thursday in Abuja.\n\nThe agency said: \u201cHe had pleaded not guilty upon arraignment. In the course of trial, the commission called witnesses and tendered documents in evidence, but the defendant filed a no case submission. Based on the submission, the court struck out two of the six counts.\n\n\u201cTwo further counts were chalked off upon appeal by the defendant while the appellate court ordered his continued trial on the remaining two counts.\u201d\n\n\u201cDelivering judgment today, Justice Mohammed held that the prosecution failed to prove the ingredient of the offence beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n\u201cHe held that the Commission ought to have investigated the defendant\u2019s claims that the monetary gifts he claimed to have received came from his friends, and tender the recovered cash before the court.\n\n\u201cConsequently, he discharged and acquitted the defendant; however, the commission believes the trial judge erred in dismissing the charge and has resolved to test the ruling at the appellate court,\u201d Uwujaren said.",

          "text": "Kaduna state Governor Nasir El Rufai has admitted the Nigerian authorities know the camps, the identities and listen to the conversations of the armed groups terrorising large swaths of the North-west region.\n\nThe governor spoke after some terrorists ambushed and attacked a Kaduna bound train coming from Abuja Monday evening.\n\nAt least eight people were killed during the attack which lasted for almost two hours.\n\nSeveral passengers sustained gunshot injuries while a yet-to-be determined number of people were kidnapped by the gunmen.\n\nEl-Rufai was speaking at an event attended by the transportation minister, Rotimi Amaechi, to update Nigerians on what the government was doing to stem the tide of banditry in the state after Monday\u2019s deadly attack.\n\nThe governor explained why the military has not bombed the bandits despite knowing their whereabouts and listening to their conversations.\n\n\u201cWe know where their camps are. We know their camps, we have the maps; we know everything. We have their phone numbers and listen to their conversation sometimes. But it has to be done across the five states,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor explained the military was originally reluctant to bomb the camps of the bandits to avoid civilian collateral damage, adding however that since a Nigerian court has declared them terrorists, the rule of engagement has changed.\n\n\u201cThis is war,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe know what they (terrorists) are planning. We get the reports. The problem is for the agencies to take action. Don\u2019t wait until they attack before you respond. The Army should go after their enclaves to wipe them out. Let the Air Force bomb them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe visibly angry governor lamented that despite the fact that the Department of State Service (DSS) has informants all over the place sourcing information for the service, such attacks still happened.\n\nWarns against late evening shuttle\n\nGovernor El-Rufai also said the attack could have been avoided if the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) had listened to his warning to end late evening shuttles.\n\nHe said the state Security Council wrote twice to the NRC on the possibility of suspending the night time shuttle, but the NRC did not listen.\n\n\u201cThe last train from Kaduna to Abuja should leave by 4 p.m. so that it will get to Abuja in daylight,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf anything is to happen, the response time will be quick, maybe in 30 minutes. When something happens, the response time will be faster in the daytime,\u201d the governor said.\n\nThe managing director of the NRC, Fidet Okhiria, confirmed that the state government warned the corporation.\n\n\u201cThey wrote to us; they suspected they wanted to attack the train, but that was in December/January. But we looked at it and said if there is something like that, they should find a solution to it and stopping the train is not the solution.\n\n\u201cAnd we don\u2019t run night train. The last train leaves in the evening. We believe if we stop the running of trains, it means the terrorists have won,\u201d the MD told Daily Trust.\n\nSource: Premium Times\n\n\u2018No bandits\u2019 barricade on Kaduna-Abuja road\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, the Kaduna state government has debunked rumours that bandits Thursday barricaded a portion of Kaduna-Abuja highway.\n\nCommissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan stated this in Kaduna.\n\nHe said \u201cA few hours ago, some panic was spread on social media over bandits barricading the Kaduna-Abuja Road and kidnapping citizens plying the route.\n\n\u201cThe buzz in circulation is false and was presented by a group of social media enthusiasts who celebrate negative news.\n\n\u201cThe preliminary operational feedback showed that fleeing bandits escaping a military onslaught attempted to pass through a narrow corridor around Kasarami general area of Kaduna-Abuja road.\n\n\u201cThe troops, on receiving this intelligence, hurriedly moved to the location and engaged them in the adjoining forest.\n\n\u201cThe Kaduna state government will update members of the general public when more detailed feedback is received. The Kaduna state government does not deny the existence of security challenges, and continues to work assiduously with relevant military and security agencies.\u201d",
