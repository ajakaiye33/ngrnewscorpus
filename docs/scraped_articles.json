          "title": "Retrenchment protest: We will vehemently oppose victimisation, says Kaduna NLC chairman",
          "text": "In this interview, Ayuba Suleiman, the Chairman of the Kaduna State Chapter of the Nigeria Labour Congress, speaks to ABDULLAHI SULEJA on issues ranging from labour\u2019s position on the sacked civil servants in the state, and why judiciary, Houses of Assembly and local government\n\nautonomy is vital to good governance\n\nHow are you handling the issue of sacked civil servants in Kaduna State?\n\nWe have discussed a lot about it and as I am talking to you now we have reached an agreement with the Kaduna State Government under the reconciliation of the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, and because of the Memorandum of Understanding that we signed alongside with our national leadership, we don\u2019t want to say much about the issue at the moment, because it is a matter that will be taken care of by our national secretariat under the leadership of our amiable President, Ayuba Wabba. As such, I will reserve my comments on that for now.\n\nThere are speculations that there is a policy put in place by the state government to compulsory retire civil servants of 50 years and above with special emphasis on nurses from grade level 14 and above. What is your take on this?\n\nIt was part of what we discussed recently during our meeting with the Minister of Labour and Employment and our state government under the leadership of Mallam Nasir El-Rufai. I told you earlier on that I didn\u2019t want to make comments or debunk those allegations. The MoU that we signed is still what we are looking upon. The state government said the issue you mentioned was just an allegation and it debunked it.\n\nThere\u2019s also the issue of the state wanting to sack civil servants across all sectors. How true is this?\n\nIt is part of the victimisation that I am talking about and we have opposed it. We totally reject that and as a state council under the leadership of our national body, we will not take it. We knew even before the industrial strike, which we recently embarked upon, that the state government made a pronouncement that it would dismiss all nurses from grade level 14 and above. We also heard that a good number of academic and non-academic staff members of the Kaduna State University will also be sacked, because they joined us during the said industrial strike.\n\nThe issue of victimisation we know is still around the corner, but as part of that agreement, we resolved that any staff member that participated in the last strike would be protected. By implication, what I am saying is that we reject such an act. That is our stand and that is the stand of the national secretariat of the congress and we as the state council will abide by it 100 per cent.\n\nYou are a major stakeholder in your association and you participated in the recent national conference, which was held in Kaduna during which the issue of constitutional review was discussed by stakeholders. What is your opinion on the matter?\n\nThe issue of constitutional review has been undertaken by both the upper and lower chambers of the National Assembly; I think it was a good one. It is an exercise that one can describe as an overdue although it is still the right step. It is a serious issue. In my position as the chairman of the NLC in Kaduna State, we represented the congress at the said public hearing.\n\nWe went there under the leadership and instructions of our national secretariat alongside a staff member, who presented and submitted our memo suggesting about 30 positions of the various institutions with the critical and most important ones being the issues of labour matters in the exclusive list rather than taking them into concurrent list. Equally, there are issues of granting autonomy to the judiciary, legislature and the local governments.\n\nWe want an independent judiciary and also want financial independence for state Houses of Assembly as well as in the local governments. We want the local governments to be considered as a true third arm of the government and must be given their financial dues and rights. We equally took the issue of pensioners. We want all these to be included in the exclusive list. Another major issue is the national minimum wage. If this issue is in the concurrent list, by implication it gives the right to state governments to always determine what they give to their respective local governments.\n\nWe are not comfortable with what is happening at the moment as regards how some state governments are treating their local governments. Up till this moment that I am talking to you, a bill that has been signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari as far back as 2019 is not being implemented by a good number of states. Up till now, some state governors are still not in support of the new national minimum wage.\n\nTo pay a worker his entitlement of N30,000 in 30 days, a governor is still rejecting it. You can see that it is very glaring. The NLC is not only representing workers in the public sector, we are representing good numbers of workers and working people in the private sector in the entire country and the issue of the new minimum wage is applicable to all working class. For example, here in Kaduna State, we have a good number of private sector players and they are paying their staff the said minimum wage, because it is a law, but the moment you allow governors to tamper with that aspect, they do what they want with workers\u2019 salaries. So, we are not in support of that and I think these are the four major issues that we presented although there were other issues that we equally presented.\n\nKaduna Textile has been down for some decades and there is the issue of youth unemployment in the state. As a labour leader in the state, what are you up to with regard to this?\n\nWe have some textile industries in the state. I think about seven of them, but the information before me now is that the only one that is functioning is not even in full capacity; I was equally informed that in the last three to four months, production has been suspended and the staff members are now only on allowances. So, the situation is pathetic and that is why we are saying that the government of Kaduna State should look inward in providing employment to our teeming youths and other citizens of the state.\n\nThe issue of taking people out of their jobs is looking very negative. We are not saying that they must be employed by the government; rather, we are saying that they should create an avenue where youths and other citizens will have something to do. We are calling on stakeholders in Kaduna State, including the government to create employment, most especially to revive the textile industries in order to generate more employment for all and sundry, rather than leaving the youth to be what they are now, but if the industries are revived, they will have multiple effects on our society.\n\nI want to use this medium to also call on the Federal Government to come to see to the revival of Kaduna State\u2019s textile industries, because a good number of them are moribund for decades now, leaving only the Arewa Textiles, which was also closed during the coronavirus pandemic. It will also interest you to know that Coca-Cola, Pepsi and their likes are no longer doing production in Kaduna State. I am calling on both the federal and Kaduna State governments to look into this issue with interest and revive the said industries.\n\nWhat will be your message to civil servants and the youth in Kaduna State?\n\nThe situation that Kaduna State civil servants are going through is not palatable; they are getting afraid of losing their jobs and they are no longer their usual selves. Even with all what is happening to them, I urge them to do their work to the optimal level and with God on their side, they will achieve their desired greatness. I also want to urge the upcoming youths not to go to higher institutions of learning to study courses that they will be depending on the government for jobs after graduation; rather, they should study entrepreneurship related courses to enable them become self-sufficient in the future.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

They have sought to rubbish the hard work and sacrifice that has gone into building the APC in Anambra State.\n\n\u201cTheir actions are an insult to good conscience bordering on the criminal. And I reject these results in their entirety and without the slightest reservation.\n\n\u201cI have been a member of the APC since its inception. Before that, I was a member of one of the predecessor political parties, the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP). For 22 years I have served the party in different capacities, always creditably and always with the highest dedication and loyalty.\n\n\u201cI expect us to be better than those against whom we contend. For me, this is a matter of conscience and principle and as such, there can be no compromise,\u201d he lamented.\n\nOn his next line of action, he said: \u201cTherefore, I will do everything within my abilities and the law, to ensure that the travesty orchestrated by Prince Abiodun and his team will not stand. I have appointed a legal team, and we have gathered evidence including videos, pictures and sworn statements by party election officials appalled by the fraud that Dapo Abiodun and his people have sought to perpetrate against the people of Anambra State.\n\n\u201cI will work within the Appeals process of the party to present my case and I have the full expectation that the right thing will be done. I call on the national leadership of the APC and to all those in our party who still believe in the promise of democracy and good government, who are committed to protecting respect for electoral processes and ensuring the rule of law, to act now and ensure primary elections are properly conducted in Anambra State.\n\n\u201cAnd to ensure that members of the party can choose a candidate with character and integrity to lead the party to the Government House in Awka in November, \u201d he charged.\n\nUnleashing his evidence for the battle ahead, he said: \u201cIn the 2017 election for Governor of Anambra State, a total of 448, 771 people voted in Anambra State in an election that was keenly contested by 37 political parties and their candidates. Yet, Prince Abiodun and his team want to convince Nigerians and the world that nearly 350 votes were cast on Saturday, in the middle of the night, across 326 voting centres in 21 Local Government Areas of Anambra State.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, no major television station in the country has one recorded video clip of elections taking place anywhere in Anambra State. Yet there are thousands of videos showing voters across the State complaining bitterly about the fact that neither the materials nor the personnel for elections was provided in their locales,\u201d lamented.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe Director-General, National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brigadier General Shuaibu Ibrahim, has said that the scheme is determined to take unemployed Nigerians out of labour markets.\n\nGeneral Ibrahim said this when the management of the Sun newspaper, led by the Managing Director/Editor-in-Chief, Onuoha Ukeh, to pay him a courtesy visit in his office in Abuja on Monday.\n\nHe further noted that with scaling up of Skill Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Development (SAED) programme under his leadership, the management will ensure that every Nigerian who passed through the scheme will be equipped with relevant skills.\n\nWhile appealing to Nigerians and the private sectors to pick interest in matters concerning the scheme, he commended the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Bank of Industry among others for supporting the scheme.\n\n\u201cIt is a pleasure to have you, the management of the Sun newspaper. There is no doubt that the Sun is a big platform with wide reach. We appreciate the support of the management for publishing our programmes through editorial and advertorial.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that the Sun has a big stage for the scheme to partner. I want to assure you that we are going to take this relationship to the next level. We promote national integration and entrepreneurship simultaneously in NYSC. With integration there will be unity, peace, development and with these, corps members can be mobilised year in year out.\n\n\u201cIn the course of mobilising the corps members, we have come to realise that skill acquisition is very germain because white cola jobs are not readily available anywhere. While we promote national unity, we also give attention to skill acquisition this time during orientation and post orientation programmes. Our target is that Nigerian youths don\u2019t need to go searching for jobs after service.\n\n\u201cI am happy to inform you that the corps members that took advantage of our skills acquisition training are doing wonderfully well. We have our partners with the CBN, BoI, Access bank, Unity bank that provide start up capital through NYSC Foundation for them to set up their businesses after their service year.\n\n\u201cTo scale up our mission, we have appealed to the federal government on the need to have NYSC Trust Fund which will be made available as start up capital for all corps members. One of our cardinal focus is to make those that passed through the Scheme self reliant.\n\n\u201cOur target is to take many unemployed Nigerians of the labour markets. We have realised that these fresh graduates are digital in all there dealings. Once we can provide job for the unemployed Nigerian youths, I can assure you that we can go to bed and sleep.\n\n\u201cWe realised that the ones we empowered are not only doing well but also employing others. The joy of the whole thing is that they don\u2019t establish these businesses in their state of origin but state of residents which is part of the integration.\n\n\u201cI want to urge Nigerians to take interest in what the NYSC is doing. We also encourage the private sector to invest in the Scheme,\u201d he appealed.\n\nSpeaking earlier, Onuoha, who led the Sun newspaper management, had commended the management of the Scheme, assuring it of the readiness of the newspaper to provide its big platform to publish its activities and programmes.\n\n\u201cWe are happy to be here today and to underscore the importance of this visit, almost the whole members of the management team are on this visit. We came to strengthen our relationship with the Scheme and testify the good work you have done.\n\n\u201cThis visit is part of the efforts to liaise with critical stakeholders to celebrate with the organisations and commend those we feel are doing well.\n\n\u201cThe Sun has made tremendous improvements since inception till now including our press printing simultaneously in three zones like Abuja serving the north, Aba, serving the Southeast and South-South and Lagos, in charge of the South-West.\n\n\u201cAs the Voice of the Nation, we talk about everybody including the common, high and mighty in the society. We give voice to anybody who has anything to say.\n\n\u201cWe can testify for the successes you have recorded including last year during COVID-19 pandemic when the world economy was threatened. We also commend the efforts you have made within this two years you took over the mantle of leadership as the DG,\u201d he said.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

Consequently, the ACF chairman stated that it is imperative for the Northern lawmakers to be adequately prepared.\n\nBesides, Ogbe said the northern body, after a meeting to discuss the issue would present \u201csomething\u201d to the lawmakers to work on.\n\n\u201cA lot has been said about the Petroleum Industry bill but I will not dwell on that. But there is something that will come before you very soon. The last time Mr. President met with a delegation from the South South, he made a statement that if a bill is presented before the National Assembly on the question of restructuring and the Assembly passes it, he will have no objection than to sign it.\n\n\u201cIt then means that the matter may not be too far away. At our last meeting in Kaduna, we extended an invitation to Ohanaeze, Afenifere and the South South Peoples Congress that we want to engage them and have a conversation on the subject. However, I will like you, as legislators to take note of this.\n\n\u201cMany of the people who are clamouring for restructuring are referring to the 1963 constitution. Somehow, they believe that constitution gives to every part of Nigeria whatever resources there are.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to get copies to send to all of you to see. Item 25, part one of section 69 of the first schedule says mines, minerals, including oil fields, oil mining, geological surveys and natural gas are on the exclusive list. The 1963 constitution, an exact copy of the 1960 constitution and a copy of the 1999 constitution which has now made to look as if it was written by the government itself. Take out these constitution and read it well. We will meet, discuss and something will be presented to you. It will be up to you to make it work after which Mr. President will be ready to sign it.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "By James Emejo\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has approved the release of 50,000 metric tonnes of maize to 12 major producers to control the price of the commodity.\n\nThe bank said yesterday that the latest rollout of the commodity from the Strategic Maize Reserve (SMR) under the Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP) to companies would be the third intervention by the CBN in recent times.\n\nIt stated that the release of the grains is aimed at checkmating the activities of middlemen hoarding the product to cause artificial scarcity.\n\nCBN spokesman, Mr. Osita Nwanisobi, confirmed the release of the grains in a statement yesterday and expressed optimism that the release would crash the price of maize, reduce pressure on the market, and make the product directly available to feed producers, thereby reducing the price of poultry feed.\n\nHe added that as part of the bank\u2019s financing framework, the CBN would continue to facilitate the funding of maize farmers and processors through the ABP commodity association, private/prime anchors, and state governments, Maize Aggregation Scheme (MAS) as well as the Commercial Agricultural Credit Scheme (CACS).\n\nAccording to the statement, the identified recipients of the grains included Premier Flour Mills, Crown-Olam, Grand Cereals, Animal Care, Amobyn and Hybrid Feeds.\n\nOthers are Obasanjo Farms, Zartech, Wacot, Sayeed Farms, Pandagri Novum and Premium Farms.\n\nReacting to the development, the National President of the Maize Association of Nigeria (MAAN), Dr. Bello Abubakar, urged middlemen to desist from taking advantage of the supply gap to hike the price of the commodity.\n\nHe assured the people that farmers will maintain reasonable pricing regime of the products.\n\nThe apex bank had while responding to the activities of middlemen earlier in January, released 300,000 metric tonnes of maize, a move which led to the reduction in the price of the commodity.\n\nAlso, the bank, in a renewed move to address the rising cost of food prices in the market partnered with the Rice farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) to distribute 27,000 metric tonnes of rice paddies directly to millers last week.\n\nThe direct allocation from RIFAN warehouses across 16 states of the federation followed the earlier sale of paddy aggregated as loan repayment under the ABP to millers from the rice pyramids unveiled in Niger, Kebbi, Gombe and Ekiti States.\n\nEarlier in February, maize farmers had criticised agitations by some groups for the importation of the commodity, describing it as a calculated attempt to further hinder maize production in the country.\n\nThey, however, said with current improvement in local production capacity and funding support from the CBN, under its Anchor Borrower Programme (ABP), as well as expectations that the COVID-19 pandemic will be better managed globally, the country should be able to achieve at least 25 million metric tonnes (MMT) before the end of the year.\n\nThey added that in the short-term, the price of maize, which had hit the roof in recent times, will drop within three to four months with the modalities put in place to achieve price reduction.\n\nAlso, the National President of MAGPAMAN, Dr. Edwin Oche, had stated that the CBN\u2019s massive investment in ABP had boosted maize production from eight million metric tonnes to about 20 million metric tonnes within three years.\n\nHe said local farmers had the capacity to grow enough maize to support both industrial use and local consumption.\n\nHe had said: \u201cToday, we shouldn\u2019t have been discussing this if not for the challenges encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cIf not for the advent of COVID-19 that affected food chains and production as well as agriculture as a whole both locally and internationally, we will not be talking about the price increase in maize per bag. We will not be talking about the increase in feeds, flour and all the derivatives from maize and others.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a global issue and as an association, we are dealing with it and strategically looking at the ways to ameliorate the problem by engaging the federal government and CBN and other partners to ensure we come out of it.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "TIMELINE: After almost 4 years of hide-and-seek, Nnamdi Kanu back in DSS net",
          "text": "What had begun like an uneventful Tuesday evolved into the relatively unexpected, as news broke sometime after mid-day that Nnamdi Kanu had been arrested and extradited to Nigeria \u2014 not as the triumphant secessionist leader as he had hoped when he fled the country in 2017, but as a \u201cfugitive\u201d brought before the law to answer to crates of unsettled court cases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKanu and his agitation for secession, which birthed the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), began with an obscure Radio Biafra in 2014 and, before the next year, became the face of the biggest secessionist movement in the country since the Nigerian Civil War.\n\nTHE LAGOS ARREST AND A RACE TO SELF-EXILE\n\nOn October 14, 2015, Kanu was arrested at a hotel in Lagos by operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) and thus began his race to elude the reaching hand of the Nigerian government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater that year, several courts ordered the release of the IPOB leader, but the DSS failed to comply.\n\nThe security agency, instead, slammed another five-count charge of treasonable felony on Kanu and, in 2016, three courts ruled his remandment in Kuje prison, citing threats to national security.\n\nOn April 25, 2017, the federal high court in Abuja granted Kanu bail on \u201chealth grounds\u201d, and three days later he became a free man once again after being detained for 18 months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis release followed the perfection of his bail condition, which included providing three sureties \u2014 one of whom must be a serving senator; the second, a Jewish leader, and the third, a highly respected Nigerian.\n\nThe bail also came with some caveats \u2014 that Kanu must not grant media interviews and avoid being seen in a crowd of more than 10 people. The terms were, however, flouted at least three times within a few weeks of his release.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he had retorted, during an interview when asked if speaking to the media could get him into trouble.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like asking me not to breathe. I can\u2019t go outside to call for a press conference. I can\u2019t go on Biafra Radio to broadcast.

          "text": "What had begun like an uneventful Tuesday evolved into the relatively unexpected, as news broke sometime after mid-day that Nnamdi Kanu had been arrested and extradited to Nigeria \u2014 not as the triumphant secessionist leader as he had hoped when he fled the country in 2017, but as a \u201cfugitive\u201d brought before the law to answer to crates of unsettled court cases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKanu and his agitation for secession, which birthed the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), began with an obscure Radio Biafra in 2014 and, before the next year, became the face of the biggest secessionist movement in the country since the Nigerian Civil War.\n\nTHE LAGOS ARREST AND A RACE TO SELF-EXILE\n\nOn October 14, 2015, Kanu was arrested at a hotel in Lagos by operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) and thus began his race to elude the reaching hand of the Nigerian government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater that year, several courts ordered the release of the IPOB leader, but the DSS failed to comply.\n\nThe security agency, instead, slammed another five-count charge of treasonable felony on Kanu and, in 2016, three courts ruled his remandment in Kuje prison, citing threats to national security.\n\nOn April 25, 2017, the federal high court in Abuja granted Kanu bail on \u201chealth grounds\u201d, and three days later he became a free man once again after being detained for 18 months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis release followed the perfection of his bail condition, which included providing three sureties \u2014 one of whom must be a serving senator; the second, a Jewish leader, and the third, a highly respected Nigerian.\n\nThe bail also came with some caveats \u2014 that Kanu must not grant media interviews and avoid being seen in a crowd of more than 10 people. The terms were, however, flouted at least three times within a few weeks of his release.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he had retorted, during an interview when asked if speaking to the media could get him into trouble.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like asking me not to breathe. I can\u2019t go outside to call for a press conference. I can\u2019t go on Biafra Radio to broadcast. I can\u2019t allow large groups of people to basically congregate outside to see me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis disregard for the court order was the stick with which Labaran Maku, the federal government\u2019s counsel, used to demand that the bail be revoked.

          "title": "Ghana kicks off first fully digital census in West Africa",
          "text": "Ghana has started its long-awaited fully-digital national census; the first-ever in West Africa. This comes after a trial was conducted in select districts nationwide back in 2019.\n\nThe country\u2019s last census was in 2010 and it put the population at 24.6 million. The country has, every 10 years since 1981, conducted the Population and Housing Census (PHC) but was forced to postpone the 2020 census due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nNow the government has gone digital, using tablets and satellite images to improve the reach of field agents and ensuring the whole population in Ghana is counted on census night.\n\nThe digital census will be done with the use of Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) devices which are tablets for electronic data capture and Geographic Positioning Systems (GPS) for recording coordinates of structures.\n\nMore than 67,000 field enumerators have been deployed to collect data nationwide using electronic questionnaires on digital tablets, according to the Ghana Statistics Service (GSS), the institution responsible for collecting and collating national data.\n\nThe field agents will target persons travelling, persons in short-stay institutions such as health facilities, hotels, and prisons, and those considered homeless at their locations, Ghana\u2019s Chief Government Statistician, Samuel Kobina Annim, was quoted as saying.\n\nAn \u201call-inclusive\u201d exercise\n\nThe historic digital census in Ghana fits right in with the government\u2019s bid to capture the exact number of Ghanaians in the country, especially the vulnerable population, for better national development.\n\n\u201cThe 2021 census is unique with the use of electronic tablets and the Internet to capture and transfer data to guarantee the delivery of high-quality and faster results to support the decision-making process,\u201d President Nana Akufo-Addo said back in May when he announced a countdown to the digital census. Ultimately, this would help in socio-economic planning in the country and potentially aid the fight against inequality while transforming the informal sector.\n\n\u201cThe digitisation will help us deliver results more promptly and accurately than we used to have with the paper and pen data collection in the past,\u201d said Peter Takyi Peprah, the Field Operations Manager at the GSS.\n\nGhana has millions of street vendors and waste pickers that make up most of its informal economy. The majority of these people moved from poorer rural areas in search of work and represent a \u201cfloating population\u201d that the government wants to capture better in its database.\n\nThe census will also play a major role in the nationwide rollout of biometric identity cards launched by President Nana Akufo-Addo in 2017. The new ID card requires a digital address code, many of which will be generated by enumerators during the census.\n\n\u201cThe counting that we do at GSS during a PHC is the snapshot of the population and it is an all-inclusive exercise,\u201d Annim added.\n\nThe fully digital PHC is said to have cost the government $84 million, around 50% more than the last census. It sees the West African nation join the list of African countries to collect national data electronically, an exclusive club that includes only Swaziland, Malawi, and Kenya. Meanwhile, South Africa is in line for its first-ever digital census.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

This comes more than two years after the last exercise.\n\nThis is an opportunity for Nigerians that are yet to register before to get their voters card, to enable them to participate in any election. The process is also open to people whose permanent voters cards (PVC) are damaged, stolen, or want to change their biodata.\n\nAs the voter registration exercise kicks off, INEC has announced guidelines to help people understand how the new process will work.\n\nHow can you register?\n\nThe INEC voter registration exercise will be done both online and in-person, according to Obo Effanga, Resident Electoral Commissioner at INEC in Rivers State.\n\nOnline registration: This can be done on a new INEC portal, where Nigerians can fill in all their details and print out the slip.\n\nINEC launched the dedicated portal last week. This is unlike the previous years where prospective voters queued in various centres to register and obtain their voter\u2019s cards.\n\nThe portal will help Nigerians start the registration process online and then make an appointment for a date and time to visit an INEC State or Local Government Area (LGA) office to give their fingerprints and complete the registration.\n\nWith the online portal, you can also apply to replace lost or damaged permanent voters cards or update your biodata. It is also open to people who have transferred their registrar or done any correction of names or other details.\n\nIn-person registration: After the online registration, you have to proceed to INEC offices at the local government area near you or any designated centre that INEC provides along with your printed slip. At the LGAs, a biometric capture will be done after which you will get temporary voter cards.\n\nINEC has warned Nigerians against doing double registration as the system would detect that and such a person\u2019s registration could be cancelled. They could also be liable to prosecution at the court and face the law.\n\nWho can participate in the Voter Registration?\n\nNigerian citizens up to 18 years who are yet to register\n\nRegistered voters that have issues with accreditation during previous elections can apply to have the agency fix the problems\n\nRegistered voters that want to transfer their voting points from one place to another\n\nRegistered voters whose voters cards have been damaged or lost can apply to replace them\n\nRegistered voters that wish to correct any information on their cards\n\nFor now, only the online exercise of the voters\u2019 registration has kicked off and INEC is yet to set a date for the physical registration.\n\nINEC has said it is targeting at least 20 million new voters to its existing 84 million voters as of 2019.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigerian businesses face an avalanche of losses as the Twitter ban continues",
          "text": "On Saturday the 5th of June, Wunmi*, a digital marketer lost a gig worth \u20a6600,000 ($1,200). The marketing campaign was to start the next day but she got a call from the client telling her they couldn\u2019t proceed anymore due to \u2018orders from above.\u2019 She was dumbfounded.\n\nThat same day, about 39 million Nigerians woke up to realize that they couldn\u2019t access Twitter except via VPNs. Internet Service Providers (ISP) in Nigeria like MTN and Airtel had blocked all access to Twitter.\n\nWhen Peju, owner of Abebi Organics, describes the day the ban was enforced, she recounts how the jokes kept coming until one by one people found that they could not tweet anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than two weeks since and the effects of the ban have been anything but humorous for businesses like hers who built their customer base on Twitter.\n\nThe ban happened a day after the Nigerian government announced an indefinite Twitter suspension. The minister of information had stated that the reason for banning Twitter was because the social media platform has \u201cconsistently made its platform available to those who are threatening Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nWhile still mourning the loss of the first job, Wunmi lost another one for the same reason.\n\n\u201cEverything felt like a waste. What was worse was another \u20a6700,000 ($1,400) deal ended up in the mud. The client paid \u20a6150,000 ($333) at least for the little job I had done,\u201d she said.\n\nThe effect on businesses\n\nFor many Nigerians, this ban has affected how they stay informed, build relationships and get opportunities. Businesses on the other hand have experienced a decline in engagements and sales.\n\nIn the case of Nifries, an online food delivery service that relies on Twitter to reach its audience, its customers aren\u2019t responding as they used to.\n\nFeranmi Ajetomobi, the founder of Nifries, explained that the Twitter ban has affected anon (short for anonymous) sales which drive about 20% of sales at Nifries. Anon sales happen when people surprise strangers or friends by buying goods for them without revealing their identity.\n\nHi @TereSagay_, Anon just opened a tab of N15,000 for you to pick whatever you want from our Menu! \ud83d\ude0d\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nKindly visit https://t.co/rmQIkQXPkD and send a DM of what you want \ud83d\udc9b \u2014 Sexy Suya Burgers \ud83c\udf54 (@ni_fries) June 15, 2021\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve realised that when we reach out to a few people and there\u2019s no response, It\u2019s either because they\u2019ve taken a break or the Twitter ban has affected them. How we know it\u2019s the ban is because when these people we reach out to come online, they attribute their absence to the fact that using VPN is confusing,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Habib who runs Smiley Socks, a clothing company that also thrives on the \u2018anon sales\u2019 phenomenon, sales via Twitter have been affected. He\u2019s also noticed that engagements with tweets have reduced.\n\nThis has made him turn to other channels. He\u2019s had to pay more attention to his Instagram page and work on his SEO for his e-commerce website to maximise conversations.\n\nHe\u2019s also started experimenting with TikTok and so far, the results have been astounding. One day after he opened a new TikTok page, it already had 100 followers. The few videos he\u2019s posted already have at least 500 views, with the highest being one with over 4,000 views.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy when you think about the fact that it\u2019s a new page and we are not following anyone. Despite the engagement, there\u2019s a bigger question of how we\u2019ll convert these numbers into sales. For now, we\u2019ll just do more influencer marketing and affiliate marketing as we figure out what works,\u201d said Habib.\n\nWunmi* who has lost two deals worth over $2,500 is now considering focusing on unexplored channels like IG Reels and TikTok.\n\n\u201cFor clients that do not mind me using VPN, I go ahead and use Twitter. Unfortunately, those clients are very few. No one wants to offend President Buhari at this time for fear of being blacklisted by the government or worse, getting forcefully shut down. Clients think of many negative scenarios of how the government can strike back, they sometimes seem hilarious, but can you blame them?\u201d she said.\n\nComparing Twitter to other platforms\n\nCharles Isidi, a growth marketer and digital consultant, agrees with the need to pivot to other digital marketing channels but has a word of caution. He has experienced the effect of the decline first-hand on his personal account. With followership of about 17,000, his monthly impressions have gone from as high as 3.8 million, to under 500,000.\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for April\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for May\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for June\n\nHe says the ban will affect advertising spend and results across other digital marketing channels because Nigerian Twitter users who are using VPNs will also have their locations skewed across every other app.\n\n\u201cIf your most valuable audience is in another country that you do not know, then how can you reach them?\u201d he said.\n\nHe also raised the question of whether people know how to use VPNs safely.\n\n\u201cQuite a lot of people use free VPNs. In the next six months, we might start experiencing a lot of theft. We\u2019ll have to be looking at how much we\u2019ve lost due to cybercrimes.\u201d\n\nBusinesses might need to move to other social media platforms but Twitter offers more favourable returns in terms of marketing efforts.\n\nCompared to other advertising channels, Twitter is a cheaper and less stressful channel.\n\nHe\u2019s been trying to run a billboard campaign for the past 3 months and has been stuck waiting for Lagos\u2019 paid advertising approval. For digital adverts, in less than an hour, the advert is approved and has started delivering value for the business.\n\n\u201cUnlike other social media platforms, take Facebook as an example. A typical page with 10,000 followers reaches 3% of your audience with a post. Meanwhile, on Twitter, an organic post can be retweeted. In terms of shareability and virality, there\u2019s a reason why people love Twitter. I can say something and even if I have just 100 followers, 3 million people can see that tweet.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s difficult on Instagram where you have to make the explore page or use a hashtag that people love to get a similar kind of result.\n\nHow much is being lost\n\nCiting a scenario, he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re currently managing a brand that has 20,000 followers, it\u2019ll get 1-3 million impressions on average. To be conservative, at a 0.1% conversation rate, the brand will have an average of 1,000 \u2013 3,000 new customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we put the average transaction value per customer at $3 dollars per month, that\u2019s an average of $3,000 \u2013 $9,000 dollars lost due to the ban. Let\u2019s put it across all the businesses in that range and you see that the number is massive.\u201d\n\nWith the Twitter ban, Nigerian businesses that have previously relied on the massive reach of the platform now face an avalanche of losses if the decision is not reversed soon.\n\nAnd if we were to be a little hopeful and imagine a world where the ban is lifted, how much irreversible damage has been done to the potential audience reach these businesses used to have? We\u2019ll find out soon enough.\n\n*Name changed to protect their identity.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

Local and international investors that participated include Alitheia IDF, Golden Palm Investments, 4DX Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Asia Pacific Land, Breyer Labs, and MSA Capital.\n\nPreviously, the company received pre-seed funding from Hustle Fund in San Francisco and C5 Capital in London through the PeaceTech accelerator. It also participated in this year\u2019s Catalyst Fund Inclusive Fintech Program cohort, where it was the only Ghanian startup. Ingressive Capital also lists the company in its portfolio.\n\nFounded in 2018 by CEO Miishe Addy and COO Solomon Torgbo, the company wants to enable African businesses to see and control their cross-border supply chains. It uses technology to make the movement of cargo across borders clear and simple.\n\nAs Addy told attendees at AB2020\u2019s 2019 Tech in Ghana Accra event, Jetstream was initially started as a logistics company for cosmetics manufacturers in South Africa. They consolidated airfreight shipments of finished shea and other products and sent them to the United States for distribution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the founders quickly realised that the biggest problems in distribution were occurring further up in the supply chain, in places like Northern and Eastern Ghana. From these locations, millions of smallholder farmers and SME processors produce ingredients that make their way through long and complex supply chains to markets like the US, South Africa, and Europe.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the CEO said, \u201cWe discussed and tried lots of different solutions for about a year and discovered that cargo aggregation generated strong traction almost immediately.\u201d\n\nEventually, Jetstream began operations in Ghana in March 2019, when it launched a Less Than Container Load (LCL) \u2014 a shipment in small quantities that cannot occupy the whole of a container \u2014 aggregation service. It allowed agricultural exporters to group their shipments into shared sea freight containers.\n\nIn November 2020, Jetstream added trade finance for customers who found it difficult to fill large purchase orders.\n\nThe company is currently white-labelling \u2014 providing services or products which other companies rebrand as theirs \u2014 its internally built systems to manage shipments and financing for customers.\n\nPreviously, Addy \u2014 a Stanford law graduate \u2014 taught business at Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST), while Torgbo had worked at Maersk\u2019s freight forwarding subsidiary Damco for eight years; their experiences have aided them in the running of the company.\n\nAfrica\u2019s share of exports to the rest of the world ranged from 80% to 90% between 2000 and 2017. And this is a major catalyst for the continent\u2019s newly created African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which aims to boost regional commerce.\n\nThe company is well-positioned to facilitate this move, especially as it is located in Ghana. The West African country is a major proponent of the AfCFTA initiative and is home to Port Tema, the largest container terminal in West and Central Africa, with plans to handle one million containers a year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to Port Tema, Jetstream counts an unnamed Asia-based global shipping line as a major customer and early adopter of its technology. This has seen the business generate seven-figure revenue, and Addy claims the startup grows more than 100% year on year.\n\nJetstream also has operations in Nigeria with agents in South Africa, China, the US, UK, and Europe \u2014 a move strategic to the company\u2019s ten-year plan to move whichever agricultural product to whichever enterprise that needs it, especially within Africa.",

          "text": "Nigerian Wealth management startup, Cowrywise Financial Technology Limited \u201cCowrywise\u201d, has secured an asset management licence from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe licence, dubbed the \u201cFund/Portfolio Management Licence\u201d, gives companies the right to manage funds and investment portfolios on behalf of retail investors. Per the SEC, only companies with such licence can develop and operate any product that pools investor funds.\n\nCo-founded by Razaq Ahmed and Edward Popoola in 2017, Cowrywise entered the digital wealth management space with the aim of giving more Nigerians access to a range of investment and savings products.\n\nHowever, SEC had not yet defined regulations for fintech companies playing in the investment space. Startups were left to take up the mantle of protecting investor funds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot being a fund manager itself, Cowrywise struck a partnership with a SEC regulated entity, Meristem Trustees Limited.\n\nThe company\u2019s plan to protect investors was to introduce a trustee who will act as a guardian to investor funds. According to the startup, this SEC-regulated trustee ensured that Cowrywise properly invested customer savings on its platform\n\nIn 2018, the company launched various retail investment schemes, and it says it now has up to 21 mutual funds with various risk categories, and up to three hundred thousand people now use Cowrywise in 2021.\n\nAccording to Ahmed, CEO of Cowrywise, the SEC licence not only validates the company\u2019s work, but it will help to improve investor confidence, and help it deepen its partnerships with other fund managers.\n\n\u201cWe can now decide to even build our own mutual funds, partner with other fund and portfolio managers to digitise their operations and expand their reach to first-time investors,\u201d Ahmed says.\n\nA public API\n\nThe Cowrywise app. Source: Supplied.\n\nAhmed says the company\u2019s plan is to capture 10 million first time investors by 2025 into regulated investments., and an important step going forward is to digitise the country\u2019s investment infrastructure.\n\nPer Ahmed, the company will be launching its public Application Programming Interface which other fintech companies and traditional fund managers can access to either launch their own wealth management products, or digitise their operations.\n\n\u201cWe want to help fund managers across the world access our services and open up more investment options to serve our customers in Nigeria better,\u201d Ahmed reveals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur investment API simplifies regulatory, compliance and technical hurdles. We\u2019ve been developing this for some time and the SEC licence eliminates the regulatory obstacles to launching such a product,\u201d he says.\n\nRecall that in January 2021, Y Combinator-backed Cowrywise raised $3m pre-Series A, led by Quona Capital which brought its total funding to $3.5 million since its 2017 launch.\n\nA closer look at SEC\u2019s licence\n\nImage by Daniel Bone from Pixabay\n\nIn Ahmed\u2019s opinion, this latest move signifies the SEC\u2019s interest in embracing the rise of fintech companies and giving their services the much needed regulatory backing.\n\nCowrywise\u2019s Fund/Portfolio Manager licence comes barely a week after SEC issued a sub-broker licence to Chaka, a startup that helped people trade stocks from companies like Amazon, MTN, and Airtel.\n\nHowever, the requirements for SEC\u2019s fund manager licence are more capital intensive.\n\nThe registration process involves four fees that cost a combined \u20a6800k ($2000). These include a filing/application fee, processing fee, registration fee, and sponsored individual fee.\n\nAccording to SEC\u2019s website, every fund manager must have, at least, three sponsored individuals with one serving as a regulatory compliance officer.\n\nThe commission requires a minimum paid-up capital of \u20a6150 million ($365k) This capital could either be in bank balances, fixed assets or Investment in quoted Securities.\n\nThe company would also be required to secure a current Fidelity Insurance Bond covering at least 20% of the minimum paid-up capital \u2014 \u20a630 million ($73k).\n\nInterestingly, SEC\u2019s January 2021 rule amendment states that fund managers must pay annual regulatory fees that amount to 0.25% of their total funds targeted at retail investors. They will also pay a 0.01% fee on their funds which are targeted at High Networth Individuals (HNIs).\n\nAnother section of this rule also states that fund managers can only develop or operate any product when the commission grants it prior approval or has no objection on that product.\n\nFlouting this rule could attract a \u20a6500k ($1200) fine and an additional \u20a610k ($24) for every day the violation continues.\n\nConsidering Cowrywise\u2019s position as a constantly innovative fintech company, it is not clear if this rule would be adjusted specifically for fintech companies.\n\nMeanwhile, the Commission has already given fintech startups without defined regulations until Q3 2021 to joins its incubation program, a very similar initiative to the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN\u2019s) regulatory sandbox.",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nJiji\u2019s acquisition of Cars45\n\nOnline voter\u2019s card registration for Nigerians\n\nBanks banking on the ecosystem\n\neCommerce platform, Jiji, acquires Cars45\n\nOne of Cars45\u2019s inspection centres\n\nIn what seems to be a foray into the transactional marketplace, classified eCommerce platform, Jiji, has reportedly acquired Cars45, an online marketplace for used cars.\n\nWhat does this imply? This acquisition could see Jiji strengthen trust amongst buyers as both companies\u2019 business models will be integrated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince Vladimir Mnogoletniy, Jiji Co-founder, said that vehicles have the largest listings on the platform, Cars45\u2019s network of inspection centres will ensure that vehicles are properly checked and evaluated.\n\nFind out more about the details of this acquisition and what it could mean for eCommerce in Africa.\n\nRead here: Jiji reportedly acquires Cars45 for an undisclosed amount\n\nLikely sign? Although questions have arisen about the viability of the classified eCommerce marketplace in Africa, past optimism expressed about this sector is most likely justified. This acquisition could be a sign of things to come. What do you think?\n\nNigeria begins online voter registration\n\nAfter the 2019 general elections held in Nigeria, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) announced on November 4, 2020, that another round of registration would begin in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nIn line with that announcement, an online Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) action is ongoing on INEC\u2019s continuous voter registration portal. It is set to go on for six months before the next general elections in 2023.\n\nThis registration is open to eligible voting citizens who want to get a voter\u2019s card for the first time or registered voters who need to review their voter registration, update information, or transfer voter registration to another polling unit.\n\nWhy now? Well, Mahmood Yakubu, INEC Chairman, stated that the aim is to enhance the voter experience by making the registration exercise faster, easier, and less crowded than before.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCould this be a sign? With this in place, it just might suggest that the country is closer to establishing a start to finish e-voting process on a large scale. Because, despite consistent calls from the National Assembly, the Nigerian Constitution hasn\u2019t been amended to fully adapt electronics in the election process.\n\nA good time to revisit this: Inside Nigeria\u2019s first-ever electronic voting exercise in Kaduna State\n\nOn the portal, you can pre-register for a PVC, update your information, apply for collection of your PVC, and request to replace a missing voter\u2019s card.\n\nI pre-registered today as a first-time voter, and the process was somewhat seamless and hurdle-free. But is that all there is to it?\n\nOur reporter, Victoria Fakiya, is trying to experience and document the process to make it easier for you; look out for a step-by-step guide.\n\nWill physical bank branches ever be irrelevant?\n\nIn the past few years, we have seen the rise of fintech startups lead to remarkable changes in how digital banking services are offered.\n\nBefore now, we have reported that in Nigeria alone, over 150 fintech startups generate annual revenues of over $5 million. And this has seen experts make optimistic projections about the sector.\n\nThe question of how relevant traditional commercial banks will be in the coming years is valid. Some experts have given their take on the possibility of physical branches becoming the dinosaurs of a very digital future.\n\nTemenos, a company that specialises in building software for banking services, partnered with The Economist Intelligence Unit to carry out a survey between February and March 2021 on the digitisation of banking.\n\nSixty-five per cent of the 305 senior global banking executives who filled the survey believe that branch-based banking will be dead in five years.\n\nThis might seem improbable, but one can argue that as technological innovations evolve and have a wider reach, there could be an existential threat to conventional banking models.\n\nBut, I suppose the uniqueness of the African market is something to be considered before making this assumption.\n\nWith a population of over 350 million unbanked adults in sub-Saharan Africa, the future of fintechs in Africa looks bright. It could have a tremendous impact on fostering financial inclusion in Africa. But, to make bank branches go extinct? Maybe.\n\nWhat next? A good option would be integrating digital innovation for financial services into traditional banking methods. Another 81% of the experts who took the survey believe that unlocking value from AI will be the key differentiator between winning and losing banks.\n\nLet\u2019s continue this conversation in the comment section.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nHow to set up an online store for your business on WhatsApp and Instagram in Nigeria.

          "text": "In a scathing ruling, the Constitutional Court found former president Jacob Zuma guilty of contempt of court and sentenced him to a 15-month jail term, for his failure to comply with an order of SA\u2019s apex court to testify before the state capture inquiry.\n\nIn a majority judgment read by Acting Chief Justice Sisi Khampepe, the justices argued that it would defy logic to impose a suspended sentence in response to what has been a direct and calculated assault on the judiciary and SA\u2019s constitutional democracy.\n\nRead Also: What next after Zuma fails to shake off corruption charges?\n\n\u201cThere can be no doubt Zuma is in contempt of court. He failed to comply with an order of the Constitutional Court. Of course, society would receive benefit from Zuma\u2019s testimony at the state capture inquiry, given that the maleficence happened during his term. A cohesive order that is again defied would only further impune the integrity of the Constitutional Court.\n\n\u201cThe majority has no choice: this case is exceptional not because Zuma is being treated exceptionally, but as a result of the nature of Zuma\u2019s attacks on the judiciary,\u201d Khampepe said.\n\nThe full bench, led by Khampepe, heard arguments from the state capture inquiry in March. Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi for the commission urged the court to sentence Zuma to two years in jail. He discouraged the court from granting Zuma alternative relief, such as a suspended sentence or a fine.\n\nZuma has not opposed these contempt of court proceedings and has indicated no intention of participating in those proceedings.\n\nThe judgment by the court opens the way for the commission to force Zuma to comply with all lawfully issued summonses and directives of the commission and to appear and give evidence before it.\n\nThe Zondo commission, since it was first constituted in 2018, has heard through various testimonies from witnesses that during Zuma\u2019s years as the head of state, his close allies \u2014 such as the controversial Gupta family used their relationship with the former president for personal enrichment.\n\nThe verdict is likely to have major implications for the country and the governing ANC as Zuma sought to portray court rulings as part of long-standing ploy to discredit him. It is a strategy that served him well when he originally faced corruption charges related to the country\u2019s 1990s arms deal, with court appearances resembling political rallies. His strategy might also serve as a template for allies, notably secretary-general Ace Magashule, who are facing criminal charges and fighting for their political lives.\n\nOn January 28, the Constitutional Court ordered Zuma to comply with summonses to testify before Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. The ruling also directed Zuma to file affidavits and respond to questions at the commission.",

Through the Energy Cabin projects, Awoye and Odofado are having access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for the first time thus fulfilling Goal 7 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).\n\nOndo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, who was represented at the commissioning by Mrs Abike Ilawolle, the Secretary, Ondo State Public Utility, said that the rural electrification project is in line with his administration\u2019s agenda.\n\nWhile promising to ensure that all rural areas benefited from social amenities in order to improve their welfare, the governor COMMENDED CNL, the sponsors of the laudable project which he said was first of its kind.\n\n\u201cRural electrification is part of our administration\u2019s agenda and we will ensure that rural dwellers, especially residents in the riverine areas have access to social amenities for life to be enjoyable to them unlike their land counterparts.\n\n\u201cThe communities should prioritise these projects and guarantee its security in order to charge the government to do more and extend such to other riverine communities to bring succour to them.\n\nMr Goke Ojatuwase, the Chairman, Ilaje LGA who also commended the IRDC and sponsors of the laudable project, said it would relieve the two communities of total darkness. He said the project which was one of its kind had set the pace for other states to emulate, assuring the riverine communities of more dividends of democracy from the present administration in the state.\n\nOn his part, the Chairman of the IRDC, Mr Roland Akintoye, expressed gladness for the completion of the project which he said had set the group to the highest pedestal in the community drive for improved standard of living. He thanked the state government, the LGA and NNPC/Chevron for the synergy which had blossomed into cordial relationship and attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) beneficial to residents of the riverine communities.\n\nEngr. Ayodeji Olumilua, Managing Director, A4 and T Power Solutions, contractor of the projects said that residents of the riverine communities would enjoy uninterrupted power supply with 40 percent discount on tariffs compared to normal electricity. \u201cWe have metered all the 200 houses and shops for them to enjoy the uninterrupted power supply.\n\n\u201cThe token amount of money that was paid on their prepaid meters would generate funds that would be used to maintain and sustain the solar cabin grid.\u2019\u2019\n\nMr Aribo Adegoke, a resident of Awoye community said that the solar electricity was a welcome development for them as they now have access to noiseless electricity at cheaper rate compared to generating set and its expenses.\n\nAlso speaking, another beneficiary from Odofado community, Mrs Folashade Ojagun said she had totally lost hope in electricity as no government had been able to erect poles on the river to provide electricity until the advent of the solar power.\n\nNigerian Observer gathered that IRDC was a community-based organisation solely funded by NNPC/Chevron Nigeria Ltd. It was founded under a Global Memorandum of Understanding (GMoU) between Ondo State government, Some communities neighboring CNL\u2019s Operations in Ondo State and NNPC/Chevron Nigeria Limited to manage community development in constituent areas.\n\nTo execute the Energy Cabin project, Ilaje RDC partnered with the Foundation for Partnership Initiatives in the Niger Delta (PIND), a Chevron-sponsored Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) which was incorporated in Nigeria, in 2010, to complement Chevron\u2019s existing social investment efforts to help promote equitable economic development and peace in the Niger Delta through partnerships.

          "text": "Agency Reports\n\nNew vote totals released on Tuesday in New York City\u2019s Democratic mayoral contest sharply narrowed the lead for Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president.\n\nThe additional votes left the outcome even more uncertain with thousands of absentee ballots still to be counted over the coming weeks.\n\nKathryn Garcia, a former sanitation chief for the city, was in second place, while Maya Wiley, a former MSNBC analyst and civil rights lawyer, was in third.\n\nAdams alleged there were unspecified \u201cirregularities\u201d after his lead shrank. He held a considerable lead on Election Day a week ago, based on the initial count of first-choice ballots from voters who cast ballots in person.\n\nBut for the first time, the mayoral election used a ranked-choice system, in which voters could rank up to five candidates in order of preference. Tuesday\u2019s tally was the first analysis of those choices, though it included no mail-in ballots.\n\nAdams expressed confidence he would retain his lead and become the next mayor but questioned why the vote total increased by 100,000 from the previous count.\n\n\u201cWe have asked the Board of Elections to explain such a massive increase and other irregularities before we comment on the Ranked Choice Voting projection,\u201d Adams said in a statement.\n\nThe ranked-choice system operates as a series of instant runoffs. The candidate in last place is eliminated, and his or her votes are redistributed to voters\u2019 second choice. The process repeats until there are only two candidates remaining, and the one with a majority is declared the winner.\n\nAfter 11 rounds of elimination, Adams was ahead of Garcia 51% to 49%, with a margin of just under 16,000 votes among more than 700,000 total ballots.\n\nWiley was the final candidate eliminated; in the penultimate round, she trailed Garcia by fewer than 4,000 votes.\n\nTuesday\u2019s count, however, did not include any of the approximately 125,000 absentee ballots that have been received, which could easily alter the final results.\n\nGarcia\u2019s campaign has said it expects to benefit from absentee ballots, which were turned in at high rates in neighborhoods where she did better than Adams and Wiley. In a statement, Garcia said she was \u201cconfident about a path to victory.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Wiley called for every vote to be counted and urged all New Yorkers to support the results.\n\nElections officials plan to rerun the ranked-choice voting tabulation next week, this time with at least some absentee ballots included. Final results are not expected until mid-July.\n\nLast week, Adams had 32% of first-choice ballots, based on the incomplete results released on Election Day. Wiley was at 22%, and Garcia stood in third at 19%.\n\nAndrew Yang, the former presidential candidate, was in a distant fourth place and conceded on election night.\n\nThe winner of the Democratic primary will be a heavy favourite in November\u2019s general election against Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels civilian patrol group.\n\nDemocratic voters outnumber Republicans in the United States\u2019 most populous city by more than a six-to-one ratio.\n\nThe rise in crime dominated the campaign, providing an early look at how Democrats nationally might approach the issue of policing ahead of next year\u2019s congressional midterm elections.\n\nRepublicans intend to portray Democrats as left-wing extremists who want to \u201cdefund the police,\u201d a rallying cry echoed by some liberals last year amid nationwide protests over police brutality.\n\nAdams, a former police officer who put public safety at the heart of his bid for mayor, vowed to reinforce policing.\n\nWiley, by contrast, argued for cutting one-sixth of the police department\u2019s $6 billion budget and redirecting money to mental health aid and other social services.",

          "title": "Why NNPC Is Borrowing To Acquire 20 Percent Equity In Dangote Refinery \u2013 Mele Kyari",
          "text": "\ufeff\n\nSolomon Elusoji, Lagos\n\nThe Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mele Kyari, on Tuesday explained why the national oil company is purchasing a stake in Dangote oil refinery.\n\nThe refinery is expected to begin production in 2022 with an installed 650,000 barrels per day capacity.\n\nIt has been touted as a groundbreaking project for energy security in the country and for the African continent.\n\nIn May, the NNPC announced that it plans to acquire a 20 percent equity stake in the private company led by billionaire Aliko Dangote.\n\n\u201cThere is no resource-dependent country that will watch a business of this scale, which borders on energy security and has implications for fiscal security of the country, and you don\u2019t have a say,\u201d Mr Kyari said on Tuesday while appearing on Channels Television\u2019s Sunrise Daily.\n\nHe argued that the decision was also driven by the profit potential of the refinery business.\n\n\u201cFor the Dangote refinery, we are not taking government money to buy it, which is the mistake that people are making,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are borrowing on the back of the cash-flow of this business.\n\n\u201cWe know that this business is viable, it will work and it will return dividends. It has a cash-flow that is sustainable because refinery business, in the short term, will continue to be sustainable.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why banks have come forward to lend to us, so we can take equity in this.\u201d\n\nWhat Mr Kyari Said\n\n\u201cDangote refinery will come into production by 2022. And what that will do is to deliver over 50 million litres of gasoline into, to be specific, our markets. We are also working on our refineries, to ensure that we fix them. We have awarded the contract for Port Harcourt refinery rehabilitation. And ultimately we are going to close that of Warri and Kaduna very soon in July, so that all of them will work contemporaneously. The net effect is that you are going to have an environment where Nigeria becomes the hub of petroleum products and supply. It\u2019s going to change the dynamics of petroleum supply globally in the sense that the flow is coming from Europe today and it is going to be reversed to some other direction. We will be the supplier for West Africa legitimately and also many other parts of the world.\n\n\u201cSo the meaning of this is, there is an opportunity that has been thrown at us. And I\u2019m not sure Mr Dangote wants to sell his equity in the refinery. I can confirm that it was at our instance that we started this engagement. He did not want to sell his shares in this refinery.\n\n\u201cThere is no resource-dependent country that will watch a business of this scale, which has bordering on energy security and has implications for fiscal security of the country, and you don\u2019t have a say. And for us, as a strategy, we started this process long before Dangote started his refinery project. We take equity in very significant businesses that are anchored on the oil and gas operations: fertiliser, methanol plants, modular refineries and some other businesses that we are dealing with.\n\n\u201cIt is to expand our portfolio and also because we are the national oil company, we have the responsibility to guarantee energy security for our country. And there is no way you can have a say, except you have a seat on the board of these institutions. And that\u2019s why anyone that is going to construct a refinery that is in the excess of 50,000 barrels per day, we will talk to them, take equity in it, as long as we have the money to pay for it.\n\n\u201cFor the Dangote refinery, we are not taking government money to buy it, which is the mistake that people are making. We are borrowing on the back of the cash-flow of this business. We know that this business is viable, it will work and it will return dividends. It has a cash-flow that is sustainable because refinery business, in the short term, will continue to be sustainable. That\u2019s why banks have come forward to lend to us, so we can take equity in this.\n\n\u201cWe are very proud that we did this. This is good for our shareholders, which includes all 200 Nigerians who will also be happily buying shares from this company if they had the opportunity. But now we have done on their behalf, so that ultimately the value will come to all of us.\n\n\u201cBut there is no way you can watch a business of this magnitude, of this sensitivity, to run without the involvement of the national oil company. No country does this.\u201d\n\nFuel subsidy\n\nMr Kyari also suggested that the inability to find an appropriate price for petrol has forced the continuation of the subsidy scheme.\n\nThe NNPC is currently the sole, official importer of petroleum products into the country.\n\nWhile its landing price is about N256 per litre, according to Mr Kyari, petrol sells for N162 to N165 in most parts of Lagos.\n\nIn March 2020, the Federal Government said it would allow market forces to dictate the pump price of petrol.\n\nBut after oil prices rose in the preceding months, the Federal Government decided not to adjust the price correspondingly under pressure from organised labour.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that we cannot afford it,\u201d Mr Kyari said.\n\n\u201cBut also the second reality is if you don\u2019t do something smart, you could end up throwing prices at Nigerians that are well above prices that they should pay for.\u201d\n\nThe NNPC chief said the government is still engaging with organised labour and other stakeholders on how to properly price the product.\n\n\u201cThe engagement is aimed at making sure there is a reasonable level of pricing that we can do that will recover the cost,\u201d he said.\n\nFuel smuggling\n\nMeanwhile, a huge chunk of the petroleum the NNPC pays for is being smuggled to neighbouring countries where they are sold at higher prices.\n\n\u201cPetroleum consumption in Nigeria is not up to 60 million litres per day, but we supply up to that,\u201d Mr Kyari said.\n\n\u201cWe always plan with 60 million litres, because anytime we do below that, there is a crisis.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged that there \u201care sharp practices which we are trying to control\u201d and \u201can organised cross-border smuggling of petroleum, which is associated with the price of petroleum itself.\u201d\n\nThe smuggling, he noted, is exacerbated by the fact that Nigeria shares borders with countries who have no choice but to transport petroleum by road.\n\nWhen borders were shut last year, the NNPC chief said, consumption fell to 52 to 53 million litres per day.\n\nAnd during the thick of the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, the number fell to about 42 million litres.\n\n\u201cIf everything works well and consumption is limited to our country, we are dealing with about 42 million litres,\u201d Mr Kyari said.",
