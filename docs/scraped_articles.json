          "text": "The Catholic Diocese of Ondo has fixed Friday, June 17, 2022 for the mass burial of those who lost their lives in the terrorists attack on St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo , Ondo State last week Sunday.\n\nAccording to the church, no fewer than 40 people died in the attack while many others sustained injuries.\n\nThe Diocese\u2019s Director of Social Communication, Rev. Fr. Augustine Ikwu, confirmed the date of the mass burial to our correspondent on Monday.\n\nAccording Ikwu, the mass burial would take place at the church\u2019s new cemetery at Emure Road, Owo.\n\n\u201cThe mass burial would take place at the new cemetery of the church on Friday in Owo,\u201d he said.\n\nHe maintained that the number of the deceased still remained 40.\n\nIt was gathered that the injured victims are still receiving treatment at the Federal Medical Centre and the St. Louis Catholic Hospital both in Owo and some other private hospitals in the state.\n\nHowever, no one has been arrested in connection with the attack.\n\nMeanwhile, the Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has declared a three-day mourning for the victims of the attack.\n\nThe governor, in a statement issued by the state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omostoso, on Monday, directed that all flags should fly at half-mast as part of decision to mourn the victims at the Southern Governors\u2019 meeting.\n\nSanwo-Olu also urged Lagos residents and visitors to remain law-abiding and vigilant as the government is doing everything to ensure that peace continues to prevail in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cFlags are flying at half-mast in Lagos following Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu\u2019s directive. The action is for three days to mourn the victims of the St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo State, terrorist attack.\n\n\u201cThe decision to mourn the victims came at a Southwest Governors\u2019 June 10 virtual meeting, which reviewed the security situation in the region. The communique issued after the meeting was signed by Governors Rotimi Akeredolu, Ondo; Kayode Fayemi, Ekiti; Gboyega Oyetola, Osun; Dapo Abiodun, Ogun; Seyi Makinde, Oyo and Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos.\n\n\u201cThe governors condemned in very strong terms the horrendous crime perpetrated by terrorists against the people and residents of Owo, Ondo State and, by extension, the peace-loving people of the South-West.\u201d",

          "text": "By Ugochukwu Alaribe \u2013 Umuahia\n\nFollowing the failure of the Igbo man to clinch the presidential ticket of the ruling All Progressive Congress,APC, and the major opposition party ,the Peoples Democratic Party PDP, chieftain of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Prince Richard Ozobu,has said that the Igbo can only actualize their dream of producing a Nigerian president through going into political alliances with other sections of the country.\n\nOzobu told Vanguard since it is known that no section of the country can produce a president on its own,Ndigbo could have long concluded an alliance through the support and acceptance of other zones.\n\nHe advised that producing the president requires tact ,strategy and long term planning and alliances in reaching out to various interest groups across the federation.\n\nRead Also:\n\nWhy next election should ride on Blockchain-enabled e-voting\n\nCourt strikes out suit to invalidate 1999 Constitution, stop Ekiti guber election\n\n2023: Sowore, Adeyanju lampoon Peter Obi over Egypt trip\n\nIn his words; \u201cNo tribe can get the presidency alone,you must get the support and acceptance of others through going into alliances with other sections of the country.Since Igbo leaders are aware of this fact, what have they done to get the support and acceptance of other zones for the Igbo presidency project?\n\n\u201cYou can see that most of the Igbo aspirants in the last presidential primaries were not even prepared. None of them told us their agenda. Most of the Igbo presidential aspirants were only campaigning in Abuja.We didn\u2019t see their posters in any of the Igbo cities.There was no interface with Igbo leaders on their vision. Igbo votes can\u2019t make anyone president neither can it deny anyone the presidency as we have seen.\n\nTherefore ,we must learn our lessons. We must emulate the great Dr.Nnamdi Azikiwe and Dr. Michael Okpara who entered into alliances with the North during their time. You saw that the Igbo benefitted from the Azikiwe and Okpara alliances with the North.\n\nIt was through alliance that we produced Ekwueme as Vice President and Ume Ezoke as Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Igbo have done well in commerce and industry ,but we lack same quality in politics. President Muhammadu Buhari chose his running mates,Dr.Chuba Okadigbo and Chief Edwin Umezuoke from the South East in 2003 and 2007, respectively ,but the Igbo rejected their sons. If Buhari\u2019s nomination of Okadigbo or Ume Ezoke had succeeded, it would have been the easiest way to produce a Nigerian president of Igbo extraction.\n\nBut Buhari went to the South West zone for the second time in 2015 after 2011,and the alliance with the South West worked. So, 2023 is pay back time for the South West. You can see what the Igbo lost? We ought to have learnt our lessons from 2003 and 2007,but we didnt.\u201d\n\nHe lamented that the Igbo ,especially the South East zone, also missed the opportunity of replicating the 1999 agreement which the then two major political parties produced two presidential candidates from the South West zone,because of its inability to build alliances.\n\n\u201cBecause of lack of strategic planning and inability to align with other sections ,we missed the opportunity of getting the type of agreement which the then two major parties in 1999 elected their presidential candidates from the South West.\n\nWe need to reach out,negotiate,build bridges of friendship and alliances and support and assure other tribes of what will be their benefit in Igbo presidency.\n\nIf we desired the presidency in 2023, we ought to have started planning for it more than 10 years ago,it requires proper and long term planning,not a fire brigade thing. Political alliance is the only way to actualize presidency project. It is either we embrace it or continue to lament exclusion.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Miftaudeen Raji\n\nChief Whip of the Nigerian Senate, Orji Uzor Kalu has appealed to Christians in Nigeria not to worry over speculations that the All Progressives Congress, APC may consider a Muslim vice presidential candidate for its flag bearer, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.\n\nKalu, who made the appeal, Wednesday, while addressing journalists at the National Assembly, stated that Christians shouldn\u2019t feel threatened over such a move, because Tinubu\u2019s wife, Oluremi Tinubu, a Senator representing Lagos East Senatorial District, is a Senior Pastor.\n\nHis words: \u201cDo you want me to speak the truth, if I am in Ahmed Bola Tinubu\u2019s situation. I will go Muslim-Muslim ticket. The most important thing is for the party to win. We should stop all this rubbish about whether you put a Christian, after all the wife is a pastor and she is already like a deputy president.\u201d\n\nA video posted by Viable TV on Youtube and monitored by Vanguard captured the moment.\n\nThe former Governor of Abia state said, \u201cLet me tell you, in my house, my wife is the head of the house in reality. Even you men that are here, now that your wives aren\u2019t here, they are the head. Like if I wear this cloth, my wife will tell me \u2018My dear, this cloth is not good to remove.\n\n\u201cYour wife will tell you you are supposed to eat Akara and Akamu, whether you argue with her, you must take that Akamu and your wife wants you to pay children school fees, whether you argue or not, you must pay.\n\n\u201cThe Christians should relax because Tinubu\u2019s wife is a pastor and once she\u2019s a pastor we are protected because she\u2019s not a housewife. She has political knowledge,\u201d he said.\n\nRecall that prior to the APC primary, Kalu was a frontline campaigner for the presidency of President of the Senate, Ahmed Lawan, who was perceived to be the consensus presidential candidate of the ruling party.",

Later, people will come to shout rigging.\n\n\u201cPeter Obi should be going to Ekiti, not Egypt.

This was how Moghalu was all over social media but someone called Dumebi defeated him,\u201d he added.\n\nPresidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC), Omoyele Sowore has described Obi as an unprepared presidential candidate.\n\nSowore, via his verified Twitter handle said, \u201cHeard @PeterObi traveled to Egypt to learn how to fix Education/Power problems, this is exactly the problem with unprepared candidates.\n\n\u201cIt is 9 months to the election & a two-term gov. & former VP candidate wants to go learn something from Egypt in 3 days?

          "text": "Senate Chief Whip Orji Uzor Kalu has stated that a Muslim-Muslim ticket is the only option for pesidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu in 2023.\n\nKalu, who spoke while answering questions from reporters at the Senate, said it would be politically naive for Tinubu, a minority Muslim from the South-West, to choose a minority Christian from the North as his running mate.\n\nHe insisted that since Tinubu\u2019s wife is a senior pastor with the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), she will balance the ticket as a \u2018de facto deputy president\u2019 should Tinubu win the presidency.\n\nHe said that APC cannot afford to field two minorities and expect to win the 2023 presidential election.\n\nOn if he will support a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket for the APC, Kalu said: \u201cListen, do you want me to speak frankly? If I am in Ahmed Bola Tinubu\u2019s position, the wife is a Pastor in a Pentecostal Church. I will go for Muslim-Muslim ticket. The most important thing is for the party to win. We should stop this rubbish about religion.\n\n\u201cWhether you put a Christian there, after all, if we win, already the wife is a Pastor and they have been living together for over 40 years. These are facts. So, don\u2019t blame anyone, Tinubu\u2019s wife is already like a deputy president. I am saying my opinion. I am a Catholic. This is Orji Kalu\u2019s opinion. You cannot deny me my opinion.\n\n\u201cBut you can also play Christian-Christian tickets depending on the scenario. Because if we don\u2019t play the Muslim-Muslim ticket, we are in trouble, it will be difficult to win the election because the only thing left for Ahmed Tinubu today is to play Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\n\u201cI know the Church I go to, the Catholic Social Secretariat may not be happy about this but what is wrong with Muslim-Muslim ticket?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anything wrong with it. There is nothing wrong with Christian-Christian ticket, it depends on the condition. The condition we found ourselves in today is that you cannot play two minorities.\n\n\u201cTinubu is a minority Muslim from the South, if you put a minority Christian from the North, the minority can\u2019t get it. It is difficult. What I am telling you is the position of mine, it is not the position of my party. This is Orji Kalu\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been with Tinubu\u2019s wife in the Senate and the wife is a Pastor, so there is nothing wrong with that. Moreover, I\u2019ve known Tinubu for a very long time. He is a man who brings Christians and Muslims together. He is a man who can do the work.\n\n\u201cFor me, the issue of Christian ticket, I know some people will not like what I am saying but putting a Christian will not make him to be the best president, or putting a Muslim will not make him to be the best president. It is his conscience. Conscience is an open wound, only the truth can heal it.\u201d\n\nOn whether picking a Muslim running mate would not make Tinubu to over depend on the North, Kalu said: \u201cAre the northerners not Nigerians? Are they not Nigerians? I ask you, answer me. Are they not Nigerians?\n\n\u201cLet me tell you, are you Nigerians doing religion. Let me tell you, in my house, my wife is the head of the House in reality.\n\n\u201cEven you men that are here, you may deny that your wife is not the head of the family. In reality, they are the ones.\n\n\u201cIf I put these clothes on, my wife will tell you to come, this clothes are not good. You will say that you want it but finally you will remove it.\n\n\u201cShe will say you will take \u2018akara and akamu\u2019 as breakfast and you will take it. Your wife wants you to pay the children \u2018s school fees. You will do it.\n\n\u201cEither you like it or not, women are the head of the family. They counsel you and Tinubu\u2019s wife is a Pastor. Once she is a Pastor, we are protected.\n\n\u201cShe is not a housewife. She has political knowledge. She is in the Senate. So, when I say this, you people will say I am a houseboy to the northerners.\n\n\u201cI am not a House boy to anybody. I don\u2019t fear anybody. If the president is a westerner or a northerner, I will tell him the truth because I\u2019ve reached a stage in life where nobody feeds me and I don\u2019t need to talk to anybody to feed. I am not even afraid of death. If I speak, I speak the truth.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his next option after Ahmad Lawan failed to secure the Presidential ticket of the party, Kalu said he would work for Tinubu and APC to win the general elections in 2023 including the presidency.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe next is to work for Tinubu and work for the APC candidate. No alternative. I am a party man and I am sure, most of you know that I am a very strong party man. I don\u2019t shy away from issues.\n\n\u201cNow, the way I fought for Ahmad Lawan, is the way I will fight for Ahmed Tinubu. I am a party man, if I disagree, I will disagree.\n\n\u201cSo, the most important thing now, I agree that Bola Tinubu won, and the whole APC agreed. Nobody is in doubt about winning. And if nobody is in doubt, we will all have to go back to the field. And I pray that my constituency which gave Buhari 68 per cent and the South East will give us that belief and will give us the votes as they gave Buhari.\n\n\u201cWell, I told people that they don\u2019t know Muhammadu Buhari and that he was not going to take sides and that is exactly what happened.\n\n\u201cPeople try their luck and the message is that Buhari did not take sides. It helps democracy. He also talked to the governors not to take sides. When I was Governor, I ensured that my own candidate won. But there was a lot of rancour and we need to allow democracy to prevail.",

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nFr. Michael Umoh, the church noted that the decision by any political party to field candidates of same religion wouldn\u2019t have been an issue, but for the fragility and suspicion in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, there would have been nothing wrong with a Muslim-Muslim or Christian-Christian ticket in a democratic dispensation if there is mutual trust and respect for the human person and where the overriding desire for seeking political office is the fostering of the common good. But one cannot really say so of our country at the moment.\n\n\u201cWith the present glaring crisis and division in the nation, a Muslim-Muslim ticket would be most insensitive and a tacit endorsement of the negative voices of many non-state actors who have been threatening this nation\u2019s unity and peaceful coexistence without an arrest.\n\n\u201cEven in the despotic military era, most juntas ensured a balance of the religious architecture in their regimes. For instance, we had Murtala-Obasanjo, Obasanjo-Yar\u2019adua, Babangida-Ebitu Ukiwe, Abacha \u2013 Diya. This also applied to the Heads of the various military formations and the different government parastatals like Customs, Immigrations, Finance, etc. Significantly, it was only during the General Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s era as military Head of State (31 December,1983 \u2013 27 August,1985) that we had a Muslim-Muslim military dictatorship.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, only once did we have a Muslim-Muslim ticket in the 1993 democratic elections, which featured Abiola-Kingibe ticket and turned out to be one of Nigeria\u2019s freest and fairest elections. But that government never took off. Fast forward to 2022, 30 years later, some individuals have tried to suggest the Muslim-Muslim ticket for the Presidential election in a country like Nigeria that has unfortunately been badly polarised.\u201d\n\nThe Catholic Church, thus, advised political parties toying with divisive agenda to have a rethink by presenting a more inclusive ticket, while calling on all people of goodwill to resist the budding injustice that may be hatched against a cross section of the people.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to note that all Nigerians, irrespective of creed or region, are equal, as such, there must be sensitivity in the spread of political positions without compromising competence. We call on all Nigerians, individually and collectively, to do everything in their power to seek and work for peace, unity and justice in Nigeria,\u201d it said.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "From Uche Usim, Abuja\n\nFrom the World Bank came a frightening report yesterday that the Nigerian economy has sunk into its lowest level in the nation\u2019s history as it recommended the deployment of sound fiscal and monetary policies to tow it out of the doldrums.\n\nThe gloomy picture, which was contained in global bank\u2019s Development Updates on Nigeria, presented in Abuja on Tuesday, said inflation would push seven million more Nigerians into poverty by the end of 2022.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThe report stated that petrol subsidies could cost Nigeria as much as N5.4 trillion in 2022, much higher than \u201call of the resources allocated to health, education, and social protection together\u201d.\n\nIt also projected that net oil/ gas revenue for 2022 will fall to N1.6 trillion from N2.6 trillion recorded in 2021.\n\nThe startling report was presented by the Lead Economist for Nigeria at the World Bank, Dr. Marco Hernandez, who attributed the economic nightmare to a plethora of policy distortions on the part of the Nigerian government and global shocks that have fueled inflation.\n\nHe painted a particularly worrisome picture of the Nigerian situation, that it was not just the price of imported products that were skyrocketing, but includes locally-produced goods.\n\nHernandez noted that the high inflation has crashed the value of the national minimum wage of N30,000 ($82), which is now worth N22,000 ($37).\n\nThe fast-eroding minimum wage aside, the World Bank reckoned that most Nigerian families earn N15,000 monthly which was worsening the poverty situation in the country.\n\nHe further stated that there is a nexus between foreign exchange rate and inflation, adding that when the former\u2019s rates go up at the parallel market, inflation rate follows automatically.\n\nHe said: \u201csuboptimal exchange rate management is fuelling inflation due to FX supply constraints and lack of predictability, which is ultimately leading to a rise in the parallel exchange rate which is closely associated with inflation.\n\n\u201cImport and FX restrictions reduce the supply of food and key staples, increasing their prices and those of associated goods. The monetization of fiscal deficits by the Central Bank of Nigeria (ways and means) and CBN\u2019s subsidized lending to firms add to inflationary expectations\u201d.\n\nThe report noted that despite that the rising price of crude in the international market due to the Russia-Ukraine war, Nigeria\u2019s oil production and revenue have continued to slump because of several factors.\n\nThe Bank said it was quite concerned about Nigeria\u2019s fiscal side, emphasizing that Nigeria needa to address fiscal deficits most urgently.\n\nReacting to the report, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, who spoke virtually noted that the huge amount spent on petrol subsidy has put the economy on ventilators and threatening its survival.\n\nShe passed the buck on subsidy removal to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe really are at a crossroads and there are very difficult times. It is actually paradoxical. At a time when growth is accelerating there are so many other challenges that have gathered and are impacting the lives of the people.\n\n\u201cOn our part, we are going to reduce the fiscal pressures caused by the increase in our deficit caused by increase in PMS subsidies. These PMS subsidies are costing us an additional N4 trillion than was originally planned.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "\u2022Says president refused to act as autocrat at APC convention\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\nThe Presidency, yesterday, dismissed insinuations about President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s decision-making process, saying the president is in charge, and has been responsible for all decisions taken by his administration in the last seven years without interference from any third party or cabal. Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, stated this yesterday in a release.\n\nShehu made reference to the recent presidential primary of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), stressing that Buhari refused to act as a dictator; instead, he ensured a level playing field for all participants.\n\nHe emphasised that contrary to swirling misgivings in some quarters, the president had never relied on the opinions of third party elements, but had always taken his decisions without the backup of the so-called cabals or back-up boys.\n\nThe presidential aide said those still assailing the APC and the president, expounding conspiracy theories, and making all manner of speculations needed to understand those important points about the country\u2019s leader.\n\nShehu said the strong leader myth had lasted for far too long in the country, with people assuming that a leader must dominate everything, and even determine electoral outcomes.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cLuckily, for Nigeria, President Buhari does not suffer from such constraints. He refuses to act as the elected autocrat. The president had a clear purpose leading up to the primary: to ensure a transparent, free and fair process that will bring back people\u2019s faith in democracy by taking good governance up to the grassroots level.\n\n\u201cBy this alone, people\u2019s faith and that of the international community in our democracy has received a major boost since the completion of the APC nomination. The flag-bearer has been chosen. He has the president\u2019s unwavering support. The journey to victory continues.\u201d\n\nThe presidential spokesman, however, clarified that the speculations in the media about the president\u2019s favourite candidate ahead of the APC primary were expected, especially, in a situation where the opportunity to choose a presidential candidate came once in eight years.\n\nAccording to him, the successful conduct of the convention and the eventual emergence of the party\u2019s standard-bearer must have been a disappointment for those who assembled to witness a catastrophe.\n\nShehu stated, \u201cNo intrigue, no division, no disagreement, no defeated candidates rejecting the result, no splits, no third-party runs. Only determination to rally around the chosen flag-bearer to deliver victory and an APC third term in February 2023. The opposition reaction to this successful nomination convention has come by way of a counter offensive, so that we do not go on the offensive.\u201d\n\nHe alleged that there was clear evidence of a conspiracy to destabilise the governing party and defame the president, as the media were inundated with made up stories and speculating about the role of the president in the contest: whether he had a favoured candidate, and whether manoeuvres were made to install him; whether the chosen flag-bearer was the president\u2019s choice, or another.\n\nThe presidential aide further stated, \u201cSpeculation is easy. But facts are simple. The president always said he had a favoured candidate. He said that candidate was whoever was chosen by the APC in a democratic primary to lead the party at the election.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Sunday Aborisade\n\n\n\nIt was a day of high drama at plenary yesterday in the Senate, as both the Majority Leader and Minority Leader resigned their posts, and nearly 70 per cent of the senators lost their bid to return to the red chamber.\n\nThe Senate resumed after a six-week recess announced to enable members to participate in the congresses and conventions of their political parties ahead of next year\u2019s general election.\n\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan announced the resignation of the Majority Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, and Majority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe. Lawan said the resignations followed the senators\u2019 defection from the political parties under which they got elected into the Senate.\n\nHe said Abdullahi, in his letter of resignation, attributed his decision to his defection from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nAbaribe, on the other hand, defected from PDP to the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Lawan said.\n\nThe senate president, in yet another letter, notified his colleagues that the chairman, Senate Committee on Works, Senator Adamu Aliero, had defected from APC to PDP.\n\nLawan, therefore, directed the Chief Whip, Senator Orji Kalu, to relocate both the former senate leader and his colleague in the minority caucus to other seats.\n\nAbaribe\u2019s defection to APGA and formal exit as Minority Leader was deferred as a result of the inability of the senate president to come with his defection and resignation letter to plenary.\n\nLawan said Abaribe\u2019s letter would be formally read on the floor before his exit as Minority Leader.\n\nThe defections of Abdullahi and Aliero, both from Kebbi State, were conveyed in two separate letters addressed to the senate president, and read on the floor during plenary. Abdullahi and Aliero represent Kebbi North and Kebbi Central senatorial districts, respectively.\n\nThe defections brought the total number of PDP senators to 39, from 38, with the exclusion of Abaribe, who is set to formally defect from the main opposition party to APGA on Wednesday. It also cut down the number of APC senators from 71 to 69.\n\nThe senate leader, in his letter titled, \u201cDefection From APC to PDP And Resignation As The Majority Leader Of The 9th Senate,\u201d said his decision was informed by the democratic challenges and deficits faced by APC in Kebbi State. He explained that all attempts to remedy the situation through the intervention of the North-west zone\u2019s governors and the defunct Abdullahi Adamu-led National Reconciliation Committee failed.\n\nAliero also cited same reasons advanced by Abdullahi for his defection.\n\nAttempts by Senators Phillip Aduda, George Thompson, and Gabriel Suswan to stop the relocation of Abaribe, because he had not formally communicated his decision to his caucus, were rejected by the senate president.\n\nHe also advised Senator Betty Apiaffi to seek legal redress, when she cited constitutional provisions, which required the defectors to lose their seats.\n\nMeanwhile, Lawan advised his colleagues, who lost the just concluded primary elections, to cheer up and continue to pursue what they believed in. He also wished those, who defected to other political parties, well and prayed for better opportunities for them in the nearest future.\n\nLawan called on lawmakers to stay committed to the political system of their respective parties, not minding the outcome of the just concluded primaries.\n\nThe upper chamber had suspended plenary on May 11 to enable lawmakers participate in the primaries of their political parties.\n\nLawan, in his welcome address, underscored the need for the senate to prioritise the country\u2019s security challenges, and undertake further amendment of the Electoral Act. He said the electoral process in the just concluded primaries had thrown up issues that must be critically looked at by the National Assembly.\n\nSpeaking on the outcome of the party primaries, he said, \u201cSome of us participated in the congresses for their senatorial districts, some of our colleagues went for governorship of their states, and four of us went for the presidency of our great country.\n\n\u201cWe have recorded different results from those activities, but as politicians, it is never over until it is over. We should continue to support the political system that we believe in. Those of our colleagues who have recorded successes, we wish them more successes in the general election. And those who have not succeeded as much, we are hopeful that between now and then, the situation may be better.\n\n\u201cBut on the whole, our commitment to ensuring that this democracy benefits from legislative interventions of the National Assembly should remain our focus. As a parliament, we still have issues that require our legislative intervention.\n\n\u201cThe electoral process may have thrown up certain issues that the National Assembly could also look at and address, because the Electoral Act itself, even though a good document, is not a perfects document. So, it needs some refinement from time to time to improve our electoral process.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What does Gozem and IFC partnership mean?",
          "text": "12 million.\n\nThat\u2019s the estimated number of motor vehicle drivers that Gozem, a Francophone Africa-focused super app, says operate in informal markets across West and Central Africa. But there\u2019s a problem: these drivers do not have access to traditional banks or micro-finance institutions to finance their vehicles. Instead, they rely on money lenders that charge ridiculous interest rates\u2014some are as high as 70% annually.\n\nGozem, which provides a suite of mobility, e-commerce, and financial services to drivers, retailers, and other consumers, announced on Friday that it has partnered with the International Financial Commission (IFC) to solve these headaches for drivers.\n\nIFC has dedicated a $10 million investment into Gozem\u2019s vehicle financing project. This investment will enable Gozem to provide access to affordable vehicle financing in Togo and Benin, its operating markets.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThis deal comes about 6 months after Gozem closed a $5 million funding and 14 months after it started its vehicle financing program. The company said it has already helped more than 2,000 drivers acquire vehicles with affordable financing. This new partnership will finance new vehicles for 6,000 more drivers.\n\n\u201cMotor vehincle drivers in West and Central Africa will need access to $3 billion dollars of credit facilities annually to finance their vehicles and we are excited that IFC is placing their trust in Gozem to be at the forefront of providing affordable financing solutions to these underserved communities,\u201d Gregory Costamagna, co-founder and co-CEO of Gozem, said in a statement.\n\nUnlike banks that require credit history, asset collateral, or guarantors before issuing loans, or third-party lenders who charge cut-throat interest rates that are only increasing, Gozem simply uses drivers\u2019 data already available on its platform. The company provides this service by leveraging what Costamagna called its \u201csophisticated\u201d KYC process, financial and behavioural data, like the number of trips completed using its app\u2014which can be accessed in a matter of minutes\u2014to calculate drivers\u2019 credit worthiness. This alleviates drivers from keeping track of their bank statements and records; simply by using the app to find riders and gigs, Gozem knows how much they earn and how long they are likely to take to make their payments.\n\nGozem said in a statement sent to TechCabal that for the next year, they will also work with the IFC to test electric bikes in motovehicle operating conditions and \u201cbuild a green battery-swapping station network in Togo and Benin to demonstrate electric bikes can save drivers money.\u201d\n\nGozem\u2019s Raphael Dana, Costamagna\u2019s counterpart as co-founder and co-CEO told TechCabal over the phone that IFC is starting a pilot investment to test the impact and scalability of this model and will double down based on the result of the pilot.\n\nHe added that this partnership also factors in electric vehicles (EV). \u201cWe have set aside 10% of the investment for our EV pilot phase. There\u2019s a dedicated team working on our EV ambition and we need to ensure that the bikes, battery swapping, economic units, etc. work at scale,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s statement, the project will \u201cvalidate electric bikes and that their adoption at scale will not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly, but it will also help drivers save money through lower energy and maintenance costs.\u201d\n\n\u201cElectric vehicles have the power to said Aliou Maiga, IFC\u2019s Regional Director for West and Central Africa, emphasised that EVs have the potential to \u201ctransform the moto-taxi market in West and Central Africa by lowering carbon emissions and lowering operating costs for drivers.\u201d She said that by partnering with Gozem, together they could \u201cincrease affordable and green financing solutions for moto-taxi drivers to shift to electric bikes.\n\n\u201cWe hope IFC\u2019s investment for these underserved communities will encourage other investors and accelerate the reduction of poverty and greenhouse gasses emissions in these markets,\u201d she added.\n\nThere\u2019s been a significant uptick in access financing initiatives lately. Last year, Asaak went into a partnership with Untapped Global to finance 2,000 bikes in Uganda\u2014both EV and fossil-fuel vehicles. Untapped Global had also entered a similar partnership with South African Flexclub.\n\nLooks like Gozem is gearing up for some big funding. In March, Dana told Africa Report that the company was seeking an $80m Series B\u2014$50 million in equity, $20m in debt, and a $10 million pre-series B\u2014fundraising as it prepares to expand to new markets like Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Senegal.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "NITDA's Code of Practice to help Nigeria regulate social media",
          "text": "Months after it lifted its 7-month ban on Twitter, the Nigerian government has set out to regulate social media platforms with a new Code of Practice. Plans for the Code of Practice were announced in January by Director-General of NITDA, Mr Kashifu Inuwa.\n\nYesterday, the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) announced that it had developed a draft Code of Practice for Interactive Computer Service Platforms/Internet Intermediaries\u2014defined by the code as \u201celectronic medium or site where services are provided by means of a computer resource and on-demand and where users create, upload, share, disseminate, modify, or access information, including websites that provide reviews, gaming Platform, online sites for conducting commercial transactions.\u201d\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\n13th June 2022\n\n\n\nNational Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) Issues a Code of Practice for Interactive Computer Service Platforms/Internet Intermediaries and Conditions for Operating in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/N9y3qfyCIu \u2014 NITDA Nigeria (@NITDANigeria) June 13, 2022\n\nAccording to NITDA, the draft was developed in collaboration with the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC), with input from platforms like Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Google, and TikTok.\n\nIn the statement signed by NITDA Head of Corporate Affairs and External Relationships, Hadiza Umar, the Code is supposedly aimed at \u201cprotecting the fundamental human rights of Nigerians and non-Nigerians living in the country, as well as defining guidelines for interacting on the digital ecosystem\u201d.\n\nWhat the Code instructs\n\nNITDA instructs that all Interactive Computer Service Platforms with more than 100,000 users would be required to fulfil certain conditions in order to operate in the country. While this includes US-based social media platforms, it also includes indigenous sites like Nairaland, blogs like Linda Ikeji, and newsletter platforms like Substack with over 100,000 users.\n\nThese platforms would have to register as legal entities with the country\u2019s Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), pay taxes, appoint country representatives, and more notably, \u201cprovide information to the Nigerian government on harmful accounts, troll groups, and deleting all information that violates Nigerian law\u201d.\n\nThe draft Code is divided into 5 parts with the first 2 parts laying down the responsibilities of the Interactive Computer Service Platforms, while Part IV\u2014titled \u201cProhibitions\u201d\u2014lays down orders for the removal of material prohibited by Nigerian law. According to the draft, \u201cProhibited Material\u201d includes anything that threatens public interest, order, security, peace and morality\u2014content which must be taken down within 24 hours.\n\nIn Part I of the draft Code, NITDA lays down 11 primary responsibilities which include abiding by Nigerian laws, providing dedicated channels for government agencies to lodge complaints, removing any content reported by government agencies within 24 hours, disclosing identities of reported creators to the Nigerian government, and expeditiously removing non-consensual sexual content.\n\nPart II of the draft Code consigns 12 additional responsibilities including the requirement for Interactive Computer Service Platforms to file annual compliance reports that detail the numbers of [active] registered Nigerian users, deactivated accounts, and removed content, among other things. This part lists the responsibilities of the platforms to inform the users of their obligations which include abiding by all Nigerian laws.\n\nNigeria\u2019s poor regulatory history\n\nThere are few provisions within the draft Code that fulfills NITDA\u2019s aim of \u201cprotecting the fundamental human rights of Nigerians\u201d. For example, Items 4 and 5 of Part I seek to protect Nigerians from promoting revenge porn and child sexual abuse materials (CSAM), while Item 1 of Part II promotes equal distribution of information for Nigerian users.\n\nAccording to \u2018Tooni Ajiboye, a lawyer and writer, \u201cThe good part of the bill is that it tries to hold these social media platforms accountable for all the information and mechanisms promoted on their platform. There are, however, red flags in the draft Code and they unfortunately outweigh the good.\u201d\n\nAs Ajiboye explains it, the biggest red flag in the draft Code is how much information it wants to control. \u201cThere are about 5 classes of information highlighted: misinformation, disinformation, harmful content, unlawful content, and prohibited materials. While unlawful content already has legal backing, misinformation and harmful content are left to discretion. It\u2019s easy to point out where child sexual abuse materials are criminalised in Nigerian law but the same can\u2019t be said for what the draft defines as prohibited or harmful material.\u201d\n\nPart IV of the code, which examines Prohibited Material, prescribes that all content that is contrary to morality, or public interest should be deleted once a complaint is made. This brings to light the possibility of the Nigerian government going after citizens who post materials in support of LGBTQ persons, or anyone posting content deemed religiously \u201cblasphemous\u201d, a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment in many Nigerian states.\n\nPart IV of NITDA\u2019s draft Code of Practice\n\nWhile these provisions wouldn\u2019t constitute a problem in other regions, Nigeria\u2019s history is riddled with fundamental human rights infringement and the misappropriation of laws. In the events following its #EndSARS protests where Nigerian youths fighting against police brutality were thrust into the global spotlight, many faced imprisonment and financial sanctions due to their involvement on and off social media.\n\nThe #EndSARS event, which also sparked commentary from celebrities like Rihanna, Trevor Noah, and ex-US president Barack Obama, spurred numerous attempts by the Nigerian government to regulate social media. There was the social media bill of 2019, and the hate speech bill which proscribed death as the penalty for hate speech. In 2021, there was also an attempt to modify the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Act to cover social media platforms.\n\nNigerians are against the bill\n\nSince the bill was announced yesterday, many Nigerians have taken to social media, specifically Twitter, to express their concerns over the bill.\n\nLawyer and satirist Elnathan John said, \u201cThis is such a dangerous thing the Nigerian government is trying to do. They want to be able to track and harass citizens on social media.\u201d\n\nThis is such a dangerous thing the Nigerian government is trying to do. They want to be able to track and harass citizens on social media. https://t.co/JPhGnQp5GT \u2014 Elnathan John (@elnathan_john) June 14, 2022\n\nAjiboye noted that the Code is still in its draft stage so there\u2019s the possibility that most of its provisions would be revised. \u201cSpeaking objectively, they\u2019re releasing the draft so they can get feedback from stakeholders and ensure that whatever is enacted is palatable to the people the Code will apply to.\u201d\n\nThe draft Code is yet to be enacted but many Nigerians have been encouraged by Digital Africa Research Labs, an NGO studying social media misuse on the continent, to send their comments to NITDA at info@nitda.gov.ng. TechCabal has reached out to Digital Africa Research Labs for more comments but is yet to receive responses at the time of publication.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Despite rising crude oil prices, revenue accruable to the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) from crude sales has nosedived within the last six months due to the burden of petrol subsidy, prompting the government to borrow more.\n\nThe reduction in federally collected revenue is also putting states in a tough financial position.\n\nAccording to the latest figures from the Debt Management Office, Nigeria\u2019s public debt stock stood at N41.6 trillion as of March this year, up by N2.o4 trillion in three months.\n\nCrude oil prices remain supported by ongoing geopolitical risks and rising demand. As oil producers enjoy the benefits from surging prices, Nigeria has failed to make the most of the opportunity.\n\nAnalysts say Nigeria\u2019s sub-optimal oil production, poor infrastructure, and fuel subsidies have deprived it of the benefits of surging oil prices.\n\n\u201cThe current rise in global oil price is not showing in the government\u2019s revenue. This is the time to build up reserves for a rainy day fund. In fact, the rainy day is here, but we are being beaten by heavy rains,\u201d a professor of Energy Economics at the University of Ibadan, Adeola Adenikinju, told BusinessDay.\n\nIn a presentation on Monday, analysts at the World Bank said despite higher oil prices, oil revenue in 2022 would be lower due to larger petrol subsidies and lower production.\n\nRead also:Manufacturing in Nigeria can be frustrating \u2013 Daily-Need MD\n\nOther experts say poor economic choices by the government and delays in the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act have added more pressure to Nigeria\u2019s federation allocation and foreign exchange inflows.\n\n\u201cWith the current system in place, Nigeria needs more than a miracle to have positive inflows of oil remittances,\u201d Joe Nwakwue, a former chair of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, said.\n\nThe federal government has borrowed over N19 trillion from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), a development that has intensified inflationary pressures in the country.\n\nFindings by BusinessDay showed the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) has spent N947.53 billion on petrol subsidy this year, more than half of 2021 subsidy spending.\n\nThe FAAC document obtained by BusinessDay showed that this is the fifth time the oil company will not remit any fund to the federation account in 2022 \u2014 as subsidy payments continue to deplete revenue.\n\nNNPC also said it would deduct N271 billion for the shortfall in May 2022 during next month\u2019s FAAC meeting.\n\n\u201cThe value shortfall on the importation of PMS recovered from April 2022 proceeds is N271,125,127,487,58 while the outstanding balance carried forward is N371 billion,\u201d it said.\n\nTo compound the concerns, Nigeria is currently not meeting the oil production quota of 1. 7 million barrels per day (bpd) given to it by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), as oil theft and pipeline vandalism continue to plague the country\u2019s vital oil and gas sector.\n\nOPEC\u2019s latest data showed that the country\u2019s production fell to 1.024 million bpd in May from 1.22 million bpd in the previous month.",

However, for a well-informed and engaged citizenry to exist, the media must not just inform the public, but analyze and present information and unbiased date that can and should shape policy.\n\nThe AUN-Premium Times Data Hub is is a unique collaboration between higher education and media to inject more data-driven analysis into civic discussions and journalism.

On each platform, the best available data on Nigeria\u2019s current status will be presented and analysed and solutions to specific problems will be proposed.\n\nOur goal is to present and analyze data in a way that will educate you, our readers, guide you toward action and, over time, guide the decisions of policymakers.

          "text": "BY EMEKA EJERE\n\nNigeria could lose around N5trillion in the year from subsidising petrol, with the way the subsidy bill is increasing, the World Bank has warned.\n\nThe global lender, in its Nigeria Development Update (NDU) released on Tuesday in Abuja, noted that N5 trillion is urgently needed to cushion ordinary Nigerians from the crushing effect of double-digit increases in the cost of basic commodities, to invest in Nigeria\u2019s children and youth, and in the infrastructure needed for private businesses small and large to flourish, grow and create jobs.\n\nBusiness Hallmark had reported that data obtained from the NNPC last week showed a monthly rise in PMS subsidy spending by the oil firm which, however, described it as under-recovery/value shortfall. Importation of petrol into Nigeria and payment of subsidy for the product have solely been handled by the NNPC for a while.\n\nThe approved subsidised pump price of PMS in Nigeria is between N162 and N165/litre, but oil marketers say the actual cost should be a little higher or about the same price as diesel were PMS deregulated.\n\nLatest figures from NNPC showed that the amount spent on fuel subsidy maintained an upward trend from January to April this year. In January, February, March and April, the national oil firm incurred N210.38bn, N219.78bn, N245.77bn and N271.58bn respectively, amounting to a total of N947.51bn during the four-month period.\n\nThe World Bank report said, \u201cWhen we launched our previous Nigeria Development Update in November 2021, we estimated that Nigeria could stand to lose more than N3 trillion in revenues in 2022 because the proceeds from crude oil sales, instead of going to the federation account, would be used to cover the rising cost of gasoline subsidies that mostly benefit the rich\u201d.\n\nThe bank\u2019s Country Director for Nigeria Shubham Chaudhuri, however, noted: \u201cSadly, that projection turned out to be optimistic. With oil prices going up significantly, and with it, the price of imported gasoline, we now estimate that the foregone revenues as a result of gasoline subsidies will be closer to N5trillion in 2022.\n\n\u201cN5 trillion is urgently needed to cushion ordinary Nigerians from the crushing effect of double-digit increases in the cost of basic commodities, to invest in Nigeria\u2019s children and youth, and in the infrastructure needed for private businesses small and large to flourish, grow and create jobs.\n\n\u201cNigeria is in a paradoxical situation: growth prospects have improved compared to six months ago but inflationary and fiscal pressures have increased considerably, leaving the economy much more vulnerable\u201d.\n\nThe NDU highlighted: \u201cThe inflationary pressures will be compounded by the fiscal pressures Nigeria will face this year because of the ballooning cost of gasoline subsidies at a time when oil production continues to decline.\n\n\u201cNigeria, for the first time since its return to democracy, and alone amongst major oil exporters, is unlikely to benefit fiscally from the windfall opportunity created by higher global oil prices.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s growing macroeconomic challenges in 2022 highlight the continuing urgency of a departure from business as usual, and the need for consensus around a package of robust reforms.\u201d",

This shows we are in very difficult times. Government income is highly challenged,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe theme and objective of the retreat couldn\u2019t have been better captioned, given the fiscal challenges at the moment.

It\u2019s expected that discussions at this forum will help in improving the capacities of members and stakeholders and getting them more acquainted with Nigeria\u2019s fiscal challenges and advance recovery strategies that will enable effective management and avoid fiscal deficits,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFiscal deficits often indicate a variety of adverse domestic and external shocks that affect budgets directly as well as through their impact on the economic environment.

The (price) increase is the only way out.\n\n\u201cThe government should do something fast or in the next two weeks, we are going to buy diesel at N1, 000-N1, 500, if care is not taken.\u201d\n\nNigeria has been experiencing scarcity of petroleum products since February, and the situation has defied various measures so far taken to address it.\n\nAnd the situation was further aggravated by the Russia-Ukraine war with the attendant sanctions from the European Union (EU) on Russia, a major supplier of gas globally.\n\nKorie said: \u201cThe only way out of the present situation is that the government should increase the pump price of fuel a little to reduce the money spent on subsidy so that the CBN can have more forex. \u201cDiesel is imported and the importers are not getting dollars to import the diesel at the official rate of the CBN, so everybody is going to the black market to get the dollar to import diesel. So, you expect the price of diesel to be high.\n\n\u201cWhat I am saying is that if you can bring down the use of foreign exchange, it will help other businessmen importing diesel to bring it in at a low price. So, you need to increase the price of fuel so that there can be money for importers of diesel.\u201d\n\nAbuja fuel scarcity\n\nOn the fuel scarcity in the nation\u2019s capital city, he said Abuja residents would continue to experience fuel queues not just because of the bridging gap, but also because of bad roads, and maintenance cost.\n\n\u201cThe cost of diesel is high. Not just that, the roads are bad, the maintenance is high too. So, you can\u2019t make profit.\n\n\u201cIf you go out now, you will see that 75 percent of filling stations in Nigeria are going out of business. It\u2019s not that the fuel is not there, but the cost of bringing it here(Abuja) is too high,\u201d he explained.\n\nOn measures taken by Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF) and the Nigeria National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited on landing cost, he said this had failed to yield the desired result.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cit is not enough because at the time of that increase, diesel was between N300-N400. So now, we are talking about N850. \u201cEverybody is suffering. The only way out of this is for Nigerians to take the blow a little so that the rate the country is paying for subsidy will reduce and the money will be used to buy diesel.\u201d\n\nHe said the situation was tough for businessmen in the petroleum sector because, according to him, it had become very difficult for them to get loans from the bank to do business.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "Onu Okorie\n\nThe Association of Bureaux De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) need to collaborate to achieve exchange rate stability, ABCON President, Aminu Gwadabe has said.\n\nHe said the BDCs can also be used as tool in ending multiple rate practices, and ushering in stability in the forex market.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Operational Manual defines BDCs as small retail end institutions licensed to carry on the business of selling Personal Travel Allowance (PTA), Business Travel Allowance (BTA), school fees and medical bills payment abroad among other roles at the critical retail end of the foreign exchange market.\n\nHowever, the various policies of the CBN on the operation of the sub-sector continues to be inhibitive and limiting BDCs\u2019 from providing their constitutional roles in the forex market and economy.\n\nGwadabe has therefore called for collaboration between the BDCs and the CBN in the implementation of market-friendly policies that will make the BDCs impact more positively in the market and promoting exchange rate stability in the economy.\n\nThe ABCON boss said the hasty generalisation that criminalizes the BDC sub-sector as responsible for all market crisis and infractions like selling dollars with higher premium above regulatory limit, promoting loss of confidence in the near, and multiplicity of the exchange rates is not in the best interest of the market and economy.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is in view of this disturbing situation and the need to strengthen BDCs value chain as obtainable in organised climes that we urge the regulators and policymakers to consider BDCs as the most potent tool in liberalising the foreign exchange market and stopping multiples exchange rates in the system.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the BDCs have since 2006, provided policymakers with a window in achieving their mandate of exchange rate stability and price equilibrium. He therefore called for the reintegration of the BDCs into the forex market ecosystem to sustain their roles in the economy.\n\nGwadabe said the BDCs have for years remained effective and creative in contributing to the forex market.\n\nFor instance, the introduction of the Investors & Exports (I&E) FX window in 2017 was as a result of agitations from stakeholders like ABCON, foreign investors, Nigerians in Diaspora who advocated for it to allow more dollar inflows to the economy boost foreign reserves, and raise confidence in the naira by addressing widening rate premiums.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn order to address the challenges facing the forex market, now is the time to integrate BDCs into the market activities as agent of stabilization and delivering the market to the promised land\u201d.\n\nOn how ready the BDCs are for the responsibility, Gwadabe said the operators have for years been preparing for a time like this by integrating technology into their operations and promoting efficiency and transparency in their businesses.\n\nFor instance, ABCON trains Compliance Officers to ensure they are acquainted with what is required of them, especially on monthly rendition of results and tracking illicit capital flows to the market through compliance initiatives.\n\nAccording to him, the BDCs will continue to comply with the rendition of suspicious transactions reports as directed by NFIU, CBN, and EFCC through constant training their directors and sanctioning of erring operators.\n\n\u201cIn compliance with the provisions of Bank and Other Financial Institutions (BOFIA) as amended, every BDC renders returns to the CBN in prescribed format and within the deadline stipulated by the CBN. The records of the BDCs are made readily available to the CBN examiners as and when requested including carrying out customer due diligence, corporate governance and tax returns,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that ABCON has over the years established itself as a key player in the BDC industry, made several commitments and sacrifices to ensure that the sector continues to thrive against all odds.\n\nGwadabe said that BDCs have achieved major success with operational digitization as operators have been empowered to file their weekly, monthly or quarterly reports from anywhere without clustering at CBN\u2019s offices.\n\nHe said ABCON digitized BDCs operations with the official launch and take off of the ABCON Live Run Automation Portal in Lagos, which has the backing of the CBN.\n\nThe ABCON Live Run Automation Portal, he added, ended decades of manual filling of regulatory reports by BDCs and enhanced global competitiveness of operators.\n\nThe portal, which is a game changer in the Nigerian BDC Industry, is the final phase of automating all BDCs\u2019 operations and integrating them with the operations of CBN, NFIU and Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) for improved compliance with regulation and seamless operations in line with global best practices.\n\nGwadabe reiterated ABCON\u2019s commitment to boosting liquidity in the forex market, fulfilling its regulatory mandate of bringing forex closer to the end users and supporting the CBN\u2019s goal of achieving sustainable exchange rate stability.\n\n\u201cWe therefore conclude by urging the regulators to consider our proposal for the creation of Bureaux de change Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market (BAFEX) to replicate I&E window initiative, and address concerns of stakeholders like Nigerians in Diaspora, foreign investors, international financial institutions stability of the market,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Kehinde Ibrahim, Lagos\n\nTHE National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) in partnership with the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) has jointly released the guidelines on the submission of insurance programme by operators, project promoters, alliance partners, and Nigerian indigenous companies in the Nigerian oil and gas industry.\n\nThis is in compliance with Sections 49 and 50 of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development (NOGICD) Act 2010 in relation to insurance transactions.\n\nThe guidelines for the oil & gas insurance business was issued in 2010 which stipulate the roles and responsibilities of insurance institutions in ensuring compliance with local content law.\n\nThis was done with the primary consideration of ensuring that available In-Country Insurance Capacity is fully filled before any foreign consideration.\n\nThe overall aim of the guideline is the development of indigenous content through increased indigenous participation which was applauded by the entire insurance industry as it greatly complemented NAICOM roles and responsibilities in performing its regulatory and supervisory oversight function.\n\nSpeaking at the official signing and presentation of the joint guidelines by NAICOM and NCDMB, the Commissioner for Insurance and Chief Executive Officer of the NAICOM, Olorundare Sunday Thomas, said the NOGICD Act was enacted following the peculiarity of the Oil and Gas industry, which facilitated the collaboration between the NCDMB and NAICOM leading to the proactive considerations of the specific provisions of the NOGICD Act relating to the Insurance Industry.\n\nIn a similar vein, Thomas explained that Sections 49 and 50 of the NOGICD Act specifically relate to Insurance & Reinsurance and approval for offshore Insurance respectively with recommended minimum levels of Nigerian Content measured by percentage spend.\n\nHe said \u201cthe synergy between NAICOM and NCDMB necessitated a veritable platform for inter-agency collaboration in order to give effect to the requirements of Section 49 and 50 of the NOGICD Act 2010 by providing guidance to Operators in the Oil and Gas necessary for satisfying the provisions of the law in relation to insurance transactions.\n\n\u201cThe joint Guidelines which are today issued with the objectives of enforcing and strengthening compliance with the provisions of the referenced sections of the NOGICD Act and relevant provisions of the Insurance Act with respect to companies carrying on insurance business in the Nigerian oil and gas industry is to also enable the Board monitor utilization of in-country insurance capacity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI, therefore, implore all operators, project promoters, alliance partners and Nigerian indigenous companies engaged in any form of business, operations or contract in the Nigerian oil and gas industry to note that the sighted relevant laws have demanded our adherence and continued compliance, hence the issuance of this Guidelines.\n\nThomas who expressed optimism about the realization of the benefits of increased local content of increased retention, and growth in an in-country technical capacity, stated that it will also lead to job creation and employment generation, increased penetration and GDP growth, and human capacity development, and many others.\n\nHe said Whilst noting the need to secure domestic supply chains through strong backward domestic integration which has the potency of protecting economies from imported contagion of both a health and economic variety, they are also mindful of the capacity gap of the Supply-side.\n\nHe said NAICOM is committed to creating an enabling environment that will consistently enhance the increased capacity of the Insurance Institutions both financially and technically.\n\nIn his speech, the Executive Secretary, NCDMB, Engr Simbi Kesiye Wabote, said the release of the Guidelines addresses loopholes that have been identified by the Board in implementing the provisions of the NOGICD Act, particularly sections 49 and 50.\n\nHe noted that the combined provisions of sections 49 and 50 require all operators engaged in any form of activity or project in the Oil and Gas industry to \u2018\u2019insure all insurable risks related to its oil and gas business\u2026with an insurance company, through an insurance broker registered in Nigeria.\u2019\u2019\n\nWabote said the Act provides that where an operator seeks to place an insurable risk offshore, written approval of NAICOM must first be sought and obtained.\n\nThe essence of the above provisions of the NOGICD Act, he said, was to ensure the full utilization of available in-country capacity in the Insurance sector before seeking offshore insurance services to support retention of capital in-country and build the capacity of Nigerian insurance companies in the oil and gas industry.\n\nHe expressed optimism that \u201cthe implementation of this Insurance Guidelines will further strengthen the Board\u2019s local content drive by ensuring that a greater portion of the spend in the Insurance industry as it relates to oil and gas activities in Nigeria is retained in-country.\u201d\n\nWabote said the implementation of the guideline \u201cwill lead to more value addition and usage of Nigerian insurance firms and insurance brokers registered in Nigeria.\u201d",

          "text": "A UK court has ruled against Nigeria in the $1.7bn suit against JP Morgan Chase Bank over the transfer of proceeds from the sale of OPL 245.\n\nJudge Sara Cockerill of the Business and Property Courts of England and Wales Commercial Court held on Tuesday that the Nigerian government couldn\u2019t show that it had been defrauded.\n\nThe Federal Government had sued JP Morgan, alleging that the bank \u201cought to have known\u201d that there was corruption and fraud in the transaction which saw Malabu sell its 100 per cent in OPL 245 to Shell and ENI for $1.1 billion.\n\nREAD ALSO: Last-Gasp Challenge Fails Against UK\u2019s Rwanda Asylum Plan\n\nDuring a trial which lasted six weeks, Nigeria argued among other things that the bank acted negligently when it transferred $875 million in funds between 2011 to 2013 from government accounts to Etete, who had been convicted of money laundering.\n\nThe country sought $1.7bn as damages including interest for what it identified as \u201cglaring\u201d red flags, including \u201coverwhelming\u201d evidence of fraud and stark warnings from its own compliance staff when it authorized the payments.\n\nThe case essentially examined the extent of a bank\u2019s duty of care toward clients, and whether it should have halted payments even if that meant overriding assurances from government officials.\n\nThe bank in its defence rejected Nigeria\u2019s claims, maintaining that all due processes were followed and money laundering checks were done, arguing that allegations of fraud only came up after a new government took over in Nigeria.\n\nJPMorgan also argued that it filed suspicious activity reports with enforcement authorities and gained their consent before making the transfers.\n\nIn the judgement, Judge Cockerill ruled that the Nigerian government could not prove that it was defrauded, saying it may be that with the benefit of hindsight, \u201cJPMorgan would have done things differently\u201d but declared that \u201cnone of these things individually or collectively amount to triggering and then breaching\u201d the bank\u2019s duty of care to its client.\n\nAccording to the judge, by the time of the 2013 payments, the bank was \u201con notice of a risk\u201d of fraud.\n\nIn its reaction to the judgment, JP Morgan in a statement said, \u201cThis judgment reflects our commitment to acting with high professional standards in every country we operate in, and how we are prepared to robustly defend our actions and reputation when they are called into question.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Federal Government said it will be reviewing the judgment before deciding next steps.\n\n\u201cThe FRN will continue its fight against fraud and corruption and to work to recover funds for the people of Nigeria,\u201d it said.\n\nControversial deal\n\nShell and ENI had paid a total of $1.3 billion to Nigeria\u2019s account at JP Morgan \u2014 $801 million for Malabu, the original OPL 245 allottees, and $210 million as signature bonus to the federal government.\n\nAll attempts by Nigeria to prove that there was corruption in the OPL 245 deal have so far proved fruitless.\n\nAn Italian court in March 2021 dismissed all charges of corruption in the transaction, discharging and acquitting all the defendants, including Shell, ENI and Dan Etete, the promoter of Malabu.\n\nThe US Department of Justice (DoJ) previously investigated the OPL 245 deal and announced in October 2019 that it was closing the case.\n\nIn April 2020, the US Securities and Exchange Commission also closed investigation into the controversial deal after it could not prove fraud or corruption.\n\nIn the JP Morgan case, it was alleged that Mohammed Bello Adoke, the attorney-general of the federation when the transaction was concluded in 2011, was corrupt and that the entire deal was fraudulent.\n\nAdoke has always denied any wrongdoing, alleging political persecution and maintaining that there is a grand conspiracy to twist a failed mortgage transaction he did in 2013 as evidence of the alleged corruption.\n\nCiting proceedings from Nigerian courts, JP Morgan said that on April 13, 2018, \u201cthe Nigerian Federal High Court granted declarations to the effect that Mr Adoke could not be held personally liable in respect of the payments to Malabu (and the giving of instructions to JPMC to make them) because he was merely carrying out the lawful directives and approvals of the President\u201d.\n\nThe bank said for Nigeria to make a case, it must prove that \u201cMr Adoke caused the Resolution Agreements to be concluded and the payment instructions to be issued; and that he did so in exchange for bribes.\u201d",

          "text": "The governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party, SDP in the June 18 governorship election in Ekiti state, Segun Oni, has expressed optimism that he will come victorious at the polls.\n\nThe former APC scribe who disclosed this while featuring on TVC\u2019s Breakfast show, added that all polls conducted by credible platforms place him and his party above other contenders.\n\nMr Oni, who is also a former governor of Ekiti is seeking re-election on the platform of the SDP after failing to to get the ticket of the People\u2019s Democratic Party during its primary.\n\nHe had contested alongside a serving Senator, Abiodun Olujimi but both lost to Bisi Kolawole, the party\u2019s flagbearer.\n\nSpeaking on while he decided to seek reelection despite previous unsuccessful attempts, the former deputy national chairman of the APC said his decision was borne out of the inability of those governing the state to bring desired changes and development to the people.\n\nHis words: \u201cI did not contest in 2004 or thereabout at all. In fact I didn\u2019t want to go back to governorship, when I was I leaving, I made it very clear that I believe the governorship should go to other zones. But over the years, we see things are not going well for the state. In the first place, when I was in APC, it was the national Assembly caucus who came to me and said that \u201coga our party is absent on the street. And by our party then, they meant APC, it was during Fayose regime and they said the only person who can bring it (our party APC) to the street is me. They said I should contest and I said no that I\u2019m satisfied with what I am doing as deputy national chairman. They came back again and I yielded after praying on it because I wanted to resuscitate the party.\n\n\u201cThis current attempt has taken me to two places \u2013 PDP and SDP. When I left APC I went back to the PDP because I thought it was a natural home for me and of course there was also pressure on me to contest and I contested. Unfortunately I didn\u2019t get the votes that I accredited. I thought it was just normal until I saw a video where delegates were showing a particular individual the candidate they voted for. Also I heard some PDP and APC chieftains celebrated my exit from the race at the govt house because they were not happy with my presence. They had thought they wanted to monopolise the power and the party.\u201d\n\nspeaking about his chances at the poll despite contesting on the platform of almost an unknown party, the former governor said: \u201cPeople were so happy that I decided to contest on another party. They are fully supporting us. In democracy, people are the structure and I am happy the people are there. The poll has been giving it to us. Where are on ground. By God\u2019s grace, we will win because we are on the roads to success.\n\nSpeaking about his achievements as governor of the state, Mr Oni said: \u201cCompare to others, Ekiti people know I did much better than others and the records are there and that\u2019s what people still talking now. In Education, my records are there. I introduced a lot of schemes into the sector and the result was also sparkling. Before I became governor, we were ranging in the 30s in the rank, we went to number 8 that is pure without any infringement. Everyone was happy.\n\nMr Oni also spoke about the allegation that he accused the governing party of using power of incumbency: \u201cI can\u2019t remember saying the government in power is using power of incumbency. It is the people that will decide. The more you do this incumbency of a thing, the more you anger the people.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, one of the allegations against his administration during his first term was that his government recorded unprecedented cases of violence across the state. But responding to this, Mr Oni dismissed all the allegations and described them as mere propaganda. According to him \u201cYou have only one indices to show that those things are just mere propaganda. No criminal is ever loved but can be feared. That tells you those things are just lies and propaganda. There\u2019s no how I will be violent or lover of it, and still be loved this much by the people of Ekiti. The allegations are best described as mere propaganda,\u201d Mr Oni said.\n\nSpeaking about his relationship with governor Fayemi and his predecessor, Fayose, the SDP candidate said he maintains good relationship with Mr Fayemi anytime and works hard whenever there\u2019s course for them to work together. \u201cI Olusegun Oni, wherever I find myself I worked very hard and Kayode too knows. When we are together, we worked together and fought hard and not for my personal gains. And for Fayose, whenever circumstances bring us together, we work together. I don\u2019t trade with sensations,\u201d Mr Oni stated.\n\nThe Ekiti governorship election which is slated to hold this Saturday, 18th June is expected to be a straight battle among three different political parties \u2013 the governor APC, People\u2019s Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party.\n\nEkiti state comprises of sixteen local government areas and is bordered to the north by Kwara State, to the northeast by Kogi State, to the south and southeast by Ondo State, and to the west by Osun State.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has registered 988,923 eligible voters to participate in the election, and of the figure, a total of 720,724 people have collected their permanent voters cards, as of 18 May, 2022.",
          "summary": "The governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party, SDP in the June 18 governorship election in Ekiti state, Segun Oni, has expressed optimism that he will come victorious at the polls.\nAnd by our party then, they meant APC, it was during Fayose regime and they said the only person who can bring it (our party APC) to the street is me.\nBut responding to this, Mr Oni dismissed all the allegations and described them as mere propaganda.\nThe allegations are best described as mere propaganda,\u201d Mr Oni said.\nI don\u2019t trade with sensations,\u201d Mr Oni stated.",

          "text": "Still struggling with its oil production quota, the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Tuesday revealed that Nigeria reported a paltry 1.024 million barrels per day production in May, a multi-year low.\n\nHowever, while direct country reporting of total barrels drilled was roughly 1 million bpd, secondary sources, according to OPEC, indicated that the country produced 1.258 million bpd.\n\nIn all, with the latest figure released by the OPEC, it means that Nigeria\u2019s underperformance was as high as 700,000 barrels per day for the month, although the cartel\u2019s total allocation to Nigeria exceeded 1.75 million bpd for the month.\n\nThe 1.24 million bpd production was about 195,000 bpd less production when compared with April\u2019s total of 1.219 million bpd, OPEC said in its Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) released Tuesday.\n\nDespite assurances by the various government agencies, what the OPEC figures imply is that rather than improve, the country\u2019s oil production has actually deteriorated in the past months.\n\nFingering massive theft as one of the reasons for its inability to meet its quota, the federal government had also months ago, deployed heavy military presence in the Niger Delta to curb the menace.\n\nBut the OPEC data has now confirmed that the action has not made any difference, as nothing appears to have changed since the rejigging of the security arrangement in the region.\n\nOn the economy, OPEC said that Nigeria\u2019s real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) advanced by 3.1 per cent y-o y in Q1, 2022, following almost 4 per cent y o-y growth in the prior period.\n\nIt stated that this was driven by a solid performance in the information and communication industry, adding that the non-oil sector grew by 6.1 per cent y-o-y in 1Q22, faster than 4.7 per cent Q4, 2021.\n\nHowever, it noted that Nigeria\u2019s inflation outlook has deteriorated in recent months, reaching 16.8 per cent y-o y in April 2022, up from 15.9 per cent y o-y in March.\n\n\u201c Like most African countries, Nigeria\u2019s economy is grappling with rising food prices since it is largely dependent on agricultural imports, especially grains.\n\n\u201c Also, increasing diesel prices and the ongoing dollar shortage contributed to the upward trend in inflation,\u201d it said.\n\nOPEC said that the pace of growth may flatten amid fuel and power shortages, low water levels and higher borrowing costs for corporations and households following a 150 basis point increase in the policy rate by the central bank in May.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking at the MedGas Event Dinner in Athens, Greece yesterday, OPEC Secretary General, Sanusi Barkindo, said that the world economic growth in 2022 has been revised down by the cartel to 3.5 per cent from 3.9 per cent in previous assessments.\n\n\u201cWorld oil demand in 2022 is forecast to increase by 3.4 mb/d y-o-y, representing a downward revision of 0.3 mb/d. Non-OPEC liquids supply growth in 2022 was revised down by 0.3 mb/d y-o-y to 2.1 mb/d.\n\n\u201cAgainst the backdrop of a fragile situation for the global economy, oil market stability is absolutely essential. For this reason, OPEC\u2019s cooperation with 10 non-OPEC oil producing countries under the \u2018Declaration of Cooperation\u2019 is absolutely pivotal,\u201d he said.\n\nSigned on 10 December 2016, the \u2018Declaration of Cooperation\u2019 between OPEC and 10 non-OPEC Producing Countries is a pioneering framework for multilateral energy cooperation.\n\nBarkindo said that the declaration had enabled the oil industry to withstand and recover from both the severe oil market downturn of 2014-2016 and the unprecedented oil market contraction following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn the energy transition, he reiterated that in recent years, public discourse around energy, climate and sustainable development had become noisier and more forceful.\n\nUnfortunately, Barkindo argued that the conversation has become less global and inclusive, with some voices all but excluded, saying the narrative is often overtaken by emotion, with rational discussions based on facts, hard-data and science, taking a back seat.\n\n\u201cOur industry is at an inflection point and has never before faced so many challenges across multiple fronts in its long history. Put simply, we are under siege.\n\n\u201cIn the courts, there are currently over 1,200 litigation cases against oil companies worldwide. Environmental NGOs, investors and even some corporate boards are pressuring oil companies and governments to pursue aggressive policies and initiatives that could, in the end, be more disruptive than productive for the global energy industry, especially given current concerns related to energy security.\n\n\u201cWe need to be cognisant of how oil and gas industry investments are being impacted by Environmental Social Governance (ESG) requirements and the climate disclosure drive from the financial community.\n\n\u201cESG criteria can present a series of questions to investors. As several commentators have noted, there is no universally accepted objective and rigorous framework for ESG,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Nigeria Struggling to Service its Debts Due to Fuel Subsidy, Finance Minister Ahmed Laments",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed on Tuesday expressed concern that the federal government\u2019s continuous retention of the controversial fuel subsidy regime was hurting Nigeria\u2019s ability to service its debts.\n\nAlso, the World Bank has projected that Nigeria may post a N5 trillion loss in oil revenues in 2022, despite oil price rally due to the retention of its fuel subsidy policy.\n\nOwing to negative consequences of the fuel subsidy policy, Anambra State Governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo has called for it\u2019s the government to phase it out immediately, noting that the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) hasn\u2019t credited states in recent time as a result of the burden of fuel subsidy.\n\nThey all made the remarks at the hybrid launch of the World Bank\u2019s Nigeria Development Update titled: \u201cThe Urgency for Business Unusual,\u2019 held in Abuja.\n\nBut speaking at a different gathering, the acting Accountant General of the Federation (AGF), Mr. Chukwuyere Anamekwe, Tuesday lamented that government\u2019s revenues were currently under serious attack and called for articulated deployment of fiscal discipline and strategies to mitigate identified challenges.\n\nThe Finance Minister called on Nigerians to understand that fuel subsidy was causing a massive fiscal burden, saying a situation whereby the federal government borrows for consumption was wasteful.\n\nAhmed said: \u201cThis premium motor spirit (PMS) subsidy is costing us an additional N4 trillion than was originally planned. So, this is an unplanned deficit. We have gone to the National Assembly; we have gotten approvals, but the approval was simply for us to cut down on some of the investment costs. \u201cSo, investments that we needed to make in oil and gas sector which we are delaying and deferring to a later time and reducing the rollout of those investments. But we also had asked that we needed to borrow more which is very serious.\n\n\u201cAlready we have borrowing increasing significantly and we are struggling with being able to service debt because even though revenue is increasing, the expenditure has been increasing at a much higher rate so it is a very difficult situation.\u201d\n\nShe said further: \u201cSo Nigerians need to understand that this PMS subsidy we are carrying now is hurting the nation, its impeding the government\u2019s ability to be able to invest in human capital development. N4.5 trillion is money that we could have invested in health or education.\n\n\u201cBut where we are investing it in consumption, which is very wasteful, because how many Nigerians own cars that are benefiting from this subsidy.\u201d\n\nShe further pointed out that Nigeria was facing challenges from not gaining from the current oil price rally.\n\n\u201cWe are in some kind of crossroads. It is not hearsay to say that Nigeria has not derived what it should from the current high crude oil prices, rather rising crude oil prices are posing significant fiscal challenges to our economy and may lead to some negative receipts and indeed we have started seeing already those negative receipts.\n\n\u201cThere are three factors preventing Nigeria from fully benefiting from the current boom in the international crisis. First of all, our prediction had fallen below Nigeria\u2019s estimated capacity and the OPEC quota because of insecurity vandalism and theft. Secondly, the domestic price of payments has remained fixed, while global PMS prices have continued to rise.\n\n\u201cThe third is that rising international crude prices also increases the burden of PMS because we buy refined petroleum products. The higher crude oil price goes in the global market, the more we\u2019re paying for PMS, and by maintaining this PMS subsidy we as a country unfortunately forego investments that will have used the monies into essential infrastructure, goods or services that would have increased the overall productivity of the nation. So this is really the bane of the major issue that we\u2019re facing now.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the World Bank has projected that Nigeria may post a N5 trillion loss in oil revenues in 2022 as oil prices continue to rally and the war between Russia and Ukraine rages. This is N2 trillion above the multilateral institution\u2019s earlier prediction.\n\nThe Washington-based institution also declared that although Nigeria\u2019s growth prospects had improved, inflationary and fiscal pressure increased considerably, leaving the economy much more vulnerable.\n\nSpeaking during the unveiling of the NDU, the World Bank Country Director for Nigeria, Shubham Chaudhuri, who presented the highlights, predicted that inflationary pressure would be compounded by the fiscal pressure Nigeria would face this year because of the ballooning cost of fuel subsidy at a time when production continues to decline.\n\nThe World Bank chief stated that based on this, Nigeria, for the first time since its return to democracy, and as the only major oil exporter, was unlikely to benefit fiscally from the windfall opportunity created by higher global oil prices.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen we launched our previous Nigeria Development Update in November 2021, we estimated that Nigeria could stand to lose more than N3 trillion in revenues in 2022 because the proceeds from crude oil sales, instead of going to the federation account, would be used to cover the rising cost of gasoline subsidies that mostly benefit the rich.\n\n\u201cSadly, that projection turned out to be optimistic. With oil prices going up significantly, and with it, the price of imported gasoline, we now estimate that the foregone revenues as a result of gasoline subsidies will be closer to N5 trillion in 2022.\n\n\u201cAnd that N5 trillion is urgently needed to cushion ordinary Nigerians from the crushing effect of double-digit increases in the cost of basic commodities, to invest in Nigeria\u2019s children and youth, and in the infrastructure needed for private businesses small and large to flourish, grow and create jobs.\u201d\n\nHe stated that inflation in Nigeria, already one of the highest in the world before the war in Ukraine, was likely to increase further as a result of the rise in global fuel and food prices caused by the war.\n\nAccording to the bank\u2019s estimates, this was likely to push an additional one million Nigerians into poverty by the end of 2022, in addition to the six million Nigerians that were already predicted to fall into poverty this year because of rising prices, particularly food prices.\n\nAccording to the report, Nigeria\u2019s growing macroeconomic challenges in 2022 highlight the continuing urgency of a departure from business as usual, and the need for consensus around a package of robust reforms.\n\nIt highlighted three policy priorities: Reducing inflation through a sequenced and coordinated mix of exchange rate, trade, monetary, and fiscal policies including the adoption of a single, market-responsive exchange rate.\n\nThe priorities also included addressing mounting fiscal pressures at the federal and sub-national levels by phasing out the petrol subsidy (estimated to cost up to N5 trillion in 2022) and redirecting fiscal resources to investments in infrastructure, education, and health services; increasing \u201cpro-health taxes\u201d, and improving tax compliance.\n\nOthers are catalysing private investment to boost job creation by improving the transparency of key government-to-business services and eliminating trade restrictions.\n\n\u201cDespite the better-than-expected performance of the services and agriculture sectors and higher oil prices stemming from the war in Ukraine, Nigeria is experiencing a curious case of lower fiscal revenues.\n\nThis is limiting the government\u2019s ability to expand basic services, support the economic recovery, and protect the poor during this difficult time,\u201d said Marco Hernandez, World Bank Lead Economist for Nigeria and co-author of the report.\n\nIn addition to assessing Nigeria\u2019s economic situation, this edition of the NDU also casts a spotlight on the unintended effects of Nigeria\u2019s trade restrictions; the importance of investing in adolescent girls to defuse Nigeria\u2019s demographic timebomb; and the imperative of bringing Nigeria\u2019s out-of-school children back to school.\n\nAlso, speaking during an exclusive interview with THISDAY, Chaudhuri maintained that Nigeria needs urgent reforms and a coordinated mix of policies that involve exchange rate management, monetary policy, fiscal policy and trade.\n\n\u201cThe bottom-line is that we are more concerned now than we were six months ago because we see the fiscal pressures and the inflationary pressures, building up in a way that will directly impact the livelihoods and just everyday choices of millions of Nigerians will have to make and the government\u2019s ability to respond to those needs will be limited by the fiscal pressures.\n\n\u201cNigeria has always proved to be resilient in the past, we certainly hope Nigeria gets through at least another side of elections. But there has to be a broader consensus amongst the elites, and then ultimately, Nigerian people as a whole, that this situation on the fiscal front and in terms of certain key some of the key reforms that we\u2019ve highlighted cannot continue.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for Nigeria to embark on a different path that will help Nigeria realise its full potential. It\u2019s become even more urgent. And then the fact that growth has picked up is great but that\u2019s just at the most first step. Right now, the fiscal and inflationary pressures just have to be dealt with a sense of urgency.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Hernandez said: \u201cIn terms of reducing inflation, what we have highlighted previously, both in public and private conversations with governments and stakeholders across the country, is that there needs to be a sequence and coordinated mix of policies involved in exchange rate management, monetary policy, fiscal policy, and trade.\u201d\n\nSoludo, however, advised the federal government to immediately remove fuel subsidy.\n\n\u201cWe have had this analysis over and over and so the diagnosis is clear. We know this problem, we know that Nigeria is grappling with several unsustainables, be it in the area of security or in the area of macroeconomic framework and subsidies that nobody gets. We subsidise those who own cars but have no money to build the roads for them to drive on,\u201d he added.\n\nSoludo lamented that sub-nationals were bearing the cost of subsidies, he added: \u201cIn May, States received zero from the federation account coming from oil and we\u2019ve reached the end and there is only one way. That is the federal government decides that it wants to subsidise PMS. Why do you have to charge it to the sub-nationals? They should charge it on the revenue of the federal government and not charge on the federation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe solutions are pretty obvious, just get them off, and remove this subsidy like yesterday. This ought to have been removed like yesterday, it benefits nobody.\n\n\u201cIf we continue with subsidy, central bank would continue to print money, the deficit will continue to rise and how does the federal government pay its bills? It has got to resort to ways and means and the ways and means continue to fuel inflation and the depreciation of the exchange rate.\u201d\n\nGovernment Revenues under Serious Attack, Says AGF\n\nMeanwhile, Anamekwe has lamented that government\u2019s revenues were currently under serious attack and called for articulated deployment of fiscal discipline and strategies to mitigate identified challenges.\n\nSpecifically, he said due to dwindling revenues, the treasury has had to resort to other sources of revenue in order to augment for the payment of the federal government public servants.\n\nAnamekwe, pointed out that there had been an increase in government expenditure due to increasing security challenges and social needs of the citizenry.\n\nSpeaking at the opening of a 3-day retreat for members of the Technical Sub-Committee on Cash Management themed: \u201cEnthroning Fiscal Discipline in Nigeria\u2019s Public Financial Management: A Clarion Call to Stakeholders,\u201d organised by the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation (OAGF) in Nasarawa State, he called for solutions towards addressing the fiscal challenges.\n\nHe said, \u201cNow that these challenges stare us in the face, you are expected at this gathering to come out with ideas that will push us through.\u201d\n\nThe AGF further noted that the cash management retreat had become a veritable tool providing the needed platform for sharing quality information and knowledge that help to keep stakeholders abreast with public financial management reforms and managing fiscal challenges among others.\n\nHe said the retreat would no doubt help in the advancement of the desired recovery strategies.\n\nNonetheless, he said the meeting must among other things, strive to identify the challenges to revenue generation and other means of enhancing inflow into the federal government coffers, as well as ensure the reduction in the cost of governance in the most acceptable way.\n\nAlso speaking at the occasion, the Director of Funds, OAGF, Mr. Sabo Mohammed, said the persistence of deficits, as well as the inexorable rise in public sector indebtedness over the past years called for concerns.\n\nHe said financial resource scarcity had become a central policy concern with prediction of rising populations, natural resource depletion and hunger.\n\nHe said fiscal discipline requires that the governments maintain fiscal positions that are consistent with macroeconomic stability and sustained economic growth.\n\nMohammed said, \u201cFiscal deficits often indicate a variety of adverse domestic and external shocks that affect budgets directly as well as through their impact on the economic environment.\u201d\n\nHowever, he noted that maintaining fiscal discipline remained essential to sustaining macroeconomic stability, reducing vulnerabilities and improving aggregate economic performance.\n\nObinna Chima, Nume Ekeghe in Lagos, Ndubuisi Francis and James Emejo in Abuja",
          "summary": "Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed on Tuesday expressed concern that the federal government\u2019s continuous retention of the controversial fuel subsidy regime was hurting Nigeria\u2019s ability to service its debts.\nAlso, the World Bank has projected that Nigeria may post a N5 trillion loss in oil revenues in 2022, despite oil price rally due to the retention of its fuel subsidy policy.\nOwing to negative consequences of the fuel subsidy policy, Anambra State Governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo has called for it\u2019s the government to phase it out immediately, noting that the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) hasn\u2019t credited states in recent time as a result of the burden of fuel subsidy.\nThe Finance Minister called on Nigerians to understand that fuel subsidy was causing a massive fiscal burden, saying a situation whereby the federal government borrows for consumption was wasteful.\nAhmed said: \u201cThis premium motor spirit (PMS) subsidy is costing us an additional N4 trillion than was originally planned.",
