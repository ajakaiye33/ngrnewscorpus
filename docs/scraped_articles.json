          "title": "Girl Child Day: Stand up against FGM, violence \u2014 Imo NAWOJ",
          "text": "By Chinonso Alozie, Owerri\n\nThe Nigeria Association of Women Journalists, NAWOJ, Imo State Chapter, on Thursday called on Women and the girl child to stand up against violence as well as the practice of Female Genital Mutilation, FGM, in society.\n\nNAWOJ, State Chairman, Dorathy Nnaji, made this call at this year\u2019s International Day for the Girl Child held in Owerri.\n\nAccording to her, discrimination and the practice of FGM, were among the obnoxious practices that reduced the girl child to mental subjugation.\n\nTo end it, Nnaji said: \u201cGood knowledge of culture is important for the overall development of the Girl-child. This is part of what needs to be done but it\u2019s not every cultural practice that needs to be imbibed. There are obnoxious cultural practices that need to be jettisoned and for the developmental cultural imperatives, the girl-child needs to learn and imbibe the practices. It is however through sound education that you will be able to decipher right from wrong cultural practices. I call you to become more sensitive to culture to achieve the best human development index.\n\n\u201cIssues such as Female genital mutilation (FGM), Obnoxious practices against women, Violence against the Girl-child and women, and all forms of discrimination against women and the female gender, etc., the Girl-child should be enlightened enough to stand up against such Obnoxious actions. We advise the empowerment of the Girl-child both knowledge-wise and economic-wise to enable her to stand to liberate womanhood from mental subjugation and imprisonment of the mind. In addition to professional training and academic heights, acquisition of skills and development of entrepreneurship skills is key for the emancipation of the Girl-child.\u201d\n\nIt was her opinion that \u201cIn the very past, during the period our people were predominantly illiterates, there used to be a wrong perception that women do not necessarily need education since any training done to their ends with their getting married away to another family. It was during that time that it was said that Women\u2019s Education ends in Kitchen.\n\n\u201cThat is not only a fallacy of perversion of reality but a jaundiced perception that stagnated generations of the past. The world remains in the darkness of ignorance until the female gender is liberated from the claws and shackles of stagnation. The Girls are leaders, Changemakers, agents of growth in the world. Girls are fundamental in the strive to activate gender equality.\u201d\n\nThe event was well attended by the members of the Imo state House of Assembly, led by the Speaker, Paul Emeziem, Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, Imo State Chapter, led by the Chairman, Chris Akaraonye, Chairman Correspondent Chapel, Chris Njoku, as well as women from different security agencies, school children among others.",

          "text": ".\n\nDayo Johnson Akure\n\nVice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo yesterday made a case for orphans in the country saying they needed spaces to grow, thrive and meet their physiological needs\n\nHe said this at the inauguration of a charity and social development centre called Dorian Home in Akure, Ondo state capital.\n\nThe orphanage was built by a philanthropist, Dr Tolulola Bayode.\n\nHe said the number of children whose parents had been killed during conflicts in the country is about nine per cent of the nation\u2019s population.\n\n\u201d The number of the young children turned to orphans had increased over the year and stressed the need to rebuild their lives after their harrowing experiences during the violence.\n\nAccording to him \u201cbeing an orphan did not determine the greatness of a child in the future, said many great men in Nigeria and the world were orphans, hence the need to help the children in the orphanage category.\n\n\u201d We are confronted with a huge challenge. In 2015, the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development has estimated that there were about 17.5million orphans and vulnerable children in a nation of about a 200million people.\n\n\u201cThat is close to nine per cent of the population. Sadly this number has increased over the years due to violence, conflicts, communal clashes in different parts of the country.\n\n\u201d This is a large number of widows and vulnerable women and again due to conflicts in different parts of the country, the number has grown.\n\n\u201d A million of orphan children need spaces to grow and to thrive and ensure that there physiological needs met, a place where they are cared for and trained.\n\n\u201cThe women after harrowing experience also need spaces where they can begin to rebuild, that is why places like Dorian Home initiatives are needed.\u201d\n\nHe however, said government alone cannot solve this society\u2019s biggest problems but require stakeholders attention and resources to support the orphans and vulnerable children who have lost one or both parents.\n\nOsinbajo commended the initiative of the founder and President of the Dorian Homes, Dr Tolulola Bayode, saying such initiatives will expose orphans and women to better care and the world will be a better place for them.\n\nHe said \u201csome of the greatest names of our time which include, Eleanor Roosevelt, Nelson Mandela, Malcolm X, Ella Fitzgerald, Leo Tolstoy, Louis Armstrong, and Steve Jobs among others grew up as orphans, and they changed history.\n\nThe founder of the orphanage, Bayode said that she was motivated by her parents and two experiences that changed her orientation and mindset towards rendering social services to humanity.\n\n\u201d The first was my excruciating pain I went through before I could deli er my son, Dorian, after whom this home is named. I encountered some childbirth complications that brought me face to face with realities of life.\n\n\u201cConsidering what I went through, several questions were raised in my mind. How do the less privileged cope without social safety nets? What would have happened to me if I had no one to take care of me? What about my son? What would have happened to him if I did not make it through that experience?\n\n\u201cThese questions mirror the reality of many people in our society today , women who have lost their husband\u2019s and have the weight of their families on their shoulders, children on the streets without hope of where the next meal will come from\u201d\n\nBayode said the state-of-the art building would accomodate motherless babies , their games, dinning, a decent kitchen, women training among other features to develop the skills of the orphans in the home.\n\nGovernor Rotimi Akeredolu described the initiative as unique noting that his government will continue to partner with individuals and corporate organizations in complementing the state government community projects.\n\nSpeaking through his deputy, Hon Lucky Aiyedatiwa said that the home would open several windows of opportunities for the people of the state.\n\nAkeredolu said that the humanitarian project \u201cwould complement the good agenda of his administration .\n\nHe added that the Dorian Home \u201cwould have the total support of the Ondo State Government.\u201d\n\nPresent at the inauguration of the orphanage include traditional rulers, ministers, National Assembly members, state lawmakers and other personalities across the country.",

          "text": "By Elizabeth Osayande\n\nIN a bid to cushion the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and having the belief that no pupil should be left out of school on account of lack of basic amenities, Empowering Africans Through Education Initiative, EAE, has awarded scholarship to 13 pupils selected across public and low-income private schools in Lagos State.\n\nThe beneficiaries got selected based on these criteria: Currently enrolled in primary 4 or 5 as of the time of the nomination; the best pupil in primary four (4) or five (5); economically disadvantaged but with a good academic track record; and Interest in the sciences and technology-related subjects e.g., Mathematics, Integrated Science, etc.; and having a good attendance record in school.\n\n\n\nREAD ALSO:CBN directs banks to apply I & E rates for PAPSS transactions\n\nSpeaking during the presentation of the award to the pupils who were accompanied by their parents and teachers at the event held recently in Gbagada, Lagos, the Community Engagement Manager, EAE, Joseph Onokpe, said the scholarship scheme was about improving the lives of children and seeing that basic education becomes inclusive in Nigeria.\n\nHis words: \u201cIt is about seeing children get better at what they do. It is great fulfilment and joy to see a child wake up and have access to the basic form of education without being left out due to certain limitations seeing that education has become the ticket out of poverty. For me, I believe if we can touch the lives of these children, they will grow up to pass the baton of change.\n\nThis implies that over the years, we will have more children in school.\n\n\u201cSo, the scholarship offers N140,000 for a full academic year in the following forms: School Support, provision of basic school needs such as books, stationaries, school uniform, etc. This addresses the Sustainable Development Goal 4. Nutritional support: this by extension benefits members of the pupil\u2019s family. This will ensure that the beneficiaries and members of their families have access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food.\u201d\n\nThis addresses the Sustainable Development Goal 2; \u201cThe Health Insurance: through this, the beneficiaries will have access to quality essential health,\u201d Onokpe explained.\n\nOn the future goal of EAE, the Community Engagement Manager noted that the non-governmental organisation which started in 2017 and whose focus is on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, STEM, hoped to see Experimento incorporated into the national curriculum. \u201cOur future goal is to have Experimento, a STEM-focused project being implemented into the Nigerian Curriculum.\u201d\n\nAlso commending EAE, the Executive Chairman of the Lagos State Universal Basic Education Board, LASUBEB, Mr Wahab Alawiye-King, said the need to improve on STEM education is very paramount in today\u2019s world.\n\nAccording to the LASUBEB chairman, who was represented by Mrs Ismail Margaret, Deputy Director, Co-Curricular, LASUBEB: \u201cThe need for more support by NGOs like EAE is appreciated to intensify our efforts in improving science and technology as the technology of today may be obsolete tomorrow.\n\n\u201cOnce again, I thank EAEI for investing in our pupils and teachers. You are not only building society; you are moulding our future,\u201d he said.\n\nExpressing delight over the items given to them, a basic six pupil from Fazil-Omar Amadiya Primary School, Al-Amin Kabiru, said he felt happy being selected for the scholarship. \u201cI am in basic six pupils of Fazil-Omar Amadiya Primary School. I feel very happy and excited and proud of myself for winning this scholarship. We have been given food items and school items. I thank the NGO for being so kind.\u201d Kabiru said.",

Dikio was first appointed in August 2020, and has, despite the challenges, been able to command widespread respect amongst the various stakeholders in the Niger Delta,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe former militants noted that the President took the right decision in Dikio\u2019s reappointment in the interest of peace and stability of the Niger Delta.\n\nMr Tonye Bobo, National chairman of the Third Phase of the PAP, said by extending Dikio\u2019s tenure, Buhari had demostrated his committment to the development of the region.\n\nBobo also commended the President for not listening to naysayers, who were bent on derailing the programme.\n\nHe urged Dikio to see his reappointment as an acknowledgement of his efforts in the last one year and charged him to justify the fresh mandate by working for the sustained peace of the region.\n\nBobo assured Dikio of the support of ex-agitators, especially those in the third phase, adding that having keyed into his vision, they will work with him to achieve it.\n\n\u201cIt is cheering news for us because it is what we clamoured for. So, we are thanking President Buhari for listening to wise counsel and extending the tenure of Col. Milland Dixon Dikio.\n\n\u201cDikio has shown capacity, he has demonstrated in the last one year that he understands the workings of the programme and when you listen to his vision and template, it is obvious he knows what is best for the ex-agitators and the region as a whole.\n\n\u201cWhat we are going to appeal to him is to look into the issues that are pending before him like that of the undocumented ex-agitators and see how they can be captured because they have suffered a lot. For us we will work with him to achieve his desired goal for the Niger Delta,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, another ex-militant leader, Mr Kingsley Umoh, also known as 007, noted that ex-agitators from Akwa Ibom are delighted with the development.\n\nHe observed that Dikio has repositioned the scheme and given them a hope with policies to make them entreprenuers rather than depending on stipends.\n\n\u201cThe man is a good man, you can see the stability enjoyed in the region within the past one year, he is honest and transparent and very unassuming.\n\n\u201cWe pray that his reappointment will pave way for him to complete the policies he initiated,\u201d Umoh said.",

As a result, global demand next year is seen averaging 100.8 mb/d.\n\n\u201cDemand is anticipated to be supported by healthy economic momentum in the main consuming countries and better management of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u2019\u2019",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu and Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC), yesterday, slammed the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for condemning the Senate\u2019s amendment of the Electoral Bill on Tuesday to allow political parties hold only direct primaries.\n\nAccording to the APC Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee, John Akpanudoedehe, PDP is only pretending to be an opposition political party.\n\nThe senate had reconsidered its decision on some clauses in the Electoral Amendment Bill that were passed in July.The Senate amended clause 87 of the bill to mandate political parties to hold only direct primaries for candidates seeking elective positions, which the PDP was opposed to. It also amended the clause to let the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) determine the use of electronic voting and transfer of election results.\n\nAkpanudoedehe while affirming the APC\u2019s support for the Senate\u2019s amendments, said the party would support constitutionally-permitted innovations that would improve transparency and credibility of the country\u2019s electioneering processes and internal democracy.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the sound bites from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) should be ignored in its entirety. PDP is only pretending to be an opposition political party. Meanwhile, the patriotic disposition of the multi-partisan 9th National Assembly should be commended. It is the right thing for the National Assembly to aggregate and consider the clamour by civil societies, interested stakeholders and indeed all Nigerians on all matters requiring legislation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe APC scribe said in line with the party\u2019s progressive mantra, the credibility of elections had continued to improve under the President Buhari-led APC government.\n\nHe said valid votes now count and past practices of electoral fraud inflicted on Nigerians were fast becoming a thing of the past.\n\nHe said at party level, the APC CECPC, under the leadership of Governor Mai Mala Buni, had entrenched internal democracy.\n\nThis, he said, was especially in its nomination processes as recorded in recent and successful nationwide congresses conducted by the party.\n\nHe assured that the APC as a party and government, would continue to stand for and support free, fair, transparent and credible elections across the country.\n\nBut in a swift reaction, the PDP accused the APC of destroying the country\u2019s electoral process.\n\nThe PDP, which was reacting to a statement by the APC urging Nigerians to ignore its concern over the introduction of direct primaries into the electoral law, by the Senate, said it was not true that the ruling party has improved the electoral process.\n\nThe opposition party, in a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, urged the APC to accept its failure in governance.\n\n\u201cOur position is predicated on a statement by the APC in which it claimed to have improved on electoral process in the country, whereas what abounds in our nation is a painful story of how the APC has destroyed our economy, our electoral process and our national unity, to the extent that life has become despondent to the average Nigerian.\n\n\u201cWe accept the fact that the APC lacks the capacity for feedback mechanism, however, the PDP wishes to bring to the attention of the APC that all Nigerians today would wish this administration had come to its end.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding, our party counsel that the APC should begin to prepare their handover notes because Nigerians are not ready to endure this anguish beyond May 29, 2023, \u201c the PDP stated.\n\nMeanwhile, the APC has said nly internal bickering and disunity within its ranks can stop it from retaining power in 2023.\n\nIt appealed to aggrieved members that their inability to eschew bickering and misunderstanding would pose serious threat to the quest to retain power beyond 2023.\n\nSpeaking during the inauguration of the state congresses committees in Abuja, Akpanudoedehe urged aggrieved members to explore the reconciliation window endorsed by President Muhammadu Buhari to ventilate their grievances and achieve unity.\n\nThe party scribe admitted difficulties in managing a nuclear family, let alone a large political party like the APC with over 40 million members, urging members to applaud efforts by the National Chairman, Governor Mai Mala Buni in proper management of the party.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

Whether public or private television stations, they must comply with the directive.\n\n\u201cThis directive will work both ways.

          "text": "In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nAccording to court documents, the contract stipulated that the plaintiffs would transport Uber\u2019s Kenya customer base at a minimum of $0.54 per kilometre, with a minimum fare of $2.71. Under this agreement, Uber Kenya Limited retained a 25% cut of overall profits from each ride.\n\nIn July 2016, Uber reduced the minimum rate per kilometre to $0.32 and the minimum fare to $1.81 per trip. This, claimed the drivers-turned-plaintiffs, was a breach of contract that left them unable to earn profits as Uber drivers and maintain vehicles purchased to adhere to Uber standards.\n\nUber Kenya Limited had a different story. They claimed that the group of 34 drivers had not entered into contracts with them but had done so with Uber BV, a private LLC registered in Amsterdam. Because of this, Uber Kenya Limited said they were not liable for the breach of contractual obligations.\n\nAfter years-long litigation in the High Court of Kenya, during which the drivers fought to prove that Uber Kenya Limited and Uber BV are one and the same, the High Court of Kenya has finally issued its ruling on the issue this week highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry.\n\nThe Corporate Veil\n\nUber BV is an Amsterdam-based company that owns the rights to the Uber app. Uber Kenya Limited acts as a subsidiary that contracts Uber drivers in Kenya. While Uber BV claimed it was a separate entity from Uber Kenya Limited, the High Court of Kenya concluded that there was an intricate link between both companies.\n\nEvidence presented to the court revealed that the group of Ubers shared the same email address and hired the same council to litigate disputes in court.\n\nThis, stated Milimani court justice, Francis Tuiyott, lifted the \u201ccorporate veil\u201d off of the conglomerate, making Uber Kenya Limited and Uber BV liable to the plaintiffs.\n\nUber and Its Drivers\n\nUber, as a company, maintains the claim that it does not employ drivers but acts as an intermediary between the drivers and clients. This murky relationship has landed the company in court cases across the world.\n\nIn April, a group of South African lawyers partnered with a UK law firm to file a class action suit against Uber that would force the company to recognise drivers as employees with benefits rather than independent contractors.\n\nUber has also been in and out of UK courts over how it classifies its drivers. In February, the company finally agreed to treat drivers as workers after losing in front of the Supreme Court. More recently, The Court of Amsterdam struck down Uber\u2019s intermediary status ruling that drivers are, in fact, employed by the company.\n\nIn Kenya, the line between Uber as an intermediary and employer becomes even blurrier.\n\nUber employed over 12,000 drivers in Kenya as of November 2020. While some of Uber\u2019s fleet owns their vehicles, many do not.\n\nDrivers who cannot afford their own cars are employed by private sub-contracted companies that run their own group of cars. Others act as private chauffeurs whose employers allow them to drive their vehicles as Ubers between pickups.\n\nThis sub-contracted third-party relationship means that returns to Uber drivers in Kenya are even lower than the cut they receive from Uber itself.\n\nFuel to the Fire\n\nAdding to reduced incomes are Kenya\u2019s ongoing petrol price hikes that have placed fuel prices in Kenya at a historic high.\n\nDavid Muteru, Chairman of the Digital Taxis Association of Kenya, claims that after the fuel price hike, Uber failed to cushion the financial blow for drivers\n\n\u201cThey did not raise fares. Instead, they introduced new cheaper products,\u201d said Muteru in an interview with TechCabal.\n\nAs of the time of writing, Muteru claims he has been deactivated from the Uber app as a result of his activism.\n\nUber has consistently lowered its prices to suit the needs of the Kenyan market. For over two months, the rideshare app has been offering weekly 25% discounts to loyal customers, competing against Bolt who is also making inroads in the Kenyan market. The reduction in fare is then shirked to the driver.\n\nBottoms Up\n\nUber cannot be blamed for this alone. Its strategies in rapidly expanding African cities are permitted by policymakers who see Uber\u2019s entry as a red stamp of approval for on-track development. The ability for a city to Uber everywhere also delays the need to address and urgent need for reliable public transportation.\n\nKenya\u2019s Uber drivers recognise the company\u2019s important presence in the nation\u2019s transport infrastructure. David Muteru and his colleagues do not want an all-out ban of Uber in Kenya but better regulation that yields a more transparent relationship between the company and its contracted drivers.\n\n\u201cit\u2019s opaque,\u201d said Muteru of the current situation. \u201cUber should start by recognition of driver representation from registered bodies\u2026the end goal is compensation for losses incurred\u201d.\n\nBut, will it be worth it in the long run? While powerhouses like Uber can keep up in a foot race, local tech companies with little capital in their early stages cannot. If this trend continues, large multinationals may price out drivers, as well as local tech companies hoping to cash in on Kenya\u2019s digital revolution.\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author",

          "text": "In 2013, M-Pesa, Africa\u2019s largest mobile money platform, was faced with a major challenge: Its users couldn\u2019t settle insurance premiums and make bank payments in real-time. Payments made to Kenya Power took 48 hours before reflecting in the company\u2019s systems; other payments, like the one to the National Hospital Insurance Fund, experienced longer delay times, often taking three days before they were acknowledged.\n\nAmong the many reasons for these lengthy settlements and transfer times was the fact that M-Pesa\u2019s mobile money platform could only handle between 200 to 300 transactions per second. But that needed to increase by at least tenfold to make transactions more seamless.\n\nDesperate for a way out, the Vodacom and Safaricom-owned M-Pesa turned to Chinese tech giant Huawei, which helped migrate M-Pesa\u2019s 12.8 million active users over the space of 18 months to a better-performing mobile money platform.\n\nEight years later, M-Pesa has scaled operations to cater for its 50 million active users in the seven African countries it operates in \u2013 Kenya, Tanzania, Lesotho, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Mozambique and Egypt. It now processes over a billion transactions every month.\n\nMostly working in the background, Beijing Murong Technology, a Chinese financial software company, also collaborated with Huawei over the years to introduce some features to M-Pesa.\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\n\n\nSuccess begets success\n\nM-Pesa\u2019s success meant that when Ethiopia\u2019s state-owned telecoms company Ethio telecom decided to build the country\u2019s first mobile money platform, TeleBirr, they turned to Huawei.\n\nLaunched in May 2021, TeleBirr caters to the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. In just two months since its launch, TeleBirr has added six million users to its mobile payment system without a hitch.\n\nFor Huawei, these feats highlight its shift from providing solely telecommunications infrastructure to now providing its network customers with technology to run mobile payment applications in as many as 19 African countries. Encouraged by its accomplishments, Huawei also recently announced its intention to build an innovation and research centre in Tunisia, head of the company\u2019s North Africa region.\n\nThe success of M-Pesa and Telebirr has enhanced Huawei\u2019s reputation as the poster child for China\u2019s enterprising tech sector. Meanwhile, the collaboration between Huawei and Beijing Murong Technology highlights a bigger trend: Beyond building bridges, rail lines, airports and roads across the continent, Chinese companies are increasingly building digital infrastructures in Africa.\n\nWhy Africa? The African market offers Chinese companies and investors a growing young population expected to reach 1.7 billion by 2030. Presently, about 50% of this growing population is excluded from the financial system and less than 40% have access to the internet. This presents a massive opportunity to boost financial inclusion and connectivity.\n\nThe indispensable player\n\nThe presence of tech companies like Huawei and ZTE in Africa dates back to the 1990s. Their expansion to Africa was fueled by the desire to fill a vacuum left by the growing disinterest by Western companies and countries to invest in Africa. These Chinese tech companies decided to establish a stronger presence in Africa despite the political and economic instability. In the long run, this move has paid off and the results are glaring.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that you wouldn\u2019t have a thriving African tech ecosystem today without the Chinese,\u201d said Eric Olander, Managing Editor of the Chinese Africa Project, a media organisation dedicated to exploring every aspect of China\u2019s engagement with Africa.\n\n\u201cIf the Chinese were not there, Africa would be 15 years behind at least. Think about it, about 50% of the phones in Africa are controlled by one company: Transsion.\u201d\n\nOlander cites the success of Transsion, Africa\u2019s leading mobile phone maker which went public on a $7 billion valuation, and more recently Opay, a fintech platform with over 5 million users, which raised $400 million at a $2 billion valuation from investors like Softbank.\n\n\u201cThese Chinese companies are challenging the assumption that you can\u2019t make money in Africa and that the African tech ecosystem isn\u2019t really that big.\u201d\n\nTranssion\u2019s assembly factory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Source: CNN\n\nBeyond just making money, once these Chinese companies strike gold, they go on to invest in other upcoming Chinese startups. In 2018, Transsion led a $40 million seed investment in PalmPay, a digital payment service, with participation from China\u2019s NetEase and Taiwanese chip designer MediaTek. PalmPay offers peer-to-peer money transfers, airtime purchase and bill payments in Nigeria and Ghana with plans to expand to other African countries.\n\nRiding on Transsion\u2019s wings, in 2020, PalmPay came pre-installed on about 20 million units of Transsion phone brands \u2013 Tecno, Infinix and itel. Likewise, from June 2021, Huawei Mobile Kenya users were able to make in-app purchases via M-Pesa.\n\nChinese tech giant, Alibaba Group, hasn\u2019t been left out of the action. Its online and mobile payment platform Alipay collaborated with Vodacom to develop VodaPay, a super app positioned to drive financial inclusion and economic growth in South Africa. In June 2021, VodaPay was unveiled, with 70 companies already signed up on it.\n\nNotably, Wapi Pay, a Singapore-based Kenyan fintech startup powering the Africa-Asia cross-border payment, uses Huawei\u2019s mobile money services. An indication that contemporary fintech startups are also relying on Chinese tech.\n\n\u201cChinese technology is the foundational technology in Africa. I call it the indispensable player in the African tech space. You take the Chinese piece out and African tech falls apart,\u201d Olander said.\n\nCaution, concerns and the reality\n\nThe proliferation of Chinese enterprises in Africa has attracted a great deal of scepticism from academics, policymakers and other observers in recent years. Of particular concern is the relationship between Chinese companies and the Chinese communist party as well as how the data from Africa is used.\n\nJili Bulelani, a South African researcher at Havard with research interests in Africa-China relations, is concerned about this.\n\n\u201cThe question a lot of the time is how deep Chinese companies like Huawei are involved,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt some level, we can see them supporting fibre optics, cloud storage and mobile money projects. But there are questions around who owns this data and the legal ramifications around people securing themselves and their data.\u201d\n\nThese issues around data usage are worsened by the fact that there aren\u2019t effective data laws in Africa to protect its citizens. About 50% of countries on the continent don\u2019t have data protection laws backed by legislation.\n\nWhile Olander agrees that the answer to these questions about Huawei\u2019s practices is relatively opaque, partly because Huawei does not communicate well enough about this, he also clamours for a practical look at the situation.\n\nHe believes that, from a practical standpoint, African countries are better served by these Chinese companies because their products are cheaper and more tailored to the African market. Africa is a difficult place to do business, and as such, most African countries and companies are not in a strong negotiating position.\n\n\u201cWhen the Americans told the Kenyans that they should not use Huawei for 5G networks, the answer from Safaricom was, \u2018Okay, but what do we do?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cFor African countries, the choice at the end of the day is not between Nokia, Alcatel, Ericsson, Samsung and Huawei. Oftentimes, it\u2019s between Huawei and nothing.\u201d\n\nHe also points out that the accusations against Huawei aren\u2019t about the performance of their products and services. A testament to the fact that they make quality products that meet the needs of their clients.\n\nHenry Tugendhat, a senior policy analyst with the China team at the US Institute of Peace, is of the opinion that if Africans are really concerned about cybersecurity then they have to start with the assumption that everybody is interested in our data and communications.\n\n\u201cUntil African countries manufacture their own equipment, they\u2019ll always be susceptible to international organisations having access to their data,\u201d Tugendhat said. \u201cTo manage the situation it\u2019s going to come down to how African countries can legislate and how they enforce that legislation.\u201d\n\nIs there room for competition?\n\nDespite the immense contribution of Chinese tech to the African fintech space, there\u2019s still room for growth. Per the GSMA report 2020, less than 50% of the African population have a phone. This pales in comparison with the US (81%) or even China (63%).\n\nThe race is still on for the different players building digital infrastructure for the African fintech space. Iginio Gagliardone, author of China, Africa, and the Future of the Internet is of the opinion that there might not be much room left for competition in the next few years.\n\n\u201cChina tends to approach projects with a longer time horizon. With it making headway in the physical and digital infrastructure space, it could use its pervasiveness to lock in standards against competitors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf they keep creating at this momentum, it\u2019ll be difficult to unbundle and pull the plug. I\u2019m a bit more worried about the future,\u201d Gagliardone added.\n\nIn the past decade, China has become a central player in Africa\u2019s development. Having a strong Chinese presence in African tech has clearly been very beneficial; a monopolistic dominance is what\u2019s worrying.\n\nTechCabal contacted Huawei for comments but had not got a response at the time of publishing this article.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate",
          "text": "When Kemi*, 26, received a rejection email from Twitter about a software engineering role she\u2019d applied to, she was devastated, and she cried. She\u2019d previously aced Palantir\u2019s recruitment process for the same role and was going to travel for the final interview, on-site, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and thwarted that plan.\n\nBefore all of these, Kemi had applied to Google, Amazon and Apple but didn\u2019t scale through their recruitment processes. These initial rejections didn\u2019t faze her like Twitter\u2019s, though, because, by the time she applied to the social media giant, she felt she\u2019d already acquired enough skills to land the job.\n\nYet she didn\u2019t. The common response she got across these companies was that she\u2019d submitted her coding assessments later than required; they thought she was slow in coming up with solutions. But she had a demanding, full-time job, and that took up most of her time.\n\nShe decided, then, to take a break from applying for international jobs and focus on her current job at the time. The job paid her enough to sort out personal and family bills, after all.\n\nAnd yet, her ambitions wouldn\u2019t take a break. So it was only a matter of weeks before she was back to applying again to these international jobs.\n\nSo, how did a girl like her \u2013 who came from a poor background \u2013 go from selling fufu and dried fish on a university campus to almost working with Google, Amazon, Twitter and Palantir, and finally landing a software engineering role at the world\u2019s biggest financial data and news company, Bloomberg?\n\nIt all began in Lagos, Nigeria, 26 years ago.\n\nKemi was the first child of her family, born in 1995, in the Akowonjo area of Lagos, Nigeria. Her mother, Mrs Adeoye*, was a schoolteacher and fabric trader. But not the kind that owned shops. Mrs Adeoye sold fabric to her colleagues at school and neighbours. On weekends, she and Kemi hawked them on the street.\n\nDue to their inadequate salary, it\u2019s common in Nigeria for teachers, especially female ones, to double as traders. But it\u2019s not common to see a schoolteacher hawking on the street.\n\nMrs Adeoye collected the fabrics on credit from wholesalers and could only restock after paying for the previous wares. She embodied steadfastness and diligence \u2013 values she has passed down to her daughters.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKemi watched her mother juggle two jobs to provide for her and her sister and that influenced her decision to work hard and smart. \u201cMy mum raised us alone, and I just got the memo, from a young age, that if I didn\u2019t want to suffer, I\u2019d have to hustle.\u201d\n\nIt was a lonely journey for a single mother raising two daughters alone in Lagos with the little money she made from her teaching job and side hustle.\n\nBut where was her father?\n\n\u201cBold of you to think my dad is dead,\u201d Kemi said, when I asked when her father had died.\n\nHer father had left her mother when her younger sister, Ayo,* was a year old. There was no reason for his disappearance \u2013 at least not any Kemi or her mother knew of. Kemi was five when he left and never looked back.\n\nThe next time Kemi saw him again, she was 12.\n\nHer father\u2019s return was bad luck\n\nIn 2007, Kemi\u2019s sister Ayo fell seriously sick and Mrs Adeoye had to send for her daughters\u2019 father. He showed up, surprisingly, like a hero who\u2019d come to save the day. He spent some months with his earlier-abandoned family and ended up turning everything upside down before he left them yet again. Kemi, her mother and sister had gone out one day, and when they returned, found that he had disappeared with Mrs Adeoye\u2019s goods and put her in debt.\n\nThis event marked the beginning of a negative turn for the family, throwing them into a state of penury that would last over three years. Those goods had been collected on credit and now the wholesalers were upset and wanted their money.\n\nMrs Adeoye had to repay her debts in bits, from her meagre salary, leaving her with almost nothing for feeding and housekeeping. Sometimes, her creditors stormed the school where she taught to embarrass her about their money. By now, things had gotten so bad that Kemi and Ayo used polythene bags to carry their books to school.\n\nSchool fees were the least of the Adeoye sisters\u2019 problems, however, because they both attended schools where their mother taught. There was a staff discount for teachers\u2019 kids at these schools, and sometimes, a complete fee waiver.\n\nExcelling in school\n\nAmid all this chaos, Kemi remained one of the most brilliant students in her class. Being a teacher\u2019s kid may not have come with life\u2019s best comforts, but it gave her something: strict supervision that drove her to excellence.\n\nTwo years after secondary school, Kemi was admitted into the Faculty of Engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife.\n\nThings had gotten better for her family while she was in SS 3, her final year of secondary school. Her mother got a new job in another school. The job came with accommodation, free lunch and better pay. Mrs Adeoye bought Kemi her first laptop and was able to pay her university bills.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut their problems were far from over.\n\nA few months into Kemi\u2019s freshman year, terror hit again. Her mother lost the new job, and the family was back to square one. Her mother never found her feet again after that.\n\nFor five years, Kemi struggled through university. In her second year, her friend\u2019s father paid her school fees, and in her third year, her fees would come from money she made hawking food on campus. In her third year, she took fufu, eggs and dry fish from one hostel room to another, calling on her fellow students to come buy.\n\nShe stopped selling food after her internship at a tech firm in Lagos. And she used part of the money she made during the internship to sort out her fees for her fifth year of school.\n\nWriting code changed Kemi\u2019s story\n\nKemi started writing code in her freshman year. Some guys at her school had organised a coding bootcamp, which she passively attended. At OAU, it was easy to get into coding as there were always coding camps going on, on the campus.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to continue coding. After the bootcamp, Kemi wasn\u2019t really excited about the skill and discontinued further development in that area \u2013 until her third year when she started working as a software development trainee in a tech company in Yaba, Nigeria\u2019s biggest tech hub. The company picked up students, trained and paid them a stipend for learning.\n\nWhile that was going on, one of her lecturers organised a coding training and, at the end of it, a hackathon, which marked the beginning of it all.\n\nIf Nigerian universities were to be graded based on the number of top tech talents produced, OAU would be in the top three. The school is popular for this, and the Nigerian tech ecosystem testifies to this.\n\n\u201cI like to say I officially became a software engineer during my internship at a leading e-commerce company,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cThat was the turning point for me.\u201d\n\nSince her internship at Konga, all the jobs she\u2019d gotten had been based on recommendations.\n\nDuring her time at her first job out of school, she got an offer from a company based in Germany, but her Nigerian company made a counter-offer and she remained with them. However, when Bloomberg called, it was a case of not every offer can be countered.\n\n\u201cGetting into tech wasn\u2019t really about passion. It was more about getting stability in life,\u201d Kemi told me. \u201cA career as a software engineer has allowed me to do things I could only dream of [before].\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s reality is the same for most Africans, especially young people going into tech; many available jobs can barely cater for their own immediate needs, not to talk of catering for other family members.\n\nKemi wants to continue supporting her mother and sister, not only by clearing their bills but also helping them to be independent of her. \u201cI want to help my family build generational wealth, and you know that can\u2019t happen if I\u2019m the only one giving.\u201d\n\nKemi graduated from OAU with a first-class. This revelation was enough to start an entirely new conversation. There were so many more questions I wanted to ask her, but the answer to them all, she told me, was grit, ambition and a staunch fear of poverty.\n\n*Names have been changed to protect subjects\u2019 identities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "At the first virtual Google for Africa event today, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, announced a plan to invest $1billion over 5 years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made huge strides together over the past decade \u2014 but there\u2019s more work to do to make the internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African.\u201d Sundar Pichai said.\n\nTo provide affordable internet access in Africa, Google is building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs. Its subsea cable Equiano will run through South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria and St Helena and connect the continent with Europe.\n\nAs part of Google\u2019s commitment to supporting Black-led startups in Africa, the company announced the launch of an Africa Investment Fund. Through this fund, it will invest $50M in startups and provide them with access to Google\u2019s employees, network, and technologies to help them build meaningful products for their communities. This is in addition to Google\u2019s existing support through the Google for Startups Accelerator Africa, which has helped more than 80 African startups with equity-free finance, working space and access to expert advisors over the last three years.\n\n\u201cI am so inspired by the innovative African tech startup scene. In the last year we have seen more investment rounds into tech startups than ever before,\u201d Nitin Gajria, Managing Director for Google in Africa said.\n\n\u201cI am of the firm belief that no one is better placed to solve Africa\u2019s biggest problems than Africa\u2019s young developers and startup founders. We look forward to deepening our partnership with, and support for, Africa\u2019s innovators and entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nTo cater for small businesses and entrepreneurs, Google is collaborating with non-profit organisation Kiva to provide $10M in low-interest loans to help small businesses and entrepreneurs in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa get through the economic hardship created by COVID-19.\n\nNonprofits haven\u2019t been left out of this, Google.org is expanding its commitment to support nonprofits working to improve lives across Africa, with an additional $40M to help more partners organisations. In the case of the Airqo team at Makerere University, who use AI and sensors to monitor poor air quality, a leading cause of premature death. Google is providing $3M in new grant funding to expand this pioneering work from Kampala across 10 cities in 5 countries on the continent.\n\nThe announcement of the $1bn investment is commendable and a testament to Google\u2019s commitment to supporting digital transformation in Africa. Since 2017, Google has trained 6 million young Africans and businesses in digital skills. Google has also supported more than 50 nonprofits across Africa with over $16 million of grants and enabled 100 million more Africans to access internet services for the first time through Android.\n\nShare this article\n\nAdegoke Oyeniyi | Author @seunadegoke01",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDamilola*, a 24-year-old female, believes sex is disgusting and painful. She has no desire for sex and finds it difficult to discuss this challenge with her parents and friends because she is wary of the possible stigmatisation.\n\n\u201cI was only five years old when I was sexually assaulted for the first time, and I\u2019ve been a victim of sexual assaults since then. Well, I guess it\u2019s normal now, because how else would you know you\u2019re a beautiful girl if you haven\u2019t been sexually assaulted? I\u2019m simply being sarcastic. But it hurts so much that I can\u2019t stop thinking about it,\u201d she tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), sexual health is more than just the absence of sickness, malfunction, or infirmity. It is a condition of physical, emotional, mental, and social well-being associated with sexuality.\n\nSo even though Damilola shows no signs of illness or infection, she\u2019s sexually unhealthy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSexual assault can lead to sexual dysfunction \u2014 a sexual health problem \u2014 but there are tech tools to make us feel safe.\n\nSexual health in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Shawn Fields on Unsplash\n\nWhile growing up, unintended pregnancies were commonplace. It was surprising to see young people deviate from the abstinence training they\u2019d received.\n\nThen again, maybe I was wrong to assume their parents or guardians taught them about abstinence.\n\nI\u2019m much older now, and unplanned pregnancies are still prevalent. And this makes me wonder why parents still fail to teach their children about sex or give sexual health tips and abstinence talks.\n\nIf you\u2019re a Gen Z or Millenial, you\u2019ll be familiar with adverse reproductive health outcomes like unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and high HIV infection rates.\n\nIsaac Ogal, a Sexual Health Advocate and Volunteer with the International Youth Alliance for Family Planning (IYAFP) in Uganda, says, \u201ctraditional, cultural, and religious barriers to sexual health continue to exist in Africa.\n\n\u201cAnd due to high illiteracy rates and limited access to technology, a very small number of Africans have access to and understand sexual health information.\u201d\n\nPerhaps, this explains why some African parents don\u2019t give their children the necessary sex education.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides, a study shows that access to and utilisation of youth-friendly sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services remains a significant challenge for the African youth, particularly in the sub-Saharan region.\n\nThe study also reveals that sub-Saharan African youth face numerous significant SRH challenges, including limited access to youth-friendly services (YFS) such as information on growth, unsafe abortion, gender-based violence, sexuality, and family planning.\n\nAccording to WHO, achieving our sexual health and well-being depend on our \u201caccess to comprehensive, good-quality information about sex and sexuality, knowledge about the risks they may face and their vulnerability to adverse consequences of unprotected sexual activity, ability to access sexual health care, living in an environment that affirms and promotes sexual health.\u201d\n\nIn other words, sexual health issues occur when we lack access to sexual health information and education.\n\nSexual health issues are diverse, encompassing sexual orientation and gender identity, sexual expression, relationships, and pleasure.\n\nThey also include adolescent pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), endometriosis, and sexual dysfunction.\n\nHow is technology promoting sexual health?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDamilola only realised her problem when she came across \u201cSexual Dysfunction\u201d on the Internet in July 2021. She noticed that one of the dysfunctions addressed her desire and pain disorders. And this prompted her to seek help, even though she was devastated at first.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my condition was huge. I knew I had a problem, but I didn\u2019t realise it required me to be deliberate and attentive. I assumed it would go in marriage. What an irony! Thanks to the Internet, I began asking questions and researching sexual dysfunction,\u201d she says.\n\nAccording to a study, healthcare is being increasingly delivered via digital channels such as the Internet, mobile phone messaging, social media, apps, voice, video messaging, and telemedicine.\n\nThis trend has been aided by the spread of mobile technology and rapid advances in artificial intelligence.\n\nInterestingly, the study also shows that digital communication channels provide widespread coverage, allow messages to be targeted to specific groups or individuals, and have the potential to improve the delivery of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) information and support.\n\nConsequently, technology can help people in Africa access sexual health information since the continent\u2019s Internet population is rapidly increasing.\n\nOgal believes that technology significantly bridges the sexual health information gap, as many educated youths have smartphones connected to the Internet.\n\n\u201cHowever, people with sexual health issues are afraid of accessing these services because of the stigma associated with them in a society that is already historically and culturally biased,\u201d he says.\n\nBesides, we may face barriers to access sexual health services, such as concerns about confidentiality and privacy, high costs, insufficient transportation, and a scarcity of medical providers.\n\nAlso, living in remote or isolated areas can limit options because there may be no sexual health specialist available and no choice of a male or female doctor.\n\nHence, the use of telemedicine to increase access to sexual health information.\n\nTelemedicine makes use of information and communication technology to overcome geographical barriers and increase access to healthcare services.\n\nTechnological advancements are removing the stigma associated with seeking information on sexual health and related issues.\n\nWe discuss four tech tools that can help us improve our sex lives while avoiding stigma.\n\n1. Ask Without Shame (AWS)\n\nAsk Without Shame was founded by Ruth Nabembezi, who grew up in a Ugandan orphanage home.\n\nAfter Nabembezi\u2019s parents died of AIDS, her sister developed severe skin rashes, and fellow villagers assumed demons possessed her. Instead of taking her to a healthcare centre, they took her to a witch doctor\u2019s place, where she later died.\n\nFollowing her sister\u2019s death, Nabembezi was unhappy that people in Uganda not only lacked information about sex and sexual health but were not allowed to have such discussions. And that prompted her to start Ask Without Shame (AWS) in 2015.\n\nAWS is a non-profit organisation that uses mobile technology to deliver sexual health information from medical experts and counsellors to young people to dispel sexual myths and taboos, halt potential HIV transmissions, and prevent unwanted pregnancies in Africa.\n\nAsk Without Shame offers emergency sex education through an Android mobile app, WhatsApp, phone calls, and SMS. It puts sex education at the fingertips of young people aged between 12 and 35 without judgment or shame.\n\nIt also allows many users to disclose information that they are too embarrassed or afraid to reveal to others. The organisation claims it wants all African youth to have access to the sexuality information they need to make informed sexual decisions.\n\n2. Honey and Banana Connect\n\nAccording to a Guttmacher Institute fact sheet, 15.7 million of Nigeria\u2019s 45 million women of reproductive age (15\u201349 years) want to avoid pregnancy.\n\nIn addition, 61,000 Nigerian women die each year from birth-related complications, abortions, or miscarriages. However, with better access to contraception information, most of these deaths can be avoided.\n\nHoney and Banana Connect claims it\u2019s helping to reduce this number through its call centre \u2014 which can be reached by dialling 55059 \u2014 that provides access to supportive, affordable, and high-quality family planning services.\n\nAfter calling 55059, you will be connected to live agents who will respond to all of your family planning, birth spacing, and contraceptive-related questions.\n\nFor the purpose of this article, I dialled the code to learn more about what they do.\n\nA bot welcomed me before my call was transferred to one of their agents \u2014 whom I\u2019ll call Aramide \u2014 in under 10 seconds.\n\nAramide introduced herself, asked for my name, and wanted to know why I called.\n\nI told her I\u2019d had unprotected sex the previous night and was terrified because it was my first time.\n\nAnd without asking embarrassing questions or judging me, Aramide told me to get Postpill from a pharmacy close to me and use it. I ended the call after telling her my age and where I was calling from.\n\nTo learn more about Postpill, I redialed the code. As I\u2019d hoped, another agent answered; I\u2019ll call him Julius.\n\nJulius told me that the Postpill is an emergency contraception (EC) that prevents pregnancy if taken within 24 hours of having sex. Asked if I could use it before sex, Julius said, \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nAccording to studies, using emergency contraception before having unprotected sex may not provide the best long-term protection because sperm can live inside the body for up to five days after ejaculation.\n\nBecause these drugs only provide the most effective protection for three to five days after sex, having unprotected sex after taking EC means the sperm may outlast the medicine\u2019s most effective window.\n\nSo, taking Postpill after sex is more effective.\n\nFurthermore, he stated that the pill should be taken three times per month but not as regular birth control.\n\nAccording to Honey and Banana Call Centre, callers are guaranteed complete confidentiality and privacy.\n\nIn Nigeria, calls are free on all mobile networks except Glo.\n\n3. Blueheart\n\nBlueheart is a sex therapy app that provides access to sex therapy, helping users overcome sexual dysfunction and have healthy personal relationships.\n\nFounded in 2019 by Sachin Raoul (CEO), Blueheart uses guided audio sessions to help people regain their libido.\n\nRenowned sex therapist, Dr Katherine Hertlein, and Dr Laura Vowels, a specialist in libido and sex drive problems within relationships, provide the information on the app.\n\nBlueheart uses the Sensate Focus technique \u2014 a hybrid of exposure therapy and mindfulness. These methods are known for dealing with a wide range of issues, including sexual health issues.\n\nAvailable in text and audio, Blueheart encompasses thought sessions that focus on sexual fears and anxieties, body sessions that focus on developing a positive relationship with your body \u2014 alone and with a partner \u2014 and connection sessions that focus on communication.\n\n4. Scarleteen\n\nFounded in 1998 by Heather Corrina, Scarleteen answers sex-related questions in a straightforward yet friendly manner. The young-adult-friendly website discusses a wide range of topics such as anatomy, pregnancy and STI prevention, abortion, sexual orientation, and sexual pleasure.\n\nYoung adults can use the online resource to learn about their bodies and health. It\u2019s a place where they can get answers to questions they\u2019d be too embarrassed to ask someone in person.\n\nIt also offers a one-on-one live chat with trained volunteers, extensive articles, and a forum where visitors can talk with people dealing with similar adolescent issues.\n\nThe significance of sexual health cannot be overstated, as it allows people to control their reproductive health and emotional well-being in intimate relationships.\n\nSexual health is an essential component of living a happy life. And prioritising it can improve a person\u2019s emotional, physical, and mental well-being, as well as their intimate relationships.\n\n* \u2013 not real name\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Our premium reports are now available for free, like the Nigerian Startup Funding Report (NSFR), which contains comprehensive details of quarterly funding activities in Nigeria.\n\nOur Data and Research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has since 2018, released 12 editions of the NSFR.\n\nAlso, our flagship report, the West African Decade Report, which details funding activities in West Africa between 2010 and 2019, can now be accessed at no cost to you.\n\nWhy? I can explain, but our Intelligence Team Lead, Yinka Awosanya, aka Otunba, did that in his official announcement.\n\nRead here: Why Techpoint Africa is making all its past premium reports free\n\nStartup funding 101 with Mbwana Alliy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMbwana Alliy, Managing Partner, Savannah Fund. Source: Savannah Fund\n\nOver the last few years, Savannah Fund has invested in several startups, with over $200 million in follow-on funding.\n\nMbwana Alliy, Managing Partner of the firm, reveals how they decide which startups to fund, what drives the firm\u2019s investments, and goals.\n\nHe started the firm in 2012 when he discovered how hard it was for founders to get early-stage capital. And with significant experience gathered at i/o Ventures, an early-stage seed fund, Alliy was well equipped to run Savannah Fund.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe firm looks out for a solid technical co-founder, strong technical team, among others, before investing in a startup.\n\nBut here\u2019s where it gets interesting. Alliy says Savannah Fund invests more than money in startups.\n\nTo find out more, read Techpoint Africa\u2019s Chimgozorim Nwokoma\u2019s chat with Alliy here: Pan-African venture capital firm, Savannah Fund wants to help African startups go global\n\nSpeaking of funding startups, Eden Life, a home services company, has closed a $1.4 million seed.\n\nLocalGlobe led the round, with participation from others, including Future Africa, Samurai Incubate, and Rising Tide Africa.\n\nThe startup offers users domestic services such as cleaning, laundry, and cooking which can be directly requested from its app. Its target market is executives, remote workers, creatives, and techies.\n\nIt plans to use the funding to develop in-house technologies, build its own kitchen and operation hubs, and reduce its reliance on third-party service providers.\n\nElectronic voting and transmission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectronic Voters Machines prepped for elections in KAD-SIECOM\n\nSince July 2021, there\u2019s being some back and forth between Nigerian legislators and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) over the electronic transmission of election results.\n\nOn Friday, July 16, 2021, when the House of Representatives summoned the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) over the issue, Ubale Maska, Executive Commissioner, Technical Services, NCC, said less than 50% of the country had access to 3G Internet coverage \u2014 a major hindrance to electronic transmission of results.\n\nInterestingly, the electoral umpire, on Saturday, September 25, 2021, said that it could transmit election results electronically.\n\nAccording to The Premium Times, the Senate on Tuesday, October 12, 2021, amended a clause of the Electoral Amendment Bill to allow INEC to determine the procedure in which elections are conducted and transmitted.\n\nCan electronic voting work? The technology was first used in Kaduna State in May 2018. The truth is, whether it worked or not depends on your perspective.\n\nTechpoint Africa was at the scene of that election, and you can read all about it here. Inside Nigeria\u2019s first ever electronic voting exercise in Kaduna State\n\nElectronic transmission of election results is always a tricky subject. While INEC claims it can be done, Maska\u2019s assertion that 3G Internet coverage isn\u2019t available in some parts of the country throws some doubt.\n\nNigeria\u2019s electricity tariffs to the moon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectricity tariffs in Nigeria have continued to take an upward trajectory in 2021.\n\nAccording to Nairametrics, electricity tariffs were increased three times \u2014 January, June, and September \u2014 this year.\n\nThe tariff increase aligns with the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission\u2019s Service Based Tariff (SBT) programme.\n\nPer The Guardian, the programme which started in 2020 has increased electricity tariffs by 50%.\n\nAccording to Intelligence by Techpoint, the average electricity tariff across Nigeria now stands at \u20a632.99 ($0.078) per kilowatt-hour (kWh) since the latest increase on September 1. Consequently, the average electricity tariff for a month is approximately \u20a623,752 ($57.82).\n\nMeanwhile, a World Bank report in 2020 says about 47% of Nigerians do not have access to grid electricity. And estimates the economic cost of irregular power supply in the country at $28 billion, making electricity a major constraint to Nigeria\u2019s private sector.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nSophia, the first android with citizenship, now wants to have a robot baby.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTen years is a long time, and in the startup scene, it can often seem like forever. In the nine years since its founding, Savannah Fund-backed startups have raised follow-on funding of over $200 million. Techpoint Africa caught up with Mbwana Alliy, the firm\u2019s Managing Partner and chatted on what drives the firm\u2019s investments and future plans.\n\nBefore starting Savannah Fund, Alliy, an electrical and communications engineer and Stanford MBA graduate, worked as a software and aerospace systems engineer for several technology companies in Silicon Valley and the United Kingdom, including Microsoft and the UK\u2019s Defense Evaluation Research Agency.\n\nHe cut his teeth as an investor while working as an associate at i/o Ventures, an early-stage seed fund. He helped source deals, incubate startups, and provide strategic directions for the venture\u2019s portfolio companies.\n\nHis experience at these organisations allowed him to observe developments in Africa\u2019s tech industry. This opportunity showed him the difficulty founders face in getting early-stage capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTogether with Paul Bragiel, Savannah Fund\u2019s General Partner and a partner at i/o Ventures, he started the firm in 2012. Initially an accelerator, the firm hosted startup cohorts for three months, culminating in a $30,000 investment. In 2016, it fully transitioned to a VC firm supporting early-stage startups.\n\nWhat the firm looks for in startups\n\nSavannah Fund invests between $100,000 and $250,000 in startups, and Alliy shares what they like to see in the founders they back. The first requirement is having at least one technical solid co-founder on the team. With both partners having technical backgrounds, this does not come as a surprise.\n\n\u201cIn my experience, the best startups have strong engineering teams. Aerobotics and Smile Identity (portfolio companies) have strong engineering teams. We are seeing more and more startups that could work without a technical CTO, but that is something that we like.\u201d\n\nThe market size the startup is pursuing is another factor the firm considers. \u201cWe like to go after frontier markets where there\u2019s not much going on. That\u2019s why I like Ethiopia right now. It\u2019s quite disconnected from the rest of Africa, and with a hundred million people, it\u2019s a big market.\u201d\n\nIn addition to a big market, the firm also favours startups with the potential to scale across Africa and go global. Two of the companies in its portfolio \u2013 Aerobotics and FlexClub \u2013 have expanded outside Africa; the former operates in the United States while the latter has launched in Mexico.\n\nIn March, the firm brought the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Women\u2019s Finance Initiative (WeFi) on board as investors in their second fund. This has affected the firm\u2019s investment policy, emphasising female founders/teams and issues around environmental, social, and governance (ESG).\n\nAlliy discloses that about 46% of the startups in their portfolio have at least one female founder or a female CEO. In addition, he encourages startups in their portfolio, especially those in the logistics sector, to adopt sustainable practices. Governance is another area the firm takes seriously, but he cautions that timing is crucial in instituting corporate governance.\n\nMore than money\n\nA major effect of the success enjoyed by African startups is that more investors are itching to get a piece of the pie. However, this also means that founders need strategic partners who bring more than money to the table.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSavannah Fund is well-placed to offer founders a lot more than money. Alliy and Bragiel have extensive contacts in the US, having worked there previously. Also, Bragiel is a partner at Golden Gate Ventures, a Singaporean VC firm that has invested in startups like Stripe and AngelList.\n\nPortfolio companies and failures\n\nSome of the startups in Savannah Fund\u2019s portfolio include lending startup, Lidya, identity management startup, Smile Identity, eCommerce startup, Supermart.ng, logistics startup, Sendy, Ugandan gaming company, Kola Studios, and edtech startup, Eneza Education. So far, none of the firm\u2019s portfolio companies has failed.\n\nHowever, Alliy reveals that most of the startups from the firm\u2019s accelerator days failed.\n\nPitfalls for startups to avoid\n\nAlliy believes that focus is vital for startups, especially at the early stages when they may not have as much freedom to experiment. \u201cI see too many startups trying to do too much, too quickly, too early. A focus on the next step is very important.\u201d\n\nHe also advises that founders build to solve problems they care about and not for investors.\n\nWhile speaking with Alliy, his pride in those who work or have worked with him is evident. One such person is Malaika Judd, Co-Founder and CFO at Sendy, a logistics platform. Before joining Sendy, she was a mentor at Savannah Fund, leading the firm\u2019s investment in Nigerian logistics company, African Courier Express (ACE).\n\nDespite being Tanzanian, Savannah Fund has not funded any Tanzanian startup; Alliy hopes to change this soon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not made any investments in Tanzania because the previous governments have not been friendly towards startups. Hopefully, that changes soon. Investing in a Tanzanian startup would be my proudest moment,\u201d he remarks with a laugh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Over 40 million young Nigerians under 29 years could abandon furthering their higher education to join the informal sector over worsening poverty on the continent by 2030, a new World Bank report has said.\n\nThe report titled \u2018Good Jobs for a New Generation: Delivering Quality Jobs for Young Nigerians After COVID-19\u2019, said about 19.7 million will engage in household agriculture, 13 million in non-farm household enterprises, and 3.9 million holding wage jobs.\n\nThis could worsen poverty on the continent as informal sector jobs are unlikely to offer secure pathways out of poverty, the report said.\n\n\u201cMost farms are not commercialized and lack access to key inputs, so farming may not generate the earning needing to lift Nigerians out of poverty and non-farm enterprises are similarly small scale,\u201d Jonathan Lain, Economist at World Bank and one of the authors said at the media briefing of the report that took place on Thursday.\n\nLain further said that these labour patterns reflect the slow pace of structural transformations in Nigeria.\n\nOver 90.1 million Nigerians are now living in extreme poverty, up from 82.9 million three years ago; according to the World Poverty Clock. It makes a mockery of the Buhari government\u2019s plan to lift 100 million people out of poverty by 2030.\n\nThe World Bank findings relied on the Nigeria General Household Survey-Panel (GHS) and the COVID-19 National Longitudinal Phone Survey (NLPS) to draw its conclusions.\n\n\u201cYouth responded to both the 2016 oil recession and Covid-19 crises by leaving school earlier to enter the labor market, thus increasing overall labor supply. Rising labor supply amid chronic job shortages have further widened precarity and informality in Nigeria\u2019s labor market,\u201d the report stated.\n\nLeaving school early to find work could affect the country\u2019s human capital stock, notably through declines in educational attainment, the report said.\n\nIt added that the continued underinvestment in human capital may keep Nigeria from harnessing the economic potential of its young population through two main channels: weakening workforce productivity and slowing any fertility transition.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s economy to grow on oil boost but won\u2019t outpace poverty\n\nNigeria\u2019s economy has slumped into two recessions within the past five years owing to the collapse of oil prices, disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and an inability of the government to reform the economy.\n\nThe contractions have weakened consumers\u2019 purchasing power, throwing millions into poverty and now precipitating a rush to the job market with limited skills.\n\nAccording to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), headline inflation, which serves as a measure of consumer prices, rose by 17 percent in August 2021 while Nigeria\u2019s unemployment rate came to 33.3 percent in 2020.\n\nThe report said that between 2015/16 and 2018/19, the share of working-age Nigerians who were working increased from 60.8 percent to 67.3 percent, while the share of young Nigerians who were working jumped even more, from 38.6 percent to 50.7 percent.\n\nIt also stated that by February 2021, the share of working-age Nigerians who were working was significantly higher than would be expected, given previous seasonal patterns.\n\nTo test the report\u2019s conclusions, BusinessDay sampled the opinion of several young people engaged in menial jobs and found that poverty is the biggest motivation for the leap into the job market even with limited skill sets.\n\nDaniel Ekurume, a 20-year-old domestic worker said he had no plans to attend a university immediately after graduating secondary school three years ago.\n\n\u201cBeing the first child of my family, I have a lot of responsibilities at home. My father abandoned us when we were young, so as the man of the house I just have to do my part to support my family,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, 23- year old Survival Gabriel, who was unable to finish secondary unlike Ekurume said he engages menial jobs.\n\n\u201cMy father is sick, so he is unable to work, while the proceeds from my mother\u2019s catering business is not enough to take care of four kids,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NBS data shows that there are 69.7 million people in the labour market, out of which 30.6 million between the ages of 15-34 are fully employed.\n\nA further breakdown of the 30.6 million employed shows the most employed persons are those with Senior School Certificate Examination (9.7million) followed by no education (8.4million) and First School Leaving Certificate (4.2million).\n\n\u201cThe economic situation in the country has affected the capacity to retain jobs, create new jobs and sustain people in schools, thereby aggravating the high unemployment crisis,\u201d said Muda Yusuf, former director-general, Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI).\n\nThe World Bank recommends more investments in human capital, recouping learning opportunities lost during the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nThis will not only provide workers with the skills needed to prosper in the labor market and create jobs themselves but could also foster an improved standard of living for Nigerians, the report said.\n\nThe report also called for macroeconomic reforms to the exchange rate, trade, and fiscal policies to diversify revenue sources away from oil and ignite the structural transformation needed to create good wage jobs.\n\nIt is also called rendering help to small enterprises so they can thrive and grow. For farms, this involves research into improved crop and livestock varieties as well as public investment to support storage, transport, and market access could help boost agricultural productivity, the World Bank report said.\n\nFor non-farm enterprises, it called for policies that will loosen credit constraints and build the infrastructure and markets on which small businesses rely could bolster productivity, profits, and job creation.\n\n\u201cEvidence-based policy action in these areas can help ensure good jobs are available, enabling Nigeria to seize the demographic dividend of its young population and lay strong foundations for future inclusive growth,\u201d Tara Vishwanath, Lead Economist at World Bank and author of the report advised.",

          "text": "The network disruption experienced by over 73 million subscribers on the MTN Nigeria network on Saturday was caused by a disruption in the core network affecting voice and data services, the company said in a statement.\n\nMTN Nigeria said its technical team was able to rectify the problem in about five hours, allowing service restoration for customers to begin connecting with one another. The company is also extending time-bound subscriptions to ensure full value is delivered to all affected customers.\n\n\u201cI want to apologize to all the customers that were affected by Saturday\u2019s service outage. Our primary mission is to bring you the benefits of modern connected life, and notwithstanding this unfortunate event, our commitment to providing the reliable service you\u2019ve come to expect over the past twenty years remains unshaken,\u201d Olatokun Toriola, CEO of MTN Nigeria said.\n\nCore network in the telecommunications industry refers to a central element of a network that provides services to customers who are connected by the access network. The core network is responsible for a number of services including routing telephone calls across public switched telephone network (PSTN). This allows mobile subscribers to get access to the services that they are entitled to use. The mobile core network also provides critical functions such as subscriber profile information, subscriber location, authentication of services, and the necessary switching functions for voice and data sessions.\n\nRead also: MTN Nigeria users experience hours of network disruption\n\nRouters and switches are the facilities and devices used for the core or backbone network. Switches are used more often. The technologies used for the core facilities are mainly network and data link layer technologies, including asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), IP, synchronous optical networking (SONET), and dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM). For backbone networks used for enterprises, a 10 GB Ethernet or gigabit Ethernet technology is also used in many instances.\n\nThe mobile core network has evolved considerably from 2G, 3G to 4G. The core network for 2G GSM used to be known as Network Switching System (NSS). later the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) was introduced resulting in two nodes, Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) and Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) serving as part of the 2G core network.\n\nThe same approach was followed for 3G Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) core networks. 4G LTE networks (Long Term Evolution), however, use a more advanced core network called Evolved Packet Core or the EPC.\n\nOver the years, disruptions brought about by problems arising in the core network have affected 2G, 3G, and 4G networks. For MTN, Toriola says the company is working closely with network partners Ericsson and Cisco to ensure that the reasons for the disruption are fully investigated, and appropriate action is taken to enhance the resilience of affected systems.",

          "text": "The United States data giant, Vantage Data Centres has chosen South Africa over Nigeria for its more than $1 billion first African campus, the company said Wednesday.\n\nModerna, the pharmaceutical giants which shot into limelight with its sparkling success in leading the chase for a covid vaccine is currently reviewing a list of five countries to locate its multi-billion dollar plant to make the vaccine but analysts say Nigeria has only a little chance of being chosen.\n\nVantage Data expansion into Africa and its choice of South Africa, underscores the rising demand for cloud services even in relatively undeveloped corners of the technology universe and positions South Africa for more impactful foreign investment.\n\nNigeria, Africa\u2019s biggest economy and most populous nation has fallen down the continent\u2019s pecking order for foreign direct investment in recent years and it is slowing its recovery from two consecutive economic contractions in four years.\n\nThree months ago, another global technology firm chose Ghana ahead of Nigeria as headquarters for its 500-man strong operation in Africa.\n\nVantage\u2019s carrier\u2010neutral 80 megawatts-capacity facility will include 60,000 square metres of data space across three facilities in Johannesburg once fully developed, making it the largest in Africa, it said in a statement.\n\nRead Also: MTN Nigeria reveals reason behind $1.5bn broadband investment\n\nThe first phase of the campus is slated for completion by the third quarter of 2022 and will be powered by its own on\u2010site, high\u2010voltage substation, Vantage added. It will be developed by Attacq one of South Africa\u2019s largest property developers.\n\n\u201cJohannesburg is the data centre hub for sub\u2010Saharan Africa due to its strategic location, IT ecosystem, fibre connectivity to the rest of Africa and the availability of renewable energy,\u201d Antoine Boniface, the president of Vantage EMEA said.\n\nFor companies, having local cloud storage could save costs since they would be able to rent storage instead of building their own servers or relying on other countries.\n\nThe global provider of wholesale data centres will challenge Amazon.com Inc which has also been expanding its presence in the emerging tech hub of Cape Town.\n\nMicrosoft Corp has also built two data centres in South Africa, one in Cape Town and one in Johannesburg, while China\u2019s Huawei started building two data centres in South Africa in 2019.",

          "text": "Despite public outcry, the spokesperson of the House of Representatives, Ben Kalu, said the N134 billion allocated to the National Assembly in the 2022 budget is inadequate.\n\nHe called for an increase in the allocation to the National Assembly \u201cfor it to fulfill its mandate\u201d.\n\nHe stated this while contributing to the debate on the budget on the floor of the House. He reiterated the position while briefing journalists after the debate.\n\nMr Kalu had in February described the Nigerian parliament as the poorest in the world. The following month, he alleged that the National Assembly was broke, and called for an upward review of its allocation.\n\nThis call is coming despite the N6 trillion deficit of the 2022 budget for which the Buhari administration has planned to fund through local and international borrowing that will further increase the debt profile of the country.\n\nAlso, the National Assembly has ignored repeated calls to give details of its annual budgetary allocations.\n\nDebate\n\nDuring the debate on the general principles of the Appropriation Bill on Thursday, Mr Kalu lamented that the National Assembly did not benefit from the N280 billion increment in the statutory transfers.\n\nHe said the N134 billion allocated to the federal legislature represents about 0.82 per cent of the entire N16.39 trillion budget. He stated that the executive did not consider the exchange rate and purchasing power of the Naira.\n\nHe alleged that members of the House are too scared to speak on the matter.\n\n\u201cIf you do a proper analysis of statutory transfers for 2022, you will be seeing N768.28 billion and this is an increase of about 58.7 per cent from the last one which was about N484.49 billion, which means that what was added to it was N283.79 billion.\n\n\u201cNow, this increase, one would have expected that it would impact positively on the budget of the National Assembly. It is common reasoning. Over the years, you have increased the budget from one level to the other and the percentage of \u2018oversighting\u2019 arm of government keeps dropping.\n\n\u201cMany people would ask, \u2018are you saying that the money is not enough?\u2019 That is the truth. If you look at the committees and their responsibilities \u2013 the work they need to do, they need money to do it and the purchasing power of the money has gone low.\n\n\u201cIt is affecting them, especially on oversight functions. The amount of money needed to go on oversight (visits) is no longer sufficient for the job to be done. I stood up (on the floor) to call on the National Assembly to review this N134 billion because there is no a need for trying to sound acceptable to Nigerians and we are unable to do the job that you have asked us to do.\u201d\n\nWithholding details of budget\n\nThe budget of the National Assembly is part of the statutory transfer.\n\nHowever, unlike other ministries, departments and agencies, the breakdown of the budget of the National Assembly is not contained in the budget. It is just an approved lump sum amount.\n\nThe president increased the National Assembly\u2019s budget from N125 billion in previous years to N128 billion for 2021.\n\nDuring the approval, the lawmakers upped the budget by N6 billion, bringing their total budget for 2021 to N134 billion.\n\nThere are speculations that the legislature will again increased its allocation.",

          "title": "Britain now epicentre of online bank scams",
          "text": "Britain has become the global epicentre of online bank scams as scammers buy up batches of consumers\u2019 personal details on the dark net to target the record numbers shopping and banking online since the pandemic.\n\nThe country\u2019s super-fast payments infrastructure, relatively light policing of fraud-related crime, plus its use of the world\u2019s most widely used language English, also made it an ideal global test bed for scams,\n\nsaid five of the biggest British banks and more than a dozen security experts.\n\nA British record of 754 million pounds ($1 billion) was stolen in the first six months of this year, up 30% from the same period in 2020, according to data from banking industry body UK Finance, and up more than 60% from 2017, when it began compiling the figures.\n\nThat represents a per capita fraud rate roughly triple that seen in the United States in 2020, according to a Reuters calculation from UK Finance and the latest available Federal Trade Commission data.\n\n\u201cThe most sophisticated fraud tends to start in the UK, and then move two years later to the U.S. and then around the world,\u201d said Ayelet Biger-Levin, vice president of product strategy at U.S.-based cybersecurity firm BioCatch, which provides anti-fraud technology to banks.\n\n\u201cIn the last 12 months we have seen more fraud attacks than we had seen in any other year in history. Data breaches have also accelerated, so there\u2019s a lot more personal information out there that criminals can take advantage of.\u201d\n\nIt was an email offering a discount on an electric toothbrush that began the sequence of events that ruined Anna\u2019s life.\n\nWithin minutes of entering her card details, she got a call from her bank telling her fraudulent transactions were being made. The next day Robert Clayton from Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority called to say they were pursuing the criminals responsible but that her savings were at risk.\n\nThere was no toothbrush, though. No fraud department, no Robert Clayton. They were all part of a scam to gradually siphon off Anna\u2019s life savings, and within a few weeks the plot had succeeded, to the tune of about \u00a3200,000 pounds ($270,000).\n\n\u201cI am still in shock, the guilt and shame are impossible to convey,\u201d said the 78-year-old widow from central England, who did not want her full name to be used in this story.\n\nShe is one of thousands of people who have seen savings swept away this year by an unprecedented wave of online bank fraud hitting Britain, where you\u2019re more likely to be a victim of online fraud than any other crime.\n\nUnlike simple email-based scams of the past purporting to be from princes or oil barons seeking your help to shift their millions, the modern bank scam can be sophisticated, multi-phased and extremely convincing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some cases where the fraudster has been talking to somebody for three or four years as someone else before they actually scam them out of a large amount of money,\u201d said Brian Dilley, group director for economic crime prevention at Britain\u2019s biggest bank Lloyds.\n\nDeena Karia, another scam victim, told Reuters how she lost 10,000 pounds in early February after buying a seemingly safe bond purportedly issued by Credit Suisse and apparently listed on price-comparison site MoneySuperMarket.\n\nAfter filling out a form on the website and receiving a call from a staff member there, she called them back on the number listed on the website to check the phone number was legitimate, made further checks about the bond and went on to invest.\n\nKaria, from outer London, still does not know exactly how her money was stolen, but believes the scammers may have created a fake website mimicking MoneySuperMarket.\n\nThe genuine MoneySuperMarket warned on Feb. 15 of crooks faking its website and impersonating its staff. A spokesperson for the company said it is working to take down such fake websites and phone numbers, working with the FCA to highlight cloned websites and reporting issues to the police.\n\n\u201cI lost my Dad not long ago, I\u2019m caring for my mother and that money would have supported us for years,\u201d Karia said.\n\nBarclays, her bank, has refunded only half the money, saying she could have done more to protect herself.\n\n\u201cWe have every sympathy with Miss Karia who was the victim of an investment scam and as the case is currently being investigated by the Financial Ombudsman Service, we await the conclusion of their review,\u201d Barclays said.\n\nFAST PAYMENTS, FAST FRAUD?\n\nThe government\u2019s National Economic Crime Centre (NECC) agrees with the banking sector\u2019s assessment that fraud represents a threat to British security.\n\n\u201cIt is growing from an already enormous scale,\u201d said Chris Reed, fraud threat lead at NECC, which he said was meeting at least every month with bank bosses, technology executives and telecoms companies to assess and respond to threats.\n\nBritain\u2019s Faster Payments\u2019 network, which allows transfers between bank accounts to settle instantly rather than in hours or days as in the United States and other developed banking markets, means criminals can rapidly spirit away funds.\n\n\u201cThe faster payment system has facilitated faster fraud,\u201d said Richard Emery, a fraud expert who is advising Anna and 63 other scam victims whose average loss is 102,000 pounds.\n\nPay.UK, which runs the network, said the system supported the British economy, consumers and businesses. It added that criminals were getting better at exploiting digitisation and that it was working with the industry and regulator to fight fraud.\n\nWhile security experts and senior bankers said many fraud attacks could be traced overseas \u2013 including from India and West Africa \u2013 Britain is also increasingly exporting attacks.\n\nCrimes such as authorised push payments (APP) \u2013 where people are tricked into authorising a payment by a criminal posing as their bank or other trusted company \u2013 are proliferating globally after having started off as a largely UK phenomenon.\n\nThe country ranks second in the world behind the United States as a source of automated bot attacks, the fastest-growing type of fraud attack in the world, according to data from LexisNexis Risk Solutions, a financial crime analysis firm.\n\nBot attacks see criminals use a high volume of stolen identity credentials to overrun a website, allowing them to set up new accounts or access existing ones.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s popular to say the fraud threat is imported into the UK, and I don\u2019t think that bears analysis,\u201d said NECC\u2019s Reed. \u201cThere is a significant UK nexus to a lot of fraud, our operational experience is showing that.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s banks \u2013 which often pick up the compensation bill when people are scammed \u2013 are trying to respond.\n\nHSBC, which has operations in the Americas and Asia, has hired more than 300 staff in a year to support its anti-fraud operations in its home market and increased annual spending by 40% to deal with an \u201cexponential\u201d number of customers affected, the bank told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThe UK is the hotbed of activity for fraudsters. Currently the UK accounts for about 80% of our global personal fraud losses,\u201d it said.\n\nLloyds said it had invested 100 million pounds in its defences over the past two years, while rival NatWest has 10% of its workforce \u2013 amounting to 6,000 people \u2013 dedicated to combating financial crime. TSB has hired 100 extra staff to support fraud victims in the last year.\n\nBut lenders are also pressing the government to make social media platforms, where they say some attacks originate, share the burden. British lawmakers told bosses at Facebook, Google, Amazon and eBay last month that they needed to do more combat fraud.\n\nThe NECC\u2019s Reed said another problem was that just 1% of policing resources were dedicated to fighting fraud, despite it making up over a third of all crime in England and Wales.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t hide away from the fact that resourcing of the response is completely out of step with the scale and seriousness of the threat. We\u2019ve got a mountain to climb.\u201d\n\nThis means that criminals are emboldened to target people like Anna, who has little hope of recovering her savings.\n\nThe fraudsters had told her to shift her \u201cat risk\u201d cash to an account on a cryptocurrency platform that they emptied \u2013 while isolating her from family by stressing secrecy and coaching her on how to respond to sceptical bank officials.\n\n\u201cThey knew the name of my financial adviser, they were utterly convincing as FCA staff,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they told me I could not tell anyone about the investigation as it would damage their efforts to catch the crooks.\u201d",

Aviation is also capable of stimulating recovery and growth of the global economy by acting as an enabler and multiplier of economic activity\u201d.\n\n\u201cConsidering that the global aviation industry operates as an interconnected ecosystem, it is therefore imperative that all the States of the world implement the ICAO Council Aviation Recovery Taskforce (CART) recommendations and guidance, which are based on the latest development of the COVID-19.\n\n\u201cICAO, in collaboration with relevant stakeholders, is required to bring to maturity in short term a consensual modality for establishment and deployment of a global health passport as well as the specification of infrastructure (soft/hard) and training of professionals,\u201d he added.",

          "title": "To Raise IGR, States Need To Think Like Sovereign Entities \u2013 Osinbajo",
          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Thursday tasked states to think out of the box in raising their respective Internally Generated Revenues.\n\nHe made the remark at the maiden edition of Ekiti State\u2019s maiden investment forum in Ado-Ekiti.\n\n\u201cThinking differently, there is a need for a sub-national to think like a sovereign State,\u201d the Vice President said.\n\n\u201cYou have a bigger GDP and even more revenues than many nations. There is a different mindset when you are sure of a monthly allocation of cash at least enough to pay salaries, whether you generate income or not. This is the challenge. The so-called Dutch disease, one becomes complacent.\n\n\u201cBut what if you had to take responsibility for all those who reside within your borders, pay all salaries, from internally generated revenue?\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Sanwo-Olu, El-Rufai, Other Governors Call For State Police\n\nThe VP recalled how Lagos State improved its IGR from N600million monthly in 1999/2000 to about N45billion today. He said the illegal seizure of the allocations to the State by the then Federal Government was the shock that forced the state to rethink.\n\nSpeaking further, Prof. Osinbajo noted that although a state within a Federation is not a nation, it must behave like one, to further boost its economic development.\n\n\u201cThe economy of the sub-national is a peculiar animal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe state within the Federation is not a nation, but it must behave like one, it derives some resources from the Federal pool, and generates some income, the overall sum will provide infrastructure and services to the community. The size of the sum and the quantum of opportunity available to provide livelihoods for the populace will depend on how the State enables local and external investors, small and large to put their resources into business and commercial activity business in the State.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThe funded portion of the state\u2019s budget is after all a mere fraction of the sum total of economic activity or income-generating activity, formal or informal within the State. So, the attractiveness of a state to commerce is a radical issue.\u201d\n\nHe asserted that \u201cthe very lives and livelihoods of the people within the borders of the State, whether the people will live prosperous and happy lives, be educated, have access to affordable medical care, depends on it.\u201d\n\nPrivate sector-led\n\nSimilarly, Prof. Osinbajo highlighted how Federal and State governments can benefit from a private-sector led economy, noting that the private sector-led model is the right way to go, as \u201cbusiness is the business of the private sector, while governments should as much as possible facilitate, or at best, collaborate.\n\n\u201cAn excellent example is the formerly State-Owned, Ikun Dairy Farms at Ikun Ekiti. After 40 years of inactivity, the State Government divested 76% of its shareholding to a private dairy company, Promasidor, resulting in a company that is now producing over 80,000 liters of milk per month from a herd of about 500 cows.\n\n\u201cThere is also the recent concessioning of hospitality facilities such as the iconic Ikogosi Warm Springs, affirming the same principle (of collaboration). This is a very important principle, the idea that it is the private sector that really should lead the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nScience and Tech\n\nStates must find ways to harness the potential of their people through STEM education in order to become a more attractive destination for investors, noting that the key to the knowledge economy is education, he declared.\n\n\u201cGone are the days when you could argue that you should be an attractive destination for investment because you have cheap labour. Today, well-trained technology and innovation talent is the game-changer.\n\n\u201cIt would therefore be very important for Ekiti State to leverage its famed love and passion for education by focusing on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.\n\n\u201cSTEM education is vital for being able to participate in the 4th Industrial Revolution which is at once a digital age and a knowledge age. This must be the Fountain of the Knowledge Economy,\u201d referencing the State\u2019s alias.\n\nHe went on: \u201cthe importance of having a pool of healthy, well-trained workers such as electricians, fitters, mechanics, laboratory technicians, welders, machine toolists, and even web designers, is vital for an ecosystem that will be attractive for technology and innovation investments\n\nThriving Ekiti\n\nIn the same vein, the Vice President commended the State Government for establishing the foundations for a modern and thriving economy.\n\nProf. Osinbajo also pointed out the State\u2019s business-friendly environment, having ranked 18th overall out of the 36 States and the FCT in the inaugural edition of Nigeria\u2019s \u201cSubnational Ease of Doing Business Baseline Survey.\u201d\n\nEkiti State also had the highest score amongst all the States in the Technical and Professional Skills category of the Ease of Doing Business Rankings, he noted.\n\nAccording to the VP, \u201cthe fundamentals are there; a modern, strong, consistently improving legal and Justice sector. Ekiti State was strongest in the Skills and Labour and Infrastructure and Security indicators where it had an average score of 5.35 and 5.05, respectively.\n\n\u201cThis is a State that has vast arable land for agriculture and its value chains, a modern, strong, and effective media and public communications system, an experienced CEO of the State, Governor Fayemi, whose academic, civil society background, excellent relationships with international donors and DFIs, his experience as second term Governor, one-time Minister of Mines and Steel, and as Chair of Governors\u2019 Forum whose important experience in extracting benefits for the States from the Federal Government, all put the State at a distinct advantage.\u201d\n\nPointing to yet another area of strength, Prof. Osinbajo said \u201cfor example, there is tremendous potential for the development of a whole medical education and healthcare industry around the huge private investment in the iconic Afe Babalola University and the ABUAD multi-system Teaching Hospital. I know that the State was helpful in providing access roads and some other facilities to the campus.\n\n\u201cMany countries of the world do not have the number of medical talents assembled in that hospital alone. There are huge opportunities here and I believe that we must tap into those opportunities also.\u201d",

I have been through this road before,\u201d Soludo told Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today, days after INEC\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cWhen I ran in 2010, we had about 13 court cases in three months and thank goodness, the Nigerian judiciary stood firm and came through in the end.\u201d\n\nBut a month later, the Mahmood Yakubu-led INEC made a u-turn and named Soludo as the APGA candidate for the Anambra election.\n\nAgain, the commission said the development was in line with court judgements on the matter.\n\n\u201cThe commission was served with the judgement of the Court of Appeal (Kano Division) which set aside the judgement of the High Court of Jigawa State on the leadership of APGA and the nomination of its candidates for the Anambra Governorship election,\u201d INEC National Commissioner and Chairman of Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye explained.\n\nFollowing INEC\u2019s move, Soludo received the party\u2019s flag and launched his campaign at an event \u2013 held in Awka \u2013 and witnessed by hundreds of APGA\u2019s faithful at the Alex Ekwueme Square.",

          "title": "Five Killed in Beirut During Protest Over Judge in Blast Probe",
          "text": "Armed clashes erupted Thursday during a protest organized by the militant group Hezbollah and its allies against the lead judge probing last year\u2019s blast in the city\u2019s port. At least five people were killed and dozens wounded in some of the biggest fighting in years, authorities said.\n\nThe hours-long exchange of fire on a former front line of the 1975-90 civil war involved snipers, pistols, Kalashnikovs and rocket-propelled grenades, and were reminiscent of that conflict. It was the worst armed clashes since 2008, when the Shiite Hezbollah briefly overran parts of Beirut.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how Thursday\u2019s clashes began but tensions were running high after the Iran-backed Hezbollah and its Shiite allies from the Amal Movement demanded the removal of the judge leading the investigation into last year\u2019s massive port explosion. The two parties called for a protest near the Justice Palace, along a former civil war front line between Muslim Shiite and Christian areas.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the two groups said their protesters came under fire from snipers deployed over rooftops in the Tayouneh area.\n\nGunfire echoed in the capital for several hours and ambulances, sirens wailing, rushed to pick up casualties. Snipers shot from buildings. Bullets penetrated apartment windows in the area. Four projectiles fell near a private French school, Freres of Furn el Chebbak, causing panic, a security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press.\n\nThe students huddled in the central corridors with the windows open to avoid major impact, in scenes reminiscent of the 1975-90 civil war. Smoke covered the neighborhood where intense gunfire was relentless. A car caught fire, while a blaze was reported in a lower floor where residents were stuck and called for help.\n\nHaneen Chemaly, a resident of Furn el-Chebbak and mother of a 6-month old girl, said she first moved to the corridor before running to the shelter because the sound of gunfire was terrifying from her 10th-floor apartment.\n\n\u201cI did it for my child,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what is happening. I can just hear the sound of gunfire.\u201d\n\nThe violence unfolded while U.S. Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland was in town, meeting with Lebanese officials. Her schedule was slightly thrown off by the action on the streets.\n\nThe demands for Bitar\u2019s removal and calls for protest upset many who considered it blatant intervention in the work of the judiciary.\n\nThe right wing Christian Lebanese Forces mobilized supporters Wednesday evening after Hezbollah and Amal called for the protest at the Justice Palace, located in a Christian area. Videos circulating on social media showed supporters of the Christian Lebanese Forces marching in the streets, carrying large crosses.\n\nA journalist with The Associated Press saw a man open fire with a pistol during Thursday\u2019s protest, as well as gunmen shooting in the direction of protesters from the balcony of a building. Several men fell immediately from the gunfire and bled on the street. The army deployed heavily and sent patrols to the area to search for the gunmen, following the exchanges of gunfire between the Muslim and Christian sides of the capital.\n\nA staffer at the emergency room at al-Sahel hospital said they received three bodies and 15 people who were injured. One of the dead, a woman, had received a bullet to her head. Two of the 15 injured were in critical condition.\n\nIn a statement, Prime Minister Najib Mikati appealed for calm and urged people \u201cnot to be dragged into civil strife.\u201d\n\nThe probe centers on hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrates that had been improperly stored at a port warehouse that detonated on August 4, 2020, killing at least 215 people, injuring thousands and destroying parts of nearby neighborhoods. It was one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history and has further devastated the country already roiled by political divisions and unprecedented economic and financial meltdown.\n\nBitar is the second judge to lead the complicated investigation \u2013 his predecessor was removed following legal challenges. Now Bitar has come up against formidable opposition from the powerful Hezbollah group and its allies who accuse him of singling out politicians for questioning, most of them allied with Hezbollah.\n\nNone of Hezbollah\u2019s officials have so far been charged in the 14-month-old investigation.\n\nSporadic shooting continued even after army troops deployed to the area Thursday. Residents and civilians in the area were ducking to avoid the shooting. Someone screamed: \u201cSome martyrs on the ground!\u201d People pulled one man who was apparently shot and down, away from the line of fire. Others pulled another body away.\n\nIn some videos circulating online, some men were chatting: \u201cShiite Shiite\u201d on the streets, as residents were running from the gunfire.\n\nThe tensions over the port blast add to Lebanon\u2019s enormous multiple troubles, including an unprecedented economic and financial meltdown, an energy crisis leading to extended electricity blackouts, hyperinflation and soaring poverty.\n\nChemaly said said there was no electricity for her to follow on TV what was going on. So she knew nothing of the situation on the ground and opted for safety. After spending some time in the shelter, she moved to the first floor to stay with her neighbors away from the fire.\n\n\u201cI know there was so much mobilization from the night before, all predicting that a war would erupt,\u201d Chemaly, who heads a local NGOs that provides social services. Civil war erupting \u201cis the last card they have to use. They have (driven) us into bankruptcy, devastation and now they are scaring us with the specter of civil war.\u201d\n\nThe armed clash could derail the country\u2019s month-old government of Prime Minister Najib Mikati even before it begins tackling Lebanon\u2019s economic meltdown.\n\nA Cabinet meeting was canceled Wednesday after Hezbollah demanded urgent government action against the judge. One Hezbollah-allied minister said he and other Cabinet members would stage a walkout if Bitar isn\u2019t removed.",

          "text": "All Nigerian commercial banks have been directed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to adopt the exchange rate in the importer and exporter window (I&E) for cross-border payments through the Pan-African Payments and Settlement System (PAPSS).\n\nPAPSS which is a centralised payment and settlement infrastructure for intra-African trade and commerce payments, was developed by the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) in partnership with the West African Monetary Institute (WAMI).\n\nCBN gave the directive in a circular introducing the guidelines on operations of PAPSS in Nigeria, recently signed by Ozoemena Nnaji, CBN\u2019s director of trade and exchange department.\n\nThe I&E FX window is the market trading segment for investors, exporters and end-users that allows for FX trades to be made at exchange rates determined based on prevailing market circumstances.\n\nCurrently, naira trades between N410 and N411 at the market \u2014 which the CBN had adopted as the country\u2019s official rate.\n\nBy implication, intra-African businesses will need CBN\u2019s approval for banks to convert rates at the prevailing I&E FX rate for cross border payments and transactions.\n\nThe circular reads, \u201cAll authorised dealers are required to ensure that prevailing exchange rate at Investors and Exporters Forex Window as advised by Financial Markets Department, FMD, should be used in cross-rates conversion between Naira, United States Dollars and third currencies within Africa, for outbound payments and vice-versa for inflows\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor settlement of PAPSS transactions by CBN, authorised dealers shall obtain the approval of CBN for dollar cover before initiating payments on PAPSS.\n\n\u201cThe request for approval should be forwarded to the Director, Financial Markets Department, CBN.\n\n\u201cThat eligible payment of imports and receipt of export proceeds by the CBN shall be restricted to trade-backed transactions only and that the documentation requirements stipulated in Memorandum 9 and 10 of the Foreign Exchange Manual (2018) and other extant circulars shall apply. Import payments shall also be restricted to goods of African origin.\u201d\n\nAccording to the circular, all the required documentation should be provided before a transaction is initiated on PAPSS by authorised dealers and their customers.\n\nIt further noted that export proceeds repatriated to CBN under PAPSS shall be subject to certification by respective processing banks as being repatriated by the exporter.\n\nThe circular added that the provisions of all existing guidelines, circulars, and directives on the operations of foreign exchange market shall apply.\n\nThe CBN, however, stated that only eligible transactions as may be determined by the central bank from time to time shall be eligible for payment on PAPSS. \u201cItems classified \u2018not valid for Foreign Exchange\u2019 shall remain ineligible,\u201d the circular adds.\n\nOmotayo Araoye",
