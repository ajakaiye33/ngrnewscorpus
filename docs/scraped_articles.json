          "title": "Tribunal orders Multichoice to pay FG N900bn tax backlog",
          "text": "A Tax Appeal Tribunal sitting in Lagos has ordered Multichoice Nigeria Limited, owners of cable television services, DSTV, to pay 50 per cent of N1.8trn tax backlog to the Federal Inland Revenue Service.\n\nDirector, Communications and Liaison Department of the FIRS, Mr Abdullahi Ahmad, made this known in a statement in Abuja on Wednesday.\n\nAhmad explained that FIRS discovered the backlog through a forensic audit, as it allegedly showed that Multichoice Nigeria Limited had failed to pay to the Government of Nigeria in past assessment years.\n\nHe said the five-member TAT led by its Chairman, Prof. A.B. Ahmed, issued the order following an application to it by the Counsel to FIRS.\n\nHe stated that the Counsel made the application under Order XI of the TAT Procedure Rules 2010, which requires Multichoice or any other taxpayer who disputes their tax assessments, to make the statutory deposit required under Paragraph 15(7) of the Fifth Schedule to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (Establishment) Act 2007 (FIRS Act).\n\nAccording to him, these relevant laws are conditions that must be fulfilled before the prosecution of the appeal brought before TAT.\n\n\u201cIn certain defined circumstances to which the Multichoice appeal fits, paragraph 15(7) of the fifth schedule to the FIRS (Establishment) Act 2007 requires persons or companies seeking to contest a tax assessment to pay all or a stipulated percentage of the tax assessed before they can be allowed to argue their appeal contesting the assessment at TAT.\n\n\u201cMultichoice Nigeria Limited filed the matter at the Lagos TAT following its dispute over FIRS\u2019 issuance of Notices of Assessment and Demand Note in the sum of N1,822,923,909,313.94k on 7 April 2021.\n\n\u2018The amount constitutes what the FIRS calculated as due in taxation to the Federal Government of Nigeria from Multichoice after an investigation over several months to determine the extent to which Multichoice has been evading taxes in Nigeria,\u201d he explained.\n\nAhmad noted that at Tuesday\u2019s hearing of the matter in Appeal, Multichoice Nigeria Limited amended its Notice of Appeal and thereafter sought through its Counsel, Bidemi Olumide of AO2 Law Firm, for an adjournment of the proceedings to enable it to respond to the FIRS\u2019 formal application for accelerated hearing of the appeal.\n\n\u201cIn response, the FIRS Counsel asked TAT to issue an order requiring that Multichoice makes the statutory deposit of 50 per cent of the disputed sum.\n\n\u201cAfter hearing arguments from both sides, TAT upheld the FIRS Act and directed Multichoice Nigeria Limited to deposit with the FIRS the amount prescribed by the law, which is an amount equal to the tax charged upon Multichoice in the preceding year of assessment.\n\n\u201cOr one half of the tax charged by the assessment under appeal (whichever is lesser), plus a sum equal to 10 per cent of the said deposit as a condition precedent for further hearing of the Appeal.\n\n\u201cThereafter, TAT adjourned the Appeal to September 23, 2021 for the continuation of the hearing, subject to compliance with the Tribunal\u2019s order,\u201d he said.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that FIRS had in July announced its plan to engage some commercial banks as agents to freeze and recover N1.8 trillion from accounts of Messrs MultiChoice Nigeria Limited (MCN) And MultiChoice Africa (MCA).\n\nThe Service explained that the decision to appoint the banks as agents and to freeze the accounts was as a result of the groups\u2019 continued refusal to grant FIRS access to their servers for audit and it discovered that the companies persistently breached all agreements and undertakings with FIRS.

          "text": "Professor Yemi Osinbajo\n\nDetailing some of the ongoing and completed Federal Government projects in the Southeast, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, affirms that the Buhari administration considers the zone a strategic industrial, trade hub, and a major player in Nigeria\u2019s economic growth.\n\nThe consideration and the projects would also help in lifting people out of poverty.\n\nProfessor Osinbajo stated this earlier today at the inauguration of two completed projects in Anambra State: the MSMEs Shared Facility at the Ogbunike Leather Trading Cluster, and the Awka 120MVA 132/33kV Sub-Station.\n\nThe VP observed that the Second Niger Bridge Project which connects Asaba in Delta State and Onitsha in Anambra State has now achieved 65 per cent completion and will be completed by October 2022.\n\nBesides, he noted that the concession of the Onitsha Inland River Port is in its final stages, while both the draft Concession Agreement and the Full Business Case (FBC) have been transmitted to the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) for necessary action.\n\nAccording to Osinbajo, \u201clet me also assure you of this administration\u2019s commitment to seeing through the major infrastructural projects that will have a transformative impact on this zone. The Second Niger Bridge Project which connects Asaba in Delta State and Onitsha in Anambra State has now achieved 65 per cent completion.\n\n\u201cBy the time it is completed in October 2022, the Project will offer significant socio-economic benefits for the contiguous States and indeed the entire nation by easing traffic flow, improving road safety, and creating greater opportunities for residents and neighbouring States, thereby regenerating economic life.\u201d\n\nContinuing, the VP noted that the concession of the Onitsha Inland River Port is in its final stages, adding that once the Port becomes operational, it will effectively decongest the Apapa ports and ultimately translate into a reduction in the cost of imported goods.\n\n\u201cThe cumulative effects of all these measures is to open up the Southeast and our resolve to pursue these projects to their completion is an indication that the administration sees the zone as a strategic industrial and trade hub. They also demonstrate our conviction that Anambra State and the Southeast at large, have a huge role to play in our drive to foster economic growth and lift our people out of poverty. The commissioning of this facility here today is a milestone in our nation\u2019s economic adventure,\u201d he says.\n\nOn the Ogbunike Shared Facility project, the Vice President said the initiative would transform businesses within and around the cluster, hugely increasing their production capacity.\n\n\u201cI am told this leather cluster has about 2000 stores with almost 30,000 MSMEs operating here. So, I have no doubt that this facility will be of immediate value to all of them. When asked, some of MSMEs operating here said they are able to produce 200 to 400 shoes a month, using manual processes. With this facility, the MSMEs located here would now have a potential monthly production of 96,000 shoe soles, 44,000 slippers, 44,000 shoes and 22,000 boots.\n\n\u201cThis project will also help provide relative succour to MSMEs by also housing a One-Stop Office for MSMEs. This arrangement brings all relevant regulatory agencies under one roof to enable MSMEs requiring services or facing difficulties to access them with ease.\u201d\n\nOn the Awka Power Station, the VP said \u201cthe commitment of the Buhari administration to ensuring the completion of this Awka NIPP 132kV Grid Substation now provides a hitherto unavailable 70MW additional power capacity for driving industrial growth and boosting the economy of the State, with positive knock-on effects on employment and socio-economic upliftment for residents of the State.\u201d\n\nProfessor Osinbajo explained that beyond commerce, the power project \u201cis also connected to the new ultra-modern airport at Umueri,\u201d noting that \u201cwe are looking here at a substantial addition not just to power capacity, but more importantly at the capacity of the residents of this State, and businesses in this State to be more effective.\u201d\n\nWhile thanking the Vice President, Governor Willie Obiano, acknowledged the support the State has received from the Federal Government across different sectors including MSMEs, infrastructure projects, among many others.\n\nHe noted that thousands of small businesses have benefitted from schemes implemented by the Federal Government including direct disbursements to businesses in the State.\n\nSpeaking earlier, a representative of the Shoe Manufacturers Association of Anambra State, Chief Clement Okemefuna Emesim, expressed appreciation to the Federal Government for fulfilling a promise made in 2018, while appealing to governments to patronise the products from the leather hub in the State.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

The Governor is a leader that is really passionate about uplifting the lives of Borno people, placing public interest first, in all his decisions\u201d the Chief of Staff said.\n\nSpeaking on Zulum\u2019s media aides and social media associates, Prof. Marte said, \u201cyou guys have done a great job. I am with you, and I support you\u201d.\n\nOn his part, Borno\u2019s Chairman of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Comrade Bulama Talba, who represented all journalists in the State at the event, thanked the Editorial Team of the Compendium and lauded the cordial relationship between the Borno State Governor and the NUJ and journalists in Borno State, saying \u201cit is the most successful in the history of Borno State\u201d\n\nThe compendium documented articles published by journalists on Zulum\u2019s humanitarian engagements, issues of security, education, healthcare, strategic planning and development partnerships, budget and economic planning, housing and infrastructure, transport, governance and politics, the workforce, honours and awards, newspaper editorials, and wide range of comments by columnists and other persons in relation to the Governor and issues relating to Borno State.\n\nThe compendium documented some activities of the Deputy Governor of Borno State, Umar Usman Kadafur, with a special focus on his period as Borno\u2019s First Acting Governor, following Governor Zulum\u2019s transfer of power to him in April 2021. It also captured the Borno First Lady, Dr Falmata Babagana Umara Zulum and her Multi-Aid and Charity Initiative, which focuses on women and girl child rights.\n\nThe \u201cSecond Verdict\u201d was dedicated to resident journalists and social media promoters as well as many other media supporters of the Governor.\n\nThe \u201cFirst Verdict\u201d which had 299 pages, was publicly presented at a well-attended function chaired by Governor Zulum on August 17, 2020, at the multipurpose hall of the Government House in Maiduguri.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

But, we leave the resolution of same in the Hands of God Almighty.\u201d\n\nThe younger Okunbo stated, in the statement, that while he was alive, the late businessman muted the idea of selling some of his assets which he had inalienable right to do, \u201cto clear his table before his glorious transition\u201d, but the family was not privy to any conclusion on the said hotel nor his final wish in his Will.\n\n\u201cSuffice it to say, therefore, that this wicked piece is nothing but an unfortunate figment of the evil imagination of depraved persons. The Okunbo family stands united in ensuring the consolidation of the laudable legacy our departed dearly beloved son left behind. We will leave no stone unturned to celebrate this generational gift to humanity and this he eminently deserves,\u201d the statement added.\n\nThe family also frowned at a video making the rounds of the late Captain\u2019s palatial and state of the art piece of residential architecture in Banana Island, Lagos, which the family said the development had been ongoing for a few years even before his death.\n\n\u201cThis again is another wicked misinformation from demons who will be judged appropriately by our Almighty Father in heaven. \u2018Lest Satan should get an advantage over us; for we are not ignorant of his devices \u20182Cor 2:11, and certainly not of his agents.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, the family said it remained resolute and committed to honoring our great son of universal accomplishments.\n\n\u201cWe are resolute on this commitment and nothing will distract this family under any circumstance BEFORE, DURING and AFTER the burial obsequies. Our unity remains indissoluble and more united to the glory of God.\u201d\n\nIt also gave media houses that had published the malicious publication 14 days to retract or face legal actions.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "A fellow of the Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE), Mr Sunday Egbiki, has raised an alarm that 31 Nigerian cities risk being washed away by flood.\n\nEgbiki, a lecturer in the Maritime University, Delta State, raised the alarm while delivering a lecture at a virtual/physical conference of the 2021 Engineering Week organised by the Apapa Branch of NSE.\n\nSpeaking on the topic \u201cGreen Buildings and Infrastructures: Panacea for Mitigating Climate Actions,\u201d he advised policy makers to pay more attention to flooding, which he said was more dangerous than building collapse.\n\nAccording to him, Lagos State, Kogi, Niger, Benue, Nassarawa and Plateau are among the 31 states at risk of being washed away by flooding.\n\nHe called for urgent measures to avert the looming disaster.\n\nAccording to him, when buildings collapse, casualties are usually minimised to those within the structure, but flood washes off everything including cities within its part.\n\nHe added that flood regulatory bodies should be inaugurated nationwide, as flooding was not caused by impact of rainfall alone but by climate change affecting hydrological system.\n\nHe called on Federal and State governments to adopt Integrated Flood Management System by embracing green building and green infrastructure.\n\nHe said trends had moved from flood control to flood management, which freed channels for flood to discharge into rivers and other water bodies without obstructions.\n\n\u201cOut of the 36 states in Nigeria, it is only five cities that are not affected by flooding.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government should first of all take the green initiative by setting up flood managers that should be moving from one state to another,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the government should move away from being reactive to become proactive in averting flood, adding that, economic well being of Nigeria would be determined by positive climate actions.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cEach state should have their own flood managers that will be giving advice to government,\u201d he said.\n\nThe guest lecturer defined green buildings as ways of using renewable energy and other construction conservation methods to achieve less carbon footprints in homes and the country at large.\n\nCiting Lagos State as an example, Egbiki said several flood plains had been built up resulting in constant flooding being experienced in the state.\n\nHe said the Lekki axis, which was expected to be a buffer zone had almost been entirely built up causing the area to be currently lying two meters below sea level warning that disaster looms.\n\nHe, however, commended the Lagos State government for recently training 30 green construction experts who would in turn train others to ensure green building and infrastructure to mitigate climate action.\n\nThe guest lecturer warned that Germany, which had not experienced massive flooding in the past recently had some whole communities washed away because of adverse effects of flood.\n\nAccording to him, Net Zero Carbon Buildings will ensure adoption of construction methods that lowered energy and water consumption in houses thereby reducing carbon footprints.\n\nHe said green infrastructure could also be adapted in the construction of roads, drains and other major infrastructure citing Netherlands lying six feet below sea level as an example.\n\nHe explained that the government of Netherlands had to pay compensations and demolished all buildings along its flood plains and turned the area into a tourism site thereby earning revenue from solving a major problem.\n\nHe called for partnership between government, industries and the academia towards positive climate action to help Nigeria key into SDG goals 11 and 13 to save the nation from disaster.\n\nHe said energy consumption would grow by 37 per cent globally by 2035 while developing countries including Nigeria will record population growth of 96 per cent, hence the need to work on the achievement of SDGs which targets zero net carbon by 2030.\n\nChairman of the Apapa Branch of NSE, Mr Christian Ufot, said the branch was passionate about resolving perennial flooding in Lagos and other states, hence the choice of the topic for its weeklong programme.\n\n\u201cFlooding causes more havoc than building collapse,\u201d he said.

Okoronkwo.\n\nThe source, who pleaded not to be named because he was not authorised to speak, said a second lieutenant, simply identified as Onah, sustained a gunshot injury.\n\nThe officers were said to have been killed while foiling the gunmen\u2019s attempt to gain access to the hostels.\n\nUnconfirmed reports said the gunmen have demanded N200 million ransom.\n\nNDA is a military university that trains officer cadets for commissioning into one of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force.\n\nIt is located on Kaduna-Lagos highway and about 10 kilometres from the city centre.\n\nThe institution\u2019s spokesman, Major Bashir Jajira, said in a statement that efforts were on to rescue the abducted officer. He did not confirm the ransom demand.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe security architecture of the Nigerian Defence Academy was compromised early this morning (yesterday) by unknown gunmen who gained access into the residential area within the Academy in Afaka.\n\n\u201cDuring the unfortunate incident, we lost two personnel and one was abducted.\n\n\u201cThe Academy, in collaboration with the 1 Division Nigerian Army and Air Training Command, as well as other security agencies in Kaduna State, has since commenced pursuit of the unknown gunmen within the general area to track them and rescue the abducted personnel.\n\n\u201cThe NDA community and cadets are safe. We assure the general public that these unknown gunmen would soon be apprehended and the abducted personnel rescued.\u201d\n\nThe Defence Headquarters (DHQ) added that troops were on the trail of the gunmen.\n\nDirector of Defence Information, Major General Benjamin Sawyer, said the gunmen \u201csneaked in after breaching the perimeter fence\u201d, adding that they \u201cwent straight to the officer\u2019s living quarters and started shooting sporadically\u201d.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, two brave and gallant officers paid the supreme price while one other officer was abducted by the bandits during the process.\n\n\u201cAll efforts have been intensified by troops who are currently combing the entire locations in search and rescue mission for the adducted officers.\n\n\u201cThe Commandant NDA, as well as the HQ 1Div with the support of NAF, are presently in a coordinated joint operation to search and rescue the abducted officer and arrest the perpetrators,\u201d Sawyer said.\n\nEl-Rufai saddened\n\nKaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai, in a statement by the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, prayed for the repose of the souls of the personnel who lost their lives.\n\n\u201cThe governor conveys heartfelt empathy to the Academy, and the immediate families of the personnel, and also extends deep concern to the family of the abducted officer.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the Government of Kaduna State extends its unreserved solidarity to the Armed Forces of Nigeria and all security agencies who are making immense sacrifices on different fronts.\n\n\u201cThe government hereby appeals to the good citizens of the state to volunteer useful information to the military and security agencies in the campaign against banditry and kidnapping, in the state and beyond.\n\n\u201cOn its part, the Kaduna State Government will continue to take actions considered imperative in the campaign against bandits throughout the state,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nPDP: Nigerians have lost hope\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said Nigerians have lost faith in the capacity of President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration to secure the nation.\n\nIt said the situation has become so bad that gunmen now have the temerity to attack military formations and kill officers.\n\nThe party\u2019s spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, said in a statement: \u201cIt is distressing that having lost hope in the capacity and commitment of the President Buhari-led APC administration to protect citizens, state governments are now sending vehicles to the University of Jos, Plateau State, to evacuate their citizens.\n\n\u201cThis shows their complete loss of confidence in the APC administration and the empty promises by the Buhari Presidency.\n\n\u201cIt is even more disheartening that while our nation is under turmoil and while hundreds of helpless Nigerians, including innocent students, are languishing in kidnappers\u2019 den, President Buhari and APC leaders are more interested in their lavish funfair with state-owned resources and facilities.\n\n\u201cOur party notes that violence and acts of terrorism had escalated across the country due to the incompetence and compromises of the Buhari administration as well as its refusal to heed wise counsel from well-meaning Nigerians, including the PDP, on how to secure and stabilise the nation.\u201d\n\nSani: No lessons learnt\n\nA former Senator representing Kaduna Central, Shehu Sani, decried the recurring attacks on government institutions/facilities in Afaka.\n\nHe said in a statement: \u201cThe Airport staff quarters that were once attacked; the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation that was once attacked and now the Nigerian Defence Academy are all in Afaka. No lesson learned and nowhere is safe. Disappointing.\n\n\u201cThe bandits who kidnap and kill in the North and extorted billions in ransom remain poor, wretched and appear famished whenever arrested.\n\n\u201cUntil the government gets the hidden lords who ultimately collect the money and supply them with weapons, we just wasting our time.\u201d\n\nACF: security architecture in reverse gear\n\nThe Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) expressed shock over the incident, describing it as embarrassing.\n\nThe group, in a statement by its spokesman, Emmanuel Yawe, commiserated with the deceased families and prayed that the abducted officer would be rescued.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe latest security breach is another embarrassment to the ACF.\n\n\u201cThe NDA is a proud monument of the efforts of the first generation of northerners who fought hard to bring development to the north \u2013 the likes of Muhammadu Ribadu, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and Sir Ahmadu Bello who brought the Institution to Kaduna.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead Also: Nine bandits die during fight over ransom sharing formula\n\n\u201cThey did not bring it here for our generation to hand it over to bandits or whatever we call them.\n\n\u201cThis is an institution that is not only a pride of the north but pride of Nigeria. Many African countries train their military officers here.\n\n\u201cIt is really sad that ordinary street bandits will invade a military institution of such high national and international repute, outwit the security system and men there, kill officers and take one away to an unknown destination.\n\n\u201cWe of the ACF are particularly sad because Kaduna is our home not only because our headquarters is located here but for a long time even after the split of our Northern Region, Kaduna remained home to all northerners.\n\n\u201cThe NDA is a proud reminder of the achievements of our fathers. Is that how our present generation of northerners will seat and watch as these legacies are destroyed?\n\n\u201cWe of the ACF have said it again and again that there is everything seriously wrong with the management of our security. The other day, a Nigerian Airforce fighter aircraft was shot down by the so-called bandits.\n\n\u201cToday the factory where all Nigerian military officers are produced has been invaded and desecrated.\n\n\u201cWhat else do we need to show that our national security system is running on reverse gear?\u201d\n\n\u2018Sack Monguno\u2019\n\nThe Coalition of Northern Elders for Peace and Development (CNEPD) called for the sack of the National Security Adviser, Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd), over the alleged failure of Nigeria\u2019s intelligence network.\n\nIn the statement by its national coordinator, Zana Goni, the group said Monguno should have gone with other security chiefs.\n\n\u201cThe fact that a fortified military institution could be so easily invaded by armed militias without resistance has left us with the conclusion that no part of this country and no citizen, no matter his or her status, is safe again,\u201d CNEPD said.\n\nKaduna State House of Assembly Speaker, Yusuf Zailani, described the attack as an assault on Nigeria\u2019s territorial integrity.\n\nIn a statement by his spokesman Ibrahim Dahiru Danfulani, the Speaker said: \u201cIt is disheartening and unfortunate for such an attack to have taken place, catching those in charge of its internal security off guard.\u201d",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan, Noah Ebije, Kaduna, Molly Kilete, Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja and Sunday Ani\n\nThe attack on the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) in Kaduna by bandits in the early hours of yesterday, which led to the death of two officers and abduction of a Major, has sparked outrage and tension across the country.\n\nThe bandits reportedly entered the NDA premises disguised in military uniforms and passed through the security gate into the academy officers quarters and started shooting sporadically.\n\nThe Academy spokesman, Major Bashir Muhammad Jajira, in a statement said: \u201cThe security architecture of the Nigerian Defence Academy was compromised early this morning by unknown gunmen who gained access into the residential area within the Academy in Afaka. During the unfortunate incident, we lost two personnel and one was abducted.\u201d\n\nThe Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Iraboh, who has been on tour of the North East was said to have made a stopover at the NDA, yesterday. Iraboh, who arrived the academy at about past 5pm was taken round the academy by its commandant, Major General Yusuf and other officials to have a first hand information on what really happened.\n\nSecurity has been beefed up in and around the academy just as the Academy in collaboration with the 1Division Nigerian Army, Air Training Command and other security agencies have begun pursuit of the gunmen with a view to tracking them and rescuing the abducted personnel.\n\nMeanwhile, unconfirmed report said the abductors have contacted the NDA demanding N200 million ransom.\n\nPiqued by the development, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said the citizens has lost hope in the ability of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) administration to combat terrorism.\n\nIn a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, it said security situation has deteriorated so much that suspected bandits now attack military formations.\n\n\u201cBandits and terrorists are now freely ravaging our communities in Kano, Kaduna, Kogi, Benue, Zamfara, Adamwa, Taraba, Borno, Yobe, Imo and other states of the federation, including Mr. President\u2019s home state, Katsina, where the governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has now asked victims of terror attacks to defend themselves.\n\n\u201cIt is distressing that having lost hope in the capacity and commitment of the President Buhari-led APC administration to protect their citizens, state governments are now sending vehicles to the University of Jos, Plateau state, to evacuate their citizens,\u201d PDP said.\n\nThis is as the Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE) through its Senior Elders\u2019 Forum, raised the alarm that bandits may overrun Aso Rock, Nigeria\u2019s seat of power in Abuja, if proactive steps are not taken to safeguard the Presidential Villa and the entire country, while the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) expressed regret that the nation\u2019s security system was operating on reverse gear. The apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, pan-Yoruba group, Afenifere and the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) described the attack as a national calamity as it showed that bandits were becoming superior to the military.\n\nFormer national president of YCE, Dansaaki Samuel Agbede, who spoke with journalists in Ibadan, Oyo State, said the invasion was unprecedented in the history of the Nigerian military.\n\nAgbede, retired colonel of the Nigerian Army, stated that the attack signified that \u201cchicken is coming home to roost. All our calls and cries for proactive actions against insecurity have been confirmed by this worrisome invasion. It is very worrisome that bandits could have the audacity to attack military academy and kill officers. This has never happened in the history of the military that bandits could have the effrontery to attack military academy.\n\n\u201cThis is too disgraceful and it is just confirming what we have been saying about the fifth columnist. We have seen why we should not allow those Boko Haram insurgents into the military. It is like putting fire on our thatched roof.\n\n\u201cIt is time to look up and gather elders together to do something about this issue. It is dangerous to leave governance of 200 million people in the hands of one man. To say that we have a Major-General as our Commander-in-Chief and this is happening is worrisome.\n\n\u201cJust like we have been crying, these bandits are everywhere. We should stop dancing around for politics. It is disgusting. We really have problems and we should not wait until they overrun Aso Rock. We still appeal to the Federal Government to gather people together to address this issue.\u201d\n\nReacting, spokesman of ACF, Emmanuel Yawe, said in a statement that the incident was an embarrassment to first generation of northerners who fought hard to bring development to the north.\n\n\u201cWe of the ACF have said it again and again that there is everything seriously wrong with management of our security. The other day, a Nigerian Airforce fighter aircraft was shot down by the so-called bandits. Today, the factory where all Nigerian military officers are produced has been invaded and desecrated. What else do we need to show that our national security system is running on reverse gear?\n\n\u201cThe latest security breach is another embarrassment to the ACF. The NDA is a proud monument of the efforts of the first generation of northerners who fought hard to bring development to the north; the likes of Muhammadu Ribadu, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and Sir Ahmadu Bello who brought the institution to Kaduna. They did not bring it here for our generation to hand it over to bandits or whatever we call them.\n\n\u201cThis is an institution that is not only a pride of the north but a pride of Nigeria. Many African countries train their military officers here. It is really sad that ordinary street bandits will invade a military institution of such high national and international repute, outwit the security system and men there, kill officers and take one away to an unknown destination.\n\n\u201cWe of the ACF are particularly sad because Kaduna is our home not only because our headquarters is located here, but for a long time, even after the split of our Northern region, Kaduna remained home to all northerners. The NDA is a proud reminder of the achievements of our fathers. Is that how our present generation of northerners will seat and watch as these legacies are destroyed?\n\nSpeaking through its national publicity secretary, Alex Ogbonna, Ohanaeze Ndigbo described the country\u2019s security as scaring to any average Nigeria and called on the government to sit up because the development is threat to the corporate existence of the country.\n\n\u201cIt is a national calamity for this kind of attack to happen to the nation\u2019s defence academy because the armed forces are the symbol of national unity and last line of the country\u2019s defence,\u201d he said.\n\nFor MBF, the fact that the Air Force has not been allowed to bomb the bandits and mop up their bases means there is complicity on the part of the government.\n\n\u201cGovernment has to come clean because it is getting worrisome. If the government will allow the bandits to get this far, it means that something is wrong somewhere. To attack a defence academy where military offices are being trained is going too far. Government has to rise up and bomb the bandits out of existence,\u201d national publicity secretary, Alex Ogbonna, submitted.\n\nThe pan-Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, Afenifere, said the development is shocking and disturbing.\n\nAfenifere National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, said the NDA is the heart of Nigeria\u2019s military and should elicit fear in the hearts of criminals.\n\nAjayi, who spoke on behalf of the group\u2019s leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, said for the attack to happen few days after President Muhammadu Buhari had a meeting with his security chiefs was an indictment on the security architecture.",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\ncrisis rocking the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) assumed a new twist, yesterday, as the Deputy National Chairman ( South), Elder Yemi Akinwonmi and the Deputy National Chairman (North), Suleiman Nazif, laid claim to the leadership of the opposition party.\n\nA Degema High Court, in Rivers State, had on Monday, restrained the PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus, from parading himself as national chairman, pending determination of the substantive suit.\n\nAhead of the 2023 general elections and run-up to the PDP National Convention, power blocs in the opposition party had been at daggers drawn over the control of party structure.\n\nThe crisis blew open three weeks ago as a major crack emerged in the National Working Committee (NWC) with six of the members calling for the immediate resignation of Secondus.\n\nHowever, after a meeting of stakeholders, including PDP governors, members of the Board of Trustees (BoT) and members of the National Assembly, it was resolved that the party\u2019s convention, earlier scheduled for December hold in October.\n\nIt was also resolved that Secondus should convene a NEC meeting to set up convention and zoning committees. Nevertheless, Daily Sun gathered that NWC at its meeting, last Wednesday, could not agree on convening the NEC immediately, as resolved by the stakeholders.\n\nIn the aftermath of the court order restraining Secondus from functioning as party chairman, Akinwonmi, in a statement, yesterday, said he had taken over the affairs of the party in line with Section 35(3) (b) of the PDP constitution, 2017. Consequently, he announced indefinite suspension of the NWC meeting earlier scheduled for yesterday.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cSection 35(3) (b) of the constitution of the Peoples Democratic Party empowers me to summon and preside over party meetings in the absence of the national chairman.\n\n\u201cOur attention was drawn yesterday evening to a court order which purports to restrain our National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus from summoning and presiding over the meetings of the organs of the party.\n\n\u201cIn the foregoing circumstances, as Deputy National Chairman (South) of the Peoples Democratic Party, after the consultations and in exercise of the aforesaid powers, hereby deem it fit and prosper to postpone the National Working Committee (NWC) meeting earlier scheduled for today until further notice to allow for broader consultations in the overall interest of our party.\u201d\n\nHowever, in a twist, Nazif and some NWC members stormed the party\u2019s secretariat at about 2.30pm for a meeting.\n\nThe party officials were escorted by a team of mobile policemen, civil defence operatives and plain clothed security operatives. Immediately, the anti-Secondus NWC members commenced the meeting, the escorts took over the security arrangement around the venue.\n\nNazif explained that Section 35(3)(d) of the PDP Constitution (2017) empowers him to take over the affairs of the party in acting capacity, in the absence of the national chairman and deputy national chairman (South).\n\nThe NWC members at the meeting were the PDP national secretary, Senator Ibrahim Tsauri; national auditor, Adamu Mustapha; national vice chairman, South-South, Dan Orbih; his South-East counterpart, Ali Odefa; national vice-chairman, South-West, Toafeek Arapaja and national youth leader, Sunday Ude-Okoye.\n\nAccording to him, the NWC was in receipt of the court order restraining Secondus from parading himself as PDP and has complied.\n\nHowever, Akinwonmi insisted he was the authentic acting national chairman of the party and declared Nazif\u2019s decisions null and void.\n\nAkinwonmi, who was accompanied by the national secretary, Ibrahim Tsauri, said every decision taken by the Nazif group, was null and void.\n\n\u201cI am a man of peace, not a man of crisis. PDP has a good succession order. There is order here. The chairman is followed by the deputy national chairman 1 (South), followed by the deputy national chairman (north).\n\n\u201cEverything conducted here while I was not here is null and void. At the appropriate time, we will call on a meeting of NEC, BoT and we will meet here.\n\n\u201cI appeal to party loyalists, when a father is dead, another father will come. I did not play a part in the death of the former one.\u201d\n\nAkinwonmi, while reacting to the allegation that he was incapacitated, admitted that he was sick for some months but was getting back on his feet.\n\n\u201cSickness is not a friend of anybody. I was on my way to Wadata Plaza when I had stroke in my car. I was at the Cedacrest hospital for three months. Anybody can be sick but I am getting back and better. It was not my making to be sick. In the past, I could not stand up but I stop up singing the national anthem here this afternoon.\n\n\u201cIt is wrong for people to start making reference to my ill health. Anybody can be sick but I am getting better now.\u201d\n\nTsauri, who was one of those, who attended the NWC meeting presided over by Nazif, earlier in the day, said there was no division the opposition party.\n\n\u201cWe are here to adopt the doctrine of necessity. PDP is a law abiding party, with people of integrity and respect.\n\n\u201cYesterday( Monday), we were faced with something very challenging; which we never expected. We have no other option but to accept the order if the court. There are lawyers that took this matter to court. We have given the judgement to the lawyers to study.\n\n\u201cThe meeting that was held this afternoon happened because the constitution says if the national vice chairman 1 is not around, the national vice chairman 2 should take over. The crisis that brought all this started here, it is here and it will end here. We shall be prepared for NEC and convention. NEC will decide when the convention will hold.\u201d",

Some are teenagers, below the ages of 11, 12, who can handle AK-47 and there\u2019s one very important thing that Nigerians need to understand; if this issue of Boko Haram, insurgency, is not resolved, I believe it will never end because it is a generation. Those that came out from the bush you can see one person has two wives, three wives in the bush, he\u2019s having 10 children. These children are well trained to behave in such manner.\u201d\n\nZulum, who said he had been attacked by insurgents about 50 times, also promised to support victims of insurgency, especially those whose parents were killed.\n\nHe expressed support for ongoing surrendering by insurgents, saying it was in the best interest of peace and a way to eventually bring the protracted insurgency to an end.\n\n\u201cIn the last 12 years thousands of lives were lost, people have completely lost their means of livelihood. We have a total number of over 50,000 orphans and widows, these are official figures, the unofficial figures are more than this, and we were able to cultivate not more than three percent of our total arable land because of the insurgency and right now, the whereabouts of not less than 10 per cent of people of Borno State is not known to all of us at all. This is a very serious matter and I think the report of the surrendering of the insurgents, to me in particular and to the greater people of Borno State, is a very welcomed development. Unless we want to continue with an endless war, I see no reason why we shall reject those that are willing to surrender.\u201d",

          "text": "Kill two officers, abduct one\n\n*Officers in charge of CCTV allegedly slept off\n\n*ACF: It\u2019s a desecration, Northern elders want senior officials sacked, allege intelligence failure\n\n*El-Rufai sad over attack, commiserates with victims\u2019 families\n\n*Military launches manhunt for assailants\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna and Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nShock, condemnation, and anger trailed attack launched on Nigeria\u2019s elite military academy yesterday by some daredevil bandits terrorising Kaduna State and environs. The military university, Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), Kaduna, came under attack in the early hours of yesterday. Two officers were reported killed and another in the rank of a Major, abducted.\n\nThose killed are Lieutenant Commander Wulah and Flight Lieutenant Okoronkwo while Major Datong is still missing.\n\nIronically, the military university is just a few metres from the Federal College of Forestry Mechanization, Afaka where 39 students were abducted by terrorists on March 11, 2021.\n\nSketchy details of how the bandits gained entry into the premises of the premier military institution have begun to emerge even as unconfirmed reports circulating on different online platforms alleged that the kidnappers had made a ransom demand of N200 million to release the abducted officer.\n\nAnother officer was said to have sustained injuries from gunshots and was receiving medical attention at the institution\u2019s health centre, which occupies a vast land in Afaka, along the road to the Kaduna International Airport.\n\nTHISDAY has, however, learnt that personnel in charge of the Close Circuit Television (CCTV) mounted at the NDA actually slept off while on duty, which allowed the terrorists to gain access to the living quarters of the officers. .\n\nReacting to the development, the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), which condemned the attack, however, said it was embarrassing that \u201cthe factory, where all Nigerian military officers are produced has been invaded and desecrated.\u201d\n\nOn their part, the Northern elders have alleged a failure of Nigeria\u2019s intelligence network following Tuesday\u2019s attack on the Nigerian Defence Academy, NDA, Kaduna, by bandits and therefore called for the immediate sack of the National Security Adviser (NSA), Babagana Monguno.\n\nSimilarly, the Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, has expressed sadness over the attack on the NDA and sympathised with members of families of the victims of the invasion.\n\nMeanwhile, the Armed Forces had immediately launched a manhunt for the killers of two military officers and kidnappers of one other officer in a daring attack on the NDA by bandits.\n\nSources said the bandits, who were in very large number stormed the military institution at about 1am on Tuesday, wearing military camouflage, manoeuvred their way into the Academy and proceeded to the officers quarters.\n\nIn a statement yesterday confirming the incident, spokesman of the Academy, Major Bashir Jajira, said the security architecture of the institution was compromised, saying two officers were killed while one was abducted by the bandits.\n\nJajira said the Academy, in collaboration with the 1Division Nigerian Army and Air Training Command both in Kaduna, as well as other security agencies in the state, had commenced a manhunt for the gunmen with a view to tracking them and rescuing the abducted officer.\n\nThe statement titled, \u201cSecurity breach of Nigerian Defence Academy architecture\u201d, read: The security architecture of the Nigerian Defence Academy was compromised early this morning by unknown gunmen, who gained access into the residential area within the Academy in Afaka. During the unfortunate incident, we lost two personnel and one was abducted.\n\n\u201cThe Academy in collaboration with the 1Division Nigerian Army and Air Training Command as well as other security agencies in Kaduna state has since commenced pursuit of the unknown gunmen within the general area with a view to tracking them and rescue the abducted personnel.\n\n\u201cThe NDA community and Cadets are safe in the Academy. We assure the general public that this unknown gunmen would soon be apprehended and the abducted personnel rescued.\u201d\n\nBut sources have hinted that the reason the NDA was caught unawares was because the personnel in charge of the Close Circuit Television (CCTV) mounted at the NDA slept off while on duty and were unable to alert others to the presence of the gunmen.\n\n\u201cIt was in the middle of the night, and the personnel that were meant to be monitoring the CCTV had slept off. They could have put everyone on alert, and avert the attack,\u201d a source said.\n\nBut the ACF, in a statement by its spokesman, Mr, Emmanuel Yawe, said it was sad that ordinary street bandits would invade a military institution of such high national and international repute, outwit the security system in the academy, kill officers and take one away to an unknown destination.\n\n\u201cThe ACF, first and foremost commiserates with the families of those, who lost their lives during todays (Tuesday) attack on the Nigerian Defence Academy. These gallant men have payed the supreme price for Nigeria, their motherland. We hope their sacrifices are not in vain.\n\n\u201cThe Forum is praying that the abducted officer will be rescued and the criminals, who abducted him brought to book,\u201d Yawe said, adding that the latest security breach was another embarrassment to the forum.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe NDA is a proud monument of the efforts of the first generation of northerners, who fought hard to bring development to the north; the likes of Muhammadu Ribadu, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and Sir Ahmadu Bello, who brought the Institution to Kaduna.\n\n\u201cThey did not bring it here for our generation to hand it over to bandits or whatever we call them. This is an institution that is not only a pride of the north but a pride of Nigeria. Many African countries train their military officers here.\n\n\u201cIt is really sad that ordinary street bandits will invade a military institution of such high national and international repute, outwit the security system and men there, kill officers and take one away to an unknown destination.\n\n\u201cThe NDA is a proud reminder of the achievements of our fathers,\u201d he said, wondering if the present generation of northerners would seat and watch as the legacies were destroyed.\n\n\u201cWe of the ACF have said it again and again that there is everything seriously wrong with the management of our security. The other day a Nigerian Airforce fighter aircraft was shot down by the so-called bandits.\n\n\u201cToday, the factory where all Nigerian military officers are produced has been invaded and desecrated. What else do we need to show that our national security system is running on reverse gear?\u201d the forum asked.\n\nThe Northern Elders, while demanding the sack of Monguno, lamented that the development was an indication that no Nigerian was safe again in the country.\n\nThe group, under the aegis of Coalition of Northern Elders for Peace and Development (CNEPD), also sought an in-depth review of the entire security architecture of the country, stressing that the entire security chiefs must be blamed.\n\nIn a statement signed by its National Coordinator, Zana Goni, the group said it was time for the president to do away with Monguno following the worsening insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cThe the deteriorating security situation is a sign that Monguno, who manages the nation\u2019s security, is not on top of his game\u201d, the statement stated, criticising stakeholders in the region for their alleged \u201clong silence in the face of unbearable criminal acts by armed herdsmen and insecurity across the country \u2018thereby giving a bad image of the region.\n\n\u201cWe find it once more expedient to comment on the worsening security situation in the country, especially, the latest attack on a military formation, the Nigerian Defence Academy, which is the institution, where future military leaders are trained.\n\n\u201cThe fact that a fortified military institution could be so easily invaded by armed militias without resistance has left us with the conclusion that no part of this country and no citizen, no matter his or her status, is safe again.\n\n\u201cWithout mincing words, we wish to attribute this ugly development to intelligence failure and gaps in the capacity of our armed forces. We wish to strongly say here that the attack is a slap on the Nigeria intelligence community and the armed forces.\n\n\u201cThe retention of the National Security Adviser, General Babagana Monguno, at the time the president listened to the voice of reason and replaced service chiefs, may contribute to the continuously deteriorating security situation in the country.\n\n\u201cAs Northern elders, we have found it very important to call on President Buhari to remove the National Security Adviser, Major-General Babagana Monguno (retd), whose office and responsibilities are critical to the achievement of comprehensive security all over the country but hasn\u2019t used the high esteem of his office in any productive ways since his appointment as NSA.\n\n\u201cThe reason for this call is not farfetched. We believe that Major-Gen Monguno was part of the gross failure associated with the tenure of the former security chiefs and his continued presence in office will make the success Buhari intended to achieve with the changes very difficult, if not completely impossible.\u201d\n\nEl-Rufai, in a statement by his Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, was briefed on the incident and prayed for the reposed of the souls of those killed.\n\nAruwan said, the state government \u201creceived with sadness the report of the unfortunate security breach at the Nigerian Defence Academy, Kaduna in the early hours of Tuesday 24th August 2021. The security breach at the Academy led to the death of two personnel and abduction of one officer.\n\n\u201cBeing the host of the Academy and a partner in several spheres of national security and development, Governor Nasir El-Rufai has been briefed of the development, and on behalf of the Government and People of Kaduna State, has prayed for the repose of the souls of the personnel who lost their lives.\u201d\n\nHe said the governor conveyed his heartfelt empathy to the Academy, and the immediate families of the personnel, and also extended deep concern to the family of the abducted officer.\n\n\u201cThe Government of Kaduna State extends its unreserved solidarity to the Armed Forces of Nigeria and all security agencies, who are making immense sacrifices on different fronts,\u201d the statement stated.\n\nThe statement also appealed to the citizens of the state to volunteer useful information to the military and security agencies in the campaign against banditry and kidnapping in the state and beyond.\n\n\u201cOn its part, the Kaduna State government will continue to take actions considered imperative in the campaign against bandits throughout the state,\u201d Aruwan said.\n\nHowever, the Defence Headquarters, said yesterday that troops were in hot pursuit of the fleeing terrorists.\n\nAs the military pursued the bandits, Minister of Police Affairs, Maigari Dingyadi, said the armed forces were committed to containing mounting security challenges confronting the nation even as he disagreed with the position of the Governor of Katsina State, Alhaji Aminu Masari, to the effect that citizens should resort to self defence.\n\nHe said government was committed to the protection of lives and property and called for support of the citizenry in tackling the security crisis.\n\nAccording to him, while the bandits presented the challenge of guerilla warfare by their hit and run tactics, government was committed to its containment policy with regards to security challenges facing the nation.\n\nThe Defence Headquarters (DHQ), which alleged that the attackers sneaked into the officers quarters of NDA and started shooting sporadically, however, reiterated that manhunt for the criminals was in top gear.\n\n\u201cThe gallant troops of the Armed Forces of Nigeria (AFN), in joint operations are in hot pursuit of armed bandits that attacked the officers quarters of the prestigious Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), in Kaduna early hours of 24 August 2021.\n\n\u201cAll efforts have been intensified by troops, who are currently combing the entire locations in search and rescue mission for the adducted officers. The commandant NDA as well as the HQ 1Div with the support of NAF are presently in a coordinated joint operations to search and rescue the abducted officer and arrest the perpetrators.\n\n\u201cThe Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) wishes to use this medium to condole with the families of the deceased officers. He thanked troops for their quick response. The CDS also wishes to assure the NDA communities of their safety as security has been beefed up while operations are on going in the general area. Further details will be released later.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, Speaker of the Kaduna State House of Assembly, Hon. Yusuf Ibrahim Zailani, has expressed shock over the attack on the NDA by bandits on Tuesday and described the invasion, killing and abduction as an assault on Nigeria\u2019s territorial integrity, which must be treated with all seriousness.\n\nIn a statement by his spokesperson, Ibrahim Dahiru Danfulani, the Speaker decried the onslaught on NDA and called for an investigation by the military hierarchy.\n\n\u201cIt is disheartening and unfortunate for such an attack to have taken place, catching those in charge of its internal security off guard,\u201d he said, urging the NDA not to let the attack demoralise them.\n\n\u201cI sincerely commiserate with families of those, who lost their lives. I am pleased that the NDA authorities have given assurances that the assailants are being trailed and would be apprehended,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says excessive borrowing places country on a time bomb\n\n\u2022Emefiele, banks pledge to support girl child education initiative\n\nNume Ekeghe\n\nA former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and a former Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, has called on the federal government to stop subsidising power and fuel consumption in order to put the economy on a sustainable fiscal path.\n\nHe also warned the government against excessive borrowing, describing it as a time-bomb.\n\nSanusi said this yesterday at his Diamond Jubilee celebration where he launched his book and also commenced the HHMS11 SDG challenge, a United Nations initiative of which he chairs the advisory council.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN) Mr. Godwin Emefiele, pledged that the central bank and the Bankers\u2019 Committee would raise $2 million in five years to support his drive towards supporting the girl child.\n\nSanusi while speaking on the state on the Nigerian economy said: \u201cNigerians have to understand that the way we run the state is unsustainable we cannot continue subsidising fuel, we cannot continue subsidising power. It is desirable, but not sustainable but we have to be ready to make certain sacrifices.\n\n\u201cBut if we don\u2019t make those sacrifices now and set a fiscal position for government so that we are not relying on excessive borrowing, we are placing the future of this country in jeopardy.\u201d\n\nHe argued that the federal government has become so dependent on borrowing to the detriment of the future generation.\n\n\u201cThis generation will continue borrowing to consume while passing the debt to the next generation to pay. It is difficult decision to pass but we have to pass it. Because if we don\u2019t make it and you keep giving Nigerians everything they want today, at the end of the day you will leave the country on time bomb.\n\n\u201cThese decisions have to be taken to put this country on the path of fiscal sustainability and we all have to make these sacrifices and we have to stop relying on the government for everything,\u201d he added.\n\nSanusi who is also the chair of the advisory council of 1 million teachers, a United Nations sustainable development goal said proceeds from his book launch and all funds raised would all go to the initiative.\n\n\u201cThose who know me know that in many ways I am passionate about issues around women and girls. Out of all the United Nations sustainable goal, if you\u2019ve asked me which goal has the greatest impact for dealing with development issues, it would be educating the girl child,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also spoke about his new book, saying, \u201cNot many people know that between June 1995 and June 1996, I was in Sokoto prison as a threat to national security under General Abacha. Many of the articles in this book started after that experiment because when you are a direct victim of the injustice of the system, you experience it in the manner that people who would read about it do not. \u201c\n\nEmefiele, whilst noting that the government does not have the capacity to do everything, assured that the banks under the umbrella of the Bankers\u2019 Committee as well as members of the Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID) would be making contributions to support the initiative.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe should indeed not wait for government to do everything. Indeed government does not have the money to do everything, and what is being done today is to play a role in improving the education of the girl child.\n\n\u201cGiven the responsibility to raise at least $2 million in five years and i dare say that five years is too long. We would do our best to ensure we raise more than $2 million. At the Bankers\u2019 Committee, we did deliberate on this subject and the bankers would contribute substantially to this project.\u201d\n\nAlso, in his opening remarks, the Managing Director of Access Bank Plc, Herbert Wigwe, who is also the Chairman of Body of Bank CEOs, said: \u201c Sanusi for his 60th decided to gift to Nigeria with something that he was going to work tirelessly on \u2013 one of the SDGs \u2013 and that is the one that has to do with making quality education accessible for all, promotion of lifelong learning and more importantly around gender equality.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Alleges underground plot to make way for herdsmen\n\n\u2022Says president\u2019s bad governance anchored in nepotism\n\n\u2022Insists Benue will reject grazing routes\n\nGeorge Okoh\n\nThe Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, has said the dispositions of President Muhammadu Buhari, were beginning to confirm insinuations that he might have resolved to make the establishment of grazing reserves and routes the preconditions for peace in parts of the north, where herders/farmers crises were prevalent.\n\nOrtom, who spoke on national security issues on Tuesday in Makurdi, the state capital, also alleged that there were underground plots to make way for herdsmen, a development he further said had begun to embolden criminal herders.\n\nThe governor, who claimed Buhari\u2019s governance was bad because it was anchored on nepotism, however, said Benue would not allow grazing routes and reserves unless the entire people of the state, including himself were first killed by the federal government.\n\n\u201cFrom my previous discussions with the president, it is obvious he believes for peace to reign, grazing routes and reserves must be opened for herdsmen. Mr. President has a set mind towards achieving this, because previously, after holding meetings with relevant stakeholders across the country, the NEC had advised that the best way to stamp out the farmers/herders crisis was to support and implement ranching. It is really sad that the President would throw to the dustbin the report and recommendations of the NEC.\n\n\u201cHere in Benue, there has never been a gazetted route or reserve. The federal government is only on a mission to impose this unlawful structures on us.\n\n\u201cEven most of the northern states have agreed that open grazing is un-Islamic and as Christians, open grazing has been frowned at in the Bible in the book of Exodus.\n\n\u201cLands have not increased, but population has, therefore, a decrease in land availability has rendered the grazing route policy an inhumane policy. Rather, there has even been a decrease due to the ceding of land to neighboring nations,\u201d he said.\n\nOrtom, who said it was disappointing for President Buhari to declare a review of Grazing Routes and Reserves, was also concerned that the president might have been misquoted.\n\nHis words: \u201cWith the array of responsible and learned people around Mr. President, it is quite disappointing to hear the president come out to declare a review of grazing routes and reserves. I want to believe he was wrongly quoted, because as a man, who has an Attorney General and very many lawyers around, he\u2019d have been advised better.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ortom, Buhari\u2019s actions to approve N6bn for ranching in Katsina State but still went ahead to open Grazing Routes and Reserves in other states beat the tenets of fair play and justice.\n\nHe said, \u201cMr. President himself a farmer, believes in ranching, which is why he recently approved over N6bn to Katsina State to pilot the ranching policy, a cause which Benue as a state has championed for long.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, questionable why he would choose to open ranches in Katsina and open grazing routes and reserves in other states. His actions beat the tenets of fair play and justice.He is the president of Nigeria, so, it is wrong for him to restrict himself to Katsina State.\u201d\n\nThe governor pressed further that he was not at war with the Fulani, because there were good Fulani people, some of whom were his good friends.\n\n\u201cI am not at war with the Fulani. Of course, there are good Fulani people, some of whom are my very good friends. It will amount to logical fallacy if I say all Fulani are bad. It is just a case of bad governance anchored on nepotism on the part of Mr. President.\n\n\u201cI have told the president that if anyone tells him that he is ruling the country according to the provisions of the constitution, they are lying to him; they are only being sycophants and mediocres. For saying the truth to power, I\u2019ve been insulted by these crop, and even blocked from seeing the president, because for every second I spend with the president, I only get to tell him the truth.\n\n\u201cThe body language of the president has emboldened Miyetti Allah in executing very heinous crimes in this country. It is so bad that after orchestrating and executing terror, the Miyetti Allah now move in Abuja with long convoys and heavy security paid with tax payers money.\n\n\u201cAs long as I still hold the mandate of my people, the people that voted me to be their governor, the president or anybody at all would have to kill me first before grabbing any land to use for grazing routes or reserves.\n\n\u201cSince my assumption in 2015, I confiscated weapons collected from thugs and criminals, so it is quite unfortunate and unpresidential for the presidency to come out and churn out lies that I am arming militia or private guards. I am not a fan of thugs or the militia, as it is now evident in Benue. I believe in the rule of law,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the privatisation of government enterprises, Ortom said, \u201cI will be hosting a stakeholders\u2019 meeting soon, where we\u2019ll discuss the issue of privatisation, which seems to be the new blackmail on me by the opposition.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Ahmed, its chairman, issued the order following an application brought to the tribunal by the counsel to FIRS.\n\n\u201cThe Counsel made the application under Order XI of the TAT Procedure Rules 2010 which requires Multichoice, or any other taxpayer who disputes their tax assessments, to make the statutory deposit required under Paragraph 15(7) of the Fifth Schedule to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (Establishment) Act 2007 (FIRS Act) as a condition that must be fulfilled before the prosecution of the appeal brought before TAT,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cIn certain defined circumstances to which the Multichoice appeal fits, Paragraph 15(7) of the Fifth Schedule to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (Establishment) Act 2007 (FIRS Act) requires persons or companies seeking to contest a tax assessment to pay all or a stipulated percentage of the tax assessed before they can be allowed to argue their appeal contesting the assessment at TAT.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FIRS said Multichoice filed a suit at the Lagos TAT following its dispute over the agency\u2019s issuance of notices of assessment and demand note in the sum of N1, 822, 923,909,313.94k on April 7, 2021.\n\n\u201cAt Tuesday\u2019s hearing of the matter in Appeal No: TAT/LZ/CIT/062/2021 19/08/2021 (Multichoice Nigeria Limited v.

In a local media outlet on Friday, Shumete accused Facebook of blocking users who were \u201cpreaching national unity and peace\u201d.\n\nIn the past year, the Ethiopian government has been criticized for shutting down access to internet and social media services, including Facebook and WhatsApp, due to unrest in the Tigray region and during the election. The government has not commented on those shutdowns.\n\nSince November 2020, Ethiopia, Africa\u2019s second-most populous country with about 115 million people, has been engulfed in a civil war between the federal government and the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), which controls the Tigray region in the country\u2019s north.\n\nSupporters of the different sides have taken the conversation over to social media.\n\nTo build these platforms, Ethiopia is relying solely on local expertise. While Shumete declined to share further details about its social media rival project, he proudly asserted that Ethiopia won\u2019t be the first to rely on local talents to build its social networks.\n\n\u201cThe rationale behind developing technology with local capacity is clear \u2026 Why do you think China is using WeChat?\u201d he said.\n\nDrawing such a parallel with the social messaging app WeChat is a bit troubling. WeChat, which is owned by China-headquartered Tencent Holdings, is widely used in the country and is considered to be a strong tool by Chinese authorities for monitoring its population.\n\nAffected by the pandemic, the Ethiopian government has a lot on its plate as it works towards economic recovery. It\u2019s looking to raise money via sales of telecom licenses and obtaining an additional $1 billion debt.\n\nThis begs the question of whether investing in state-owned social network platforms should be on its list of priorities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "Last week, Jack Mallers, the founder and CEO of Zap Solutions and Strike, a bitcoin payments company, posted a video showing a free and super instant (within 10 seconds) transfer of $10 from his U.S. bank account to the Bitnob account of Bernard Parah.\n\nFor many, the transaction may appear like any other financial payment on a fintech app. But the Bitcoin Lightning Network connecting Strike and Bitnob is a system that could disrupt and improve how money is transferred across the world.\n\nHow does the super-fast technology work? TechCabal caught up with Bitnob CEO, Bernard, to find out.\n\nWith @Bitnob_official's Lightning Network integration, we now have free, instant, non-reversible remittances of any size to and from the United States, Nigeria, and Ghana.\n\n\n\n$10 in my US bank account became spendable NGN for @bernard_parah in seconds.\n\n\n\nMonetary history. pic.twitter.com/UXTf70qkpR \u2014 Jack Mallers (@jackmallers) August 19, 2021\n\nMichael: How did you get involved in Bitcoin and what was your work experience before cryptocurrency?\n\nBernard: I first learned about Bitcoin in school. There wasn\u2019t a lot of prior professional work before then. I had dropped out of the University of Abuja sometime in 2011 and in 2013, I moved to Ghana to study computer science. It was during this time, around October in my first year in school, that I got to know about Bitcoin.\n\nAs a student, I got a lot of freelance gigs and contract jobs with companies. So after my first year in school, I spent most of my spare time just coding and building things for companies in Ghana and around the world. I had a professional life that started in school and spent most of my time working than going to lectures. I only read seriously when it was a few weeks before exams.\n\nAt the time, I worked for the biggest PR agency in Ghana back then, Global Media Alliance, on a couple of platforms for influencer marketing. I worked for companies in the U.S. and Canada as well. I also ran technical stuff for a number of digital marketing agencies, which gave me a blend of marketing and software engineering.\n\nI got back to Nigeria sometime in 2018 and started some work with my current co-founders while consulting for companies in Nigeria and abroad. It was mostly freelance and consulting before starting Bitnob in 2020.\n\nMichael: So what led to the founding of Bitnob?\n\nBernard: I have a personal story with Bitcoin. In 2016, there was a CBN ban on the use of naira cards abroad. I had money in my bank account but couldn\u2019t withdraw it in Ghana. The only way was to get someone who sent me Bitcoin and I exchanged that for Cedis. That event was a turning point \u2013 I couldn\u2019t believe someone would give an order and my money was gone. Bitcoin made a lot more sense to me. It was money that could easily cross borders and I can always find someone in any country I\u2019m in who\u2019s willing to take my Bitcoin for cash. So it changed my perspective and I decided to dive deeper into Bitcoin.\n\nSometime in 2017, I quit my full-time job to fully focus on the space and then founded Bitnob with a colleague. We initially did over-the-counter transactions for people who wanted to buy large amounts of Bitcoin \u2013 $50,000, $100,000. We were the guys who could get it for you. Such amounts were not easy to come by on online platforms so we had to move around the streets of Accra, find people who had Bitcoin, gather them for sale. Then I realised this was going to be useful for a lot of people in the future and decided to build a career in this space.\n\nRight now, we do more than just broker. Bitnob allows people to save and invest in Bitcoin and the whole process is automated. Instead of wondering when should you buy or sell Bitcoin, the app eliminates takes care of that using the dollar cost averaging technique. You can automate your savings to say, for instance, buy $10 worth of Bitcoin every week. Bitnob will handle the rest. We also offer loan services. If you have Bitcoin, we take that as collateral and give you a loan in naira. We\u2019ve gone into payments across countries as well.\n\nMichael: How many users does Bitnob currently have?\n\nBernard: We came out of private beta with less than 1,000 users. Today we have more than 11,500 users and that\u2019s from January until now. So it\u2019s been an exciting year. Bitnob is registered as a U.S. company and has no Nigerian office. We target the African market and diaspora, looking to connect both parties.\n\nBitnob Co-Founder and CEO, Bernard Parah.\n\nMichael: Tell me about the Lightning Network connecting Strike and Bitnob. How does the technology work?\n\nBernard: When you send Bitcoin on a blockchain, there\u2019s a confirmation time. You have to wait for maybe ten minutes to receive the Bitcoin and probably wait another 10-20 minutes to actually confirm that the Bitcoin has arrived. In some instances when Bitcoin prices go really high, a lot of people complain that their transactions are getting stuck or taking too long. That\u2019s because they pay network fees to miners who process their transactions. That\u2019s what\u2019s called the base layer or layer 1. You can think of it like a road where everyone moves and whenever there\u2019s huge traffic, it gets choked and vehicles move much slower.\n\nThe Lightning Network is another layer, like flyovers that are built over the main road to help ease the traffic and get people moving faster. The network is built on the original layer. Like flyovers that are much faster and with less traffic, the Lightning Network does the same Bitcoin transactions but it is instantly settled, regardless of where you\u2019re sending Bitcoin from. This is because it\u2019s not moving on the Bitcoin blockchain itself. The Lightning Network is what we call the layer 2 technology \u2013 like a highway on top of a road for people to move faster.\n\nIn addition, the Lightning Network is an open system that anyone can plug into. You can simply set up a Lightning node and immediately have access to a global payments system that offers superior functionality to legacy platforms. So Strike was able to immediately connect to Bitnob\u2019s node after linking with the Lightning Network.\n\nMichael: Won\u2019t there be delayed settlements if there are huge volumes of transactions on the Network?\n\nBernard: By design, the Lightning Network is supposed to ease transactions from the main Bitcoin blockchain. Transactions can never get too much because what causes traffic on the Bitcoin blockchain is the fact that it uses blocks. In a block, you have a certain number of transactions which take around 19 to 20 minutes for confirmation. Within those minutes when several people are doing a lot of transactions, it piles up and the Bitcoin itself processes around seven transactions per second. But by design, the Lightning Network can process more than one million per second. So it eases the traffic to a significant extent and it never gets crowded because the transactions are settled instantly. There\u2019s no wait time.\n\nMichael: What informed the integration with Strike?\n\nBernard: Chad and I both share similar visions of a world where you\u2019re not restricted to do your transactions. A system that\u2019s open, unlike traditional networks which only a few people can access, there\u2019s a lot of permissions and fees needed because of the several intermediaries involved. As Africans, we\u2019ve been on the receiving end of it. We\u2019re the ones who haven\u2019t really enjoyed this system.\n\nThe interesting thing about Bitcoin and the Lightning Network is that they\u2019re open. If two entities become nodes on the network, they become interoperable with each other. Let\u2019s say you wanted to send money from a Nigerian app to a Cash App account today, there\u2019s no way to do that. But with Bitnob you can do that because Cash App and Bitnob both support Bitcoin. It\u2019s an open network \u2013 as long as you follow the rules, you can communicate with one another. It\u2019s similar to the internet; if your device follows the rules, connected as an IP address, then you can talk to anybody anywhere in the world. The Lightning Network is also a protocol where any two nodes can talk to each other.\n\nBecause we\u2019re interoperable with Strike, we\u2019re able to instantly settle transactions via the Lightning Network without the sender or receiver needing to touch Bitcoin or knowing that the transaction was done through the Lightning Network. That\u2019s the beauty of it.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMichael: How many test transfers and how much have you transferred so far?\n\nBernard: It\u2019s still in beta testing and we\u2019ve done thousands of transactions via Lightning since the video was released. We\u2019re opening it up gradually to a lot of people, giving more testers access to it, and just gauging interest before launch. The testing has been going very well with people moving money back and forth. It will soon be available to everyone, maybe in four or five weeks\u2019 time.\n\nMichael: Everything seems to be going fine. Do you see any possible challenges to this new super light transfer tech?\n\nBernard: It\u2019s not something I\u2019m worried about. It\u2019s not like we have a bank account or any direct connection with a bank. So there\u2019s really nothing. All we\u2019re doing is Bitcoin transactions. And I\u2019m not sure anyone has banned Bitcoin transactions. Strike is just selling Bitcoin to us and it\u2019s entirely a peer-to-peer transaction with no bank in the middle.\n\nMichael: What else are you working on currently? Are there exciting projects you\u2019d like to share?\n\nBernard: We\u2019re working on things that are potentially bigger than this and are excited about them. Let\u2019s see where we\u2019ll be in a few months\u2019 time.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",
          "summary": "But the Bitcoin Lightning Network connecting Strike and Bitnob is a system that could disrupt and improve how money is transferred across the world.\nWith @Bitnob_official's Lightning Network integration, we now have free, instant, non-reversible remittances of any size to and from the United States, Nigeria, and Ghana.\nMichael: Tell me about the Lightning Network connecting Strike and Bitnob.\nLike flyovers that are much faster and with less traffic, the Lightning Network does the same Bitcoin transactions but it is instantly settled, regardless of where you\u2019re sending Bitcoin from.\nBecause we\u2019re interoperable with Strike, we\u2019re able to instantly settle transactions via the Lightning Network without the sender or receiver needing to touch Bitcoin or knowing that the transaction was done through the Lightning Network.",

          "text": "After armed men snatched seven of Abubakar Adam\u2019s 11 children in northwestern Nigeria, he sold his car and a parcel of land and cleaned out his savings to raise a ransom to free them.\n\nHe sent his 3-million naira ($7,300) into the bush, together with payments from other families in his town of Tegina.\n\nThe kidnappers took the money, seized one of the men delivering it and sent back a new demand for more cash and six motorcycles.\n\n\u201cWe are in agony,\u201d said the 40-year-old tyre repairman, who is still waiting for some sign of what happened to his children three months after the mass abduction. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t have anything left.\u201d\n\nKidnappers have taken more than 1,000 students since December amid a rash of abductions across the impoverished northwest. About 300 of the children have still not been returned, according to a Reuters tally of reports.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has told states not to pay anything to kidnappers, saying it will only encourage more abductions. Security agencies say they are targeting the bandits with military action and other methods.\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of parents are facing the same quandary: do everything they can to raise the ransoms themselves, or risk never seeing their children again.\n\n\u201cWe are begging the government to help,\u201d said Aminu Salisu, whose eight-year-old son was taken in the same daylight raid on Tegina\u2019s Salihu Tanko Islamic school in May, alongside more than 130 students.\n\nSalisu cleared out his own savings and sold everything in his shop to raise his contribution. The owner of the school sold off half the grounds. Together, with the help of friends, relatives and strangers, the people of Tegina said they raised 30-million naira.\n\nBut that still wasn\u2019t enough for the bandits.\n\nKidnappers collected more than $18m in ransom from June 2011 to March 2020 in Nigeria, according to an estimate by Lagos-based analysts SBM Intelligence.\n\nThat flood of cash brought a flood of new kidnappers, said Bulama Bukarti, an analyst in the Extremism Policy Unit (EPU) of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. He estimated there were now about 30,000 bandits operating in the northwest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most thriving, the most lucrative industry in Nigeria,\u201d he said. Kidnapping has become a tempting career choice for young men at a time of economic slump, double-digit inflation and 33% unemployment.\n\nRead Also: Payment of ransoms sustains kidnapping industry, says Shehu Sani\n\n\u201cFrom December, we saw the Pandora\u2019s box open. They saw it was possible. They saw that nothing happened to the attackers,\u201d Bukarti said.\n\nIn December, gunmen kidnapped 344 boys from the Government Science Secondary School in the northwestern state of Katsina during a night-time raid. The kidnappers released the boys a week later, but it set off a spate of similar kidnappings across the region.\n\nThe bandits took a page from the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which seized more than 200 schoolgirls from the northeastern town of Chibok in 2014. That group had ideological aims and forced some of the girls to marry fighters.\n\nThe armed kidnappers in the northwest are motivated by money, experts say.\n\n\u2018A life-and-death matter\u2019\n\nThe abductions have piled more pressure on Buhari, who promised to tackle insecurity at his inauguration in 2019.\n\nThey have also tested the security services. The military \u2014 pitted against the kidnappers in the northwest, Islamist insurgents in the northeast, separatists in the southeast and piracy in the Delta \u2014 is deployed to at least 30 of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states.\n\nInformation minister Lai Mohammed defended the strategy not to pay ransoms, saying the government had destroyed many bandit camps and tried other approaches to tackle banditry.\n\nHe declined to give details, citing the need for operations secrecy, but said all levels of government are working to free the children.\n\n\u201cWe are winning the war against insurgency and we are winning the war against banditry,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nThe government of Niger state, which includes Tegina, declined to comment. Officials working with the governor said they needed to keep their efforts secret.\n\nMeanwhile, challenges keep mounting. The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, a nongovernment organisation, tracked a 28% increase in violence nationwide in Nigeria in the first six months of 2021, compared with the previous six months.\n\nReported fatalities from violence nationwide rose 61% to 5,197, it said.\n\nIt all explains, Bukarti of the EPU said, why Adam and other parents are willing to sell everything they have to pay ransoms themselves.\n\n\u201cThey cannot afford (it) by any means. But it\u2019s a life-and-death matter. And they know security agencies cannot free their loved ones.\u201d",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has called for increased synergy between the government and security agencies to tackle the proliferation of arms and combat insecurity in the state.\n\nThe governor, who received the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Farouk Yahaya at the Government House in Benin City, on Tuesday, appealed for the setting up of military base in areas prone to kidnapping and armed robbery along Benin \u2013 Auchi Road.\n\nObaseki also received the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba, stating the need to set up a special squad to tackle arms build-up in Edo communities.\n\nSpeaking to the Army chief, Obaseki noted: \u201cFirst, l have to commend you and your men for the cooperation that we have continued to enjoy with them. However, we are still having security challenges, especially the spate of kidnapping on Benin \u2013 Auchi axis.\n\n\u201cWe have military formations in Edo South, as well as in Auchi and Agenebode, both in Edo North Senatorial District; so that 120 kilometers space between them does not have any military presence, hence it is difficult for them to respond either from the Edo South or North when there is an incident.\n\n\u201cI appeal to the Nigeria Army to consider setting up a forward operating base to close the distance between the Edo North and South, as that will help us cover the axis where we are beginning to experience a lot of incidents.\u201d\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cThe 4 Brigade has been very helpful in terms of supporting our community crisis.

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nElder statesman, veteran columnist and former MD of the Daily Times of Nigeria, Akogun Tola Adeniyi, has noted that the insistence of President Muhammadu Buhari on creating grazing reserves for Fulani herdsmen across the country is enough evidence that there is a plan to \u201cAfghanistanize\u201d Nigeria.\n\nTerrorist group, the Taliban recently took over the Asian country of Afghanistan after a successful military campaign 20 years after NATO forces drove them out of power.\n\nReflecting on the events in the Asian country, Chief Adeniyi suggested that they are similar to what is happening in Nigeria where Boko Haram terrorists and sundry bandits are sacking communities while the government seem not to be doing enough to contain the carnage.\n\nLast week, Buhari, through his spokesperson, announced that his government had approved review of 368 grazing sites across 25 states of the federation \u201cto determine the levels of encroachment\u201d with a view to recovering them for the herdsmen, a development that has since triggered outrage, with many suggesting that it\u2019s an attempt to \u201cFulanize\u201d Nigeria.\n\nReacting to the development in a chat with Business Hallmark, Chief Adeniyi said the idea of grazing reserves is unacceptable and must be rejected by all Nigerians.\n\nAdeniyi said the attempt is an unmitigated provocation, and called on relevant stakeholders in Nigeria to call Buhari to order before he plunges the country into deep crisis.\n\n\u201cApparently, Buhari cannot be alone in all of these. It\u2019s either that he is not in charge or some people are hellbent to set the restive country ablaz,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is an ugly act of unmitigated provocation. The whole world has moved on beyond open grazing. There is hardly any country in the world where under age children are deliberately deprived basic education and instead sent on bare feet following cows in bushes and forests for distances stretching to hundreds of kilometers in inclement weather.\n\n\u201cThese over exploited children and even their equally deprived fathers and mothers don\u2019t own a single cow and yet those who sentence them to this Stone Age lifestyle live in luxury and enjoy all attributes of conveniences of modern living. It is just not fair.\u201d\n\nAccording to Adeniyi, cattle rearing is a private business and should never be the business of the government.\n\n\u201cCattle business, like fishing, pig farming, poultry farming is a private business. Governments don\u2019t own these cows, why should Federal Government under President Buhari insist on raising the temperature of the polity all the time.\n\n\u201cAnd this has nothing to do with being Fulani. Not all Fulanis are cattle herders. All the cows roaming the forests and destroying other people\u2019s livelihood on their farms do not belong to only Fulanis.\n\n\u201cAnd in any case, Gentleman Shehu Shagari and Umaru Musa Yar\u2019 Adua were Fulanis who ruled this same country before. They did not put the country or the people or state governors through all these agonies and antagonisms.\n\n\u201cElders in the four corners of the country should as a matter of urgency come together and call Mr President to order. They should have the courage to tell the multitudes of unelected power mongers and influence peddlers who have hijacked Buhari\u2019s government to back off.\n\n\u201cMembers of the Council of State and the National Assembly should be alive to their responsibilities and be mindful of the judgement of history.\n\n\u201cNobody can predict the end of anarchy, so no one should provoke one.\n\n\u201cNigerians have suffered enough untold hardship. Deliberate provocation and open invitation to \u2018Afghanistanisation\u2019 and \u2018Somalianisation\u2019 should not be allowed to compound their woes.\u201d",

          "text": "GUNMEN wearing army uniform, in the early hours of Tuesday, invaded the country\u2019s foremost military institution, the Nigerian Defence Academy, Afaka, Kaduna, killing two officers and abducting one.\n\nThe PUNCH gathered that when the gunmen entered the NDA permanent site along Airport Road, Afaka, in the Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State around 1am, they came through a broken fence and caught the residents unawares.\n\nIt was learnt that the gunmen, who headed in different parts of the premises, caught the officers on duty off guard because they were wearing military uniform.\n\nIt was gathered that the situation was worsened by the fact that officers who were manning the institution\u2019s Closed Circuit Television cameras were caught napping and could not raise the alarm when the bandits stormed the academy.\n\nA source stated that the attackers had already wreaked havoc and subdued the few soldiers who tried to resist them by the time residents got to know about the attack.\n\nThe PUNCH gathered that the military authorities, who were embarrassed by the invasion, had started compiling the names of errant personnel to be court-martialed.\n\nIt was learnt that besides the two officers who were killed, another officer, 2nd Lt Onah, who was injured during the attack, was receiving treatment in a medical facility within the institution.\n\nThe officers killed by the gunmen were Lieutenant Commander Wulah and Flight Lieutenant Commander Okoronkwo; while one Major Datong was said to be missing. The gunmen also shot and injured Onah.\n\nA top military officer, who confided in The PUNCH, stated, \u201cIn a Gestapo style, gunmen in military camouflage invaded the NDA, gunning down two officers, a naval officer and an Air Force officer, after gaining access to the well-fortified institution.\n\n\u201cThe gunmen came in large numbers. They were fully kitted in military camouflage and forced their way into the academy before proceeding to the officers\u2019 quarters. Their targets were probably the cadets (students).\u201d\n\nSources explained that the embarrassing attack on the academy could have been foiled if the security guards were alert and vigilant.\n\nA source stated, \u201cPreliminary findings revealed that the security guards were either asleep or not on duty during the attack. Further investigation will show what aided the attack; whether it was insiders\u2019 connivance, negligence or dereliction of duty by the guards or other extraneous factors or circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe military institution is opposite the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, where 39 students were abducted by bandits on March 11, 2021. The bandits had demanded N500m to free the captives a few days after the abduction.\n\nBut they were released after spending 50 days in the bandits\u2019 den following the intervention of former President Olusegun Obasanjo and controversial Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi.\n\nWe lost two officers, another was kidnapped by gunmen \u2013NDA\n\nConfirming the attack, the NDA spokesman, Major Bashir Jagira, said in a statement on Tuesday that the security architecture of the institution was compromised, hence the gunmen gained access to the well-fortified institution.\n\nHe added that the institution, in collaboration with the 1 Division of the Nigerian Army, Kaduna, and the Nigerian Air Force\u2019s Training Command had launched a manhunt for the attackers.\n\nThe NDA spokesman stated in a statement titled, \u2018Security breach of the Nigerian Defence Academy architecture\u2019, that the cadets and the community were safe.\n\nJagira said, \u201cThe security architecture of the Nigerian Defence Academy was compromised early this morning (Tuesday) by unknown gunmen, who gained access into the residential area within the academy in Afaka. During the unfortunate incident, we lost two personnel and one was abducted.\n\n\u201cThe academy, in collaboration with the 1 Division, Nigerian Army, and the Air Training Command as well as other security agencies in Kaduna State, has since commenced the pursuit of the unknown gunmen within the general area with a view to tracking them and rescuing the abducted personnel.\n\n\u201cThe NDA community and the cadets are safe in the academy. We assure the general public that these unknown gunmen will soon be apprehended and the abducted personnel rescued.\u201d\n\nThe attack generated angry reactions from groups, including the Arewa Consultative Forum and the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union.\n\nWhile the pan-northern organisation, the ACF, described the incident as \u201cterrible,\u201d SOKAPU said the attack never came to it as a shock and warned that it would set the stage for what is currently happening in Afghanistan to occur in Nigeria.\n\nIt\u2019s terrible, a big embarrassment, ACF laments\n\nThe ACF, through its National Publicity Secretary, Emmanuel Yawe, said the attack highlighted the parlous state of security in the country.\n\nThe ACF spokesman spoke with one of our correspondents in Kaduna on Tuesday shortly after the attack.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible development. It underscores our parlous state of security in Nigeria and the uncountable calls by the ACF and others for something to be done by the government to improve our collective security.\n\n\u201cThe latest security breach is another embarrassment to the ACF. The NDA is a proud monument of the efforts of the first generation of northerners, who fought hard to bring development to the North; the likes of Muhammadu Ribadu, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and Sir Ahmadu Bello, who brought the institution to Kaduna. They did not bring it here for our generation to hand it over to bandits or whatever we call them.\n\nSOKAPU condemns attack, says it\u2019s Buhari\u2019s plot to turn Nigeria into Afghanistan\n\nSOKAPU, an umbrella body of the Southern Kaduna people, condemned the attack.\n\nIt noted that if nothing was done on the current attack, the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), might be rehearsing a \u201cscript.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman for SOKAPU, Luka Binniyat, said in an interview with The PUNCH that the impunity and daring way in which the attack was carried out without any casualties on the part of the invaders pointed to a more serious danger to Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThis attack, the killing of two officers and the kidnapping of another one at the NDA, to be honest, did not come to SOKAPU as a surprise at all. This is because even the barracks of the Command and Staff College, Jaji, which is between Zaria and Kaduna, has been invaded a few times this year by the same armed men, who went away with cattle and other loot.\n\nBinniyat warned that if drastic measures were not taken to apprehend the armed men, there could be a repeat of the situation in Afghanistan in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s past words, actions and controversial policies show that he may not mind transferring power to such a crop of extremists.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, this unfortunate and unacceptable development will wake up everyone to the reality that apart from Buhari, his governors and maybe, service chiefs, we are all sitting ducks in the hands of outlaws, who may be executing a sinister agenda to take over Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on all moderate Muslims, all Christians and all men of honour and courage to stand in unity and denounce this shameful development and call Buhari and Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State to take their primary responsibility seriously before we sink lower than we have ever imagined.\u201d Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "Bola Tinubu, the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress and former Governor of Lagos State, spent almost 60 days in hospitals in France, the United States, and the United Kingdom in 2021 alone, undergoing procedures for unidentified ailments.\n\nAccording to reports, Tinubu, who is expected to run for President of Nigeria in 2023 to follow Muhammadu Buhari, has spent almost two months in Europe and will spend more time there as he recovers.\n\nTinubu was taken out of the nation to Paris, France, a few days before Christmas in 2020.\n\nThere were rumours that he had tested positive for COVID-19, but his media aide, Tunde Rahman, later rejected these claims.\n\nFollowing a month away from Nigeria, the APC leader returned on January 24, 2021.\n\nHe also travelled to France for a medical check-up on Thursday, June 10 and was noticeably absent from President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s one-day business visit to Lagos State.\n\n\u201cTinubu is undergoing medical examinations in Paris, France. His health is worsening as a result of his advanced age \u201ca high-ranking source told SaharaReporters\n\nTinubu was obliged to return to the country on Tuesday, June 15, amid death rumors.\n\nTinubu was also hospitalized in Maryland, the United States, according to SaharaReporters in July 2021.\n\nTinubu, who has made numerous medical trips this year alone, is said to have undergone surgery and may be charged for another due to an illness that has yet to be revealed.\n\n\u201cTinubu is hospitalised in Maryland, US. His health is failing. He couldn\u2019t participate in launching his Arewa library, and he couldn\u2019t participate in the Local Government Area elections last week. He could not attend today\u2019s APC congress due to health reasons.\n\n\u201cHe had a surgery last week,\u201d an authoritative source had disclosed at the time.\n\nOn August 9, Tinubu had another knee surgery at the John Hopkins University Hospital in Maryland, the United States.\n\nThe APC chieftain, it was learnt, left the US for the United Kingdom on crutches, a few days after the surgery.\n\nSources close to Tinubu had told SaharaReporters that he wanted the surgery in Paris, France but changed his plan over rumours of his death.\n\n\u201cTinubu had his second surgery at John Hopkins University in Maryland recently. He was accompanied by a popular Nigerian doctor in Chicago. He had wanted the surgery in Paris but when rumour was rife about his death, he hurriedly left for Nigeria and went to John Hopkins,\u201d one of the sources had said.\n\n\u201cHe left the US for the UK on crutches,\u201d another source had revealed.\n\nOf recent, the President paid a visit to Tinubu in London and the latter was seen with a walking stick during Buhari\u2019s visit, confirming SaharaReporters\u2019 story that he underwent a second surgery in the United States.\n\nTill date, Tinubu is yet to return to Nigeria as he continues to battle ill-health.\n\nThis is despite the push for his 2023 presidential ambition by certain bodies such as South West Agenda for Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu (SWAGA 23).\n\nThough the former Lagos state governor has not openly declared his intention to run for president in 2023, it is an open secret that he intends to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nTinubu currently tows the path of President Buhari, who himself has spent more than 200 days on medical leave in the United Kingdom since he assumed office in 2015.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s leading opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party, was on Tuesday factionalized with the emergence of two acting national chairmen.\n\nThe two Deputy National Chairmen of the party, Yemi Akinwonmi (South) and Senator Suleiman Nazif (North), in separate announcements on Tuesday, claimed to be the party\u2019s acting National Chairman.\n\nIt was gathered that while Akinwonmi was loyal to the Rivers State Governor, Mr Nyesom Wike, Nazif had the support of the suspended National Chairman of the party, Uche Secondus.\n\nA Rivers State High Court presided over by Justice O. Gbasam of the Degema Judicial Division vacation court, sitting in Port Harcourt, had on Monday granted an order restraining Secondus from parading himself as the national chairman of the party.\n\nThis was sequel to the consideration of an ex parte application in suit No: PHC/2183/CS/2021 filed by Ibeabuchi Alex, Dennis Amadi, Emmanuel Stephen, and Umezirike Onucha against Uche Secondus (1st defendant) and the PDP (2nd defendant).\n\nOn Tuesday, Akinwonmi issued a statement declaring himself as the acting national chairman in the absence of Secondus, citing Section 45 (2) of the PDP Constitution.\n\nHis statement read in part, \u201cOur attention was drawn yesterday evening (Monday) to a court order, which purports to restrain our National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, from summoning and presiding over the meetings of the organs of the party.\n\n\u201cSection 45(2) (b) of the Constitution of the Peoples Democratic Party empowers me to summon and preside over party meetings in the absence of the national chairman.\n\n\u201cIn the foregoing circumstances, as the Deputy National Chairman (South) of the Peoples Democratic Party, after consultation and in the exercise of the aforesaid powers, I hereby deem it fit and proper to postpone the National Working Committee meeting earlier scheduled for today (Tuesday) until further notice to allow for broader consultation in the overall interest of our party.\u201d\n\nA few hours after the statement, members of the party\u2019s NWC under the leadership of Nazif stormed the PDP national secretariat in company with armed policemen and went straight into the NWC conference room for a meeting that started around 2 pm.\n\nSoon after the meeting, which lasted about 40 minutes, Nazif addressed the media.\n\nHe said, \u201cMembers of the NWC will recall that this morning, we were in possession of a valid court order from a high court in Degema, Rivers State, issuing an order removing Secondus as a member of the Peoples Democratic Party as well as the national chairman of our great party.\n\n\u201cA court has also ordered that from August 23, 2021, Prince Uche Secondus should stop parading himself as the national chairman. The NWC hereby complies fully with the court order.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the NWC hereby calls for an emergency NEC meeting on Friday, August 27, 2021, at 10 am prompt to deliberate on matters affecting the party. You are all aware that the PDP is a law-abiding party, the party that follows due process. So, we have received this order and this is it.\n\n\u201cAnd in line with the Constitution of the Peoples Democratic Party, and I quote Section 35, 3 a-d, \u2018Functions of a deputy national chairman: there shall be two deputy national chairman, one shall come from the northern part, while the other from the southern part of the country. The deputy national chairmen shall perform the following functions: 1) assist the national chairman in the discharge of his duty. 2) Perform such other functions as may be assigned to them.\n\n\u201c3) In a result of resignation, removal, death, incapacitation or absence of the national chairman, a deputy national chairman from the region part of the country where the national chairman originates from shall assume office as the national chairman in acting capacity without prejudice to Section 47 (6) of the Party Constitution. 4) In the absence of the national chairman and the deputy national chairman from the region or part of the country where the national chairman originates from, the other deputy national chairman shall act as the national chairman without prejudice to Section 47 (6) of this Constitution.\n\n\u201cOn this note, distinguished NWC members, I hereby take full charge of the Peoples Democratic Party as chairman in an acting capacity.\u201d\n\nWhile explaining his reason for taking over, Nazif said, \u201cWe have waited this morning for the deputy national chairman (South), who has been incapacitated and who has not been attending the NWC meetings in the last nine months. As you know, in the absence of the deputy chairman (South), I take full charge; so, I am hereby calling for an emergency NEC meeting for August 27, 2021, by 10 am prompt to deliberate on the new development.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe all the leaders of this party, the owners of this party, will be in attendance and that our governors and former presiding officers will be part of the NEC meeting to deliberate on all pending issues.\u201d\n\nIn response to a question as to whether there was now a division among members of the NWC, he said, \u201cLet me make this very clear that this meeting was called for 2 pm and like I said, the deputy national chairman, South, has been incapacitated and did not attend any meeting in the last nine to 10 months as far as the NWC is concerned.\n\n\u201cHe has not been in communication with any member of the NWC for the last 10 months. This party must continue its process.\n\n\u201cAnd if I am not available, someone else will take over. If the national chairman is not available, someone will take over; if the deputy national chairman, South, is not available, the deputy chairman, North, will take charge.\n\n\u201cThis is the resolution that was passed by the expanded caucus. And this was the resolution passed by the NWC at our last meeting and we all agreed that there would be a meeting today, a meeting that was supposed to be presided over by the national chairman; unfortunately, the court order came from a competent court and stopped the chairman from acting as the chairman of the party.\u201d\n\nThose who attended the meeting presided over by Nazif included the PDP National Secretary, Senator Ibrahim Tsauri; National Auditor, Adamu Mustapha; National Vice Chairman, South-South, Dan Orbih; his South-East counterpart, Ali Odefa; National Vice-Chairman, South-West, Toafeek Arapaja; and National Youth Leader, Sunday Ude-Okoye.",

          "title": "Ogoni Clean-up: 15 sites fully cleansed under Buhari\u2019s watch \u2013 APC legacy group -NigPilot",
          "text": "At least, fifteen sites have now been fully cleaned and restored as part of the ongoing remediation process of land degraded and polluted as a result of decades of oil exploration activities in Ogoni land\n\nThis is according to a statement issued Tuesday by a support group of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, under the auspices of APC Legacy Awareness and Campaign.\n\nBarr. Ismail Ahmed, Mr. Lanre Issa-Onilu, Mr. Tolu Ogunlesi, Mr. Salihu Moh. Lukman, the group extolled President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration \u2018s exploits in the Niger-Delta region, which, according to them, is unprecedented by previous administrations.\n\nProviding an update on the much talked about Ogoni clean-up APC-LAC noted that the procurement process for the clean-up commenced in 2018, while the actual remediation commenced in January 2019, with the handing over of the first batch of 21 sites to the selected contractors, for remediation.\n\n\u201cIt added that second batch of sites was handed over in February 2020, as fifteen sites have now been fully cleaned, while work continues on others.\u201d\n\nThe statement explained that in addition to the remediation, the Cleanup project is also rehabilitating old water schemes and constructing new ones across Ogoniland.\n\n\u201d One of the first tasks in the Clean-Up was a water quality assessment in all four local governments that make up Ogoniland. The Project will also make interventions in healthcare facilities and systems in the region. The Clean-Up has so far created hundreds of jobs for locals,\u201d the group said.\n\nThe statement further explained that until 2016, there was only one functioning Modular Refinery in the Niger Delta, with a capacity to refine 1,000 barrels of crude oil per day, but today, spurred by the Buhari Administration\u2019s New Vision for the Niger Delta, there are several Modular Refinery construction projects ongoing across the Niger Delta, all led by the private sector.\n\n\u201cThe original 1,000 BPD Refinery in Rivers State, which began operations in 2011, has under President Buhari\u2019s watch expanded into an 11,000 BPD facility. In November 2020 President Buhari commissioned the first phase of the Waltersmith Refinery in Imo State. The OPAC Refinery in Delta State has also been completed. The ones in Edo and Bayelsa States are under construction, while Waltersmith has flagged off the construction of its second phase.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest investments Nigeria has seen in a while is the Train 7 of the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) Limited, in Bonny, Rivers State. More than a decade after Train 6 was completed and launched, President Buhari has in 2021 flagged off the construction of Train 7. Until he became President, the project had stalled, the victim of a lack of political will from the previous administration. The Train 7 project will attract around $10 billion dollars of domestic and foreign investment, while creating several thousand jobs, and asserting Nigeria\u2019s place on the global map of gas-producing countries.\n\n\u201cSeveral other investments are ongoing across the Niger Delta, spurred by the relative peace and security being enjoyed, as well as the President\u2019s unwavering commitment to develop the region and help it make up for decades of neglect, pollution, and underinvestment. The Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) is developing, among other projects, a pioneering Oil and Gas Park in Bayelsa State, scheduled for completion at the end of 2022. The Park will be serviced by a 10MW power plant.\n\n\u201cThe Presidential Amnesty Programme, inherited from previous administrations, has continued to deliver on its mandate, with the full support of the President. The Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) is being reformed and repositioned, in line with the President\u2019s vision of ensuring that the people of the Niger Delta benefit maximally from the wealth of their land. The Administration has recently completed and commissioned the Commission\u2019s Headquarters, 25 years after construction began, and after several spells of abandonment by previous governments.\n\n\u201cA comprehensive forensic audit of the NDDC has just been completed; the first of such audit since the Commission was established. The President is determined to ensure a clean break from the mismanagement and corruption of the past.\n\n\u201cIn terms of physical infrastructure, the 338km East-West Road, running across four States of the region \u2014 Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers and Akwa Ibom \u2014 is now receiving priority attention, more than a decade after the contract was first awarded. The President is committed to completing the first four sections of the Road by 2022.\n\n\u201cThe 39km Bodo-Bonny Bridges and Road project is another landmark infrastructure project being delivered by the Buhari Administration, for the people of the Niger Delta. Comprising several bridges, as well as a road network, it will connect Bonny Island, Nigeria\u2019s gas hub, to Ogoniland on the Rivers Mainland, opening up several once-isolated communities for commerce, investment, and development. The project was first conceived in the late 1970s, but all the contracts awarded prior to the Buhari Administration were aborted. President Buhari has finally broken the jinx. Construction started on the project in 2017 and it is now set for completion in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe very first Water Supply project to be completed by the Buhari Administration, in 2016, was the Central Ogbia Water Supply Scheme, in Bayelsa State. The region\u2019s dream of a Maritime University has also come to fruition under President Buhari, with the licensing and operationalization of the Maritime University in Okerenkoko, Delta State, in 2018, and the allocation of a generous take-off grant by the President.\n\n\u201cAnother jinx broken is the inability to carry out a bid round for Marginal oil fields, since 2003. This year the Department of Petroleum Resources concluded the first bid round in 18 years, with an estimated value of around half a billion dollars in expected revenues for the government, in addition to billions of dollars that will be invested in the purchased assets and host communities.\n\n\u201cThe Presidential declaration of the year 2020 as the Year of Gas, followed by the declaration of 2021 to 2030 as the Decade of Gas, as well as the launch of the National Gas Expansion Programme in 2020, will attract new investment into the Niger Delta, which is Nigeria\u2019s gas-producing region, and create jobs and economic opportunities for the people,\u201d the statement reads in parts.",

It is important to contact NAPTIP when confronted with juicy offer of help that entails taking your children abroad.

She is therefore declared cured,\u201d Serge Eholie, ministry spokesman and head of the country\u2019s infectious diseases department told AFP.\n\n\u201cWe are lifting her isolation today (Tuesday).

Recent months have seen a string of attacks on Israeli-connected shipping, believed to have been carried out by Iran.\n\nEarlier this week, Bennett told his Cabinet that he would tell the American president \u201cthat now is the time to halt the Iranians, to stop this thing\u201d and not re-enter \u201ca nuclear deal that has already expired and is not relevant, even to those who thought it was once relevant.\u201d\n\nFriction between Israel and Gaza\u2019s Hamas rulers has been building in the three months since an 11-day war with Islamist militant group left least 265 dead in Gaza and 13 in Israel.\n\nIndirect negotiations between the two sides to reach an arrangement for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip have broken down in the past week.
