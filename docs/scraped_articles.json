          "title": "Politics now big business, avenue for quick money \u2013 Soludo",
          "text": "The governor-elect of Anambra State and former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Prof Charles Soludo, on Saturday expressed concern over the way people now see as a platform to make money rather than a call to selfless service.\n\nHe lamented that appointment or election into public office had produced rich men who never did any productive work, noting however that disruption to that trend would come at a great cost and could be a dangerous venture for anyone who dares to change the system.\n\nSpeaking in Abuja at the 2021 pioneer class graduation of the School of Politics, Policy and Governance, with the theme, \u2018Emergence of the unconventionals\u2019, Soludo also raised the alarm that drug barons have invaded the political terrain because of the global clampdown on criminal activities like internet fraud and illicit drug business.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs the noose tightened globally on other rentier/criminal enterprises such as drug trafficking or internet scam, many of the barons flocked into politics as the next easy alternative.\n\n\u201cPolitics has become big business. Appointment or election into public office is seen largely as an opportunity to \u2018eat\u2019 rather than a call to selfless service. There is an army of rich (big men) who have never worked or done any productive work in their life but believe that it is their right to expect something for nothing.\n\n\u201cYouth unemployment, insecurity, poverty and inflation threaten the social fabric, but disruptions will come at great costs and could indeed be dangerous. It is not far to imagine what could befall serious disruptors.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, we remember what happened to (late Head of State) Murtala Muhammed, and the history books are replete with hundreds of examples of the inherent risks.\u201d\n\nSoludo recalled that as the CBN governor, he and his family members received threats owing to the banking revolution he supervised.\n\nHe added, \u201cAt a personal level, undertaking the banking revolution in Nigeria came with 19 written threats to me and my family, including physical attacks. Disrupting the existing social order is dangerous. Beneficiaries of the current order are powerful enough to organise and viciously fight back to protect their privileges. On the contrary, the masses who are the ultimate beneficiaries are not organised enough to act as a bulwark against the special interests.\u201d\n\nSoludo pointed out that the country was currently \u201cstanding between the rock and the hard place\u201d because with the objective to retain power within the context of short electoral cycles, politicians were often afraid to undertake the necessary disruptive changes to guarantee long term safety and prosperity for all.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, the existing trends are totally unsustainable and the system is living on borrowed times,\u201d he added. \u201cEveryone is sleepwalking to the hard place, and praying that somehow a miracle will happen along the way. So, who is ready to put his head on the line to lead such productive but dangerous disruptions?\u201d\n\nSoludo noted that migrating to a post-oil world of fourth industrial revolution and sustainable prosperity would require massive disruptive transformation and restoration of a productive social contract.\n\nHe stressed that Nigeria does not lack educated and widely travelled human capital to drive her development, adding that across the world, Nigerians excel in their various fields.\n\nHe added, \u201cIn the United States, Nigeria ranks highest on education among ethnic minorities and as a percentage of its population, it has the most educated population of all ethnic groups. At home, we have over 100 universities churning out hundreds of graduates every year.\n\n\u201cOil and the easy money that came with it destroyed the social fabric and the elite created new institutions and political structures to maximise their gains.\u201d\n\nSoludo charged the graduands to display honesty always and use their knowledge to contribute to making a new Nigeria a possibility, adding that fixing politics requires talents, skills and citizens\u2019 cooperation.\n\nThe founder of SPPG and former Minister of Education, Mrs Obiageli Ezekwesili, said Nigeria would not have a high number of out-of-school children and maternal death if the nation had the right politics.\n\nShe argued that until Africa exits its kind of politics, there may not be any radical change in the fortunes of the continent in the next century.\n\nEzekwesili stated, \u201cThere is a cost to be made. The politics of Africa today does not respect cost to the individual. It only promotes benefits to the individual that is in the public space. That is an abnormality. Societies that develop did so on the principle that those in the public space are to provide leadership.\n\n\u201cIt is politics that has made the economy to be bad within the context of all the endowment that we have. Yet, we are the world capital of poverty. It is politics that has distorted all the possibilities of our society. You cannot play with the lowest degree of your citizens as political leaders in the public space and expect that something will just happen.\u201d\n\nShe charged the graduands to embrace leadership skills that would transform society.\n\nThe vice-chancellor of the school, Alero Ayida-Otobo, challenged the graduands to have an unquenchable thirst to raise standards while kicking injustice, religious intolerance, and lawlessness out of the country.\n\nMeanwhile, Soludo, who would be inaugurated on March 17, has commiserated with the victims of the fire incident at the Obodo Ukwu end of the Onitsha-Owerri Road in Onitsha.\n\nThe fire occurred early Friday following a petrol tanker explosion, which razed buildings and shops in the market around the scene.\n\nA statement on Saturday by his media aide, Mr Joe Anatune, said Soludo expressed deep concern over the magnitude of material losses suffered by the victims.\n\nHe lamented the incessant tanker explosions in the Onitsha axis and other cities around the country as he gave an assurance that a lasting solution to prevent a reoccurrence would be proffered.\n\nSoludo commended the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), and Governor Willie Obiano for their immediate reactions and condolences to the victims.\n\nHe commended the gallantry of the youths, fire service officials and other security personnel who came immediately to the scene to stem the tide of the fire.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "THE Police Service Commission has said it would not surrender to the Nigeria Police Force its constitutional mandate to recruit police constables which had been affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\n\nThe commission noted that the police authorities exploited a favourable judgment of the Federal High Court to take over the 2020 recruitment exercise but added that the order had been overturned in its favour, stressing that it would not abdicate its constitutional responsibility.\n\nThe PSC stated this in reaction to the protest and shutdown of its headquarters by workers protesting the takeover of the ongoing recruitment by the police.\n\nThe workers under the Joint Service Union had also embarked on a three-day strike to express their anger over the alleged moves by the commission to render them redundant following the takeover of the recruitment exercise.\n\nBut the PSC spokesman, Ikechukwu Ani, in a statement on Saturday, titled, \u2018Re: Workers protest police recruitment, shut down PSC,\u2019 explained that the issues raised by the workers, including delayed staff promotion and annual training, were being addressed by the management.\n\nWhile acknowledging the rights of the workers to embark on strike, it ,however, frowned on the locking of the offices.\n\nThe PSC stated, \u201cIt is necessary to state unequivocally that the recruitment of police officers from the rank of constables to Cadet Inspectors and Cadet ASPs is and remains the constitutional responsibility of the commission and this was also affirmed not long ago by a judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal.\n\n\u2018\u2019The management of the commission has no intention to abdicate this constitutional responsibility.

          "text": "* \u2018How Buhari\u2019s administration mistakes landed Nigeria in a mess\u2019\n\n* Says Ganduje did not visit him for reconciliation\n\n\u2022 \u2018But for unfinished business in Kano, I could have been President in 2007\u2019\n\nBy Levinus Nwabughiogu, ABUJA\n\nSenator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso is a grassroots politician. His support base across the country swarms with people of all faith and classes. He\u2019s bold and courageous. He has an enviable profile in politics and public service. First, he served in Kano State Civil Service for 17 years. Upon his departure, he joined partisan politics.\n\nIn 1992, he was elected into the House of Representatives where he became the Deputy Speaker. At the return of democracy in 1999, after a long military interregnum, he was elected the governor of Kano State. In 2003, he was appointed the Minister of Defense. In 2011, he was re-elected governor to serve a second term in Kano.\n\nAt the point of exiting office in 2015, Kwankwaso squared up with President Muhammadu Buhari for the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential ticket. He was later elected senator to represent Kano Central. Kwankwaso was, up till 2015, a member of the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party, PDP, when he left the party for APC.\n\nIn 2018, he returned to the PDP to contest the presidential ticket with former Vice President Abubakar Atiku among others. As the 2023 general elections inch close, he told Sunday Vanguard, in an exclusive interview, that he may run again. Kwankwaso also x-rayed the polity and the current government on many fronts and gave his thoughts, pointing out the many mistakes of the Buhari government. Excerpts:\n\nThe current Federal Government is six and a half years old. How do you x-ray its activities so far?\n\nAs you rightly pointed out, this government is now about six and a half years old. Somebody has also said that the President has 17 months to go. On the whole, I believe there are issues in all areas that are important to Nigerians, especially the issue of politics itself because that\u2019s key.\n\nOnce you get it wrong, many things are likely going to go that way. And I think the government and the party got it wrong right from the beginning in terms of inclusiveness, in terms of bringing everybody together as a nation, not virtually people of APC stock but everybody.\n\nIf you are elected, you are a President or Governor for everybody within that country or state whether somebody voted for, against you or even when somebody didn\u2019t vote at all; it is now your responsibility to convince him to vote for you next time.\n\nAnd even those who didn\u2019t vote for you, you have the opportunity to convince them so that in the next election, even if you are not the one contesting, it is your responsibility as a leader to ensure that people are happy and comfortable to the extent that they will change their minds from party A to come to you in party B or party C. And I think that was the first step that was missed by the government and the APC.\n\nI am sure you know that many of us were in PDP but, in 2015, we decided, for obvious reasons, to join the party and we provided the cutting edge for the government at that particular time to win election and I am sure you also remember that, immediately after the election, we found ourselves in the cold and, as politicians, we had to get away to maintain our relevance and ensure that the government and the party do the right thing.\n\nBecause of the issue of the party, that mistake, which is very fundamental in democracy, other things began to happen negatively, especially on the issues of the economy, security and many other sectors of the country. If you look at security, it is not just for the military or security agencies alone. It is for everybody. Everybody must have input for government to succeed.\n\nTherefore, if you exclude some people at the highest level, the implication is that those around you will hold you responsible and many people will be excluded from the government. And information is key, even in the best military or security agencies in the world. If you don\u2019t have high quality information or intelligence, no matter how big your gun or whatever equipment you are carrying is, you will hardly succeed.\n\nThat\u2019s why it is always good to carry everybody along. So that if the people are comfortable and happy, they will always give information they see around them and that is key to those whose responsibility it is to use the information. And to us, security is not just about the military or security agencies alone. It, of course, involves so many other things, especially the issue food security.\n\nIf the society is hungry, you shouldn\u2019t expect peace. People will do everything they can under the sun to make sure they have something to eat, including criminal activities. There also has to be education and security. Under any circumstance, your children must go to school and have employment opportunity, there has to be something to give them. If there is no job, it is a big problem.\n\nMany people, like many of us in politics who are roadside economists, if we go to Abuja, we go round and we don\u2019t see cranes working on construction sites, you begin to wonder what is happening. If you don\u2019t see other areas of economic activities, then we know something is wrong. So, there are other areas that every responsible government must look at to ensure security of lives and property.\n\nSo, like I said, some steps were missed and that\u2019s why we found ourselves generally in this mess because most people are finding it very difficult to eat. Maybe the leaders have heard it. Maybe they are not aware but that is the fact of the matter. So, there are challenges but there are issues one can argue.\n\nThe government was unlucky because, sometimes, in the life of a government or even an individual, you wake up someday and you find yourself in a very disadvantaged situation and it is not your making. Maybe you were even sleeping when it happened. You know, when we came to government in 2015, there were issues, especially the issue of oil price, then coronavirus.\n\nThey hit at the economy but I believe that even with those issues and more, government could have done much better. Government, in 2015, I am sure you remember, they couldn\u2019t put together the Federal Executive Council until after about six months. And six months is a very long time in the life of any government that has four-year-term.\n\nFour years, if you subtract six months, 48 months minus six months, that is 42 months left because there was no way under the democratic arrangement the President alone can function without FEC being constituted. So, there were issues really and that reminds me, in 2011, when I went back to Kano, I was sworn-in on a Sunday and, before the following\n\nSunday, I was able to inaugurate the state Assembly, select my Commissioners and took it to the state Assembly and they were able to screen and I had my first State Executive Council meeting within a week because time was not on anybody\u2019s side.\n\nIt is a contract of four years. From the time you were sworn-in, four years to another May 29, whether you like it or not, you have to get out and people will judge you by what you have done; whether positive or negative. So, once you get that opportunity, it is up to you to decide whether your name should be written in gold in terms of performance.\n\nWhen you talk about inclusiveness, the inkling I get is the 97% and 3% submission the President once made. Again, a section of the country, the South-East to be specific, feels completely marginalized. Is that what you mean?\n\nOne of the big problems of this government is the issue of communication. Government is not communicating well. The President or Governor must be able to communicate very well; even if you are doing the best thing in the world, if the people don\u2019t know, they don\u2019t know. People will judge you based on what they know.\n\nPart of the advice I gave to the President in the beginning was to sit down with the leaders of thought from the six geopolitical zones so that he could listen to them, hear them and so on. And a good government at the state or federal level should at least, every week, the leader must talk to the people.\n\nNot only talk to them, he must listen to them because it\u2019s two-way traffic. He must know their worries, strengths and weaknesses, concerns and it is your responsibility to ensure that those concerns are addressed.\n\nIn addition, government should come with an agenda and that agenda should be clear to the people even before election and, once you are elected, you start implementing that agenda to the letter to the extent that, when you are leaving office, people will be very angry.\n\nThey will start thinking of you. But if you don\u2019t come out to communicate with the people, even friends and supporters will start wondering what you are doing.\n\nDid the government take the advice you gave then?\n\nNo, I don\u2019t think so.\n\nDid you feel disappointed?\n\nNo, it is not an issue of disappointment or otherwise. It\u2019s an issue of their own result or performance. So, they still have one and a half years or 17 months as they put it. We look forward to seeing some changes especially on the issue of security.\n\nYou may think 17 months is a short period of time but to our brothers and sisters who are with bandits now, suffering in their hands, 17 months is a very long time. So, 17 months depends on where you are.\n\nIf you are in your comfort zone, 17 months is around the corner but for those who cannot eat, sick in hospital or cannot get a job, 17 months is a long time because, whatever course you read in the university or any other tertiary institution, more people will come out to add to the number of the unemployed on the streets. So, 17 months for me is a very long time.\n\n2023 is almost here and there are two big parties jostling for positions, PDP and APC. What prospects do they have? Do you see APC retaining power at the centre in 2023 or PDP taking over power from APC?\n\nYou see, so many people are very much worried about the two parties. Each one has got its own disadvantages and, of course, advantages. If you look at PDP, it was in power for 16 years until 2015.\n\nFor the mere fact that an opposition party came and defeated it at the polls is enough to show you that there were some mistakes, and I am not sure if those mistakes were corrected, especially in terms of mobilization of the people because, if you are in opposition, there are certain things you have to do in terms of mobilizing the people to support the party and, even more importantly, when it comes to the candidature of the people within the party. I think that is key.\n\nThe same thing is applicable to APC. Whatever we told the people in 2015 which was against the PDP, many people believe that it is even worse now in APC and, because of government and probably lack of people who have adequate experience in the game, you could see that there are so many mistakes that people are making in the party; PDP believes that even when they made mistakes during their 16 years tenure, APC is making worse mistakes and, therefore, many people in PDP believe that they could win election using any candidate and that is not so.\n\nYou see, we succeeded in 2015 in bringing in some changes because, at least, we had Buhari who had a movement, supporters, not necessarily for APC, just for himself. And some of us who had our own supporters at that particular time, we came together, formed a formidable force which was good enough to bring change.\n\nMany people don\u2019t understand and also many people are in a hurry, some people\u2019s politics hinge solely on getting tickets. They work so hard over time to get ticket and once that ticket is in their hands, they deposit it in the party headquarters in Abuja for the party to bring its members to vote for them. I think that era has gone now. It is history.\n\nPeople are so worried about that attachment that we used to have in PDP or ANPP at that time. It\u2019s to a very large extent not there now. What is likely going to happen in 2023 elections is simply that people will choose a candidate in PDP or APC or any other party for that matter.\n\nPeople will be more concerned about the candidate than just APC or PDP or APGA or any other party. That is the scenario that we are anticipating in 2023.\n\nWhere do you see power going exactly? South easterners are clamoring for it. Northerners are saying no. South westerners and middle belters too are coming up. So, where do you see power going after it has resided in the North for eight years under the present administration?\n\nThere are so many arguments around. For those who are talking about South, they make the same arguments you are making that Buhari has spent eight years. So, it is only fair, according to them, to take the presidency to the South.\n\nFor those who are arguing for this side of the country in the North, they will add 16 to eight, that is, 24. Out of the 24, it is only eight years plus two by Yar \u2018Adua, that is, 10. So, it depends on who you listen to. But my worry is that so many people, especially my colleague politicians, you can see so many of them are so much in a hurry to the extent that they have nothing to show other than sentiment.\n\nI am in politics, I contested 16 times and won 13 times and I lost three times. There are chances that, by the grace of God, I will contest again though I have not made up my mind on that because we are in the process of consultation.\n\nSo you see, you get people who had worked let\u2019s say in the organized private sector. They were managing directors. They were chairmen, very important people. They want to join politics.\n\nThey want to go either parallel or go up from that position, forgetting that they are now in a very brand new world and not the sort of the corporate world they used to know. We have retired military, retired civil servants and so on, who would want to retire from 3 stars, 4 stars, whatever stars and be 4 stars in politics.\n\nYou have people who were in business, counting billions or even trillions. They want from that point to either go parallel or go up. Some were lucky but luck doesn\u2019t come all the time. Now those of us who have taken time\u2026for example in 1992, I was Deputy Speaker of the House of Reps, now, it is exactly 30 years in the field, working on Sundays, Fridays, Tuesdays, everyday, Christmas, Sallah, New Year day and, I am sure you must have seen hundreds of people who are just coming, some will come for condolences but, of course, after condolences, the next thing they will ask is \u201chow\u2019s the country?\u201d It\u2019s politics.\n\nAnd we are not in a hurry. If I contested twice in 2015 and 2019 to be President, I wasn\u2019t presenting myself because I was from the North-West or from northern Nigeria, no. I was presenting myself based on the fact that I believed I was the best material to win primary election or presidential election itself and the best person to do the job because there are two things, winning, you can get tickets, and tickets are just everywhere, we have so many parties.\n\nIn 2019, we had close to 100 parties, so, ticket wasn\u2019t an issue. What was the issue was who could win the general elections? So, sometimes when I hear the issue of zoning, religion and some are even talking about all sorts of things that one shouldn\u2019t rely really on them\u2026 If I am presenting myself for the position of President, I am not presenting myself because I am a Christian or a Muslim or because I am from the North-West or North-Central but because we have done so much, we have proved all the points.\n\nYou see, in 2007, my colleagues who were governors with me in 1999 were busy wanting to be President, At that time, based on the realities on the ground, I felt that I was more relevant in terms of becoming the President and Commander-in-Chief because I was Deputy Speaker of the House of Reps.\n\nI was an elected delegate to the Constitutional Conference 1994, 1995. I was governor for four years and Minister of Defense; so, there was no better experience to handle the job among my colleagues at that particular time. But I was not in a hurry. I thought I had an unfinished job in Kano. I wanted to go and finish it.\n\nI went back to Kano, contested and won election, proved the point in terms of removing a sitting government, proved the point in terms of performance and it was only in 2015 when there was no more job really to be done at the state level that I decided to come up. Not because I didn\u2019t have the educational qualification or any other issue.\n\nBut I felt that I had to wait because we have seen people who are opportune to go for position A, B, C or D but they never had time really to consolidate any position and, at the end of the day, they crashed. So, I have seen people, my colleagues who are in politics, who are too much in a hurry, not only too much in a hurry but they are using things they shouldn\u2019t use.\n\nPeople should work hard. Any time I open the social media, I laugh and I thank my God that everybody now wanting to be President will put Kwankwaso as his running mate. I am not the only one from North-West. I am not the only northerner.\n\nI never told anybody I want to be his Vice President in this country. But you see, they have gone round, some are doing it scientifically. They will go to America and get people who will go and do polls and find out who is on the ground. They have done that.\n\nMany people will go and talk to Babalawo and ask him who is on the ground. You cannot be on the ground overnight. You have to work hard to prove your point. And while I thank God for what I am seeing in the social media, I also thank the Almighty God for sparing my life and keeping me intact with my integrity.\n\nOver these 30 years, in fact even before 30 years, I was 17 years in the civil service in Kano, there was nothing people did not do to dent my image, they tried everything under the sun but God protected us.\n\nBut it is a lesson to me and a lesson to everybody that if you are in power, don\u2019t be a mad man. Do the right thing. Whatever your assignment, whatever you are giving or taking, make sure it is not against the laws of the land.\n\nYou have been around for a while now: Deputy Speaker, Minister of Defense, two-term governor, senator and presidential aspirant. Late last year, Mr President declined assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill because of direct primary. Does that bother you or you are one of those who would say it is inconsequential?\n\nThere are two issues there. First is the issue of direct election, meaning everybody who is a member of a party is free to go and vote for a candidate of his or her choice. The other one is indirect which refers to delegates. Out of the 16 elections I had, some were direct, some, indirect.\n\nThe last one I had direct was in 1999. We were elected as flag bearers of PDP as governors in 1999 using direct primary and many other elections were indirect. Now, from my personal experience, those systems have got their pluses and negatives and the negative of the direct election is simply that it is very cumbersome.\n\nWhen we had our own, it was the military in power, at least, they were neutral because they didn\u2019t belong to any of the parties but still it was cumbersome. Now, on the other hand, this one is prone to manipulation by people, by leaders, I mean indirect primary and money plays a very significant role in deciding who becomes what in any party; especially now with the level of poverty only God knows who will go and vote under his own conscience.\n\nMany people will be happy to take dollar. I am not sure if people are seeing dollar now. Dollar is very difficult to see and many people when they see it they start shivering.\n\nBut if I were to advise Mr President, honestly, I would have told him to sign it because, for whatever reasons, vast majority of Nigerians want to see direct elections in this country because it is like people are sick and tired of manipulations by a few people and I think he would have been hailed really if he had signed the bill.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t sign it. We look forward to what the National Assembly will do. Others, on the other hand, are saying they will overrule him, go and get two thirds of the National Assembly, while some of the leaders are saying Buhari isn\u2019t wrong.\n\nSo, we will all wait and see if they can do it. But whatever the case, we hope that the 2023 elections, both primary and secondary elections.\n\nThere was no love lost between you and your successor in Kano. The issue is public knowledge. It is everywhere. But, recently, something very remarkable happened. The governor, in his New Year message, came up to say that 2022 will be a year of reconciliation and everybody thought he was talking about reconciling with you. Are you excited about that? What really transpired between you two? Do you feel betrayed by your former deputy and successor?\n\nIn politics, you have to do whatever you can to do the right thing at every given time and anything to the contrary will either show immediately or in due time or course. For me, I am in politics to ensure that the right people are in government.\n\nI am in politics to ensure that people in government are doing the right thing. Now, as you have rightly said, Ganduje was my deputy 1999 to 2003. He was my SA in the Ministry of Defense and when we left office in 2007, Yar \u2018Adua came and we worked out something for him in Chad Republic as the Executive Secretary of Chad Basin.\n\nHe was there in 2010 when I got ticket and I asked him to resign and come back. When he came back, he was my deputy again and, in 2015, when I was going, I believed he was the most senior and I had wanted to have an inclusive group or party in Kano and even elsewhere.\n\nSo, at the end of the day, we decided to support him and he became governor and, from there, all what happened in terms of our fight and so on happened and if he decides now to come back, even though he just came for condolence, he didn\u2019t come to say he was coming for reconciliation, he came for condolence.\n\nI wished he had come on other issues that happened before then, now it is time for us to wait and see how it goes.\n\nSpecifically speaking, are you contesting for President in 2023 elections?\n\nYes, 2023 is around the corner, we are already in 2022 and this is the time to consult, contact our friends. People have to be realistic and, unless you are realistic, you find it very difficult to go far in this game of politics.\n\nYou have to contact the right caliber of people, you have to think very well on what you are venturing into and we have a group known as Kwankwasiya and in Kwankwasiya, we would love to see or to listen to them, to tell us about what is happening in their state, in their local government and, together, we will sit down and take decision on either to contest or to support any of our members, anybody for that matter.\n\nSo, maybe in the next couple of months or so, I should be in the position to answer this question very clearly.\n\nAny more words for Nigerians?\n\nI am not sure if there is anything other than to thank them for their resilience, for their patience, for their understanding. We want them to do whatever they can to ensure peace in this country.\n\nThose of us who are politicians, we cannot contest elections unless you have a country or constituency and whatever you want to do, not only politicians, in whatever you are doing, you need peace and that is why we always advocate peace across the country. And it is an opportunity to appeal to the government to do more in terms of security and the economy.\n\nThis security that we have now, under normal circumstance, is not acceptable. A situation where Nigerians are being picked from villages, roads and markets should not be acceptable even by the government itself because we all know that is the primary duty of any responsible government.\n\nSo, the government must do something. And many of us are surprised and we are shocked on why we are where we are today, why the military and other security agencies cannot protect Nigerians.\n\nWe are not happy with the situation because my experience with the military is that I personally have this conviction that they are among the best on this continent and that has been tested and that has been proven; the question is what went wrong?\n\nWe have bandits, we have criminals along major roads, bandits who will come and attack today, tomorrow, next tomorrow, they come out again and they kill people, they maim people, they take them to the bush and still nothing is done, they are still there. And in these towns, villages and even cities, these people are known; it is not like they came from Jupiter or somewhere.\n\nThey are citizens of those areas. Most of them have not even gone to school in their lives. It is very pathetic and unfortunate that we have this military that we know as the best, committed, professionals, gentlemen, allowing Nigerians to be treated this way and I think the military itself especially the leadership has to device ways and means, not even because of the President or anybody even because of the institution.\n\nI don\u2019t want the military, I believe for many obvious reasons, in fact, I call myself a member of the extended family that are being reduced to what we are seeing now and we still want to know why is this happening at this time.\n\nWhen I was there in the military, I never thought that in my life time, the military will come to this point and I think this must be reversed and we hope everybody in this country should support the military, should do whatever they can to support them because they are our last resort.\n\nWithout them, we will all run away, we cannot stay. We are staying because they are there, because they are committed to protecting us, otherwise everybody will look his own way and run away if you don\u2019t have military.\n\nVanguard News",

          "title": "Erosion is swallowing my people in S/East \u2014 Onuigbo",
          "text": "Sam Onuigbo\n\nBy Levinus Nwabughiogu, ABUJA\n\nSam Onuigbo represents Ikwuano/Umuahia North/Umuahia South federal constituency of Abia State in the House of Representatives. He\u2019s the President of Global Legislators\u2019 Organization for Balanced Environment, GLOBE, Nigeria, an international association for national parliamentarians with over 100 countries as members. He\u2019s also Vice President of African Africa for GLOBE international, in Africa. In this interview, he shared what motivated him to sponsor climate change bill, now an act with its benefits to Nigeria.\n\nWhat motivated you to sponsor the Climate Change Bill that was recently signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari?\n\nThis bill has now become an Act. It\u2019s the climate change bill. You are asking about the motivation and what inspired me? First, I want to start from the angle that I come from a community that is heavily ravaged by gully erosion.\n\nIn my village as I speak, I have six active erosion sites such that I have to go outside of the village in search of a place to build a house because the erosion is coming ferociously on to the community. That is a life experience.\n\nI was born and raised in the village. I attended primary school in the village. I was still in the village when I attended post primary. The rate at which gully erosion is ravaging my community wasn\u2019t the rate I experienced when I was growing up, so something is fundamentally wrong. The soil is softer now. A little thing now leads to erosion. That is one.\n\nTwo, as farmer, I have also found out that the raining season has changed. The pattern has changed in a way that is affecting local farmers, affecting when they plant.\n\nREAD ALSO: Curbing erosion catastrophe in South East of Nigeria\n\nSometimes, maybe, you have the first rain after clearing the bush and then you go and plant thinking it will rain the way it used to rain, because you have the first rain, the second rain and then it continues like that until sometime in July when it is heavy but it is no more like that; some people suffer losses.\n\nRecently not just in the north, also in the east and some other places, the weather pattern has significantly changed leading to losses for farmers. That is something that has to do with somebody\u2019s means of livelihood and it is life threatening. So, that is when we say climate change is an existential threat.\n\nSo, it is something that has to do with the life of people and how it changes it. So, apart from the south, I have travelled round this country. I have been to all the states. In my years of working for foreign organizations, I can tell you I have been to all the local governments.\n\nSo, I have an idea of things and how things have really changed for the worse in terms of weather, in terms of what that has led to because climate change has also contributed significantly to the threat, security and other challenges that we are having including banditry.\n\nIt has its impact in this thing. So, when you put them together, you now find out that there is need to sponsor such a bill. I have not even mentioned that one coming from the health angle, because if you check the WHO report, I will confirm that but between 7 to 8 million people die annually from the impact of climate change; respiratory and other health related diseases.\n\nFor us in Nigeria, you saw or must have read what is going on in Port Harcourt if you are looking for example to touch. How it\u2019s affecting the young people and all that. When you have a serious challenge with respiratory challenge, for those pregnant women and all that, the reports that some of us have read, indicates that it affects even the child.\n\nIt affects the brain and affects development. So, the challenge is huge and what is causing is so much, health wise and that is why it is important that we all get together and solve this.\n\nFrom the angle of being a legislator, one of the reasons why I pushed so hard to ensure that this bill was put together and passed was that when I attended the Global Legislators\u2019 Organization for Balance Environment (GLOBE) event during COP21 in Paris when Paris agreement on climate change was passed, we were encouraged by our leaders to push for a legislation because that is the only way for a government to come up will actions, points based on law to be able to check the devastating effects of climate change. So, these factors put together influenced me in pushing for this bill with the persistence that we did.\n\nWe have seen bills go through the gamut of law making processes and eventually not signed into law or not passed or not supported by colleagues and institutions of government. But yours scaled through and the President gave his assent. Did you encounter challenges or in the course of the sponsoring it or was a smooth sailing?\n\nIt sure did encounter challenges, no questions about that. Do not forget that this bill, the idea was mooted, I understand in the 5th assembly but it was actually considered into becoming a law in the 6th assembly. But it failed. Then it was still forwarded in the 7th assembly.\n\nIt failed, denied presidential assent and then in the 8th assembly when I was elected and appointed to chair the House Committee on Climate Change, given the background about what I had earlier painted about where I come from, the challenges that are there, apart from my village, I didn\u2019t mention that, within my federal constituency, you have not less than 42 active erosion sites, that people are busy looking for ways of trying to solve it.\n\nNow, having seen all these things, having experienced it, I pushed for this bill in the 8th assembly. I also tried by ensuring that the agencies were involved. We wrote to so many of them.\n\nA lot of them brought in their opinions and ideas to be incorporated into the bill and all that and we had some awareness. We had public hearings on the bill until it passed by the national assembly and was successfully transmitted to the presidency for the assent of Mr President but unfortunately the assent was declined.\n\nSo, when I was reelected and to the glory of God I am the very first person to be reelected in my federal constituency, Ikwuano, Umuahia North/ South, I was not given the committee chairmanship but by the special grace of God, I persisted on working on the bill and then, I followed it and this time around.\n\nI had to broaden my level of consultation because it is said that once beaten twice shy. Because Mr President had raised a number of issues that are the reasons why he did not give assent, I had to broaden consultations to ensure that those contentious areas were adequately addressed and or were necessarily eliminated. So, that was what I did.\n\nAnd then, I had to engage the ministry of environment, the ministry of justice and other agencies that are similarly involved. And at this point, I must commend the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila for really supporting me because after making those consultations, I will come back and brief him.\n\nEven in situations where they asked me to write a letter. After writing the letter, Mr Speaker will write to say I am in support of this. So such a thing gave me tremendous encouragement. Let me also thank the minister of justice and attorney general, Abubakar Malami, SAN because it was after meeting with him and the minister of state for environment, Chief Sharon Ikeazu, I explained what was involved and the need to have this climate change bill passed into law.\n\nThey agreed with me and said do a letter. I requested for people from his ministry to help in working on the bill on terms of drafting to eliminate anything that you could see as irrelevant. So, he said do a letter and I did a letter and he promptly responded and nominated a team of five, very powerful team to work with me on the bill.\n\nAnd Mr Speaker also did a letter to say look, a letter from all of us, for Onuigbo, is supported by me. And Mr Speaker also granted us audience when I came to the minister of state for environment to brief the speaker on what we were doing and he assured that he was going to work with us and ensure that this bill was passed into law.\n\nSo, you can see the extent of consultation. We also met with the vice president to get his support. You can see the extent of consultations to make sure everyone was on board. I guess that if you would permit, because of the success of the handling of the consultation and the extensive nature of the consultation that by the special grace of God helped to bring everyone on board and then we were able to get it going.\n\nWhenever the Speaker wasn\u2019t there and any issue relating to this climate change arose, the deputy Speaker, Rt. Hon. Idris Wase took it up. My colleagues, the honourable members were very supportive because it is like everyone has risen to the fact that climate change is threatening all of us and it is not something that should be glossed over.\n\nThe senate was swift in allowing the thing to go through first reading before we started looking for concurrence. We couldn\u2019t get the concurrence before we went on recess. But as soon as we came back from recess, the Senate President, the deputy senate president were all on it and even the leader of the senate made a very powerful speech on the day it was given concurrence.\n\nSo, that was how it happened. Now the national assembly bureaucracy, the transmission was unparalleled. It was transmitted swiftly to the presidency and the president did his due diligence.\n\nSo I would like to use this opportunity to specially thank the President Mohammadu Buhari GCFR. He made this promise on the 29th of May 2015 that he was going to tackle climate change and I regard his granting assent to this bill as fulfilling that promise which he made. So, I want to thank him and thank him immensely for this wonderful thing he has given to Nigeria and the world.\n\nCan you highlight or give some of the benefits Nigeria stands to gain from this Act?\n\nThe nation now has a legal framework on issues of climate and how to tackle climate change. None existed before now. Then this thing has a Council and the purpose of this bill is to mainstream climate change actions into national development and also to establish the national council on climate change which the main organ that will drive the changes that we are looking forward to achieve.\n\nSo, you can now see that this bill in summary seeks to provide a framework in achieving low green house gas emission inclusive green growth and sustainable economic development and way to achieve that is by ensuring that as a nation, we can formulate programmes and policies for achieving a long term goal of climate change mitigation and adaptation.\n\nIn this case now, it is no longer a policy, it is a law that is clearly spelt out, generational. And of course, another benefit is that it will facilitate the coordination, all the actions that are going to be needed to achieve the long term climate objectives.\n\nSo, the actions can be properly coordinated because they are on different fora. It is not as if we do not have policies. Several policies have actually been put forward and several policies are out there but what is the level of coordination, where is the power of coordination? And that is why you have the Council to be chaired by Mr President.\n\nThis bill, when talking about the benefits has areas like climate finance. You heard the minister of state for environment talk about how the Nigerian exchange can work with the ministry of environment on this legal framework on issues of climate change fund. This act also established the climate change fund.\n\nThese are some of the areas that people can benefit and then it is going to ensure that there is a director of climate change in almost every ministry. We never had that before. The reason is that right now as we speak, transferring people to climate change desk is like punishment of sending them to Siberia.\n\nBut in the bill, we have provided that there shall be a department on climate change to be included or to be overseen or superintended by someone not less than rank of a director.\n\nAnd this act also makes provision for carbon budget on national climate change action plan and this one involves the ministry of environment with the ministry of national planning to set carbon budget for Nigeria to ensure that we keep average increases in global temperature within 2 degrees Celsius and of course join the rest of the world in pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degree Celsius above the industrial levels.\n\nSo, these things you can see have been clearly set out.\n\nThe bill has also attracted several awards conferred on you.\n\nThe United Nations is appreciative and when the media which is usually critical of such issues, examining, criticizing and making us to do better say we give you an award for doing something, you can imagine what that is.\n\nThe House of Reps Press Corps gave me an award, the most dedicated law maker of the year award.\n\nAnd coming from people who a part of their functions is to criticize you to make you work better, I want to thank God because it is an award earned and not an award purchased.\n\nVanguard News",
          "summary": "In this interview, he shared what motivated him to sponsor climate change bill, now an act with its benefits to Nigeria.\nWhat motivated you to sponsor the Climate Change Bill that was recently signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari?\nIt\u2019s the climate change bill.\nThe nation now has a legal framework on issues of climate and how to tackle climate change.\nThe reason is that right now as we speak, transferring people to climate change desk is like punishment of sending them to Siberia.",

          "text": "Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State is not swayed by arguments in favour of presidential power shift to the South next year as he insists that the North must produce President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s successor.\n\nAnother Northerner, according to him, should be in the saddle in 2023 \u201cas Nigeria\u2019s presidency is not for any section of the country but for everyone.\u201d\n\nBut the President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Prof George Obiozor, says Nigeria stands the risk of inviting a fresh round of national crisis should zoning be discarded ahead of the presidential election.\n\nObiozor, a former Nigerian Ambassador to the United States, told The Nation that it would be morally unacceptable for any geo-political zone other that the Southeast to seek the presidency in 2023.\n\nMohammed, who is interested in the presidency himself, spoke in Bauchi on Friday evening while receiving a situation report from the Contact and Consultation Committee he set up for his presidential ambition.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHe claimed that the agitation for power shift to the South applies only to Buhari\u2019s party \u2013All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to let all Nigerians, especially those clamouring for the 2023 presidency to go to the South, that it is the turn of the North to produce the next president.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the agitations of the southern part of the country because the leader of the country today, President Muhammadu Buhari, who is from the North, will finish his tenure in 2023, so power should rotate to the South.\n\n\u201cBut I want to say that I am in PDP, I am not in APC. It is the APC that has this burden of zoning the presidency to the South.\n\n\u201cIn my party, the last President, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, was from the South and he was my President.\n\n\u201cDuring this period, my party was at the centre for 16 years; 14 of those years were led by people from the South, so where is the justice and the justification?\n\n\u201cTherefore, it is the turn of the North to produce the next President.\u201d\n\nSays Atiku qualifies to be president but age no longer on his side\n\nMohammed also spoke on the presidential aspiration of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, saying that while the Adamawa born politician has all it takes to rule Nigeria, age is not on his side.\n\nHe said: \u201dThere was a time we invited our elder statesman to Bauchi; the one we respect so much in the whole of Nigeria, and in the Northeast; the Waziri of Adamawa.\n\n\u201cWe interacted and I told him I know he is the most senior among us and he is very qualified. But because of his age and fatigue, having suffered so much for Nigeria, he should allow his younger brother.\n\n\u201cThough I\u2019m not desperate about it, he should know Nigerians like me too. I\u2019m ready to put my weight behind him though if he later emerges the party flag bearer.\u201d\n\nMohammed said he needed more time for wider consultations with critical stakeholders in the PDP and other stakeholders across the country on his ambition.\n\nSpeaking earlier, the Chairman of the Contact Committee, Senator Adamu Ibrahim Gumba, advised Mohammed to discuss with Atiku so that one of them could step down for the other since they are both from the Northeast.\n\nHe claimed that PDP members backed the idea that the next President of Nigeria should come from the North, adding that the Northeast and Northcentral are the most qualified regions of the country because they have not produced an elected President in the history of the country.\n\nNigeria playing with fire if zoning is discarded \u2014 Ohanaeze\n\nBut speaking to The Nation, the President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Prof George Obiozor, declared that anyone ignoring zoning of the presidential ticket \u201cis playing with fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact you are inviting disaster for Nigeria. You are not a friend of this country and a friend of this current administration because there\u2019s no surest way for any government to be declared failed in Nigeria than to tamper with this sensitive, precarious balance between North and South which is indeed the inheritance bequeathed by our founding fathers which is part of national expectation in politics,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere is no way you can change the rules of the game in the middle of the game. Nobody should try it. I hope those of us who are 80 or nearing 80 across the country should tell the young men not to play with fire and not to play with the destiny of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThere are certain sensitive institutions you don\u2019t touch. They are sanctum sanctorum of a nation. In fact, it is indeed political sacrilege for anybody to boldly tell Nigerians that you are doing away with rotation of North and South for political convenience because of the same reason which led to tragedy before.\n\n\u201cAre we children? Power ought to be shared in Nigeria between North and South, and rotation is part of power sharing. Let the parties do what they want, but the correct thing was done by the parties in 1999.\n\n\u201cThe worst thing you can do in a federation is to marginalise any section of your country. You don\u2019t make them good citizens by marginalising them. You don\u2019t make them good citizens by not giving them a sense of belonging. You don\u2019t make them good citizens by denying them of their rights.\n\n\u201cSo, the politicians have to be sensitive because Nigeria became a country that was negotiated. A nation with history is negotiated.\n\n\u201cUnless the politicians are suffering from amnesia or forgetfulness, then they can continue to deceive themselves that somebody can ignore a particular section of Nigeria and govern it peacefully. You cannot ignore any particular section of Nigeria and govern peacefully.\u201d\n\nObiozor argued that the Southeast has enough capable people to govern Nigeria even better than those who have ruled before.\n\nHis words: \u201cWhich part of Nigeria has more sophisticated and more trained people than the Southeast? Is it in number of university graduates? Is it in number of superstars in any field of life you can find in Southeast?\n\n\u201cSomebody said competence is the name of the Southeast, and the world knows it. If you refuse to use the Igbo competence here, it is your loss.\n\n\u201cLook at the international community. Mention any organization, including the international police contingent, an Igbo is a star there.\n\n\u201cThe point I am trying to make is that from the beginning, there has never been a lack of talent or leadership in Igboland. We have qualified people, more qualified than almost all others who have ruled before.\u201d",

          "text": "Some forces, including two APC governors, are said to be rooting for Bwari for the office of national chairman while some members of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) are backing Adamu.\n\nThere was however fresh anger in the party over an alleged secret push for a former Chief Whip of the House of Representatives, Hon. Bawa Bwari and the Chairman of the APC National Reconciliation Committee, ex-Governor Abdullahi Adamu for the slot.\n\nMembers of the President\u2019s kitchen cabinet, popularly called The Cabal, were said to be considering the right aspirant to recommend to Buhari.\n\nThere were indications that the governors favour the Northcentral for the ticket.\n\nParty sources however hinted that the incoming national chairman may emerge through a consensus being worked out by governors elected on the platform of the party.\n\nThat was 24 hours after Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State said the party expected the president to guide the party in formulating its zoning arrangement of which the national chairmanship is crucial.\n\nThere had been no word from Buhari at press time on his choice for the exalted position, thus leaving the governors, party leaders and aspirants guessing.\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) hierarchy, including governors elected on the platform of the party, remained in the dark last night over who would receive the blessings of President Muhammadu Buhari among those clamouring to be the party\u2019s next national chairman.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the former governor of Nasarawa State would bow to pressure.\n\nIt was however learnt that the state chapter of APC may not back him.\n\nIf Adamu and Bwari, a strong ally of ex-President Ibrahim Babangida, join the chairmanship race, the list of aspirants will swell to 13.\n\nThe others are ex-Governor Abdulaziz Yari; Mallam Saliu Mustapha (Turaki Ilorin); ex-Governor Umar Tanko Al-Makura; Senator Sani Mohammed Musa; and ex-Governor Ali Modu-Sheriff.\n\nAlso in the race are Sunny Sylvester Monidafe; Mohammed Estu; ex-Governor George Akume; ex- Governor Danjuma Goje; ex-Governor Isa Yuguda and Alhaji Sani Abdullahi Shinkafi.\n\nA top source, who spoke in confidence, said: \u201cAPC is on the edge on the choice of a new chairman for the party.\n\n\u201cThe intrigues have left our leaders divided and the situation is becoming complicated because of the forthcoming primaries for the 2023 polls.\n\n\u201cAll our leaders, especially the governors, are positioning themselves to control the party structure or secure a vantage position in the new National Working Committee (NWC).\n\n\u201cSome hawks are desperate to alienate members of the legacy parties who formed APC.\n\n\u201cAs it is now, the party is fragile and any slip on the new chairman may leave members divided for 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cAlready, there are speculations that some party leaders are secretly romancing with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as part of Plan B in case APC becomes fractious.\n\n\u201cThis is why most governors are agitating for a consensus candidate to save the already charged situation.\u201d\n\nA governor who confided in The Nation said: \u201cTo keep our party united, only a consensus candidate should emerge as our next national chairman.\n\n\u201cWe have been consulting on this alternative.\n\n\u201cWe need to close ranks beyond the cosmetic shuttles of Abdullahi Adamu\u2019s committee which cannot achieve much.\n\n\u201cMost governors believe in consensus, but we are looking in the direction of the President for guidance.\n\n\u201cHe has not opened up to the governors and our leaders on where APC is headed.\u201d\n\nBut another party stalwart said of the consensus option: \u201cIt\u2019s not true. Things are still in a state of fluidity.\n\n\u201cAs taciturn as ever, the President is yet to make any pronouncement.\u201d\n\nThe top source confirmed that \u201cthe only weighty voice in The Cabal has been trying to recommend two aspirants from the Northcentral.\n\n\u201cBuhari is exiting power but he has a mindset on the type of APC he wants. So, he is still central to the outcome of the National Convention.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, there were indications that some forces, including two governors, have been pushing for a former Chief Whip of the House of Representatives, Hon. Bawa Bwari, to lead the APC.\n\nA few other leaders, including CECPC members, are seeking the APC chairmanship slot for the Chairman of the APC National Reconciliation Committee, ex-Governor Abdullahi Adamu.\n\nA party source said: \u201cThe emergence of Bawa and Adamu in the calculations for APC chairmanship race is part of the complexity we are talking about.\n\n\u201cWe know Bawa is an ally of ex-President Ibrahim Babangida and a PDP politician in spirit.\n\n\u201cDo they want the nPDP component of APC to lead the party to the detriment of the defunct CPC axis?\n\n\u201cIs that our best bargain?\n\n\u201cApart from age factor, how can Adamu, who is reconciling aggrieved members, now be the chairman of APC? Do they want him to approbate and reprobate at the same time?\n\n\u201cIn the case of Adamu, it may lead to a fresh crisis of confidence between him and ex-Governor Umar Tanko Al-Makura, who may see it as backstabbing, and there will be division in Nasarawa State chapter of APC.\n\n\u201cThere is anger in the party over the alleged aspiration of Adamu. Many are also uncomfortable with Bawa.\u201d\n\nAt a meeting of Nasarawa APC stakeholders during the week to support Al-Makura, Governor Abdullahi Sule said: \u201cYou can use what you have. In this state, it is only Umaru Tanko Al-Makura that has indicated interest in the race for the national championship of our great party, the APC.\u201d\n\nNortheast aspirants in jeopardy as governors favour Northcentral\n\nThe ambition of two APC governors to run as vice presidential candidate of the party is also believed to be jeopadising the interest of three national chairmanship aspirants from the Northeast.\n\nInvestigation revealed that two APC governors and a former governor from the Northeast are keen to be picked as presidential running mate while three aspirants from the region are jostling for the national chairmanship position.\n\nThe Nation gathered Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, Governor Baba Gana Zulum of Borno State and his immediate past predecessor, Senator Kashim Shettima, are being touted as possible vice presidential candidates.\n\nThose jostling for the leadership of the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC) from the region include former governor of Borno State, Senator Ali Modu-Sheriff, Chief Sunny Sylvester Moniedafe and former Minister of Aviation, Mallam Isa Yuguda.\n\nZulum, according to sources, was originally supporting his political \u201cgodfather\u201d , Senator Shettima, for vice president, but the situation may have now changed as he himself seems to be interested in the position.\n\nA source said some highly influential stakeholders from the Northeast in concert with the governors may have ceded the national chairmanship to the Northcentral in expectation that the vice president ticket would come to the zone (Northeast).\n\nBut Mallam Mamman Mohammed, spokesperson to Governor Mai Mala Buni, denied the rumour. According to him, his principal has no such ambition.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is a clear rumour. My principal has not discussed vice presidential aspiration with anybody. As far as he is concerned, he is on a mission to conduct a successful national convention that will give the party victory in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe have heard this rumour for quite a long time. But like I said, he hasn\u2019t discussed such ambition with anybody. It is a rumour and remains a rumour.\u201d\n\nSenator Modu-Sheriff had recently alleged a plot by some people from his home state to scuttle his chairmanship aspiration.\n\nThe former two-term governor of Borno State penultimate weekend told newsmen in Abuja that those pushing the narrative that the position of national chairman had been zoned to the Northcentral were afraid of his political stature, hence their plot to shut him out of the national convention.\n\n\u201cSome people are afraid because they know that I am competent to do what I am aspiring to do,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother aspirant for the chairmanship position, Chief Moniedafe, said he was unperturbed by the interest of anyone from his zone aspiring to be vice president.\n\nHe said he could not stop anyone from actualising their dream, but for him, his national chairmanship aspiration is meant to ensure \u201ca stronger and united APC for a better Nigeria\u201d.",

          "text": "By Chukwudi Nweje, Lagos and Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nPan Yoruba socio- political organisation, Afenifere, pan Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohaneze Ndigbo Worldwide, Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Yoruba Council of Elders and the Pan Niger Delta Forum, (PANDEF) have lashed out at Yobe State governor, Mai Bala Buni over a statement credited to him that the All Progressives Congress (APC), had yet to zone its political offices for 2023.\n\nBuni, who is Chairman APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) was quoted in a statement signed by his Director General, Press and Media Affairs, Mamman Mohammed in Damaturu, on Wednesday, as saying that reports that the presidential slot was zoned to the South were \u201cfalse, baseless and unfounded.\u201d\n\nThe APC was reported to also pooh-poohed the list on the zoning of party offices in circulation ahead of its national convention, and described it as fake news.\n\nHowever, Afenifere, Ohaneze Ndigbo Worldwide, YCE, MBF and Pan Niger Delta Forum, (PANDEF) have insisted that all the political parties should zone their presidential ticket to the south in 2023.\n\nThe groups insisted that parties that fail to present Southerners as presidential candidates would jettison votes from the South.\n\nAfenifere National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, said: \u201cOur position is that the presidency should go to the South in 2023. In fact, we have said that all political parties should zone their presidential ticket to the South. That remains our position.\u201d\n\nHowever, Publicity Secretary of Ohaneze Ndigbo Worldwide, Alex Ogbonnia, said the political parties should specifically zone their presidential ticket to the South East for equity, justice and fair play.\n\nOgbonnia further said that Nigeria currently sits in \u201ca precarious balance\u201d and that Gov Buni\u2019s assertion that the presidential ticket has not been zoned further threatened the peace and continued corporate existence of Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cEvery Nigerian knows it is the turn of the South East to produce the President of Nigeria in 2023. It was done in 1999 when both political parties zoned their presidential ticket to the South West. In 2007, President Olusegun Obasanjo ensured that the presidency went back to the North and the major political parties zoned their presidential tickets to the North.\u201d\n\nThe Ohaneze Publicity Secretary further said that 2023 is a moral burden on the entire country, which can only be assuaged if the presidency is given to the South East.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nHe added: \u201cThere are two kinds of people in this country \u2013 those who want Nigeria to remain one and those who want it to disintegrate. President Muhammadu Buhari must take the bull by the horns, he is the leader of the APC and he should ensure that the party\u2019s presidential ticket is zoned to the South East. The President should replicate what President Obasanjo did in 2007 and ensure that power returns to the South East.\n\nAccording to Ogbonnia, \u201cFor peace, justice and equity to reign and for the continued peaceful corporate existence of Nigeria, the political parties should zone their presidential ticket to the South East because we didn\u2019t know for how long we can continue to hold back these young boys.\u201d\n\nThe Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE) also insisted that the Southern part of Nigeria must be allowed to produce the president of the country in 2023, irrespective of political affiliations, in a bid to ensure peace, stability, progress and development for the nation.\n\nSecretary-General of the council, Dr. Kunle Olajide, who made the disclosure in a brief telephone interview with Saturday Sun on Friday, noted that though the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria does not recognise zoning, \u201cmorally, Nigerians have accepted the zoning because so many Nigerians want stability, progress, and development of the country.\n\n\u201cThis also goes with the fact that Nigerians did not take part in the making of the 1999 Constitution. The 1999 Constitution was written by a few people, during the military regime of Gen Abdulsalami Abubakar, to give us the so-called constitution. In Nigeria, we don\u2019t have our constitution yet. The 1999 Constitution does not accommodate zoning.\n\n\u201cBut it is only by zoning that the progress and peace of Nigeria can be guaranteed. The geographical south must be recognised and rotating political power among the two zones \u2013 North and South, will guarantee stability, progress and development for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo, a new constitution will be a panacea to peace and stability in Nigeria. We need people\u2019s constitution in Nigeria that we would all sit and write, and as well agree how we want to live together. We are different people. This must be recognised and that is the reality of Nigeria. We are different people and we must sit down together and discuss the facts of our union in a people federal constitution.\n\n\u201cSo, for me, any Nigerian who appears not to recognise zoning, sharing of political positions and political powers must be living in grand delusion. Though I am not desperate about the 2023 presidency and YCE is not a political party, the South must produce the president in 2023 for peace and stability of this nation. Then, the three zones in the South will sort it out among themselves who they will present.\n\nSouthern and Middle Belt Leaders\u2019 Forum (SMBLF), had at a meeting on Thursday, January 13, in Abuja, also called on all political parties in Nigeria to zone their presidential tickets to the south.the southern and Middle Belt leaders also warned that any political party that does not zone its presidential ticket to the South should not expect support from the four regions that constitute the body. The meeting, held under the chairmanship of Dr Edwin Clark and attended by Afenifere acting leader, Ayo Adebanjo, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide President General, Prof George Obiozor, Dr. Pogu Bitrus, President of the Middle Belt Forum and Senator Emmanuel Ibok Essien, National Chairman of Pan Niger Delta Forum, (PANDEF) noted that the basis of any viable democracy, especially in a diverse and complex country such as Nigeria, is fair and even sharing of power.\n\nIt noted: \u201cThe northern part of the country would have fully enjoyed the Office of the Presidency of the country for the full statutory period of eight years by 2023, hence, the presidency should rotate to the South.\u201d They noted that the extant 1999 Constitution and structure of Nigeria are grossly flawed and lopsided, and demanded the fundamental restructuring of the country by enacting a new Constitution that would enthrone equity, fairness and justice.",

          "text": "Say over 20 churches burnt, several houses, businesses destroyed\n\nInsist 110 abducted Chibok schoolgirls still unaccounted for since 2014, after 57 escaped from captivity\n\nBy Michael Olugbode\n\nThe people of Chibok local government area of Borno State have decried the neglect of their area by the government, which has left them vulnerable to Boko Haram attacks.\n\nChibok got famous when on April 14, 2014 Boko Haram invaded a school in the community, abducting over 270 schoolgirls.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Abuja on Saturday, Kibaku Area Development Association (KADA), an association of people from Chibok local government area of Borno State, lamented that since the break out of insurgency attacks over a decade ago, their area had been attacked over 72 times, with over 407 persons killed.\n\nThe group also lamented that over 332 persons had been abducted in the council, over 20 churches burnt, unquantifiable houses and businesses burnt, vehicles stolen and grains barns burnt or destroyed by the terrorist group.\n\nThe group, which was led to the press conference by the National President of KADA, Dauda Iliya said: \u201cWe are on behalf of the entire Chibok Community, using this medium to once again call on President Muhammadu Buhari to rescue Chibok Community, an ethnic nationality, from total annihilation by the Boko Haram Terrorists. This is because since the mass abduction of our 276 daughters in April, 2014, wherein 57 escaped (on their own) we still have 110 of them still unaccounted for.\n\n\u201cThe parents and the Community have continued to be subjected to persistent and sustained attacks, killings, abductions, maiming, arsons and other myriads of criminality without adequate government protection. Chibok has been for all intents and purposes abandoned to its own devices by all layers of government in Nigeria.\n\nRight from late 2012 up to this time, the statistics of the state of damage and destruction of lives and property inflicted on the Community presents a worrisome and pathetic picture.\u201d\n\nThey alleged that: \u201cFrom late 2018 to date, the frequency of attacks and level of destruction have escalated and are simply alarming. Just this year (2022) alone, Kautikari (second largest town in Chibok area) was attacked on January 14 with five girls abducted, three persons killed, many houses and churches burnt, etc. In sustaining their carnage, Piyemi, another big town in Chibok area, was attacked on January 20 with 19 persons (mostly girls) abducted and one person, the Vigilante leader, beheaded!\u201d\n\nThey added that: \u201cThe town was practically razed down and virtually all the recently harvested agricultural produce completely burnt down and/or looted. Chibok is predominantly an agrarian community and the whole year\u2019s harvests have been lost to these sustained and targeted attacks posing serious food security concerns in the community.\n\n\u201cWe call on all well-meaning Nigerians and Mr. President in particular, to rise up to the occasion and urgently save our people from total annihilation and starvation.\u201d\n\nThey asked government to synergize with security forces in confronting the menace so as to end the sustained carnage on the people of Chibok and facilitate the return of the remaining 110 daughters abducted in 2014 and numerous others subsequently abducted at different times; for the immediate setting up of IDP Camps in Chibok town and provide Chibok with skills acquisition centre so as to avoid imminent hunger/starvation.\n\nThey also requested the federal government to order deployment of more military personnel as well as better arms to Chibok to halt the continuous attacks on the community and plead with Borno State Governor to do more in organizing and helping the people of the area in securing the state in general and Chibok in particular from attacks.\n\nThey condoled the Nigerian Army for the loss of gallant soldiers including the very brave Brigadier General B. K. Zirkushu who lost their lives in Askira protecting the people against the invading terrorists on November 13, 2021.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Osinbajo: Only Leaders Not Inspired by Personal Profit Can Bring about National Transformation",
          "text": "* Asserts Nigeria will overcome its challenges and rise again\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\n\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo yesterday took a deep look at the countless problems bedeviling Nigeria and declared that only people not inspired by personal profit could bring about the desired national transformation in the country.\n\nOsinbajo, who was speaking in Abuja at the 1st Annual General Assembly of Catholics in Politics and Catholic Business Leaders, also highlighted the imperative of servant leadership and transformational leadership at different levels in society as a force for the common good.\n\nHe said: \u201cHistory teaches us that everywhere there has been a national transformation, it has been brought about by public-spirited men and women of goodwill who, inspired by their belief in a higher purpose other than their own profit, have entered the public square to champion the common good.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo said transformational leadership, particularly in a multi-ethnic and multi-faceted country like Nigeria, \u201cis needed\u201d across all levels of government and spheres of society, as its primary focus is the pursuit of the common good to ensure fairness, justice, unity and development in a nation.\n\nAccording to the VP, \u201cbuilding credible institutions of justice, the rule of law and orderly society are crucial expressions of the pursuit of the common good.\u201d\n\nRecalling the words of His Holiness Pope John Paul II during his visit to Nigeria in February 1982 in an address at the State House in Lagos, the VP stated, \u201conly the harnessing of all the forces for the common good, in true respect of the supreme values of the spirit, will make a nation great and a happy dwelling place for its people.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President stated that the common good as an imperative of public policy and governance was articulated by the second chapter of the Nigerian Constitution, adding, \u201cThe challenge of actualising the common good is coterminous with our quest to actualise the Directive Principles and Objectives of State Policy. Achieving both requires transformational leadership across all levels and spheres of our society.\u201d\n\nHighlighting why transformational leadership is critical to national life, the VP noted that it would spur positive changes across all sectors and spheres of society.\n\nHe added that as a model of leadership, transformational leadership operates by serving and uplifting others because it is servant leadership.\n\nThe VP noted: \u201cThe purpose of power is service, not domination; it is to uplift and empower others rather than to control or oppress. This is a model of leadership that is inseparable from our conception of the common good.\n\n\u201cTransformational leadership is, therefore, the pursuit of the common good. But the pursuit of the common good itself is not as easy as it sounds. This is especially so where the wounds and enmities of ethnic and religious conflicts are deep.\n\n\u201cThe common type of leadership will seek the path of relevance and popularity within their own ethnic or religious camps by seeking only the good of their own. The servant-leader will serve his people by emphasising the letter and spirit of the gospel that even our worst enemies were still made in the image of God.\n\n\u201cAnd the pursuit of the common good is the pursuit of the good of those who hate us and have hurt us even in the recent past.\n\n\u201cTransformational leadership means that we do not mourn and condemn the killing of those who belong to our own tribe or faith alone, or seek justice for ours alone, because all men are equal before God, and that the pain and anguish of a mother\u2019s loss of a child, is not different from one faith or tongue to the other.\u201d\n\nOne of the ways to cultivate the values that promote the common good (that seeks out the good of others) is in the delivery of justice and cementing the foundations of integrity in society, the Vice President noted.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe most progressive expressions of faith are concerned with justice and justice is impossible without taking the institutions that govern public life into account. In this sense, the purpose of governance and public policy is to establish a paradigm of justice that is measured by how well society deals with its most vulnerable members, settle disputes fairly and speedily, meting out punishment to violators of law without bias or fear.\n\n\u201cOur courts of law must be courts of justice. It means that we must pay attention to the quality and caliber of the men and women who are appointed judges. We must be concerned with their remuneration, and welfare. We must be unrelenting on insisting on their integrity.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo also described corruption as a \u201ccancer\u201d noting that \u201cthe cancer in governments anywhere is corruption: \u201cWhen public officials, (be they high or low in the executive, legislature or judiciary) are toll gates for the extortion of the populace while seeking government dispensations, the common good, happy and prosperous lives for the people is impossible.\u201d\n\nHe added that the pursuit of the common good must \u201cinvolve a relentless pursuit of integrity and transparency of public officers: \u201cWe must think through the systems that will reduce human discretion in public-facing institutions. So we must, as a collective, condemn and call out corruption and corrupt practices.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President also encouraged Nigerians not to despair, despite some of the challenges, but have hope and belief in the promise of a great nation while urging that Nigerians must be willing to pay the price to achieve national greatness by actively pursuing the common good of all, regardless of tribal and religious differences.\n\n\u201cFulfilling the immense promise of our nation requires men and women of goodwill from various communities and faiths to collaborate in advancing the common good. This is all the more important because it is such coalitions that can heal society of the wounds inflicted by the crude identity politics of religion and ethnicity.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur future will be shaped by how well we make common cause with other citizens of progressive persuasions to transform our communities,\u201d said the Vice President.\n\nHe emphasised the importance of forging collaborative partnerships, \u201cnot only within ourselves but with other forces which are committed to the common good to positively impact society.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo adds: \u201cOur greatest adversary in our task of national renewal is a feeling of hopelessness \u2013 a sense of futility that seems almost overwhelming. However, we cannot afford to even indulge in such despondency and despair. There is hope and there is much work to be done.\n\n\u201cNigeria will overcome its challenges and rise again. Contrary to opinion in some quarters, this house will not fall. It is being built and needs yet many more people to commit to building the sort of nation that we want. The throes and pangs of birth must not be interpreted as the pains of impending death. We are by the grace of God, more than able to overcome our present difficulties and we will overcome them.\u201d\n\nThe summit, otherwise known as the AGORA Conference, had as theme: \u201cThe Advancement of the Common Good towards Justice, Unity, Structure and Development of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "James Emejo\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has amended the operational guidelines of the Global Standing Instruction (GSI) to allow for continuous and unrestricted loan recovery by Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) and financial institutions in the country.\n\nThe GSI creates a contractual mandate from an individual borrower, in favour of a creditor bank to apply monies standing to the credit of the borrower in a third-party financial institution or electronic wallet to offset the debt obligations of the borrower. It helps to facilitate improved credit repayment culture.\n\nThe CBN in a circular titled: \u201cRe: Global Standing Instruction (GSI) \u2013 Individuals,\u201d dated January 19, 2022, signed by CBN Director, Policy and Regulations Department, Chibuzo Efobi and addressed to all banks and other financial institutions, stated that following the amendment, the frequency of recovery attempts via the GSI platform had been altered from a specific number to continuous and unrestricted.\n\nThe bank explained further that in effect, the GSI\u2019s automated loan recovery feature, applicable to all loans in the industry, shall remain perpetually in place throughout the life of the loan and/or until the loan is fully repaid.\n\nThe guideline contains lists of sanctions to be meted on banks and financial institutions in the event of violation or misapplication of the GSI.\n\nThe apex bank stated further that the move was in furtherance of its mandate to promote financial system stability.\n\nThe central bank had in July 2020, issued a guideline on the GSI, which was aimed at enhancing loan recovery and monitoring chronic loan defaulters.\n\nThe initiative was fundamentally conceived to address the recurring instances of willful loan default in the industry with a view to identifying and watch-listing recalcitrant debtors, enhancing loan recovery from all eligible and funded accounts/wallets in the banking industry, improving credit repayment culture and reducing Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) in the Nigerian banking system.\n\nHowever, CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele had, at the recent meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), disclosed that total Non-Performing Loans in the financial system had declined to about 4.85 per cent, the first in 10 years.\n\nThe updated framework is expected to further reduce incidences of loans going bad thereby worsening NPLs position.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "\u2018Who are we going to vote for?\u2019",
          "text": "A neighbour sent me a WhatsApp chat last week with a million-dollar question: \u201cWho are we voting for?\u201d It was an awkward question. I have been discussing all the theories about the qualities the next president should have but I have paid little attention to a crucial part of the equation: what determines the voting behaviour of the electorate? Just as my neighbour was asking me who we should vote for, so also do millions of Nigerian voters ask their leaders and influencers the direction to go. But while voters like my neighbour would analyse the choices they have before taking a position, many voters do not engage in such rigour. I intend to discuss why it is so in this article.\n\nI have been monitoring public enlightenment campaigns imploring Nigerians to get their permanent voters\u2019 cards, popularly known as PVC. I love the messaging. \u201cINEC does not count prayer points \u2014 get your PVC.\u201d Pray but register to vote. Lovely. \u201cINEC does not count votes on Twitter \u2013 get your PVC.\u201d Walk the talk. Fantastic. The beauty of democracy is the power of the people to decide who would pilot their affairs. Unlike military rule and one-party democracies where we have little or no say on who would call the shots, multi-party democracy puts the power in the hands of the voters. How sweet it is for you to vote freely, for your vote to be counted and for your vote to count!\n\nHowever, this begs the question: does a PVC in hand translate to making the right choice? This is a question democracy cannot answer convincingly. Having the PVC does not mean you will make an informed decision on election day. It only means you can vote. In my understanding, some candidates win not because they are good but because they are considered better than others. Some win because they have the war chest and election machinery. Some win because they appeal to big constituencies. Hardly do candidates win elections because they are the best brains a society can offer. In Nigeria, to win an election takes more than paper qualifications and power of poetry.\n\nIn a democracy, the majority carries the day. How are we sure the majority will make the right choice? How will the majority know who is going to do well in office? I ask these questions partly because Nigerians have voted for all kinds of leaders since 1999 and are always disillusioned with the governance outcome. Does that mean their collective judgment has always been wrong? Many analysts often say we have bad leaders because Nigerians sell their votes. Does that mean if they had voted for candidates who did not offer them money, those ones would have done better in office? Voting right is one thing; performing well in office is a different proposition altogether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be clear, I am not here to question the value of democracy. I believe in democracy. I was born under military rule. I schooled under military rule. I started life under military rule. I have now lived under democracy for 22 unbroken years. I know the one I prefer. But I think we make some flattering assumptions about democracy, particularly about its supposedly in-built capacity to produce good leaders. This assumption often overlooks the deficiencies and deficits of democracy. While elections should put those voted into office on their toes \u2014 knowing they stand the risk of being voted out if they disappoint \u2014 there are no guarantees of good governance either way.\n\nBack to the question: who should we vote for? That question is what several millions of Nigerian voters ask their influencers at election times, and the answer is what mostly determines their choices at the polling booth. They listen to their influencers. Therefore, as the 2023 elections draw nearer, I want to help us understand the mentality of the Nigerian voter \u2014 as I often try to do at election times \u2014 in order to moderate our expectations and provide us with analytical tools that may be useful in interpreting why we vote the way we do. How does the mind of the average Nigerian voter work? What facts and factors play the biggest role in shaping voting behaviour?\n\nNigerian voters, whether or not they are registered members of the political parties, are influenced by four broad interests: one, material; two, ideological; three, primordial; and four, political affinity. By material interest, I mean \u201cstomach infrastructure\u201d. It pulls a significant crowd in Nigeria. A small bag of rice does a lot of trick. In any poor society, food is a big appetiser for vote sellers. The material-induced voters are freelancers and are usually only valuable at election times. They do not harbour any pretence \u2014 they are in it for the one-night stand. They should not be confused with loyalists whose material needs are regularly taken care of by their godfathers and political leaders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe second category is \u201cideological voters\u201d. There are Nigerian voters who still believe in the ideals of how a society should run. They think that in the whole mess, one party or one candidate is still better than the other. So, while cynics would say \u201call politicians are the same\u201d or \u201call parties are alike\u201d, voters of this hue would argue that some are better than the others. They are not explicitly motivated by emotional interests \u2014 they do not find it hard to ignore ethnic, religious and regional sentiments in casting their votes. This category is a tiny minority in Nigeria but I think it is fast gaining ground. I have encountered many Nigerians, mostly educated ones, in this category.\n\nMany Nigerian voters are, expectedly, motivated by \u201cprimordial\u201d interest \u2014 the third category. I use this to cover ethnic, regional or religious emotions. If they have to choose between a candidate from their region/ religion and someone else, they will automatically vote for their ilk. But if no strong candidate of their kinfolk is on the ballot, they are likely to vote for whoever is \u201ccloser\u201d to them \u2014 someone likely to serve their interests or who has often identified with them. The fundamental motivation here, therefore, is group interest. This may explain why some communities historically and consistently deliver as many as three quarters of their votes to particular political tendencies.\n\nThe fourth \u201cinterest\u201d is \u201cpolitical affinity\u201d. In this category, it is not so much about ethnic or religious affiliation, but historical political alliances. In the past, for example, Southern minorities used to vote for the mainstream parties from the north. This affinity is often defined by the political and traditional rulers. If they direct their followers and subjects to vote for someone from another place or party, they will comply. For instance, Kwara state voters used to go anywhere the late Dr Olusola Saraki went. Within 48 hours to the August 1983 governorship election, he reportedly directed his supporters in the NPN to vote for Chief CO Adebayo, the UPN candidate. Adebayo won.\n\nA word of caution here. Sometimes, the godfathers read the room before taking a decision on the direction to go. There are times they call the shots and get away with it. In fact, their followers will come to them and ask: who should we vote for? Other times, they can see the direction their followers want to go and they play along to avoid rebellion. This is not limited to the general election. From party formation \u2014 where alliances are revived or shaped \u2014 to primary elections \u2014 where candidates are picked \u2014 the leaders delicately play their cards to keep their flock in line. It is not a mistake that states such as Borno, Lagos and Enugu have always voted along certain patterns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have to submit at this point that these categories are not mutually exclusive. They do overlap at times, depending on the political currents. Primordial interest and political affinity are often conjoined. Both are highly emotional in nature, unlike \u201cstomach infrastructure\u201d and \u201cideology\u201d that are mostly rational choices. The stomach is fluid and based on \u201csurvival\u201d, while ideology is a conviction. However, \u201cstomach infrastructure\u201d can fail if people\u2019s emotions lie elsewhere. \u201cGoodies\u201d cannot sway them, no matter how big. In 1999, the south-west voted for the Alliance for Democracy (AD) because of June 12 emotions. All the bags of rice from the PDP could not sway them.\n\nIdeological interests are, however, mostly fixed and could be rigid. That is why some parties still have members even when it is clear that they will not win a single ward anywhere. It is often argued that Nigerian parties do not have ideologies, that they are in the same boat. This, it is said, makes it easy to defect from PDP to APC and back to PDP. I understand this perspective. In the US, you know what the Democrats and the Republicans stand for. In the UK, you know what the Conservatives and Labour are about. In Nigeria, APC and PDP are look-alikes. But my definition of ideological voters is not based on partisanship alone. In fact, many ideological voters are blind to party affiliations.\n\nWith this at the back of our minds, we should approach 2023 with useful analytical tools. To start with, these interests will play out in the primary elections of the political parties. Party members will look up to their leaders and influencers in choosing who to vote for among the aspirants. Some will be influenced by the stomach infrastructure distributed by the aspirants during the primaries. You are not likely to find too many ideological voters at the primary elections. Rather, those who go to their leaders to ask \u201cwho should be vote for\u201d are going to be in the majority. Ideological voters will be more useful during the general election when the candidates are already known.\n\nWhat am I driving at? Since we have a fair knowledge of the voting behaviour of Nigerians, we should be working harder on the godfathers, influencers and kingmakers to make the right choices as much as we are working on the voters to do the right thing. Our big task as campaigners for good governance is to keep drumming into the ears of the political elite the need to back competent and patriotic candidates in the primaries. Yes, we should keep asking Nigerians to get their PVCs and vote right, but we should also work seriously on the kingmakers so we can be spoilt for choice at the polls. We can then hope to pressure those elected to deliver the goods. It is a long journey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nTRAGIC TRILLIONS\n\nWe are going to spend N3 trillion on petrol subsidy in 2022 \u2014 not on hospitals, not on schools, not on roads. Read that again. The whole of N3 trillion to help Nigerian motorists fill their tanks. This is a country that is borrowing to build infrastructure, a country that is perpetually running humongous budget deficits, a country that cannot fund education and healthcare to cater for the ordinary Nigerians. And, by the way, transport costs will still go up even if we sell petrol for N100 per litre. While petrol may be the highest operational cost input, it is not the only one. Prices of other consumables, such as tires and engine oil, are going up. In effect, the poor will still suffer. Paradox.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDIRECT PRIMARY\n\nPresident Buhari has succeeded in his opposition to compulsory direct primary as passed in the electoral law amendment by the federal legislators. The two houses have now deleted \u201ccompulsory\u201d and parties are now free to choose whether they want delegates or all eligible party members to decide who the candidates would be. Although my position was that neither direct nor indirect primary would address issues about election credibility, a part of me was wishing we should implement direct primary and see the magic. Well, Ekiti state did its governorship primaries last week. PDP did indirect, APC direct. Not surprisingly, both were disputed by the losers. Confirmed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUPPING THE ANTE\n\nRt Hon Femi Gbajabiamila, speaker of the house of reps, says it is time to change the minimum academic qualifications for elective offices. As things stand, all you need to contest for any office is to be educated up to school certificate level \u201cor its equivalent\u201d, according to the 1999 constitution. Technically, this does not say you must have a certificate. You can claim you received the education but didn\u2019t write the school cert exam. How this ridiculous provision has survived all amendments baffles me. We need to amend it to a minimum of first degree/HND \u201cor its equivalent\u201d. It still won\u2019t guarantee good governance but, at least, we can raise the bar, education-wise. Standards.\n\nHISTORY MAKERS\n\nMs Salima Rhadia Mukansanga became the first woman to referee an Africa Cup of Nations game when she handled Zimbabwe vs Guinea. I\u2019m not surprised she is from Rwanda \u2014 the country officially treats women as full humans, not as adjuncts or afterthoughts. Remarkably, Nigeria produced its first female referee in 1981 when Jamila Buhari, from Kano, was licensed. After her first match at the Kano Township Stadium, she got a slap from a male footballer who could not imagine a woman in a man\u2019s space! The crowd instantly descended on the rascal in kind. It is pleasing that Nigerian female referees are not doing badly. I wish them more international recognition. Amazons.",

          "title": "\u2018Who are we going to vote for?\u2019",
          "text": "A neighbour sent me a WhatsApp chat last week with a million-dollar question: \u201cWho are we voting for?\u201d It was an awkward question. I have been discussing all the theories about the qualities the next president should have but I have paid little attention to a crucial part of the equation: what determines the voting behaviour of the electorate? Just as my neighbour was asking me who we should vote for, so also do millions of Nigerian voters ask their leaders and influencers the direction to go. But while voters like my neighbour would analyse the choices they have before taking a position, many voters do not engage in such rigour. I intend to discuss why it is so in this article.\n\nI have been monitoring public enlightenment campaigns imploring Nigerians to get their permanent voters\u2019 cards, popularly known as PVC. I love the messaging. \u201cINEC does not count prayer points \u2014 get your PVC.\u201d Pray but register to vote. Lovely. \u201cINEC does not count votes on Twitter \u2013 get your PVC.\u201d Walk the talk. Fantastic. The beauty of democracy is the power of the people to decide who would pilot their affairs. Unlike military rule and one-party democracies where we have little or no say on who would call the shots, multi-party democracy puts the power in the hands of the voters. How sweet it is for you to vote freely, for your vote to be counted and for your vote to count!\n\nHowever, this begs the question: does a PVC in hand translate to making the right choice? This is a question democracy cannot answer convincingly. Having the PVC does not mean you will make an informed decision on election day. It only means you can vote. In my understanding, some candidates win not because they are good but because they are considered better than others. Some win because they have the war chest and election machinery. Some win because they appeal to big constituencies. Hardly do candidates win elections because they are the best brains a society can offer. In Nigeria, to win an election takes more than paper qualifications and power of poetry.\n\nIn a democracy, the majority carries the day. How are we sure the majority will make the right choice? How will the majority know who is going to do well in office? I ask these questions partly because Nigerians have voted for all kinds of leaders since 1999 and are always disillusioned with the governance outcome. Does that mean their collective judgment has always been wrong? Many analysts often say we have bad leaders because Nigerians sell their votes. Does that mean if they had voted for candidates who did not offer them money, those ones would have done better in office? Voting right is one thing; performing well in office is a different proposition altogether.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be clear, I am not here to question the value of democracy. I believe in democracy. I was born under military rule. I schooled under military rule. I started life under military rule. I have now lived under democracy for 22 unbroken years. I know the one I prefer. But I think we make some flattering assumptions about democracy, particularly about its supposedly in-built capacity to produce good leaders. This assumption often overlooks the deficiencies and deficits of democracy. While elections should put those voted into office on their toes \u2014 knowing they stand the risk of being voted out if they disappoint \u2014 there are no guarantees of good governance either way.\n\nBack to the question: who should we vote for? That question is what several millions of Nigerian voters ask their influencers at election times, and the answer is what mostly determines their choices at the polling booth. They listen to their influencers. Therefore, as the 2023 elections draw nearer, I want to help us understand the mentality of the Nigerian voter \u2014 as I often try to do at election times \u2014 in order to moderate our expectations and provide us with analytical tools that may be useful in interpreting why we vote the way we do. How does the mind of the average Nigerian voter work? What facts and factors play the biggest role in shaping voting behaviour?\n\nNigerian voters, whether or not they are registered members of the political parties, are influenced by four broad interests: one, material; two, ideological; three, primordial; and four, political affinity. By material interest, I mean \u201cstomach infrastructure\u201d. It pulls a significant crowd in Nigeria. A small bag of rice does a lot of trick. In any poor society, food is a big appetiser for vote sellers. The material-induced voters are freelancers and are usually only valuable at election times. They do not harbour any pretence \u2014 they are in it for the one-night stand. They should not be confused with loyalists whose material needs are regularly taken care of by their godfathers and political leaders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe second category is \u201cideological voters\u201d. There are Nigerian voters who still believe in the ideals of how a society should run. They think that in the whole mess, one party or one candidate is still better than the other. So, while cynics would say \u201call politicians are the same\u201d or \u201call parties are alike\u201d, voters of this hue would argue that some are better than the others. They are not explicitly motivated by emotional interests \u2014 they do not find it hard to ignore ethnic, religious and regional sentiments in casting their votes. This category is a tiny minority in Nigeria but I think it is fast gaining ground. I have encountered many Nigerians, mostly educated ones, in this category.\n\nMany Nigerian voters are, expectedly, motivated by \u201cprimordial\u201d interest \u2014 the third category. I use this to cover ethnic, regional or religious emotions. If they have to choose between a candidate from their region/ religion and someone else, they will automatically vote for their ilk. But if no strong candidate of their kinfolk is on the ballot, they are likely to vote for whoever is \u201ccloser\u201d to them \u2014 someone likely to serve their interests or who has often identified with them. The fundamental motivation here, therefore, is group interest. This may explain why some communities historically and consistently deliver as many as three quarters of their votes to particular political tendencies.\n\nThe fourth \u201cinterest\u201d is \u201cpolitical affinity\u201d. In this category, it is not so much about ethnic or religious affiliation, but historical political alliances. In the past, for example, Southern minorities used to vote for the mainstream parties from the north. This affinity is often defined by the political and traditional rulers. If they direct their followers and subjects to vote for someone from another place or party, they will comply. For instance, Kwara state voters used to go anywhere the late Dr Olusola Saraki went. Within 48 hours to the August 1983 governorship election, he reportedly directed his supporters in the NPN to vote for Chief CO Adebayo, the UPN candidate. Adebayo won.\n\nA word of caution here. Sometimes, the godfathers read the room before taking a decision on the direction to go. There are times they call the shots and get away with it. In fact, their followers will come to them and ask: who should we vote for? Other times, they can see the direction their followers want to go and they play along to avoid rebellion. This is not limited to the general election. From party formation \u2014 where alliances are revived or shaped \u2014 to primary elections \u2014 where candidates are picked \u2014 the leaders delicately play their cards to keep their flock in line. It is not a mistake that states such as Borno, Lagos and Enugu have always voted along certain patterns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI have to submit at this point that these categories are not mutually exclusive. They do overlap at times, depending on the political currents. Primordial interest and political affinity are often conjoined. Both are highly emotional in nature, unlike \u201cstomach infrastructure\u201d and \u201cideology\u201d that are mostly rational choices. The stomach is fluid and based on \u201csurvival\u201d, while ideology is a conviction. However, \u201cstomach infrastructure\u201d can fail if people\u2019s emotions lie elsewhere. \u201cGoodies\u201d cannot sway them, no matter how big. In 1999, the south-west voted for the Alliance for Democracy (AD) because of June 12 emotions. All the bags of rice from the PDP could not sway them.\n\nIdeological interests are, however, mostly fixed and could be rigid. That is why some parties still have members even when it is clear that they will not win a single ward anywhere. It is often argued that Nigerian parties do not have ideologies, that they are in the same boat. This, it is said, makes it easy to defect from PDP to APC and back to PDP. I understand this perspective. In the US, you know what the Democrats and the Republicans stand for. In the UK, you know what the Conservatives and Labour are about. In Nigeria, APC and PDP are look-alikes. But my definition of ideological voters is not based on partisanship alone. In fact, many ideological voters are blind to party affiliations.\n\nWith this at the back of our minds, we should approach 2023 with useful analytical tools. To start with, these interests will play out in the primary elections of the political parties. Party members will look up to their leaders and influencers in choosing who to vote for among the aspirants. Some will be influenced by the stomach infrastructure distributed by the aspirants during the primaries. You are not likely to find too many ideological voters at the primary elections. Rather, those who go to their leaders to ask \u201cwho should be vote for\u201d are going to be in the majority. Ideological voters will be more useful during the general election when the candidates are already known.\n\nWhat am I driving at? Since we have a fair knowledge of the voting behaviour of Nigerians, we should be working harder on the godfathers, influencers and kingmakers to make the right choices as much as we are working on the voters to do the right thing. Our big task as campaigners for good governance is to keep drumming into the ears of the political elite the need to back competent and patriotic candidates in the primaries. Yes, we should keep asking Nigerians to get their PVCs and vote right, but we should also work seriously on the kingmakers so we can be spoilt for choice at the polls. We can then hope to pressure those elected to deliver the goods. It is a long journey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nTRAGIC TRILLIONS\n\nWe are going to spend N3 trillion on petrol subsidy in 2022 \u2014 not on hospitals, not on schools, not on roads. Read that again. The whole of N3 trillion to help Nigerian motorists fill their tanks. This is a country that is borrowing to build infrastructure, a country that is perpetually running humongous budget deficits, a country that cannot fund education and healthcare to cater for the ordinary Nigerians. And, by the way, transport costs will still go up even if we sell petrol for N100 per litre. While petrol may be the highest operational cost input, it is not the only one. Prices of other consumables, such as tires and engine oil, are going up. In effect, the poor will still suffer. Paradox.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDIRECT PRIMARY\n\nPresident Buhari has succeeded in his opposition to compulsory direct primary as passed in the electoral law amendment by the federal legislators. The two houses have now deleted \u201ccompulsory\u201d and parties are now free to choose whether they want delegates or all eligible party members to decide who the candidates would be. Although my position was that neither direct nor indirect primary would address issues about election credibility, a part of me was wishing we should implement direct primary and see the magic. Well, Ekiti state did its governorship primaries last week. PDP did indirect, APC direct. Not surprisingly, both were disputed by the losers. Confirmed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUPPING THE ANTE\n\nRt Hon Femi Gbajabiamila, speaker of the house of reps, says it is time to change the minimum academic qualifications for elective offices. As things stand, all you need to contest for any office is to be educated up to school certificate level \u201cor its equivalent\u201d, according to the 1999 constitution. Technically, this does not say you must have a certificate. You can claim you received the education but didn\u2019t write the school cert exam. How this ridiculous provision has survived all amendments baffles me. We need to amend it to a minimum of first degree/HND \u201cor its equivalent\u201d. It still won\u2019t guarantee good governance but, at least, we can raise the bar, education-wise. Standards.\n\nHISTORY MAKERS\n\nMs Salima Rhadia Mukansanga became the first woman to referee an Africa Cup of Nations game when she handled Zimbabwe vs Guinea. I\u2019m not surprised she is from Rwanda \u2014 the country officially treats women as full humans, not as adjuncts or afterthoughts. Remarkably, Nigeria produced its first female referee in 1981 when Jamila Buhari, from Kano, was licensed. After her first match at the Kano Township Stadium, she got a slap from a male footballer who could not imagine a woman in a man\u2019s space! The crowd instantly descended on the rascal in kind. It is pleasing that Nigerian female referees are not doing badly. I wish them more international recognition. Amazons.",

          "text": "Do you need a guide for all the big tech terms people are throwing about on the internet? What do blockchain, NFT, DAO and crypto mean?\n\nOver the past couple of years, there\u2019s been an influx of words that explain certain tech concepts. Some of them like crypto, or even NFTs, have been around for a while. In fact, NFT\u2014as a word\u2014was first used in 2014 and now, 7 years later, it\u2019s still a concept that escapes a lot of us. Others like DeFi or DAOs are fairly new, but they\u2019re still getting thrown around a lot.\n\nWhether you\u2019re new or old to tech, reading about concepts can feel like learning a new language. So TechCabal is creating a guide\u2014short explainers\u2014for common tech terms. In this, you\u2019re sure to find simple short explanations that can help you understand NiFTy concepts.\n\n1. Blockchain\n\nA few of the concepts we\u2019ll explain here are based on blockchain so it\u2019s important this goes first.\n\nBlockchain is a record-keeping tech that\u2019s designed to make it impossible to hack the system or forge the data stored on it.\n\nHow it works: Standard databases store data in rows, columns and files, but blockchain stores data in blocks that are chained together. The data on the blocks are continuously updated, encrypted, and stored on several computers so there\u2019s no single computer to hack or control the data from.\n\nIn explaining blockchain, Buchi Okoro\u2014CEO and co-founder of African cryptocurrency exchange Quidax\u2014said: \u201cImagine a book where you write down everything you spend money on each day. Each page is similar to a block, and the entire book, a group of pages, is a blockchain. With a blockchain, everyone who uses a cryptocurrency has their own copy of this book to create a unified transaction record. The software logs each new transaction as it happens, and every copy of the blockchain is updated simultaneously with the new information, keeping all records identical and accurate.\u201d\n\n2. Cryptocurrency\n\nImage source: Aceris Law\n\nWe all know what currencies are\u2014dollars, pounds, shillings. Well, cryptocurrencies are digital currencies. You can\u2019t hold it the way you\u2019d hold fiat currencies like CFA coins or naira notes, but you can still spend it on things you love.\n\nHow it works: Cryptos are digital currencies created on blockchain technology. If you got a sense of what blockchains are, then you\u2019ll understand what we mean when we say that cryptocurrencies are decentralised; no one person or government controls them. They are created by algorithms and used to award engineers\u2014called miners\u2014who carry out maintenance on the blockchain.\n\nUnlike fiat currencies which derive their value and validity from states, cryptocurrencies derive their value and validity from the blockchain.\n\n3. Non-fungible token (NFT)\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by its mushroom-sounding title, NFTs are in fact inedible, even the NFT flavours. NFTs are unique digital assets created on a blockchain.\n\nHow it works: To put it simply, NFTs are digital works that exist on blockchain. They can be images, sounds, game skins, or even clothes for your digital avatars. These digital works are impossible to duplicate or forge; they\u2019re one of a kind and that makes them valuable. If you\u2019re asking yourself why a screenshot of an NFT isn\u2019t as valuable, it\u2019s because NFTs have been embedded with code which is what makes them exist on the blockchain.\n\nThink of it this way, when you go to a museum and take photos of artefacts, what you have is just a photo which isn\u2019t quite valuable. The museum still has the original valuable artefact.\n\nIt\u2019s similar with NFTs. We can take screenshots of Niyi Okeowo\u2019s $2,800 Indigo Child (below) but it doesn\u2019t mean we own the asset. The original copy\u2014the property rights and certificate of authenticity\u2014belong to the buyer.\n\nNiyi Okeowo\u2019s \u201cIndigo Child\u201d\n\n4. Web3\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen tech bros throw the word \u201cWeb3\u201d around a lot. It\u2019s the answer experts give to questions from \u201cWhat is the future of the internet?\u201d to \u201cWhat does Spiderman navigate the internet with?\u201d\n\nBut what exactly is Web3? To put it simply, Web3 is taking democracy to the internet.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at Web3\u2019s ancestors, Web1 and Web2, so we can understand what it\u2019s all about.\n\nWeb1 was the earliest version of the internet, which existed between the 1900s and the early 2000s. In this version, content was delivered via texts and graphics to users who could only consume the content but not interact with it.\n\nWeb2 is what we have now, an interactive and social web where companies can build revolutionary apps that allow users to become creators. It\u2019s centralised, i.e. controlled by companies or governments who can decide when websites, apps or content can be taken down with little input from users.\n\nOn Web2, apps are only available for as long as the company that owns them decides. Streaming sites can shut down, online games can upload patches users don\u2019t like (yes, I\u2019m looking at you Riot Games), and traditional banks can freeze bank accounts when the government demands it.\n\nHow Web3 works: Web3 will be built on the blockchain working independently from different parts of the world.\n\nOn Web3, decisions regarding the design and operation of products and funds\u2014including crypto\u2014will be made by communities of people called Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs), and not governments or companies. So if you find an app or product you like, you can join the DAO of that product, buy shares and vote on which changes should be made.\n\nFor example, if you joined TechCabal\u2019s DAO, you\u2019ll get to decide how we upgrade or downgrade depending on how much shares you have in the DAO.\n\n5. Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)\n\nDAOs or Decentralised Autonomous Organisations are social communities that will create rules and regulations which will be embedded in programming codes.\n\nHow it works: Unlike conventional organisations like TechCabal, which have managers and boards of directors that govern it, DAOs are governed by communities\u2014who don\u2019t have to be developers of the product. DAOs are created by developers who decide on a set of rules and embed it in\u2014digital contracts on blockchain that are executed when certain conditions are met.\n\nThe communities decide what happens to the products attached to that DAO, what upgrades to make and when to make it. Each DAO will have its own token which will be sold to its community members, and the more tokens you have, the heavier your stake and voting rights.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigerian musician Buju wanted to reward his fans, so he created an NFT project",
          "text": "Towards the end of 2020, project lead of \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201d, Iyobosa Rehoboth, a creative director of Global Creative Operations (GCO), started brushing up on his knowledge of crypto. After learning extensively about ethereum and NFTs, he started selling the idea of an NFT project to several Nigerian music artistes.\n\nThe award-winning music director, popularly known as Prodigeezy, had initially created a design for a joint NFT project for the trio of Nigerian music superstars, Davido, Wizkid, and Burna Boy, but when he realised that getting the three of them to collaborate on something would be difficult, he abandoned the project.\n\nRehoboth presented his design to some other artistes, who rejected it, until he got it to a Nigerian musician, Daniel Benson, popularly known as Buju. \u201cBuju was open-minded. Having made tremendous progress with his career that year, he was keen on making his brand a global one,\u201d Prodigeezy said. Buju was also, at the time, working on a comic book idea, so it was fairly easy to convince him.\n\nBuju released the remix of \u201cItaly\u201d, featuring Blaq Diamond, with a colourful artwork of his head as the song\u2019s cover. He didn\u2019t want to release a full song, so he uploaded \u201cItaly\u201d to multiple streaming platforms. Before he knew it, it was making waves and, unknown to his many fans jamming to the song, the colourful art cover is in fact an unreleased NFT project.\n\nBuju had seen the NFT project as an opportunity to build a community around his fans, reward and connect with them like never before. \u201cI feel like it is something that people are going to enjoy. I\u2019m always working on a lot of recordings. I feel like it is the best way I could reward people that enjoy my music,\u201d Buju said.\n\nThis Sunday, on a Twitter Space, Buju and the team behind the project offered more details about his NFT project \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201c, a collection of 10,001 unique NFTs of his face. Holders of these NFTs would get perks like access to physical and virtual concerts hosted by Buju, merch items, and a part of the revenue the musician makes from specific music projects.\n\nBuju explained that he would drop more songs, mixtapes, and refixes, and that the project would motivate him to drop some of the songs he has been recording for years now. Buju said that he is always dropping snippets and imagines that holders of \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201d will be able to claim ownership of some of the snippets he drops.\n\nHe said that while he hasn\u2019t decided the arrangement for the sharing revenue with holders, holders will have a fraction of ownership of some of his songs, which will allow them to earn part of his streaming revenue.\n\nThe roadmap for the project, whose Discord channel has close to 4,500 members, is divided into 3 quarters for this year. More plans will be provided in quarter 1of 2023.\n\nfloats, an extended reality company under GCO, which is building the project, will start and intensify an educational campaign to teach people the fundamentals of blockchain, onboard people into crypto, help them set up a wallet, and educate them about the polygon network.\n\nIn this quarter, the \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201d project will be minted publicly and pre-sale will start. It is then holders will begin to get some of the perks of the project. This includes access to PlaySpace, an AR filter for Snapchat and Instagram that takes users through Buju\u2019s career and also offers access to special events and interaction with Buju. Some of the other perks are an airdrop and a life membership mic that unlocks more possibilities in the metaverse and in real life.\n\nIn the second quarter, when Buju announces the release of his debut album, another limited collection of NFTs will be released, which will help holders unlock special access to Buju\u2019s concerts, events, and studio sessions. Merch items with virtual and physical utility will also be released, and some of the virtual merch will contain unlockable NFT content.\n\nThe HeadsByBuju project will dedicate 10% of its primary sales to a creator fund, and the entire community of holders will vote to decide what kind of creative project it would be. This creator fund will also be used to purchase some land in metaverses like Decentraland and Cryptovoxels.\n\nTo ensure that holders reap real-world benefits, the project is collaborating with restaurants, clubs, hotels, and health centres to provide discounts for holders.\n\nThe \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201d team wants to build the project on the polygon network, instead of the ethereum network\u2014which NFT projects are usually based on\u2014because they want to get as many people as possible onboarded to the blockchain. While developing the project, the team spoke with prospective users and discovered that the biggest problem to getting onboarded into the space was ethereum\u2019s high gas fees\u2014the amount of money you pay to execute any command on the ethereum network. So, to make onboarding easier for their audience, some of whom are interacting with NFTs for the first time, they said they want a popular and efficient marketplace and less expensive protocol, and polygon ticked all the boxes.\n\nThis is perhaps the first time any African musician has tried to use crypto technology to establish a connection with fans and reward them.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

Employers use the platform by uploading their employees and setting a budget. Employees can choose from over 100 Health Plans from top HMOs in Nigeria\u201d Olude told Techpoint at the event.\n\n\u201d roHealth is on a mission to increase access to healthcare in Nigerians by providing free health Insurance for a limited period. A lot of companies do not trust HMOs and believe that it does not provide value to their employees. We are here to give them the opportunity to get their employees to try it out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlalekan Olude, roHealth CEO\n\nPaycentre is one of the biggest Agent Banking Networks in the Country with over 80,000 Agents nationwide while Connect Nigeria is an online database with more than 300,000 companies offering information about businesses, real estate, technology, entertainment, and more.\n\nConnect Nigeria houses close to 300,000 companies and for us it is a synergy having a healthcare platform and another platform that wants to preach the message of delivering healthcare to its customers.\n\nWith access to roHealth\u2019s APIs, their partners can achieve their goals of bringing Healthcare closer to their customers and staff. These partnerships would help roHealth reach millions of Nigerians faster.\n\n\u201cNigerians have different health needs and budgets, but what we\u2019ve realised from our partners is that partnering with one HMO excludes them from working with another. But working with roHealth as a partner creates that opportunity to be able to connect as many HMOs as possible by connecting to the roHealth APIs as a service\u201d.\n\nBusinesses with a minimum of 5 Staff can access this offering on the roHealth website \u2013 https://www.rohealth.ng/free-trial and benefits covering Laboratory, Accidents, Surgery and other medical expenses.\n\nLaunching in Nigeria\n\nOlalekan believes that the future of healthcare Insurance would largely be a function of coverage funded by someone.\n\n\u201cIn most countries, Healthcare is usually paid for by the government, through taxes or by the employer in part or in full, but a lot of Nigerians are exposed to zero healthcare coverage and this is because the channels through which they consume services haven\u2019t thought about giving them healthcare to them or covering them as part of their customers or workers.\u201d\n\nThe goal is to deliver the opportunity for all Nigerians to have healthcare coverage wherever they may be through an employer, the informal sector, or services \u2014 buying data, airtime, food, etc \u2014 that people use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis launch is a pilot for expansion across Africa where it can deploy its solution which allows employees choose healthcare plans that fit them within a set budget by their employer.\n\nAt the event, Olude said there are plans to work with banks, retail shops and businesses, among others, to enable customers to get healthcare coverage after spending a certain amount within a month.\n\n\u201cSay for example, you buy stuff at Shoprite, based on some of the partnerships we are working on, once you buy produce up to a certain amount, Shoprite automatically covers your healthcare for that month.\u201d\n\nA customer who meets the requirements is automatically covered for that month, without having to change their lifestyle or their spend.\n\nSince its inception 4 months ago, over 7000 lives and 500 businesses actively use roHealth for making their health coverage decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Coverage by Techpoint Africa Looking to promote your industry event?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Amirah graduated from the Obafemi Awolowo University, she found it difficult to get a job despite her second class upper grade in economics. Six months into her search, she was getting frustrated. While hanging out with friends, one suggested that she start a tailoring business. As a student, she had made most of her dresses and even made some for her friends.\n\nThey were confident she could build a business out of her skill. But there was a problem. She needed to get a sewing machine but had burnt through her savings during her job search. She could ask her friends for a loan, but like her, they were also broke.\n\nWhile this is a fictional story, it paints a picture of numerous people in emerging markets like Nigeria. For Amirah, she could take out a loan, but only a few financial institutions would offer her one.\n\nAccess to credit is crucial for the growth of an economy. It gives access to consumers who would otherwise have been unable to afford certain products. However, no one gives out loans for fun. Financial institutions need to get these loans back with interest after a certain period and without a good enough guarantee of that, they will desist from granting these loans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat has been the case in Nigeria, where commercial banks have shied away from granting loans to most people but instead focused on a few high net worth individuals. In the past few years, fintech startups like Carbon and FairMoney have sprung up looking to solve this problem using proprietary technology.\n\nWhile some focus on lending, others embed it as a part of their service offerings. Still, one similarity is their use of technology to determine the creditworthiness of customers before granting loans.\n\nImproving access to credit for underserved markets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot all organisations have this capability, and this is where Periculum believes it has found its sweet spot. Like many Nigerians have done in the past few years, Michael Temitope Collins moved to Canada for his university education, where he studied business administration and management at Thompson Rivers University.\n\nAfter graduation, he worked at a couple of Canadian banks and started a few businesses himself. While working at these banks, he researched and discovered many underserved customers, even in Canada.\n\n\u201cI started out working in the bank and discovered that we have many underserved customers, so I decided to do some research.\n\n\u201cI realised that even in Canada, there\u2019s a pretty significant number of people that are underserved by the financial system. When you scale that out to emerging markets like Africa, Latin America, and South-east Asia, that number of underserved individuals is a lot higher.\u201d\n\nHis research also showed that one reason for the problem was the inability of financial institutions to assess individuals and their creditworthiness accurately. With this knowledge, he built a solution \u2014 Periculum \u2014 using existing financial and non-financial datasets.\n\nThe startup, launched in 2019, has seen some traction, getting into Techstars Toronto in 2021 and raising a pre-seed round of $620,000 from investors such as Loyal VC, First Fund, and White Hibiscus Capital, which Collins says exceeded their initial goal of $500k. Although the startup has clients across three continents \u2014 Africa, South America, and North America \u2014 it plans to focus on Nigeria in the interim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe plan now is to build out a separate entity in Nigeria and focus strictly on the Nigerian market. The Nigerian market is unique; it\u2019s not a market where you can operate remotely.\u201d\n\nIn pursuing this plan, the startup has hired Damilola Aluede as managing director to head its Nigerian division.\n\nAccess to credit facilities provides businesses and individuals with numerous benefits. Businesses can scale and unlock demand using credit like M-KOPA and Daystar Power do. On the part of the customers, they can access products and services that were previously out of reach.\n\nHowever, getting credit is difficult for both individuals and businesses in Nigeria. According to Business Day, seven in ten bank customers in Nigeria lack access to credit. In the same vein, only 4% of micro, small, and medium enterprises in the country have access to credit. Therefore, providing a way for banks and lending institutions to assess creditworthiness will increase access.\n\nThe startup has also signed up a few customers in Nigeria, including Lendaba, Sycamore, Golden Ox Partners, Vola Africa, Venero, and Fundii. It also has a working arrangement with API fintech, Mono.\n\nChallenges with data collection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing technology to predict the creditworthiness of a customer is great in theory. However, doing this requires data that is notoriously hard to collect in Nigeria. Unsurprisingly, Collins points out that this is their biggest challenge.\n\n\u201cThe ability to get good data sources is a big challenge in Nigeria. A lot of our data partners have specific customers, so their customers are just a small group of customers compared to the whole. So the challenge now is for us to try and find different ways to get data or the ability to assess the creditworthiness of the large majority that are not involved in the economy.\u201d\n\nTo solve this problem, Collins discloses that Periculum will be making use of existing data such as the NIN and BVN for customers who are already involved in the economy. For those who are not, the plan is to draw on data from mobile transactions.\n\nBusiness model and key differentiator\n\nPericulum can make money in two major ways \u2014 a credit analytics and data analytics service to businesses. Consequently, the startup can charge its customers for API calls or a subscription fee.\n\nPericulum is not the only African startup trying to solve this problem. In addition to the lending startups mentioned above, there is also Toju and CARMA. However, Collins believes that their data analytics solution gives them the edge over their competitors.\n\n\u201cA lot of our competitors do one thing, maybe a couple of things, but we do multiple things. We don\u2019t just provide a credit scoring system; we do a lot of data analytics as well. In fact, our core business proposition is data analysis.\u201d\n\nAs the government and private sector work to improve the economy, increasing access to credit facilities for individuals and businesses will be key. However, challenges such as a lack of uniformity in data collection remain, and startups that can work around them could be successful while unlocking pathways to wealth for more Nigerians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "title": "There\u2019s more to crypto than buying low and selling high",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November 2021, Bitcoin was at an all-time high (ATH) of $68,000; it was definitely a great time to be in crypto. At times like that, crypto traders and evangelists seize every opportunity to remind everyone who isn\u2019t into crypto trading what they are missing.\n\nHowever, it is a different story on the crypto streets as Bitcoin is bleeding out. The flagship crypto has lost almost half of what it gained during the ATH of 2021, and the charts remain crimson red.\n\nThe continuous nosedive has wiped out $1 trillion from the total market cap of cryptocurrencies.\n\nFor those who are not new to the extreme volatility that comes with trading or hodling crypto, the current decline is just one of those things. For Ruth Iselema, Founder and CEO of crypto exchange, Bitmama, the current dip in crypto prices isn\u2019t so much of a bother.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIselema revealed this at Techpoint Build 2021 while speaking on the topic, Crypto beyond trading. She touched on other use cases of cryptocurrencies besides trading and how they could be very important to finance in Africa.\n\nThere\u2019s more to crypto than trading\n\nCryptocurrencies are used primarily for speculative purposes, buying low and selling high, but they weren\u2019t originally created for speculation. According to the white paper by Bitcoin\u2019s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, the essence of Bitcoin is to provide a \u201csystem for electronic transactions without relying on trust.\u201d\n\nToday, Bitcoin trading is more or less a career path for some, an edge against inflation and the light at the end of the poverty tunnel. According to Iselema, cryptocurrencies are viewed this way, especially in Africa, because of the high poverty rate.\n\nAround 40% of Africa\u2019s population \u2014 1.3 billion \u2014 lives in extreme poverty, making crypto trading a very attractive venture. Iselema also pointed out that crypto trading is more popular among other use cases because of the complexities of using cryptocurrencies.\n\nBringing crypto into regular finance\n\nFrom lending, insurance, and exchange of value, cryptocurrencies have other use cases beyond trading. All these are classified under decentralised finance (DeFi), financial activities performed on decentralised networks.\n\nWhen it comes to alternative use of cryptocurrencies, DeFi paints a very vivid picture. It allows crypto to perform the same function as traditional financial institutions with fiat currencies, but, of course, without the need for those institutions.\n\nHow does this work?\n\nThe goal of DeFi is to create a financial system without third parties. It does this through decentralised peer-to-peer networks. This means anyone without an Internet connection can lend, trade, and borrow without the usual documentation in centralised finance.\n\nThere are several DeFi protocols such as Compound that provide crypto lending and borrowing services. People who have crypto will make it available to those who want to borrow. Collateral can be provided in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or other crypto assets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmart contracts are an essential part of DeFi as they ensure that every party holds up its end of the bargain. As opposed to lending apps that hassle borrowers after they default on payment, smart contracts immediately carry out the action that was agreed upon if the borrower defaults on payment.\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are also another interesting use case for crypto. From buying valuable art or music to creating one, NFTs have been a life-changer for Africans and many across the globe.\n\nThere\u2019s still a high barrier\n\nWhile these use cases seem simple enough on the surface, there is a high educational barrier to using them. According to blockchain research tool, Dune Analytics, there are 4 million unique DeFi addresses as of January 2022.\n\nIt is important to note that one person can have up to 10 addresses, and the actual users of DeFi protocols could be less than half of the number of existing addresses. This means that not even a fraction of the global population uses DeFi protocols.\n\nWhile Africa might be the home of peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions, it\u2019s still behind in alternative crypto usage such as DeFi. In Statista\u2018s ranking of 20 countries with the most DeFi interactions, only one African country \u2014 Togo \u2014 made the list, ranking 20th.\n\nThis can be owed to the fact that many DeFi platforms are complicated and expensive to use. Blockchain expert Oluchi Enebeli believes that the blockchain space is still largely composed of engineers and developers who do not pay much attention to design and simplicity.\n\nAlthough they\u2019ve been touted as the path to financial freedom, crypto usage can be very costly, thus creating a financial barrier. Transactions on the Ethereum network, the most popular network for alternative crypto usage, cost a lot. For context, transaction costs could be higher than the value of the transaction.\n\nWhile there are new networks, Solana and Polygon, for instance, springing up and reducing the cost of crypto usage, only time will tell if alternative crypto usage will catch on in Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

As supply remains constrained, a chorus of Wall Street banks and oil executives are forecasting a return to $100 oil.\n\nAdditionally, heightened geopolitical risks driven by fears that Russia may invade Ukraine have also contributed to crude\u2019s climb.\n\n\u201cDemand has been strong, supply has been struggling a little bit to keep up with that and that\u2019s reflected in the market,\u201d said Chevron Corp.\n\nChief Executive Officer Mike Wirth on Bloomberg TV.

          "text": "Yam tuber, maize, beans, and plantain are some of the food items that gulped the most incomes of Nigerians in 2021 as they recorded the highest increase in prices, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nYam tubers rose the most with a 59.9 percent increase on the average last year while white maize, brown maize, mudfish, white beans, and unripe plantain jumped 57.7 percent, 55.5 percent, 40.9 percent, 39 percent and 30.6 percent respectively.\n\nThe rising food prices only put more burden on Nigeria\u2019s poor population already struggling with stagnant income and deteriorating standard of living, according to experts.\n\nAccording to the 2019 survey NBS, the total household expenditure in Nigeria is N40 trillion out of which N22.7 trillion is spent on food alone.\n\nA 2021 report by the Institute of Development Studies has revealed that food consumes about 101 percent of the average wages of Nigerians and the country ranks second globally where citizens spend almost all their income on food.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s middle-class is increasingly disappearing. If you juxtapose the sustained drive in the prices of food and other commodities with stagnant income or most cases disappearance in income, you will see that the standard of living of many Nigerians has deteriorated,\u201d said Ayorinde Akinloye, a research analyst at United Capital Plc.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, 40 percent of Nigeria\u2019s total population, or almost 83 million people, live below the country\u2019s poverty line of N137,430 ($381.75) per year.\n\nRead Also: Christmas meal rises most in 10yrs on surging food prices\n\nThe pandemic also has pushed an additional 11 million Nigerians into poverty, according to the World Bank.\n\nThe Bank also revealed that inflation has pushed 8 million more Nigerians into poverty between 2020 and 2021.\n\nNigeria\u2019s headline inflation which has been on the decline for eight months saw a sudden spike in December 2021 to 15.63 percent from 15.40 in November 2021 on the back of increased demand during the festive period.\n\n\u201cThe rise in food inflation came on the back of huge demand during the festive season and insecurity in the food-producing areas as 15 states recorded higher food inflation rates in December 2021,\u201d said Ayodeji Ebo, Head, Retail Investment, Chapel Hill Denham.\n\nPlateau, Nasarawa and Benue are some of the worst-hit states by the herder-farmer crisis.\n\nFemi Oke, chairman of the All Farmers Association of Nigerian (AFAN) Lagos State chapter, explained that the major reason for the increase in the price of food is insecurity.\n\nHe explained that most of the farmers hardly go to the farm anymore because of these herdsmen and bandits\u2019 issues.\n\nIn the first monetary policy committee meeting of the year, the Governor of the CBN, Godwin Emefiele stated the surge in food prices is as a result of logistics problems particularly transport as there is a wide disparity between the low prices at the Farmgate and high prices at the marketplace.\n\nIn December 2021 specifically, white beans, brown beans, yam tuber, palm oil and vegetable oil were also the food items that accounted for the highest increase in food inflation, the same items when the average for the year was taken.\n\nMuda Yusuf, the immediate past director-general of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) said although the Government has been doing a lot especially around CBN financing for agriculture, the rise in food prices signals that more has to be done.\n\n\u201cWe need to deal with the entire value chain, the issues of insecurity and transportation are crucial issues which need to be urgently addressed,\u201d Yusuf pointed out.\n\nThe Global Hunger Index report ranks Nigeria 103rd of 116 countries with the hungriest people, indicating that hunger is severe in the country and may become alarming if nothing is done about this urgently.",

          "title": "How economy, security, zoning will dominate debate ahead 2023",
          "text": "As aspirants for the position of the president are moving from one part of the country to the other, making wide consultations, analysts say the three key areas that will play a key role in the decision by the electorate would be what the aspirants would say on the economy and security issues.\n\nAccording to them, the zoning issue is also expected to come into play as many Nigerians are looking forward to seeing how the knotty issue would be resolved.\n\nNigeria\u2019s economy has been in the doldrums and the quality of life in the country has trended so low that the country is now being described as the poverty headquarters of the world.\n\nSecurity issue has also become one of the serious challenges of the current administration and Nigerians would want to know how the aspirants would combat that.\n\nAs usual, the politicians will be in their element to woo the electorate for their votes.\n\nBut considering the failure to fulfill election promises in the past, and especially, the maladministration of the present administration, many wonder what else politicians will promise for 2023.\n\nThe scenario is worsened by the fact that no government since the return to civil rule in 1999 has achieved up to 40 percent of the promises in its manifesto, according Transparency International.\n\nAs expected, the 2023 election is likely going to be a bit different from the past elections as the electorate who have suffered several disappointments from politicians and are daily weighed down by the burden of economic hardship, especially in recent times, are waiting to hear the content of manifestos across the parties for the 2023 election.\n\nFor Sam Ajanaku Onikoyi, a Nigerian historian and Commonwealth researcher based in Brussels, Belgium, Nigerians should be the ones setting the agenda for politicians and determining the content of the manifestos, and not the usual way that has not yielded fruits since 1999.\n\nHe argued that the people are the ones suffering, they are ones who know where it is paining them most and should tell politicians what they want and not otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe politicians always woo us with sweet stories during campaigns, but even deny saying so months after. Now, the people should present what they want as legal documents and hand them over to the politicians during their campaign and hold them accountable. That is what is obtainable in Europe and also the way to go in 2023 if Nigerians wants change,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Commonwealth researcher warned that no matter the content of the manifesto, who presented it, or who is promising it, success can only come when the electorates pressurise politicians to fulfill their promises, hold them accountable, and take action when they failed after warning them.\n\n\u201cDemocracy allows for the passing of \u2018vote of confidence\u2019 and lastly, recalling of elected political office holders who are not doing well. Why are Nigerians not doing so, yet they complain. A governor can be impeached, president impeached and others can be sacked by the electorates, but those accused of not performing are still in the office. That should stop in 2023 by making sure any of those non-performing politicians do not even smell party primaries\u201d, he suggested.\n\nChijioke .J. Umelahi, an Abuja-based lawyer and former Abia State lawmaker, shared the same views with Onikoyi but added that power is in the hands of the electorate to determine the content of the manifesto for 2023.\n\n\u201cThe electorate should understand that political power is taken and not given. So, if their votes will determine who gets what, they should see themselves as kingmakers and insist on conditions for making kings among which is the manifesto that favours them and assurance of their fulfillment from the politicians and penalty as well,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, the former lawmaker, who hopes to seek an elective position in 2023, disclosed that he would want to probe security chiefs as top of the manifesto for 2023 because the country has been wasting money in fighting insecurity without result.\n\n\u201cIf you probe security chiefs, you will discover how the security funds were shared because if they were used for the reason they were allocated, Boko Haram or bandits would have been a thing of the past\u201d, he said.\n\nSpeaking further, he noted that if the government through reformed security apparatus can secure Nigeria, the economy will pick up and the masses will smile after a long time of being in despair.\n\nLooking at the growing hardship in the land, Anike Daramola, a dentist at the Federal Dental Centre, Marina, Lagos, said that government should spell out how it is going to revive the economy, the step by step approach, time limit, and updates on the project in order to give people opportunity to hold them accountable.\n\n\u201cHave you heard of how expensive things are in the market, do you know how many people that are dying every hour in Nigerian hospitals because the relations cannot afford exorbitant medical bills, people are not scared of covid-19 because the situation is worse than the pandemic? Truly, the situation out there is worse and the masses are suffering it. So, reviving the economy should top the manifesto content\u201d, she said.\n\nPart of the economic revival content of the manifesto for 2023, according to the dentist, is encouraging SMEs, which are the engine of economic growth across the world.\n\n\u201cThere are no soft loans, bank interest rates are over 25 percent, the government is introducing new taxes on the many existing ones, inflation is not helping and SMEs staff are intimidated, especially in Lagos by the taskforce, all these stifle their growth and the economy as well\u201d, she said.\n\nWith these challenges, she noted that reviving the economy would only be possible if the government put incentives for SMEs as part of its manifestos for 2023.\n\nBut Luke Onwuka, an Ahuda, River State-based, mechanical engineer and oil worker, said that government should put \u2018no more foreign loans\u2019 as part of the 2023 manifesto.\n\n\u201cWe have borrowed more than foreign lenders can loan out and that is mortgaging the future of the country. Let\u2019s look inwards in 2023 because all the loans are not used for the projects government claimed they are meant for, the growing infrastructure gap says it all\u201d, he said.\n\nHe further argued that with all the money in River State, Delta and Bayelsa, the Federal Government still claim to e financing projects there, what happens to the allocations, NDDC, Niger Delta Commission, and others he described as a conduit pipe for stealing public funds.\n\nHe also said that there should be no mention of fighting corruption in the 2023 manifesto as such will be making further mockery on the intelligence of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFighting corruption should have been top in the manifesto for 2023, but the present administration said it would tackle corruption in both the 2015 and 2019 campaign manifesto, but it failed. I don\u2019t see any APC candidate fighting corruption. We should suspend the fight until we get serious with the fight,\u201d he said.\n\nRead also: State of economy seen driving voter turnout in 2023\n\nAdanna Olekanma, a mother of three and school proprietress, decried the falling standard of education and wants quality education as top among the contents of the manifesto. But she feared that the federal government, which she accused of killing education in the country, would not look the way of education.\n\n\u201cGovernment should give education priority by raising JAMB cut-off mark to where it was before. We cannot all be intelligent at the same level and will not sacrifice the future because we want some to catch up. So, education should be top on manifestos for 2023,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Bulus Jonah, a retired banker from Plateau State, thinks that the manifesto cannot make sense if the parties are not going to institute equity and fairness in the selection of their presidential candidates.\n\nHe argues that a rotational presidency should be key in the manifesto for 2023.\n\n\u201cI know that power is taken and not given, but the political class should listen to cries for the rotational presidency to ensure equity, fairness and sense of belonging for every Nigerian. As it stands, no Tiv man, Birom, Idoma, Kanuri, Southern Kaduna, Isoko, Urhobo, among other minorities will become Nigerian president because they will not pull enough influence or votes to become president. Look at what is happening to the Igbos after helping to build the country and you don\u2019t want them to be president,\u201d he lamented.\n\nThinking the same line, Umelahi disclosed that many people who think their region is disfranchised will not vote for the 2023 election, hence making nonsense of the manifesto.\n\n\u201cIf you can be voted for and I cannot be voted for, that is unfair and you don\u2019t expect me to queue to vote for you when my interest is not covered. So, no matter what you are promising to a disenfranchised person, what he wants to hear is it is your turn and I will support you,\u201d the former lawmaker said.\n\nWell, many think that addressing insecurity, state police, erratic electricity power supply, multiple taxations, restructuring, devaluation of naira, diversification of the economy, poor quality of healthcare and education, corruption, curbing nepotism which is at its height now, among others should be the content of the manifesto for 2023 general election.",

The event commemorated a civilian-led peace agreement made between the Islam and Catholic communities in Mindanao 8 years ago.\n\nBack in 2014, Heavenly Culture, World Peace, Restoration of Light (HWPL), an international NGO mediated the conflict in Mindanao by proposing a peace agreement by local representatives. Witnessed by Chairman Man Hee Lee of HWPL, the peace agreement was signed by Hon. Esmael G. Mangudadatu, the then Governor of Maguindanao, and Archbishop-Emeritus Fernando Capalla of the Archdiocese of Davao representing local leadership. Since then, the province of Maguindanao and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) declared January 24 as \u201cHWPL Peace Day\u201d and have commemorated it as annual event to reaffirm international cooperation and local partnership for peacebuilding in Mindanao.\n\nMoreover, peace monuments were built honoring the peace agreement in Mindanao. The 1st and 2nd Peace Monuments were erected in 2015 and 2016 respectively. In 2021, the third peace monument was unveiled in Cotabato City. Being the first in Luzon, a peace monument in Dingras, Ilocos Norte was unveiled last January 24 as part of the 8th Anniversary event of the HWPL Peace Day celebration. Also, another monument located in Siniloan Integrated National High School is set to unveil on February.\n\nThe event, under the theme of \u201cLaw of Peace in Heaven and on Earth\u201d, aimed to promote interfaith harmony between religions and raise public support to establish international law for peace.\n\nKey figures gave congratulatory messages including Senate President Vicente Sotto III, Senator Panfilo Lacson, Senator Cynthia Villar, Senator Ronald \u2018Bato\u2019 Dela Rosa, Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo, and TV News Anchor Mariz Umali from the Philippines. Keynote speakers from various fields also presented commitment messages declaring their plans on promoting peace in their respective sectors including law, education, youth, women, private business and media.\n\nPrabhu Mahendra Das, Temple President of Sri Sri Radha Madhava Mandir, said that he decided to participate in the World Alliance of Religions\u2019 Peace (WARP) Office organized by HWPL as \u201ca global platform for religious leaders to talk, share, discuss, learn, and grow together harmoniously and peacefully.\u201d For the contribution to peace in the field of religion, he added, \u201cI firmly believe that all religions should enter into a partnership through the form of a Memorandum of Understanding.\u201d\n\nJustice Raoul Victorino (ret), Chairman of Philippine National Prayer Breakfast (PNPB) and Dean of the College of Law of Philippine Christian University (PCU), shared how he was inspired by the \u201crevolutionary movement\u201d that HWPL initiated to endorse global peacebuilding through the draft the \u201cDeclaration of Peace and Cessation of War (DPCW)\u201d by global experts in international law to advocate peace as a global culture and norm. He declared, \u201cI will strive to get the support of the President of the Philippines for the National Solidarity Support of DPCW. At the same time, I will integrate DPCW [education] in the college of law by collaborating with the Philippine Association of Law Schools.\u201d\n\nAlso, representing the Philippines education sector, Commissioner Ronald Adamat of the Commissioner on Higher Education (CHED) shared, \u201cThe CHED Commission en Banc has issued an endorsement to President Duterte, urging him to declare January 24 as \u2018National Peace Day\u2019, that will provide for simultaneous celebration and observance of peace through peace activities, events, and ceremonies by all instrumentalities and agencies of government, including the private sector. This shall also be celebrated and observed in the education sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur purpose is to bring all people in the world together to create a world of peace and leave it as a lasting legacy for future generations. To make this world a peaceful place without wars, let us become messengers of peace. Let us remind people around the world of that emotion\u2014a longing for peace\u2014and the Peace Day so they can remember all of this forever,\u201d said Chairman Lee during the closing remarks.\n\n[8th Anniversary of the January 24 HWPL Peace Day] \u201cLaw of Peace in Heaven and Earth\u201d\n\nhttps://youtu.be/PtBogiRkfFo\n\n...",

The defendants, their agents, servants are perpetually restrained from selling, erecting building or doing anything on the land.\n\n\u201cAnd a damage of N2.5 million is hereby awarded against the defendants (Ukhiri ) and in favour of the claimants (Ulegun)\u201d, the court ruled.\n\nJustice Edigin who averred that the court does not have jurisdiction to sit on appeal over the ruling of the Supreme court.\n\nEdigin, maintained that it would amount to judicial rascality and also dismissed the counter claims of the defendants.\n\nHowever, not satisfied with the judgement of the trial court, Ukhiri approached the appellant court to seek amongst others the up turning of the decision of trial court while Ulegun in a cross appeal also approached the court for possible review of the earlier N2.5 million Naira damages against Ukhiri.\n\nRecall that Ukhiri had on 1976 dragged Ulegun to court alleging encroachment of a portion of its land by Ulegun.\n\nAt the lower court, the court observed that the survey plan tendered by Ukhiri as exhibit A was in agreement with that of Ulegun contrary to what they (Ukhiri people) were claiming, hence judgement was entered against Ukhiri and in favour of Ulegun.\n\nThe case was again struck out at the Appeal Court for lack of merit along with cost awarded against the appellants over damages and trespass.\n\nNot satisfied with the judgements, Ukhiri village approached the Supreme court on ground that the defendants (Ulegun) only defended their claim in 1976 but did not counter claim.\n\nAfter hearing, the apex court upheld the decision of the lower courts and extinguished the appellants\u2019 claim to all the parcel of lands situated on the Benin Abraka road, Ikpoba Okha local government area by the Ukhiri community.\n\nThis prompted the Ulegun community to seek legal service of Ferdinand Orbih (SAN) and Co. to seek declarative reliefs which were granted by Justice Esther Edigin rtd, in 2018.\n\nAddressing newsmen shortly after the judgements, delivered via Zoom, Counsel to Ulegun Village, Anderson Uwadiae Asemota (Esq), hailed the judgement, declaring that the judiciary remains the last hope of the common man.\n\nHe said with the alleged influence wielded by Ukhiri community, Ulegun would have lost the case, describing the judgement as victory for democracy.\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nLAGOS \u2013 The Association of Nigeria Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA) has described the recent revenue target of N4.1 billion by the Federal Government on the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) for 2022, as a high target that will put undue pressure on the agency.\n\nFaulting the Federal Government decision on the exorbrant target, ANLCA posited that the target would also undermine its core responsibility of facilitating trade between Nigeria and other countries.\n\nThe Association President, Hon. Tony Iju Nwabunike stated this in Lagos recently during a press briefing to celebrate the four years of his executives on the leadership of the foremost freight forwarding association in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cPursuing bigger revenue and failing to strengthen trade results in greater losses to the economy as investments are either threatened, reduced or made non existent.\u201d\n\nHe also said that totality of customs efforts deployed into revenue pursuit reduces the service\u2019s productivity in many ways\u201d, Nwabunike stated.\n\nWhile appealing President Muhammadu Buhari and the Minister of Finance not to sign the proposed $3.1 billion the customs modernisation contract, Nwabunike said that it would tie down the NCS to a 20 year debt repayment programme that is not necessary for the country which is already contending with huge foreign and domistic debts that are gulping over 85 per cent of the nation\u2019s annual revenue.\n\nNwabunike said: \u201cWe want to also advise the Federal Government to be careful before signing into the $3.1 billion Customs Modernisation Project which we heard, will run for 20 years.\n\nWe urge President Muhammadu Buhari and the Finance Minister to avoid assenting to the deal, saying \u201cNigeria is already in serious debts and customs being a strategic non-oil revenue earner for government shouldn\u2019t be tied to another long term debt repayment for two decades.\n\n\u201cOn this, we call on the National Assembly to take a closer look at the details and ensure that the Federal Ministry of Finance, Nigeria Customs Service and all parties involved observe due diligence that won\u2019t entrap the country in another long term debt repayment for 20 years and maybe for lesser value,\u201d he said.\n\nHe commended the Federal Government for its recent inauguration of an expanded partnership committee on blue economy chaired by the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, saying its a very bold step in the right direction.\n\n\u201cFor us, this shows more commitment by the Buhari administration to maritime matters. We urge the committee to go beyond conference room talk and paperwork to addressing real challenges militating against full harvesting of our marine environment benefits in a sustainable manner.\u201d\n\nNwabunike also called on Federal Government to ensure that it includes the ANLCA in some of its committees, saying \u201cAs a body of Customs Brokers, practitioners and investors,\u201d they have vast experience in trade matters\u201d.\n\n...",

          "text": "The Buhari administration and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) remain committed to the welfare of the common man because it is a party of the people and will continually ensure that the common man benefits maximally from government, says Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN.\n\nProf. Osinbajo stated this on Friday when he received on a courtesy call, a delegation of the APC Professionals Forum at the State House, Abuja.\n\n\u201cThis is a party of the common man, a party of the people, a party that takes as its cradle, the importance of ensuring that the common man benefits maximally from government which is why we have the big programmes like the Social Investment Programmes, the largest if its kind in the continent and several of such other programmes that emphasize how serious we take the lot of the common man,\u201d the Vice President in a statement by his media aide, Laolu Akande said.\n\nWhile it was formed about nine years ago, the VP noted that the party has made an impact and was determined to improve the wellbeing of Nigerians.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAdding that the party is also \u201cwhere many young people are,\u201d the VP said: \u201cWe are the ruling party in Africa\u2019s largest democracy which by itself is a phenomenal achievement for such a young party.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ll find that in the particular ideological direction of our party, it\u2019s one that it was clear to the original founders of the party, the initial persons and groups that came together to form the party and they came from different parties, but it was to present a left of centre, a social democratic alternative to the ruling part.\u201d\n\nProf. Osinbajo further stated that the APC is determined to ensure the country\u2019s further growth and development, noting that the party \u201ccarries with it, the hopes and expectations of millions of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe party is not a mere platform for running for political office, it carries with it the hopes and expectations of millions of Nigerians and we must make it a place where they are comfortable, a place where they feel this belongs to us. We can even put our resources into it; it is not just for politicians; it is for us all.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe VP said leaders and politicians are there to serve the people and give them reasons to believe in a better country.\n\n\u201cOur people, the Nigerian people, need hope; they need to be able to believe in the politicians; they need to be able to believe in their leaders and if the leaders are within the political party, that political party must have an ideology that is attractive to them, that makes them feel wanted, that makes them feel cared for and I think that role is so crucial.\n\n\u201cIt is the role this Professional Forum must take on to itself. And what it entails aside from that logical objective of the forum; what it entails is actually defining in writing in various ways what our party stands for.\u201d\n\nAcknowledging the significance of the APC Professionals Forum in the scheme of things, the Vice President urged the Forum to play more important roles in shaping the party\u2019s ideology.\n\n\u201cThere are many people that say well, we have not done this, we have not done that. There are so many ways of looking at it, but the truth of the matter is that the party was committed and is seen across the country as a party of the common man, which is why I think the role of the Professionals Forum is particularly important because we are trying to shape the ideology of the party,\u201d he said.\n\nThe VP stated that professionals are integral to ensuring the party stays focused on the wellbeing of Nigerians and its ideals, as stated in the Constitution and Manifesto respectively.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to him, \u201cif the professionals cannot do that, then our party becomes all comers, anything goes so long as we have a platform to run for political office. But I think that we, especially professionals, have a unique advantage.\n\n\u201cWe have many who have run their businesses, who have professional organizations or who have excelled in their own professions and we know that the only way to do things properly is if we are able to press on without relenting.\u201d\n\nProf. Osinbajo further hoped that the APC Professionals Forum will also carry the hopes and expectations of millions of the party\u2019s supporters nationwide.\n\nHe also believed that the Forum, made up of professional elites, will be of great benefit to the party and Nigeria because of its leadership and quality of professionals on its board of trustees and as members, who he noted \u201care not just politicians, but people who have distinguished themselves\u201d in their respective fields.\n\n\u201cI think our party will rely a great deal on this forum and I hope and pray that the Forum will realize all of its objectives, including the extra ones that our party must place upon you, especially at this time in the life and history of our dear country,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his remarks, former Governor of Bauchi State, Mallam Isa Yuguda, who is the Chairman, Board of Trustees of the Forum noted that professionals in the party felt the need to identify with the Vice President being himself a professional. He invited the VP to the Forum\u2019s upcoming event in Abuja next week.\n\nThe Forum\u2019s delegation also included Deputy Chairman, Board of Trustees and former APC National Secretary, Waziri Bulama; Board of Trustees Secretary, Barrister Dapo Akinosun, SAN, and the national coordinator, Akeem Akintayo.",
          "summary": "The Buhari administration and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) remain committed to the welfare of the common man because it is a party of the people and will continually ensure that the common man benefits maximally from government, says Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN.\nProf. Osinbajo stated this on Friday when he received on a courtesy call, a delegation of the APC Professionals Forum at the State House, Abuja.\nWhile it was formed about nine years ago, the VP noted that the party has made an impact and was determined to improve the wellbeing of Nigerians.\n\u201cThere are many people that say well, we have not done this, we have not done that.\nThe Forum\u2019s delegation also included Deputy Chairman, Board of Trustees and former APC National Secretary, Waziri Bulama; Board of Trustees Secretary, Barrister Dapo Akinosun, SAN, and the national coordinator, Akeem Akintayo.",

          "text": "Daniil Medvedev finds himself the man in the way of history once again as he takes on Rafael Nadal in the final of the Australian Open on Sunday.\n\nVictory for Nadal at Melbourne Park for the first time since 2009 would make him the first man ever to win a 21st grand slam title.\n\nIt will move him clear of Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic.\n\nNadal is the last of the trio to have a shot at 21.\n\nFederer missed two match-points against Djokovic in the Wimbledon final of 2019 before the Serbian had his chance at the US Open last year.\n\nDjokovic was also bidding to become the first man since 1969 to complete the calendar Grand Slam but Medvedev stopped him, claiming his first slam title in the process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great rivalry,\u201d said the Russian. \u201cI\u2019m happy to have the chance to try to stop one more time somebody from making history.\n\n\u201cI know what Rafa is going for, I knew what Novak was going for. I\u2019m not going to say, \u2018Oh, yeah, I am trying not to listen about this\u2019. But it\u2019s kind of their thing, not mine. I\u2019m just there to try to win the final.\u201d\n\nIn spite of their respective slam records, it is Nadal that is the surprise package in this one.\n\nHe just returned from a career-threatening foot problem to reach his first major final since the French Open in 2020.\n\nIt has been clear through the Spaniard\u2019s run just how much he has exceeded his own expectations, and he was in tears after beating Matteo Berrettini in the semi-finals.\n\nUnlike Djokovic, Nadal has always insisted he is not motivated by making history.\n\n\u201cI just feel happy to be part of this amazing era of tennis, sharing all these things with another two players,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it. In some ways it doesn\u2019t matter if somebody achieves one more or one less.\n\n\u201cWe did amazing things and things that will be very difficult to equal.

When I was eight, 10 years old, I was playing against the wall and I was imagining that it\u2019s Rafa on the other side, or Roger. Novak was still not yet there, I think.\n\n\u201cNow I have the chance to play (Nadal) a second time. First one was a close one, epic one.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to try to prepare well, and I need to show my best, because that\u2019s what I took out of the three finals that I had before, that you have to do better than 100 percent in order to win.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I managed to do in the US Open.

Governor Emmanuel who was leader of the 5-man PDP primary election committee in Ekiti State gave the admonition while fielding questions with Government House correspondents at the Victor Attah International Airport, Uyo, upon his return from the assignment.\n\nHe thanked the National Chairman and the National working Committee of PDP for an opportunity to serve the party, describing it as a privilege he cannot take for granted, expressing satisfaction with the integrity and conduct of the primary election.\n\nThe Governor who described the exercise as transparent, fair and credible, called on all participants in the contest to acknowledge the supremacy of the party and pull forces together to grab victory in the consequent general election as one party.\n\nHear him, \u201cI think personally I\u2019m satisfied that the process was credible and I also believe almost 100% of the people that watched it will give us credit that it was a very credible, transparent, free and fair election. My advice is, let all of them go back and work together. We have only one seat and only one person can occupy that seat. If after all what the party did at the NWC to accommodate all aspirants, the people then spoke and said this is the person we want to bear the flag of the party, I think all others should just join hands and work together. Party is supreme, let the party win then they can all sit down and talk\u201d.\n\nHe described as false and speculative, insinuations of unfair treatment and disenfranchisement of some aspirants, maintaining that the process was void of malpractices and created no room for expression of ill behaviours that would have given grounds to discredit the exercise.\n\nAccording to him, such insinuations were indications of pre-perceived defeat. He maintained that the committee had an authentic list from the National Working Committee which followed religiously, stressing that no single person voted that was not accredited and that there was none accredited that was not allowed to vote.\n\nIn his words, \u201cTalking about Ekiti gubernatorial primaries, I\u2019ve heard a whole lot; how some aspirants even before the process started, went to the press. \u2026I think they felt they knew the outcome even before we went into the election. \u2026Some of them came to make trouble but by the time they saw that there was no room for such trouble they knew there\u2019s no way they could have made it\u201d.\n\n\u201cAll the aspirants gave us a very excellent mark for all the processes: from accreditation to voting, to sorting, to counting, even to declaration of result. Even after that we gave them opportunity to speak of they were satisfied. We also had to make sure one of the international TV stations beamed it live so everybody could see the processes\u201d he added.\n\nThe Governor cationed the public to be wary of politician who promote violence as means to grab power and sued for peaceful politicking towards the 2023 polls.\n\nHear him, \u201cAs we go into 2023, people will give peace a chance. If you want to serve the people, you can\u2019t serve the people with a gun. Whoever carries a gun to serve is not going to serve the people but himself. If you want to serve the people and you don\u2019t want peace, there is an undertone we don\u2019t know. I think we need to unravel that and question your real intensions.\u201d\n\nThe Ekiti PDP Guber primaries which was keenly contested by twelve apirants had Hon. Bisi Kolawale emerging as winner with 671, edging out his immediate runner up, Segun Oni, who scored 330. Bisi Kolawale is a former member of the National Assembly 2007-2011, served as Environment Commissioner in Fayose\u2019s administration among other political offices held.\n\nSignificantly, all the aspirants who participated in the primaries have all congratulated the winner and pledged to work for the success of the PDP in the forthcoming Ekiti Governorship election.",

          "text": "Northern youths under the aegis of the Arewa Youth Assembly have called on successful entrepreneurs in various sectors of the private economy to join the 2023 presidential race.\n\nThe group is a statement urged the entrepreneurs who are notable for successful records in their industry to join the race and use their wealth of experience to move the country forward.\n\nREAD ALSO: Why APC Is A Party Of The Common Man \u2013 Osinbajo\n\n\u201cA country like Nigeria that has great and intelligent minds with positive reputations all over the world, the likes of Mrs Ngozi Okonjo Iweala, Mrs Ibukun Awosika, Mr Bode Augusto, Mr Segun Agbaje, Mr Fola Adeola, Alhaji Tunde Folawiyo, Mr Atedo Peterside, Mr Kola Adesina, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, Mr Femi Otedola, Mr Mike Adenuga, Mr Akinwumi Adesina, Mr Herbert Wigwe and Mr Aig Imoukhuede who are boardroom Czars with a vast wealth of knowledge on entrepreneurship, why let Nigeria be run by others who lack such knowledge.\n\n\u201cAn entrepreneur that can grow wealth, bear risk in such conditions found in Nigeria surely is suited to better the fortunes too of the nation,\u201d the youths said.\n\nThey added that Nigeria will flourish under such a person, our economy will grow as he or she, is already an employer of labour, and will create employment on a level playing ground for businesses to grow.\n\nSee full statement by the youths below\u2026\n\nIt is the norm, just a few months to the general elections on which the faith of producing the next president, and of course another set of new leaders is placed upon us, the drums of campaigns shall be beating to make the biggest music. Another election season and the whole country turns into an atmosphere of advertisement for different candidates from different political parties.\n\nFellow compatriots, for a better choice of a new leader, we need to trace back and understand our root as a country in other to avoid repeating mistakes made in the past.\n\nAt the point of exit for the colonial masters, the Sovereign entity known as Nigeria was placed into the hands of our founding fathers. The very hard-working civilians who fought to globally move the country forward, having it placed in organisations like the common wealth. A few years later, these founding fathers were ousted in a bloody military coup that caused the lives of so many, including some of the founding fathers on the bases of corruption, inequality in distribution of resources, and suffering of the masses. The military had their run, from one coup to another, but the status quo never got better.\n\nThe Shehu Shagari\u2019s administration was a civilian regime that came in between military coups, probably the reason why he was himself thrown out of office by the same officers on similar accounts of corruption and suffering of the masses.\n\nAfter the death of the former head of state Gen. Sani Abacha, we finally had the most peaceful transition of power that saw the return of democracy led by Gen Abdulsalami Abubakar, a transition that will turn out to be Nigeria\u2019s longest shot at democracy to date since its independence.\n\nIt was expected that things will get better, Nigeria was set to thrive on a peaceful ground, a safe breathing atmosphere with a lot of opportunities, promises and hopes for not only it\u2019s masses but those of other African countries.\n\nUnfortunately, Nigeria is still enslaved in the shackles of corruption, poor living condition for its masses, even faced with new set of challenges that were not found previously. What could be the problem? what have we done? where have we gotten it wrong? or are we just cursed like many Nigerians insinuate?\n\nNone of these things are true or even real. The truth of the matter is we lack in our previous leaders is a very important element that is key to the success of individuals amounting all together to the success of any nation that is keen to succeed which is ENTREPRENEURSHIP.\n\nMarrying leadership with entrepreneurship has been established as idiosyncratic, thus laying a solid foundation of competency, vision, skills for firm and effective leadership. The knowledge and experience an entrepreneur acquires from business exposes him to noting how government affects the private sector, which is the power source of economic growth that propels improvements in living standards of citizens.\n\nA country like Nigeria that has great and intelligent minds with positive reputations all over the world, the likes of Mrs Ngozi Okonjo Iweala, Mrs Ibukun Awosika, Mr Bode Augusto, Mr Segun Agbaje, Mr Fola Adeola, Alhaji Tunde Folawiyo, Mr Atedo Peterside, Mr Kola Adesina, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, Mr Femi Otedola, Mr Mike Adenuga, Mr Akinwumi Adesina, Mr Herbert Wigwe and Mr Aig Imoukhuede who are boardroom Czars with a vast wealth of knowledge on entrepreneurship, why let Nigeria be run by others who lack such knowledge.\n\nAn entrepreneur that can grow wealth, bear risk in such conditions found in Nigeria surely is suited to better the fortunes too of the nation.\n\nNigeria will flourish under such a person, our economy will grow as he or she, is already an employer of labour, and will create employment on a level playing ground for businesses to grow.\n\nThe presence of entrepreneurs in politics will serve as mediators between individuals with economic ideas and the body of Government responsible for making and implementing such policies to have a harmonious outcome pushing the country further economically.\n\nDear Nigerians, please this time around let it not be about rice, spaghetti, detergents, wrapper, or mere 1 thousand or 2 thousand handed out to you. The right person will make it possible for you to earn more than enough to buy these things, and much more, but also the sense of pride and dignity for being able to stand on your own and provide for yourself and family.\n\nLet it not be empty promises or the usual polarisation along religious and ethnic lines. Hunger and poverty know not your tribe or faith. Let\u2019s give the private sector and those that have shown the true capacity to build something sustainable, that has impacted lives and communities a try.\n\nLet your voice and vote speak about concerns for the economy because to have a permanent solution to the economic, security and political crises of this country, we must produce a candidate who has rich knowledge of entrepreneurship, greatly endowed with practical knowledge of the economy as equality begins with economic empowerment.\n\nWe are calling and pleading with the successful private sector players to join the 2023 presidential race, they need to stand up and be counted. Nigeria has given you much, we ask now that you come and be the stewards of our nation, not just a business. Come and rescue Nigeria from the shackle of poor leadership.\n\nMohammed Salihu Danlami\n\nSpeaker Arewa Youth Assembly\n\nHon.
