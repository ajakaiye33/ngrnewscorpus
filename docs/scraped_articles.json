          "text": "The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Thursday, received the Head of the ECOWAS Mediation Team, former President Goodluck Jonathan, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nJonathan seized the opportunity of the visit to brief Buhari about next Sunday\u2019s special meeting of ECOWAS, slated to hold in Ghana, which is meant to deliberate on the political situation in Mali.\n\nThis is according to a statement by the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, titled \u2018Mali: President Buhari receives briefing from former President Jonathan.\u2019\n\nBuhari reiterated his position that Nigeria\u2019s intervention in Mali\u2019s transition to democracy will be within the ambit of the ECOWAS.\n\nHours earlier, the President had pledged Nigeria\u2019s support to Mali as its transitional leadership works to restore the country to civilian rule.\n\nHe, however, made it clear that Nigeria\u2019s assistance will not go beyond the limits of the extant sanctions imposed on the country by the ECOWAS.\n\nBuhari spoke while receiving a special envoy from the Mali\u2019s transitional President, Col. Assimi Goita, Mali\u2019s Minister of Territorial Administration and Decentralisation, Col. Abdoulaye Maiga, who briefed the President on conclusions from the National Conference on State-Rebuilding held in Bamako between December 27 and 30, 2021.\n\nResponding to the briefing, the President said nobody could love Mali more than Malians themselves, counselling that everyone should work within the tenets of ECOWAS to restore constitutional order to the West African country at the shortest possible time.\n\n\u201cI am pleased you have briefed the ECOWAS Chairman too. Nigeria will work within ECOWAS limitations to assist Mali. Every country has its issues.\n\n\u201cWe fought our own Civil War before, so we may not know the totality of the internal politics of each country. But we will make as much sacrifice as we can for Mali, within ECOWAS requirements,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

But in the contest of this nature for one position, only one person can and will win.\n\n\u201cThe reality on ground is that Dr. John Elaigwu won. While some persons may not be too pleased with the process of the election, the truth is that the exercise was conducted in line with the existing Benue State chieftaincy law 2016.\n\n\u201cThough the law may not completely be in tandem with all aspects of the traditions and culture of the land, it is the law.\n\n\u201cAs law-abiding citizens, we must accept and abide by it.

          "text": "By Ugochukwu Alaribe, UMUAHIA\n\nRights activist, Saint Moses Ogbonna, has said that President Muhammadu Buhari may be afraid that the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, will return to the trenches if pardoned by the federal government.\n\nIn an interview with Vanguard, Ogbonna further stated that the President is not convinced that Kanu is remorseful over the activities leading to his arrest.\n\nHe urged the IPOB leader to stop behaving as if the President cannot do anything than pardoning him, because he is agitating for Biafra.\n\nOgbonna insisted that there may be a political solution which depends on the approach, stressing that the President is still on course on his promise to Chief Mbazuluike Amaechi.\n\nIn his words: \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari has power to pardon Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cBut does the President see Nnamdi Kanu as one who has shown remorse to change his ways if pardoned?\n\n\u201cI think Kanu should stop behaving in a way that suggests that the President can\u2019t do anything other than pardoning him since he is agitating for Biafra.\n\n\u201cBuahri\u2019s fear may be that if Nnamdi Kanu is pardoned, he will return to the trenches to continue the agitation.\n\n\u201cNnamdi Kanu\u2019s issue is beyond the ordinary political issue. The matter at hand is beyond ethnic.\n\n\u201cIt would have been a different thing if Kanu were agitating for Biafra under a body that is Biafra. But he has been doing so under a body called IPOB which is a registered organization that not all Biafrans belong to.\n\n\u201cA reasonable President will allow the court to continue to adjudicate over the matter and later take a decision.\n\n\u201cThis is more democratic than the President just asking the court to pardon him.\n\n\u201cSaying that he won\u2019t release Kanu doesn\u2019t mean that there can\u2019t be a political solution. Negotiations can still go on.\n\n\u201cAfter this, the court can be approached on the next step to his freedom.\n\n\u201cHowever, the problem has been that any move on negotiation may be laced with propaganda.

That really gives you more time.\n\n\u201cRegarding my age, I see my colleagues, they are now resting and I assure you that I\u2019m looking forward to the next 17 months when I too will have to be less busy. The age is telling on me, working now for 6, 7, 8 hours per day in the office is no joke.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Council, memos from as many states as possible to be considered virtually every week. So, really, it is a lot of hard work but like I said, I asked for it so I cannot complain\u201d.\n\nCommenting on the politics, the President said the opposition can muster the strength to grab power in 2023 if the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) fail to put its house in order.\n\nHis response during the interview came on the heels of whether the APC can put its house in order before its national convention.\n\nBuhari simply said the APC should learn from the fate that befell the PDP in the 2015 general elections.\n\nAccording to him, the PDP which was then the ruling party was so arrogant and never believed that opposition parties could unite and come together to contest the presidential election.\n\nHe added that by the time the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) and All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) merged, it was too late for the PDP to realise its mistake.\n\nHis words, \u201cWell, we have a time frame. We have to work because the four-year cycle is constitutional; it cannot be interfered by anybody. So, if the party cannot agree, then the opposition can take over\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat did the PDP do? They thought that the opposition cannot agree and come together.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has admitted that the long hours he spent working is telling on him because of his age, saying that he looks forward to the end of his tenure in 17 months to join his colleagues in retirement.\n\nHe stated his in an interview with a pre-recorded Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) aired on Thursday night.\n\nAsked how he felt clocking 79 recently, he said: \u201cYes, I think COVID-19 has come to my rescue in the sense that the amount of people that you need to see you, can\u2019t see you so that is losing no time.\n\n\u201cAnd about my age, yes, I see my colleagues, they are now resting and I assure you that I\u2019m looking forward to the next 17 months when I too would have to be less busy.\n\n\u201cThe age is telling on me, working now for 6,7,8 hours a day flight in the office is no joke. Questions of executive council memos from as many states as possible to be considered virtually every week. So, really it is a lot of hard work, but I asked for it and I cannot complain.\u201d\n\nThe president also said that he does not expect Nigerian to appreciate him when he leaves office but to realize that he has done his best.\n\nHe said: \u201cYes, because, look, as you know I have been a governor. I have been a minister and I\u2019m in my second term as President. So, I have gone through the system. And really, what else can I do with this country?\n\n\u201cI have given my best and I hope after I leave Nigerians will reflect and at least not show appreciation. I\u2019m not expecting any appreciation. But what I\u2019m expecting is for Nigerians to say yes, this man has done his best. This is the most I\u2019m expecting from Nigerians. But it\u2019s no joke. I\u2019m telling you.\n\n\u201cLook at the problem we\u2019re having in the southeast now. How many police stations were taken over, weapons missing. We closed the border with Benin, we closed the border with Niger. But we had to accept the reality that the weapons are coming from our own armories, police stations have been attacked and so on. So, the main problem is, I hope, i will leave a more secure Nigeria than what it is now.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari expressed optimism that the insecurity in the country can be resolved before he leaves office, noting that the security forces are working hard on it just as more equipment and ammunition are being procured.\n\nHe stated: \u201cYes, the government is capable and is going to do it because members of the security, the armed forces and others, they are all security it depends on one Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo no matter, when people are selfish, is their self first. So, even for their own selves, they better stabilize Nigeria and I believe they will do it.\n\n\u201cI know we\u2019re short on resources. For example, dealing with the militants, if people bother to reflect on how we found the northeast and south-south and how much progress we have made and acquiring some helicopters, aircraft, their maintenance, their ammunition, armored cars, you know to counter effectively, the bandits. They cost money and they cost time for training and adaptation.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari rejected the notion that corrupt politicians defect to the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) to escaped punishment, noting that as far as he is concerned such defections has not stopped his government\u2019s insistence on accountability.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nBuhari said: \u201cI don\u2019t like to accept that joining our party will check our insistence on accountability. We are very serious about people who aspire to lead at whatever level by their performance, by their integrity both professional and personal.\n\n\u201cBut the problem is that we have to work within the system. Even if you suspect individuals, unless there is evidence, there isn\u2019t much we can do. So, really, it is the system that makes it possible for some people really to even be corrupt.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed on whether the defectors will not be allowed to go free, he said: \u201cThey can\u2019t. Nobody can go scot free as far as I\u2019m concerned.\n\n\u201cImagine what the opposition could do to me if there is something along my record, a lot of confusion could have been caused.\n\n\u201cBut luckily I think we try to find officers with integrity and that is the best thing for Nigeria leadership at all levels. Behave with integrity. If that is done, we will achieve better results. If that is not done, a lot of time will be wasted in talking, quarreling and a lot of noise.\u201d\n\nThe president reiterated that he is not a kingmaker who will determine who becomes the next president.\n\nHe also noted that any governor that tries to impose a candidate on the people will face problems.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy position is simple, I think I succeeded in trying to get my position understood in the sense that I said, we start from bottom upwards; from polling units to wards, to local governments, to states and then to Abuja. So, the party, because I\u2019m concerned about my party, the party, in all constituents they will know their positions, coming up. Therefore, when they come to Abuja, they are likely to work together.\n\n\u201cThere is no kingmaker from Abuja, no constituency is being dictated to. All constituencies are supposed to produce their leadership in our party. What other parties are doing is their own business, but we want to make sure that our party members understand that they are respected. It is from polling unit, to ward to local government, to state and after Abuja. So those who want to be elected at any level, let them work for it. Nobody is going to appoint anybody.\u201d\n\nAsked if the current problem will be resolved and the convention will still go ahead, Buhari said: \u201cWe have timeframe we have to work because the four-year tenure is constitutional. It cannot be interfered by anybody. So, if the party couldn\u2019t agree, then the opposition can take over. What did the PDP do? They said the opposition could not come together, but when CAN, ANPP, CPC, APGA came together, before PDP realized it, they were off, they are still are still off, they can see it.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Sugar tax now on all non-alcoholic, carbonated beverages\n\n\u2022Plans fuel subsidy removal for second half of 2022\n\n\u2022Restates readiness to conduct national census\n\n\u2022FIRS generated N6.4trn in 2021\n\n\u2022Independent revenue collections surpassed N1trn last year\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos; Ndubuisi Francis and James Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday disclosed that henceforth it would charge offshore companies providing digital services to local customers in Nigeria a six per cent tax on turnover as provided in the 2021 Finance Act.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, disclosed this during the public presentation and breakdown of the 2022 budget held in Abuja.\n\nAlso, Ahmed disclosed that as of November 2021, the government had surpassed all collections for its independent revenues from 2017 to date, which according to her reflected the performance of government\u2019s revenue growth initiatives.\n\n\u201cWe have now for the first time surpassed the 1 trillion mark collection for independent revenues (N1.104tn) collected as at November against a budget target of 973.41bn). Analysts have always considered our projections unrealistic, but we have always insisted on the potentials that exist to grow FGN independent revenues,\u201d she revealed.\n\nSpeaking further on the tax on digital services, she explained that it includes apps, high frequency trading, electronic data storage and online advertising, adding that, \u201cthis is introducing turnover tax on a fair and reasonable basis.\u201d\n\nThe new policy is contained in Section 30 of the Finance Act which amended the provisions of Section 10, 31 and 14 on VAT obligations for non-resident digital companies.\n\nAhmed said, \u201cSection 30 of the Finance Act designed to amend section 10, 31 and 14 of VAT is in relations to VAT obligations for non-resident digital companies and the mechanism that will be used is to restrict VAT obligations mainly to digital non-resident companies who supply individuals in Nigeria who can\u2019t themselves self-account for VAT.\n\n\u201cSo if you visit Amazon, we are expecting Amazon to add VAT charge to whatever transaction you are paying for. I am using Amazon as an example. We are going to be working with Amazon to be registered as a tax agent for the FIRS.\n\n\u201cSo Amazon will now collect this payment and remit to FIRS and this is in line with global best practices, we have been missing out on this stream of revenue.\n\nAccording to her, the new law applies to foreign companies that provide digital services such as apps, high-frequency trading, electronic data storage, online and advertising, among others.\n\nShe noted that in line with Section 4 of the Finance Act, non-resident companies are now expected to pay tax at six per cent per cent on their turnover.\n\nThe minister who stated that the government was desirous of modernising taxes for its digital economy and to improve compliance, noted that digital non-resident companies do not need to be registered locally but would have an arrangement with the Federal Inland Revenue Services(FIRS) to collect and remit taxes in a bid to reduce the compliance burden.\n\nShe also disclosed that the federal government has introduced an excise duty of N10 per litre on all non-alcoholic, carbonated and sweetened beverages in the country.\n\nThe minister stated that the charge on beverages was also a new policy introduced in the Finance Act which was signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari on December 31, 2021, alongside the 2022 Appropriation Bill.\n\nThe minister pointed out that the new sugar tax was introduced to raise excise duties and revenues for health-related and other critical expenditures in line with the 2022 budget priorities.\n\nThe aimed according to her, was to also discourage excessive consumption of sugar in beverages, which contributed to diabetes, obesity and other diseases adding that the Finance Act had also raised excise duties and revenues for the health sector.\n\nShe also said that a provision had been made under the Act to reinforce the FIRS mandate as the principal tax collection agency while collaborating with other law enforcement Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs).\n\nSpeaking further, Ahmed expressed the preparedness of the federal government to conduct the national population and housing census, which was last held in Nigeria over 15 years ago.\n\nAhmed had in November last year disclosed that the sum of N178.09 billion had been approved for the national population census in the 2022 budget.\n\nThe minister disclosed that necessary budgetary allocation had been made and every machinery put in motion to conduct the exercise, adding that it was left for the National Population Commission (NPC) to draw up a timetable.\n\nAhmed also revealed that Nigeria\u2019s independent revenue surpassed the N1 trillion mark in 2021, due to the implementation of the 2020 Finance Act.\n\nOn fuel subsidy, the minister said as provided by the Petroleum Industry Act, all petroleum products must be deregulated.\n\nFlowing from this, she said subsidy was provided for subsidy up to June after which full deregulation comes on stream.\n\nThe minister stated that subsidy was provided up to June to allow ongoing consultations with various stakeholders, including organised labour to be concluded\n\nOn how to mitigate the impact of the subsidy removal, Zainab said a committee set up by government to work out measures that would cushion the effect on Nigerians, especially the vulnerable ones would make recommendations on the way out.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had signed the 2022 Appropriation Bill of N17.13 trillion into law on December 31, 2021 having laid the proposal before the National Assembly on October 7, 2021.\n\nThe president had also signed the 2021 finance bill into law on same day.\n\nThe two chambers had increased the spending plan by N735.8 billion from the proposed N16.391tn to N17.126 trillion. They had also raised the oil benchmark from $57 per barrel proposed by the executive to $62.\n\nThe National Assembly had also fixed oil production at 1.88 million barrels per day, exchange rate at N410.15 to the dollar, GDP at 4.2 percent and inflation at 13 percent.\n\nIn his presentation, the Executive Chairman, Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Mr. Muhammad Nami, disclosed that about N6.4 trillion was collected by as taxes by the service last year.\n\nAlso, in his virtual presentation, the Group Managing Director Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr. Mele Kyari, said the country now produces 1.74 million barrels of crude oil per day.\n\nBut he said the security situation in the country had cut the figures to 1.5 million barrels about three months ago before the latest improvement.\n\nHe said, \u201cThree months ago we came down to 1.5 million barrels per day because of security issues and we are responding to it.\n\n\u201cAs of today production has increased to 1.74 million barrels per day and there are ongoing interventions to better the situation on security.\n\n\u201cThe expectations are that within the month, we will get to 1.8 million barrels per day and exceed the limit within the year.\u201d\n\n2021 BUDGET PERFORMANCE\n\nIn a presentation, the Minister disclosed that as at November 2021, federal government\u2019s aggregate revenue was N5.51 trillion, which was 74 per cent of its target for the fiscal year.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s share of oil revenues was N970.3 billion (representing 53% performance of the prorated sum in the 2021 budget), while federal government\u2019s share of non-oil tax revenues totalled N1.62 trillion (118.8% over and above the target).\n\nAlso, Companies Income Tax (CIT) and Value Added Tax (VAT) collections were N718.58 billion and N360.56 billion, representing 115 per cent and 165 per cent respectively of the prorata targets for the period. In 2021, Customs collections was N542.11 billion (104% of the target), while other revenues amounted to N2.8 trillion, of which the federal government\u2019s independent revenues was N1.1 trillion while Government Owned Entities\u2019 (GOEs\u2019) retained revenues was N1.20 trillion\n\nOn the expenditure side, she revealed that N12.56 trillion (or 94.1%) had been spent out of the N13.57 trillion prorata budget. This performance was inclusive of expenditure estimates of the GOEs but exclusive of Project-tied Loans.\n\nOf the expenditure, N4.20 trillion was for debt service, and N3.02 trillion for personnel cost, including pensions.\n\nAs at November 2021, the federal government has expended N3.40 trillion for capital budget. Of this, N2.98 trillion represented 83 per cent of the provision for Ministries, Departments and Agencies\u2019 (MDAs\u2019) capital, N369.9 billion for multilateral/bilateral Project-tied loans, and N49.52 billion as GOEs capital expenditure\n\n2022 BUDGET KEY ASSUMPTION, ESTIMATES\n\nZainab pointed out that the 2022 budget seeks to continue the reflationary policies of the 2020 and 2021 budgets of the government, which according to her, helped put the economy back on the path of recovery and growth.\n\n\u201cThe 2022 Budget was prepared taking into consideration the policies/strategies contained in the 2022\u20132024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper (MTEF/FSP).\n\n\u201cThe Budget was prepared using the Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB) approach and in line with the government\u2019s development priorities, as articulated in the National Development Plan (NDP) 2021-2025. Allocations to MDAs were guided by the core objectives of the NDP 2021 \u2013 2025.\n\n\u201cThe plan, with an investment size of N348.1 trillion, will be funded by the federal, state governments and the private sector. The 2022 federal government budget is the first key public sector contribution to implementing the plan,\u201d she explained.\n\nIn terms of its key assumptions in the area of crude oil production, Ahmed noted that although Nigeria\u2019s total production capacity was 2.5 mbpd, current (year to date) crude production was about 1.4mbpd (slightly short of the OPEC+ production quota), and an additional 300,000bpd of condensates, totaling about 1.6mbpd.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects that global oil production would increase to match rising levels of global oil consumption.\n\nOPEC crude production was projected to average 28.34 million barrels per day in 2022 higher than 26.94 million barrels per day forecast for 2021.\n\n\u201cWe projected our base oil price at $57/bbl in 2022 in consultation with NNPC and other stakeholders. This was premised on the averages of forecasts by leading institutions, factors driving market fundamentals, global economic recovery, plans by governments and market sentiments.\n\n\u201cHowever, the National Assembly increased the proposed 2022 oil price benchmark of $57pbl to $62pbl. World Bank forecasts that crude oil prices will average $74pb in\n\n2022 as oil demand strengthens and reaches pre-pandemic levels. The EIA expects Brent prices to average $70.05 per barrel in 2022,\u201d she added.\n\nThe minister, while commenting on the critical sectoral allocations of the 2022 budget, said the education sector received N1.234 trillion with 815.69 billion allocated to the Ministry of Education and its agencies for recurrent and capital expenditure.\n\nShe also said N112.29 billion earmarked for the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC), while N306 billion was allocated for Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND) for infrastructure projects in tertiary institutions.\n\nThe health sector got N876.38 billion, representing 5.1 per cent of the total budget. The Ministry of Health and its agencies would received N770.87 billion for recurrent and capital expenditure including hazard allowance.\n\nThe defence and security sector gulped 13.4 per cent of the budget or N2.29 trillion while N1.42 trillion or 8.3 per cent of the budget was set aside for infrastructure development out of which N462 billion is mapped out for social development and poverty reduction programmes.\n\nMACRO ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS\n\nThe federal government projected that in 2022, consumption would increase by about 9.36 per cent, from a revised N136.57 trillion in 2021 to N149.35 trillion in the present fiscal year. Nominal GDP was also projected to rise from N168.60 trillion in 2021 to N184.38 trillion in 2022 and then up to N221.78 trillion in 2024, while real GDP growth forecast was 4.2 per cent in 2022, 2.3 per cent for 2023 (election year impact) and 3.3 per cent in 2024.\n\nIn addition, inflation was projected to be double digit in the medium-term given structural issues impacting cost of doing business, including high food distribution cost.\n\n\u201cHowever, current steady decline is expected to be sustained, seeing inflation rate drop to 13 per cent in 2022 and 10 per cent by 2024,\u201d the minister further projected.\n\nWHERE THE MONEY IS COMING FROM\n\nAhmed in her presentation, stated that the projected aggregate revenue available to fund the 2022 budget of N10.74 trillion (inclusive of GOEs) was 32 per cent higher than the 2021 projection of N8.12 trillion.\n\nWithout the GOEs retained revenue, the government\u2019s revenue was projected at N9.01 trillion.\n\nShe disclosed that in order to promote fiscal transparency, accountability and comprehensiveness, allocations to TETFUND and the budgets of 63 GOEs were integrated in the federal government\u2019s 2022 budget proposal.\n\nIn aggregate, 35 per cent of projected revenues is to come from oil-related sources while 65 per cent is to be earned from non-oil sources.\n\nThe 2022 aggregate federal government expenditure (inclusive of GOEs and project-tied Loans) was projected to be N17.13 trillion, which was 18 per cent higher than the 2021 Budget.\n\nOn the other hand, recurrent (non-debt) spending, estimated to amount to N6.91 trillion, was 40 per cent of total expenditure, and 20 per cent higher than the 2021 budget.\n\nShe also disclosed that aggregate capital expenditure of N5.96 trillion was 35 per cent of total expenditure.\n\nThis provision was inclusive of capital component of statutory transfers, GOEs capital and project-tied loans expenditures.\n\nAt N3.61 trillion, debt service was 21 per cent of total expenditure and 34 per cent of total revenues.\n\nProvision to retire maturing bonds to local contractors/suppliers of N270.71 billion was 1.6 per cent of total expenditure.\n\nThe minister said the provision was in line with the federal government\u2019s commitment to off-set accumulated arrears of contractual obligations dating back over a decade.\n\n\u201cOverall budget deficit is N6.39 trillion for 2022. This represents 3.46 per cent of GDP.\n\nBudget deficit is to be financed mainly by borrowings: Domestic sources -N2.57 trillion; foreign sources \u2013 N2.57 trillion; multi-lateral /bi-lateral loan drawdowns \u2013 N1.16 trillion and privatisation proceeds \u2013 N90.7 billion,\u201d she added.\n\nNIGERIA\u2019S DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\n\nAhmed reiterated that the federal government\u2019s debt level was still within sustainable limits. According to her, borrowings were essentially for capital expenditure and Human Development, as specified in Section 41(1)a of the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007.\n\n\u201cHaving witnessed two economic recessions we have had to spend our way out of recession, which contributed significantly to the growth in the public debt. It is unlikely that our recovery from each of the two recessions would have been as fast without the sustained government expenditure funded partly by debt.\n\n\u201cTo compound matters, the country has technically been at war, with the pervasive security challenges across the nation. This has necessitated massive expenditure on security equipment and operations, contributing to the fiscal deficit; Defence and Security sector accounts for 22 per cent of the 2021 budget.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s Budget Deficit/GDP (-4.3%, as at November 2021) and Debt/GDP ratios (30% as at September 2021) are the lowest among Africa\u2019s leading economies;\n\n\u201cHowever, Nigeria\u2019s Debt Service/Revenue ratio (76% as at November 2021) is the highest among same African top economies. This is proof that what we have is not a classic debt sustainability problem, but a revenue challenge.\n\n\u201cTax rates and compliance ratios are significantly higher in these comparator countries; For instance, Nigeria\u2019s VAT rate of 7.5 per cent is the lowest in Africa, and less than 50% of the average rate,\u201d she added.\n\nAccording to Ahmed, efforts are ongoing to fix the country\u2019s revenue challenge, saying cutting expenditure would not be a viable option.\n\n\u201cWe must however continue to rationalise our expenditures as we cannot afford waste. In reality, our largest expenditure items are currently personnel cost, debt service and capital expenditure, which between them account for 85 per cent of the 2022 budget.\n\n\u201cThere is very little scope for cut in any of these over the medium term. The most viable solution to our fiscal challenge therefore remains to grow our revenues and plug all leakages.\n\n\u201cOur target over the medium term is to grow our Revenue-to-GDP ratio from about 8\n\n\u2013 9 percent currently to 15 per cent by 2025. At that level of revenues, the Debt-to- Service-to-Revenue ratio will cease to be a critical concern,\u201d the minister added.\n\nShe listed some measures to increase revenue to include improving tax administration framework including tax filing and payment compliance improvements; evaluation of the process and policy effectiveness of fiscal Incentives, including: review of sectors eligible for Pioneer Tax Holiday Incentives under the Industrial\n\nDevelopment Income Tax Relief Act (\u2018IDITRA\u2019); dimensioning the cost of tax waivers/concessions, and evaluating their policy effectiveness; setting annual ceilings on tax expenditures to better manage their impact on already constrained government revenues and ensuring that MDAs appropriately account for and remit their internally generated revenue, among others.\n\n\u201cGovernment will continue to create the enabling environment for private sector to increase their investment and contribute significantly to job creation, economic growth and lifting millions of our citizens out of poverty. Early passage of the 2022 Budget for implementation from January 1, will significantly contribute towards achieving government macro-fiscal and sectoral objectives.\n\n\u201cHowever, revenue currently remains our main fiscal challenge.

          "text": "\u2022Says he will sign electoral bill, if N\u2019Assembly includes consensus option, indirect primaries\n\n\u2022Declares state police not an option in tackling insecurity\n\n\u2022President\u2019s aversion to state police means he\u2019s comfortable with insecurity, posits Ayu\n\nDeji Elumoye, Emmanuel Addeh and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, revealed that he had his own agenda regarding the person that would succeed him, but he would be playing his cards close to his chest until the 2023 general election because he did not want the fellow eliminated before his time.\n\nBuhari spoke during an interview on Channels Television.\n\nHe promised to assent to the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill only if the National Assembly removed the clause mandating political parties to conduct their election primaries directly. He had declined assent to the bill last month, saying it is undemocratic to constrain political parties to a mode of primary election, as provided in the bill. But, despite widespread clamour, he ruled out establishment of state police as solution to rising insecurity in the country, saying, \u201cState police is not an option.\u201d\n\nReacting to the president\u2019s indisposition to the popular agitation for state police, National Chairman of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, accused Buhari of being comfortable with the state of insecurity in the country. Ayu said this could be gleaned from the president\u2019s declaration that \u201cstate police is not an option\u201d.\n\nAnswering a question on his likely successor, Buhari said, \u201cNo, I will not tell you, because he may be eliminated if I mention his name.\u201d But he added that it did not really matter who succeeded him, saying whoever wins the election will succeed him.\n\nOn the electoral bill, Buhari maintained that primaries must not be direct, but rather, people should be given options to make their choice.\n\nHe stated, \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t support direct primaries, because I want people to be given a choice. You can\u2019t give them one option and think you are being democratic. Let them be given the three options, which are direct, indirect and consensus. If you could recall, ACN, APGA, ANPP, CPC and another party, we came together.\n\n\u201cPDP was over confident and thought they will rule Nigeria to the end of time. But the opposition, we came together and overthrew them. We didn\u2019t overthrow PDP because of direct primaries but because of the opposition coming together and fighting the PDP.\n\n\u201cWe must not insist that it has to be direct primary, it should be consensus and indirect. Once that\u2019s done, I will sign the electoral bill. There should be options, you can\u2019t dictate to people and you say you\u2019re doing democracy. Allow them to have options to make a choice.\u201d\n\nThe president assured that bandits, particularly in the North-west, explaining that progress is being made in the fight against insecurity.\n\nHe advocated more dialogue in solving the farmer-herder clashes across the country. According to him, \u201cFor Nigerians to be fair to this administration, is to try and find out from the time we won the election in 2015 till now in the three promises we made, which are improving security, economy and fighting corruption.\n\n\u201cIn the North-west, it\u2019s same people killing each other, burning villages. I think the only language they understand we discussed it with the law enforcement agencies, the service chiefs, IGP is to go after the terrorists. We named them terrorists and we are going to deal with them as such.\n\n\u201cIf you go to those constituencies over the last four weeks, there\u2019s improvement in the security. On farmer/headers\u2019 crisis, we cannot do much about the weather but about the security, we\u2019ve taken steps and we are seeing the results. For the weather, the ministers of agriculture from Audu Ogbeh to Mahmoud now, one of the issues I discussed with them is to go and get the gazettes on cattle routes and grazing grounds and the cattle rearers are confined to those areas.\n\n\u201cThose that go outside that one are arrested and farmers are encouraged to come and lay their claims. We have to go back to that system again to try and make sure we prepare grazing areas, so that headers don\u2019t stray into peoples farms and into the towns and so on. We are working on that.\n\nHowever, Buhari failed to either endorse or reject the suggestion by the Governor of Kaduna state, Mr Nasir el-Rufai for the carpet-bombing of the terrorists irrespective of the magnitude of collateral damage and casualties.\n\nHe stated that he campaigned on three fundamental issues, namely security, corruption and the economy, stressing that on the three promises, security in the north east, which he said was very bad when he took over, has now improved.\n\nBut he noted that while the renewed attack on the gunmen must be sustained, it was important to provide protection for communities and their leaders who were helping in providing intelligence to the security agencies.\n\n\u201cI think the only language they understand, we have discussed it thoroughly with the service chiefs and the Inspector General of Police (IG), and it is to go after the terrorists. We have labelled them terrorists and we are going to deal with them as such.\n\n\u201cI told you what we have done. We met at least four times with the service chiefs and law enforcement agencies, each meeting taking at least four hours. We have discussed thoroughly what to do with the situation.\n\n\u201cWe met at least four times with the service chiefs and other law enforcement agencies, each meeting taking at least four hours. We have discussed thoroughly what to do with the situation. Luckily, I have a military background from civil war till now, so, we discussed and we tried to secure and make it safe for the leadership at community level.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s very important, the best intelligence you get is from the local leadership. They know who\u2019s who in their areas of responsibilities. You have to talk to them but you must make sure they are safe, because the bandits can be a source of insecurity to them or their families and we are very conscious of that.\u201d\n\nOn state police as a solution to insecurity, Buhari opined that state police was not an option, alluding to the propensity for governors to abuse the security institution.\n\nHe said, \u201cWell, the role of traditional rulers must not be undermined, because in their areas they know who\u2019s who. So, we have to revert to that system for us to have effective security in the localities. For example, there were two governors that came to see me about the problem and I said as far as I know, the farmers and the herders have been coexisting in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cLet them go and ask the local leadership what went wrong, why the break in communication between the local leadership and the herders, why are they now extending to people\u2019s farms.\n\n\u201cState police is not an option. Find out now the relationship between the local government and their governors. Are they getting what they are supposed to get constitutionally? Are they getting it? Try and see those people from local government let them tell you the truth about the fight between local government and governors.\u201d\n\nOn the economy, the president revealed that the crude oil production quota from 1999 to 2014 was 2.1 million barrels per day. He said at a point, the production quota was reduced by half.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhen we came in, somehow the militants were unleashed in the South-south, and production went down to half a million barrels per day. But look at what we did within the time frame with the resources available to us?\u201d\n\nBuhari expressed displeasure at the state of electricity in Nigeria.\n\nWhen asked if he was happy with the country\u2019s electricity production capacity, the president replied, \u201cI am not because I identify that no country can develop without infrastructure and infrastructure means road, rail and power. This government is working very hard on the road. Try to imagine what was happening between Lagos to Ibadan six months ago and what it is now. We are doing from Lagos to Kano the rail, road from here to Kaduna to Kano. So we have to get the infrastructure right and then Nigerians will mind their own business. But when the infrastructure is not there, the roads are not there, the rail is virtually killed, no power, what do we expect people to do?\u201d\n\nThe president noted that the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) was 100 per cent government-owned, saying his government inherited the Distribution Companies (Discos).\n\nHe alleged that the owners of Discos bought them based on geo-political zones rather than merit.\n\nBuhari said, \u201cThe people that own them, who are they? They are not electrical engineers, they don\u2019t have money, it is just a political favour. To remove a system and reintroduce one is no joke. Luckily we have the TCN and that is the transmission. If we can get our technology right, we will cut the cost on transmission and the likelihood of sabotaging the lines and so on.\u201d\n\nThe president advised Nigerian youths to use their education and exposure to improve themselves and not depend on government.\n\nHe said, \u201cI wish when they go to school; when they work hard; when they earn their degree, they don\u2019t do it thinking that government must give them jobs\n\nYou get educated because an educated person is certainly better than an uneducated person even in identifying personal problems. So, education is not just meant to hang on to the government to give you jobs and then what the colonialists indoctrinated in us to believe \u2013 have a car, have a house; start work by 8am and close by 2pm.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the possibility of releasing the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, Buhari ruled out the option of pardon. But he acknowledged the possibility of a political resolution.\n\nBuhari said, \u201cNigerians know that I don\u2019t interfere with the judiciary. Let him be listened to. For those, who are saying that we should release him, no, we cannot release him. There is a possibility of political solution.\n\n\u201cIf people behave themselves, all well and good, but you can\u2019t go to a foreign country and keep on sending incorrect economic and security problem against your country and think that you will never have to account for what you have been doing. Let him account for what he has been doing.\u201d\n\nAsked what comes to mind whenever he heard the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Buhari responded, \u201cfailure\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Ayu accused Buhari of being comfortable with the insecurity in the country.\n\nAyu also criticised the president for pushing the blame for the incessant killing of farmers by terrorists to locals along grazing routes.\n\nThe PDP national chairman was responding to some of the issues raised in Buhari\u2019s interview on Channels Television.\n\nAyu\u2019s Media Office quoted the PDP national chairman as saying, \u201cIt appears the continued killings in some localities of Nigeria, particularly, in the North, and more specifically in President Buhari\u2019s home state of Katsina, may not matter to him with his statement that state police is not an option.\n\n\u201cWatching President Muhammadu Buhari this evening on Channels TV during an interview session was a gratuitous waste of time, because there was nothing new coming from the president. As said by many before now, to expect anything new from our president would be a misplaced and unfortunate expectation.\n\n\u201cFrom the economy, to insecurity, killing of innocent farmers by terrorists (which some erroneously term farmer/herder clashes) and other sundry issues, President Buhari honoured his calling as a president, who has nothing new to offer.\n\n\u201cHe again repeated the impotent argument regarding killing of farmers by terrorists, reminding Nigerians of grazing routes. Well, what the president failed to reference is that the herders plying the grazing routes before, neither carried AK47s, nor did they engage in raping of women and despoliation of the assets of those along the routes.\n\n\u201cMr. President\u2019s position of saying the locals should be asked what went wrong, flies in the face of reason and contemporary realities. Tied to that, but not limited in scope, is the issue of insecurity and a re-organisation of the Nigeria Police to accommodate present, peculiar, environmental and social challenges.\n\n\u201cIn President Buhari\u2019s view, state police is not an option. Yet, it appears the continued killings in some localities of Nigeria, particularly, in the North, and more specifically, in his home state of Katsina, may not matter, hence, the need to have a security system that feeds on local intelligence and nuances, which the federal police cannot adequately provide, is not an option to our president.\n\n\u201cTo him, it appears that continuing the same process while expecting a different output and outcome is the best way to go. We ask, is he comfortable with the killings in the land while the status quo persists?\n\n\u201cNigerians should remind President Buhari that people evolve and societies evolve. Therefore, being trapped in a time capsule of the past about state police is not an option Nigerians are willing to accept from him.\n\n\u201cOn the economic front, nations of the world who enjoy the benefit of direct foreign investments (DFI) ensure that their countries are safe for investors to pour in their resources. No amount of propaganda will obviate the realities on ground and which embassies and foreign missions observe.\n\n\u201cTherefore, to ensure that investor confidence is restored, a safe environment must, of necessity, be created. Our government is trapped in the mentality of believing its own lies that Nigeria is better today than it was under PDP. To those who share this fallacy, we ask: Would they wish for their lives to be like Nigeria under this present regime? The lives of Nigerians today tell the true story.\n\n\u201cThe more Buhari promises to lift Nigerians out of poverty, the poorer Nigerians become. To further dwell on the entire interview would be to waste valuable time. But we implore Nigerians not to relent, because hope is on the way and, like one writer said, hope is better served as breakfast and not dinner, as the APC regime of President Buhari is doing, promising El Dorado in the dying days of its tenure.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A day after a media interview of President Muhammadu Buhari was aired by Channels Television, a private broadcast station; many of his comments during the almost one hour-long session have continued to generate reactions across and beyond Nigeria.\n\nThe latest television interview was one of the rare occasions that the former military general had sat down with Nigerian journalists to dissect issues relating to his administration since taking over power from ex-President Goodluck Jonathan in 2015.\n\nUnder Buhari\u2019s watch especially in recent times, Nigerians had experienced some of the lowest moments as a people especially with insecurity and poverty growing at alarming rates.\n\nAs a result of these issues and more, many across the country looked forward to the interview aired on Wednesday to find out what perhaps awaited Nigeria and its people in 2022.\n\nBut like in the past, President Buhari gave almost no glimmer of hope in his responses to important questions bordering on economy, security and development asked by the interviewers, which many had thought he would react to positively.\n\nInstead, the President strayed in different directions from important questions asked to the shock of many Nigerians.\n\nDementia-ravaged Buhari Couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Remember Names Of Governors Who Visited Him On Farmers-herders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Clashes | Sahara Reporters https://t.co/Dovm3ZsOO5 pic.twitter.com/rJZO17cAQo \u2014 Sahara Reporters (@SaharaReporters) January 5, 2022\n\nIn one question, Buhari was asked if he was worried that the dry season could escalate clashes between herders and farmers in parts of the country, and what his administration was doing to avert such crisis.\n\nResponding, Buhari said, \u201cWe cannot do much about the weather. But about the security, we have taken steps and we have seen the result. We thank God for that.\n\n\u201cFor the weather, we can only pray and hope for the best. Concerning climate change, Nigeria, we are very susceptible to such issues because of our population and size of the country.\u201d\n\nWhen one of the journalists tried to rephrase the question by asking the President if he thought the problem between farmers and herder had been solved by his administration, he said, \u201cThe ministers of agriculture from Audu Ogbeh to Mahmoud now, one of the issues I discussed with them personally is to go and get the gazette especially of Northern states.\n\n\u201cThere are grazing routes and the cattle rearers are confined to those areas. Anyone that goes outside is arrested and farmers are encouraged to lay their claims. If they don't have the money, their cattle were sold and the farmers are settled.\n\n\u201cWe said we have to go back to this system again to make sure that we prepare the grazing areas so that farmers and herders don't clash.\u201d\n\nFor a third time, one of the interviewers asked President Buhari what he thought could help bring a lasting solution to the herder/farmer crisis and problem of banditry in Nigeria, he said, \u201cIt is a problem of culture. You have to study it to understand.\n\n\u201cThe life of normal herders...they depend entirely on them. They sell their milk; they sell their animals to pay tax and so on.\n\n\u201cSo, if those cattle were taken away from them, they normally become wild because that is the only thing they know. It is a cultural problem. The way we will do it is to start from bottom up to make sure the grazing area and water points are secured to them.\u201d\n\nMoving away from the herders/farmers crisis, the journalists asked the President if he thought state policing was a possible solution to the issue of insecurity in Nigeria especially following rising crime wave across the country, he said, \u201cThe role of traditional rulers must not be undermined because in their areas they know who is who. We have to revert to that system for us to have an effective security.\n\n\u201cThere were two governors that came to see me about problem. The governor of Oyo State and governor of...em em...Oyo State and one other state. I said because the herders were in their forests, the animals were going into neighbouring farms and eating all the crops. As far as I know, the farmers and herders have been co-existing in Nigeria, let them go and ask the local leadership what had gone wrong, why the break in communication between them and the herders.\u201d\n\nWhile being commended for the early passage of the 2022 national budget, Buhari was asked if he feared that the budget might not be able to achieve its purpose, he responded by saying, \u201cMy confidence that we can successfully implement the budget because in most Houses (of Assembly) our party is leading. It is APC in leadership.\n\n\u201cLook at the Senate President; he was in the House of Representatives for two or three terms before he went to the Senate. Look at Femi Gbajabiamila; I was watching on the television when he was an ordinary member. He was always fighting for the system he believed in.\n\n\u201cI consider myself lucky. My party is under competent leadership both in the Senate and House of Representatives. That is why you don't hear much about me. I allow them do all the things because I can't go against my party and I can't go against people I have absolute confidence in.\u201d\n\nWhen asked the type of economy he would want to bequeath to Nigerians at the end of his eight-year tenure in May 2023, President Buhari while completely deviating from the subject matter, said, \u201cThe economy is free economy. What is free economy? You allow people to make sure that their industries are patronised. You have to stop smuggling; you have to stop developed countries dumping goods in your country. Because of technology, we can produce faster. So, you have to protect your economy. That was why within ECOWAS, we encouraged our own industries.\n\n\u201cWe are so far away in technology, if you allow dumping, unemployment is going to rise.\u201d\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: How Dementia Prevented Buhari From Visiting Katsina School Despite Being Briefed Since Friday\n\nIn yet another response that ran contrary to the question, Buhari while being asked on the number of Nigerians his administration had lifted out of poverty so far, said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you off hand. Only 2.5 per cent of arable land is being cultivated. So, we are going to turn our attention to agriculture for the time remaining for us.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, there is political problem. In the South, there is problem of land ownership, very serious one based on families, the ruling classes and so on. But luckily in the North, all land belongs to government; they can take any land at any time.\u201d\n\nWhen one of the interviewers tried to bring the President back to the question by asking if there was a setback in lifting targeted Nigerians from poverty, Buhari again went off the mark by saying, \u201cWe have setback and it is resource shortage. We need to buy machinery. Tractors, clearing the land, dividing it and\u2026giving people seeds and fertilizers and that costs money.\u201d\n\nAsked how much of the sufferings of Nigerians he understood, again the President shot overboard, declaring that, \u201cI am aware of it but look at the vastness of Nigeria. Only 2.5 of arable land is being used. We realised this rather too late but we have to go back to the land.\u201d\n\nEconomic indicators like inflation, unemployment, foreign exchange, foreign direct investment and several others under President Buhari\u2019s administration had plunged further in recent times, leaving Nigeria and many of its impoverished households on the precipe.\n\nWhen reminded by the interviewers that the numbers under his watch were far worse than where his predecessor left it in May 2015 and if that bothered him by any chance, Buhari said, \u201cI am not sure how correct your calculations are but all I know is that we have to allow people to get access to the farm.\n\n\u201cWe have to go back to the land. We need machinery, we have to build infrastructure and we have identified the infrastructure we need. We have to make the rail work; we have to make the roads.\u201d\n\nDesperate for a Nigeria that works for all, citizens have continually clamoured for restructuring of the country as according to the proponents, it will put an end to many of the crisis witnessed across the federation at the moment.\n\nAsked if he believed in restructuring as the solution to Nigeria\u2019s current problems, Buhari said, \u201cThose who talk about restructuring, I want them to define what they mean in their own concept. Do they want more states? If they want, look at the map of Nigeria, at whose expense?\n\n\u201cI have been having problems with people from South-East. They said they wanted each geo-political zone about six states. I said okay, go and look at the map and see how many of the Eastern states will contribute to the other states. That was the last I had from them.\u201d\n\nIndeed, all through the duration of his latest television interview, President Buhari failed to address key questions asked, instead shooting off the mark on several occasions and showing strong signs of a man battling with chronic dementia.\n\nApart from speaking incoherently and sometimes inaudibly, he often forgot names of important people he meant to mention during the session.\n\nSaharaReporters had in recent past reported how Buhari\u2019s dementia affected his performance in government and slows down the decision making process.\n\nIn May 2021, this newspaper reported how Buhari\u2019s worsening dementia and other undisclosed health challenges were taking a heavy toll on his ability to effectively coordinate meetings.\n\nThe President was said to have faltered during a meeting with security chiefs during that week.\n\nTop sources in the Presidency had told SaharaReporters that Buhari was not only incoherent but spoke for only a short time.\n\nIt was learnt that he spoke in the same manner when he had a meeting with the Head of European Union delegation to Nigeria and to the Economic Community of West African States, Mr Ketil Karlsen, along with his team.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s health condition is worsening by the day and affecting his handling of national matters, especially on insecurity. At the EU delegation virtual meeting, he was responding off-key.\n\n\u201cAt the meeting with the security chiefs, he was also off-key and spoke little.\n\n\u201cHe was supposed to be at the graduation ceremony at the Nigeria Police College in Kano but the event had to be postponed because the President was not ready,\u201d the source had revealed.\n\nSaharaReporters in December 2020 had reported how the inability of President Buhari to make critical decisions on insecurity and the depressed economy had become worrisome to many Nigerians \u2013 a situation which his dementia and other undisclosed illnesses he was treating could have contributed to.\n\nBuhari Is Tired, Abandons Duty At 5pm Daily Even If Nigeria Is On Fire\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Presidential Source | Sahara Reporters\n\nSaharaReporters in December 2020 had reported the inability of President Buhari to make critical decisions on insecurity...\n\nREAD MORE: https://t.co/t8AJ0tkqeD pic.twitter.com/ifpEbUTlx9 \u2014 Sahara Reporters (@SaharaReporters) June 7, 2021\n\nAt least President Buhari has jetted out of Nigeria six times for treatment, spending about 180 days since 2015 when he assumed office in his first term.\n\nDementia is a general term for loss of memory, language and thinking abilities \u2013 a condition which may be caused by the President\u2019s old age or undisclosed medical condition.",

We therefore call on your office to reengineer the process in order to ensure that the investigations are not compromised.\n\n\u201cThe CSCSN is a body of concerned members of the Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria, an affiliate of the Trade Union Congress of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are in support of all investigations against corruption in ASCSN. As a working class movement, our attention is drawn to horrible happenings and several allegations of corruption against the officials of the Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria, which has resulted in a crisis situation.\n\n\u201cWe are also aware that you have invited top officials of ASCSN for investigations concerning the corruption in the association. We are aware that so many anti graft agencies like the EFCC, ICPC, CCB, the police, etc. have risen up to the challenge to investigate the corruption in the workers\u2019 union. We are also aware that many present and past union officials have been invited for questioning by your agency and other different anti graft agencies. We commend you and your agency and all other agencies that are currently investigating ASCSN.\n\n\u201cWe are having a course for concern as the information reaching us, have confirmed that a lot of the union officials have refused to honour the invitation by your agency and that sufficient action is not taken to enforce compliance.\n\n\u201cNigerian workers, present and past labour leaders are watching, we are following the unfolding events and we hope for a sincere and thorough uncompromised investigation. It is our view that if a thorough job is done, it will serve as a prelude to exposing the corruption in the trade union movement in Nigeria. We are awaiting the acknowledgement of our mail and prompt action.\u201d",

          "title": "How mobile phones and digital tools have helped Togo tackle COVID-19",
          "text": "Globally, the COVID-19 disease has infected more than 290 million people, claimed well over 5 million lives, and plunged millions into extreme poverty. The pandemic has been devastating in every sense of the word, and its impact felt in Africa, too, where over 9.7 million cases and 228,000 deaths have been recorded.\n\nBut, within the continent, the magnitude of the crisis has been uneven by country. One of the lesser affected countries is Togo. The French-speaking country has, so far, recorded 31,500 infections and 250 deaths from COVID, per data from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC)\u2014relatively lenient nominal figures compared to Nigeria\u2019s or South Africa\u2019s.\n\nIn the small West African country of about 8 million people and a gross domestic product of around $7.5 billion, locally-led digital solutions have been crucial to authorities\u2019 efforts to curb the pandemic\u2019s reach.\n\nLast month, Togo\u2019s Ministry of Digital Economy and Transformation, led by Havard graduate and former World Bank analyst Cina Lawson, unveiled the latest in an expanding list of mobile-based solutions to help Togolese tide over the pandemic.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA new mobile application, PassCovid19TG, allows the population to easily upload, access, and present their COVID-19-related health information. Documents such as vaccination certificates, PCR tests, and the Togolese or European Union COVID Pass, whether in digital or paper format, can be uploaded on the app via scanning their QR codes.\n\nBy using smartphones to present COVID digital certificates, the new application is expected to facilitate and improve the control and checking of health passes in Togo, where people have to present passes before they\u2019re allowed into public spaces, from airports and worship centres to restaurants and bars.\n\n\u201cThe PassCovid19TG can also be used when travelling, to check in advance the validity of the Pass in the country of destination, particularly in the European Union area,\u201d said Lawson, who\u2019s overseen the creation of several technological solutions that have helped Togo effectively handle the COVID-19 crisis better than its wealthier, larger, and supposedly more tech-savvy regional neighbours, Nigeria and Ghana.\n\nLike much of the rest of Africa, COVID lockdowns and restrictions threatened livelihoods in Togo, a country where pre-pandemic per capita GDP was less than $700 in 2019 and average income below $2 a day. Per World Bank estimates, about 62% of jobs in the country were affected by the crisis, particularly in the informal sector, which employs the majority of Togo\u2019s labour force outside of the agricultural sector.\n\nFaced with the threat of worsened poverty amid rising unemployment and dwindling income, the government in April 2020 launched a program called Novissi (meaning \u201csolidarity\u201d in the local Ewe language)\u2014a mobile money-based cash transfer scheme to help those most economically affected by the pandemic.\n\nMore than 1.6 million Togolese registered for the monetary support through their mobile phones, according to data on the Novissi website. Led by Lawson, the digital ministry then used voter identification data to select beneficiaries by targeting some 600,000 people who listed themselves as \u201cinformal workers\u201d in urban areas, an indication they were likely to be poor.\n\nBut with the government unable to support every one of the millions of informal workers, identifying the poorest citizens in the rural parts of the country required more sophisticated solutions. Togo turned to satellite imagery and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe TogoSafe app.\n\nWith the help of researchers at the University of California and the US-based NGO GiveDirectly, the government was able to identify the poorest 100 cantons in the country through satellite imagery data. It then analysed mobile phone data from primary network providers to identify users in those areas with patterns that suggested they were living under the poverty line.\n\n\u201cWe chose a fully digital approach, which makes it possible to directly reach beneficiaries through mobile payments while guaranteeing traceability and transparency,\u201d Lawson\u2019s statement on the Novissi website reads. \u201cThe solution represents a real methodological break with the past and foreshadows the way in which social safety nets and cash transfer programs will henceforth be implemented in our country.\u201d\n\nLom\u00e9 has so far distributed around CFA13.3 billion (over $22 million) directly into the mobile wallets of more than 800,000 people in different communities suffering from the crisis, according to official data. Women make up the majority of beneficiaries\u2014over 500,000\u2014and received more ($22) in single 3\u20135 monthly cash transfers than men ($20).\n\n\u201cPeople should not have to choose between death by COVID-19 or by hunger,\u201d President Faure Gnassingbe said on the Novissi programme. \u201cOther African leaders could also use a similar mobile-based, cash transfer scheme.\u201d Anit Mukherjee, a policy fellow at the Centre for Global Development, in this Bloomberg article claims Novissi makes even America\u2019s COVID cash transfer programme look like a \u201cdinosaur\u201d.\n\nAround three months after launching the Novissi scheme and as reported COVID cases surged in Togo with the emergence of the more contentious and deadly Delta variant, the government launched a COVID contact-tracing application, Togo Safe, to initiate, in real-time, the health protocol needed to contain the virus\u2019s spread.\n\nThe web and mobile-based platform relies on digital geolocation to track infected individuals and immediately issues notifications to others whenever they come in contact with those who\u2019d tested positive for the virus.\n\nOn the app, Togolese can also view the number of COVID cases in their area as well as get access to health advice and a directory of useful pandemic-related hotlines.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people registered for COVID-19 vaccination through Togo\u2019s digital platforms.\n\nTogo\u2019s tech-savvy approach to handling the pandemic extends to vaccination efforts. Within a week of receiving 156,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX facility last March, the country was able to vaccinate 98% of its health workers with the help of a system that relied on digital channels to reach people across the country.\n\nAuthorities launched a mobile and web-based service that allows Togolese to register for vaccination using their phones. An individual just has to dial the shortcode *844# from a local number and complete necessary steps, after which they receive a 14-digit code to be shown at the health centre for vaccination.\n\nIn a month, more than 50,000 people had registered for vaccination through SMS and the website. Togo currently has the second-highest vaccination rate in West Africa, after Cape Verde.\n\nThe digital-driven response appears to be effective, keeping COVID infection rates in Togo at low levels so far while the poverty rate only rose marginally in 2020. It\u2019s also attracted international attention and recognition. On the COVID Performance Index developed by the Australian think tank, Lowy Institute, the West African country was ranked the 2nd to best handle the crisis in Africa, and the 15th globally. Many African countries have shown interest in replicating Novissi, Lawson told Bloomberg.\n\nTogo may not be known for tech startups with global appeal and recognition or billions in venture funding, but the country has ambitions to become a digital hub by 2025, riding on the penetration of mobile connections. As of January 2021, more than 80% of the population had a mobile phone.\n\nConsidering the manner in which the government has been able to leverage ICTs in its COVID response, Damien Mama, who was United Nations Resident Coordinator in Togo until September 2021, believes the small West African nation is on track to improving its economy with digital technologies.\n\n\u201cThe digital sector is without a doubt one of the most promising means to achieve the sustainable development goals in a small country with big ambitions like Togo,\u201d the UN official said in a post.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Here\u2019s why startup funding in the Maghreb ecosystem is low",
          "text": "Five North African countries\u2014Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Libya\u2014make up the Maghreb region, a historic island between seas of water and sand at the far end of the Arab world.\n\nLeaving out Libya, which continues to battle with consistent civil unrest and hasn\u2019t really broken ground in the startup world, and Mauritania, which is relatively small and mostly underdeveloped, startups across the other three nations raised an estimated $72 million in 2021. Algerian startups raised $30 million; Morocco recorded an all-time high of $29 million; and Tunisia closed north of $23 million.\n\nThis is a landmark growth from the $20.1 million raised across 19 deals in 2020. But when you break these numbers down into deals and compare them to Egypt\u2019s over $600 million funding in 2021, the conversation on how disturbingly small the funding is comes up. When it comes to venture funding, Egypt has always been North Africa\u2019s leader, capturing up to 80% of investment flows into the region from 2015 to 2021, per Baobab.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHowever, this is not a question of why Egypt dominates with such a huge margin but why the combined startup funding secured by five nations couldn\u2019t match up with at least a quarter of what their neighbour did. What\u2019s the problem of the Maghreb region, and how can the ecosystem rise to its full potential?\n\nTo set the context, the region has several problems that, if not resolved soon, may not only continue to shrink the potential of its burgeoning startup sector but could bury it completely. But here are five reasons funding is low in this region.\n\nIntra-regional conflict\n\nThe Maghreb countries don\u2019t see eye-to-eye; they are archenemies or, as they are popularly called, \u201cenemy brothers\u201d. It\u2019s gradually becoming clearer that these nations are incapable of cooperatively forgoing their cat-and-rat history and assembling their social and cultural similarities to achieve greater economic progress.\n\nThis enmity continues to subdue the economic potential of the region because each of the countries practices a closed-border policy, which hinders seamless intra-regional trade, especially between Morocco and Algeria. These two nations arguably hold the key to the region\u2019s prosperity but have instead contributed the most to its misfortune.\n\nDue to the hostile intra-regional trade culture, it\u2019s difficult for startups to project growth in terms of expansion across the Maghreb. That means it\u2019ll be difficult for a Moroccan company to expand into the Algerian market.\n\nA 100-kilometer fence along the Morocco-Algeria border built by the Moroccan government\n\nFor example, when Chari, a Moroccan startup that helps retailers access consumer products faster and cheaper, wanted to expand into Tunisia, it had to set up an entirely new company that has no ties with the mother company apart from the name and business model.\n\n\u201cWe had to start another company in Tunisia, with all the paperwork. We had to also hire a new general manager and local team, and basically duplicate the company in Tunisia,\u201d said Ismael Belkhayat, co-founder and CEO at Chari. \u201cSo we don\u2019t handle Tunisia from Morocco; our Tunisia operation is independent.\u201d\n\nThis shows that there is no business exchange between the countries; there is no unified environment, which means there are no real regional markets. How do you then pitch an investor to back a venture that operates in a broken market like the Maghreb?\n\nHostile bureaucracy\n\nSurprisingly, countries in the Maghreb region aren\u2019t completely in disagreement with one other. They all have something in common: a heavy and killer administrative process. Across the region, there\u2019s an administrative office called Office des Changes, a bureau that regulates all monetary transactions. The body monitors money that comes in and goes out of each country.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: as a startup, you can\u2019t do as little as spend on Google or Facebook Ads without consulting the bureau. If you want to advertise on Google or Facebook, you either need to pay a local tax or get special authorisation to spend money outside Morocco or Algeria or Tunisia. This isn\u2019t only applicable outside of the Maghreb but also within it.\n\nHence, local companies mostly consume local services and not foreign. Therefore, it is more difficult to leverage sophisticated tools to drive growth or even maintain operations across the board\u2014the bureau has made sure of that. Imagine not being able to use Trello or Slack because your country won\u2019t allow you to subscribe to them without charging your purse dry.\n\nThis same principle is applicable to investors. It\u2019s a tad difficult and expensive to pull out your funds after investing in the Maghreb region; you must pay a great chunk of tax to the bureau. All of this rigid bureaucracy makes it difficult for startups in the region to pull foreign investment.\n\nThe big don\u2019t trust the small\n\nThe Maghreb tech ecosystem is an unusual one, and startups are literally on their own. In Nigeria, for instance, big conventional banks back fintech startups, and FMCGs invest in e-commerce and logistic upstarts.\n\nIt\u2019s not like that in the North African region.\n\nBig local companies mistrust startups, mostly because of how easy it is for startups to shut down in the region. For them to trust, back and also, maybe, provide seed \u201cmarket\u201d (goods supplies), you must have at least a two-years track record.\n\nThe irony is, if nobody is ready to back a green early-stage company, how will it survive and be around for the two-year mark? It\u2019s a vicious cycle that puts startups in a very tight corner because it seems everything is designed to kill them. How can foreign investors trust a brand or product that potential local investors won\u2019t back?\n\nLack of fintech innovation\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t have been a reason if Africa had not experienced the power of fintech. Startups that play in this space attract big-cheque investors. Across the four biggest African tech hubs\u2014Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt\u2014fintech attracts the biggest funding. Even in Egypt, where logistics and e-commerce attracted more funding, the $120 million investment secured by MNT-Halan, a fintech company, remains its biggest single deal till today.\n\nWhen you move up west, the absence of fintech starts to show. Noureddine Tayebi, founder and CEO of Yassir, an Algeria-originated Maghreb-focused logistic company that raised all the $30 million for Algeria, confirmed to TechCabal over a call that \u2014 even though his company is active towards building a fintech product that will support their business\u2014 there are currently no fintech solutions in Algeria. Belkhayat also said the same about Morocco, though he mentioned that Tunisia has a few like Paymee, which he was sure will likely survive because of the supportive startup act the country enacted in 2018.\n\nBoth local and foreign investors are bullish on fintech startups, especially in Africa, and going by trends from the last five years, it\u2019s expected that entrepreneurs in the Maghreb countries will double down on fintech and court investors for more investments.\n\nHowever, Belkhayat thinks for a fintech to actually scale, it needs enough capital that is mostly not available to their startups at the early stage. This may be another reason why these countries will be stuck with cash going forward.\n\nLanguage barrier\n\nThe Maghreb region speaks French and that makes it a francophone region. According to Belkhayat, most of the available foreign investors communicate in English, so a founder who can\u2019t speak English talking to an investor who doesn\u2019t understand nor speaks French is already disadvantaged.\n\n\u201cMost VC funds are based in countries where people speak English, compared to French-speaking countries. Therefore, it\u2019s more complicated for us to raise money than the anglophones,\u201d said Belkhayat.\n\nBefore 2021, venture funding in francophone African countries was extremely low, with Morocco and Tunisia being the leaders per investment. But this year, Senegal took the lead after fintech startup Wave raised a record $200 million Series A. Apart from this deal, VC funding activity remained pretty much subdued in the region last year.\n\nAlso, both Belkhayat, his co-founder Sophia Alj and Tayebi are American-trained businessmen who have worked with top American organisations and understand the languages of the investors. Niama El Bassunie\u2014the founder/CEO at Waystocap, another Morrocan e-commerce business that was acquired by Egypt-based Fawry\u2014is also a UK-trained and based expert. So when you zoom in, it becomes clearer why their companies were able to raise enough capital, unlike others.\n\nThese are the struggles every Maghrebian startup faces while trying to raise foreign investment. Most importantly, the intra-region conflict that has led to lack of business exchange has to be fixed. Once that\u2019s solved, just like a domino effect, every other thing should gradually fall in place.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "EDITORS\u2019 NOTES\n\nOur dear readers, I want to say a big thank you for loving the brand, engaging with the publication, sharing our articles and reports, attending our events, and doing business with us. It\u2019s been an incredible year for us in which we launched TechCabal 3.0 to build a truly pan-African technology publication. We established a physical presence in Kenya and hired Nairobi-based African American technology journalist, Alexandria Williams. Our newsroom grew in order to expand our coverage beyond startup reporting to include consumer tech and Big Tech, which covers the telecoms and banking payment sectors. We broke the earth-shattering news of the dissolution of First Bank\u2019s board by the Central Bank of Nigeria governor, Godwin Emefiele, and the unsuspected high churn of tech talent within Nigeria\u2019s fifth-largest lender Guaranty Trust Bank, which was responsible for its poor mobile services. We have held hands with high-profile leaders in technology and governance to work on the Nigerian Startup Bill to straighten things up as the country\u2019s startup ecosystem witnessed shocking regulatory interruptions this year. Thankfully, the bill has been approved by the executive and is now headed to parliament, hopefully for passing into law soon. 2022 will see us expand into more countries and hire writers on ground across the continent to bring you unrivalled reports on the impact of technology in Africa. Thank you once again and remember to share our articles with your network, because everyone is invited! Happy new year! Adegoke Oyeniyi, Editor-in-Chief Hey everyone, So, how about 2021, am I right? What a whirlwind of a year for Africa\u2019s technology and business ecosystem. We raised money, backed new founders, launched new venture funds, acquired smaller companies, and expanded into new markets. I joined TechCabal in January of this year to help drive TechCabal\u2019s transition from a Nigerian tech publication to a pan-African tech and media publication. This transition had already begun before I said \u201cyes\u201d to the job, but TechCabal 3.0 really grew legs and picked up speed in 2021. And what a hectic year it was for the newsroom. Two brilliant TechCabal reporters moved to other companies (Alexander Onukwue is now at Quartz, and Muyiwa Olowogboyega is doing great work with Lemonade Finance). We brought in new reporters, contributors, and editors onboard (Michael Ajifowoke, Damilare Dosunmu, Timi Odueso, Alexandria Williams, Sultan Quadri and Kelechi Njoku). And as always, we wrote about the impact of technology in Africa. TechCabal Wrapped is our way of walking you through our most-loved and most-read articles in 2021. I encourage you to (re)read, share, and discuss your favourite pieces with your friends and peers. Thanks for sticking with us this year. I can\u2019t wait to connect with you in the new year. Happy holidays. \ud83e\udd42 Koromone Koroye, Managing Editor\n\nHere\u2019s what you enjoyed reading from TechCabal in 2021\n\nIn 2021, TechCabal published 683 articles, 265 editions of TC Daily\u2014including this one\u2014and 50 editions of Next Wave. the Next Wave. Of all these articles, here are the top ten you enjoyed reading the most:\n\n1. iPhone 13 series price in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa After about a year of speculation and anticipation, Apple released the iPhone 13 series with newer features like larger batteries, more storage (maximum of 1 terabyte storage), new A15 Bionic processors, smaller notches, and new camera features. In this article, we reached out to trusted Apple retailers across the country and explored the prices of the new iPhones in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. 2. The Next Wave: When tweeting becomes a crime The Next Wave is a weekly in-depth analysis of tech and innovation in Africa that serves as a post-pandemic guide. In this edition, Alexander Onwukwue examined digital regression and social media activism in the aftermath of Nigeria\u2019s ongoing Twitter ban. 3. Kenya\u2019s high court issues landmark ruling against Uber In 2016, 34 plaintiffs filed a suit against Uber Kenya Limited. Their claim? Uber\u2019s group of companies had violated an online contract signed by drivers in Kenya.\n\nIn October, the High Court of Kenya finally issued its ruling on the issue, highlighting growing contradictions between faraway multinational tech companies and the growth of Kenya\u2019s tech industry. 4. Overworked staff, mass exits: The inside story of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures\n\nThe Great Resignation hit one of Nigeria\u2019s largest banks and, like in other countries, was brought on by rampant stress and the shift to remote work.\n\nIn this article, Daniel Adeyemi and Goke Oyeniyi took us behind the scenes of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures, a phenomenon that plagued many of the bank\u2019s customers in the first half of 2021.\n\n5. Five top instant loan apps in Nigeria\n\nThis year, loan apps on the continent have garnered a reputation for their uncouth recovery methods. Loans, however, still remain the go-to outlet for developing businesses or personal finances.\n\nAs countries continue to clamp down on the unethical practices of some of these apps, TechCabal made a list of some of the best instant loan apps democratising access to credit and bridging financial inclusion with healthy practices.\n\n6. Meet Abeg, Big Brother Naija sponsor and app of the hour\n\nWith an audience of 309 million and billions of impressions across social media, Big Brother Nigeria is one of West Africa\u2019s most-watched television programmes.\n\nLast year, tech companies like Kudabank, Patricia, and even Flutterwave threw their weight behind the show with sponsorship. This year, one of the biggest sponsors of BBN, however, was a newcomer platform called Abeg, who reportedly sponsored the show with $2 million.\n\n7. Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank freezes bank accounts of fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka\n\nAs this year marks several wins for the Nigerian startup scene at large, it\u2019s also the year the Nigerian government came down hard on the ecosystem. From crippling bans to questionable policies, Nigeria went after creators and founders in the economy.\n\nIn August, this manifested with the Central Bank of Nigeria freezing the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove, and Chaka.\n\n8. From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate\n\nOne of the trending questions of the ecosystem in 2021 was: How can more people get into tech?\n\nTo this end, TechCabal wrote quite a number of articles and flagships to help people navigate the wonderful world of tech. This article, however, takes a different approach with a narrative voice that follows the story of Kemi, who went from hawking dry fish to working as a software engineer at Bloomberg.\n\n9. How Herconomy raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours\n\nIn 2021, Nigerian startups raised about $1.4 billion. TechCabal has done a number of stories on some of these raises, most of which are led by venture capitals or private equity firms.\n\nVery few have angel investors leading the raises and even fewer have product users participating in those ventures. In this article, we explored how one startup, Herconomy, raised a $600,000 pre-seed round in 24 hours, with members of its community as angel investors.\n\n10. Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem pays tribute to Nnena Nkongho\n\nNnena Nkongho.\n\nThe African tech ecosystem mourns the passing of Nnena Nkongho, an African investor who championed diversity and excellence.\n\nAs a way of remembering Nkongho\u2019s greatness and contribution to technology communities at home and abroad, TechCabal published tributes sent to us by people who knew and worked with Nkongho during her lifetime.\n\nIf you\u2019ve enjoyed any of our articles, please forward and share them with your networks on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "21 things that happened for the first time in 2021 in the African tech scene",
          "text": "2021 has been a noteworthy year that has seen the African tech sector bounce back from the difficulties it faced in 2020. Here\u2019s a list of 21 things that happened for the first time in the African tech scene this year.\n\nAfrican artists raked in thousands of dollars from selling NFTs (digital art)\n\nThe growing popularity of NFTs has puzzled many, yet it has opened the door for artists and creators from Africa to sell their content to a global audience. With global sales of NFTs topping $2.5 billion in the first half of 2021, we saw African artists like Niyi Okeowo and Nyahan Tachie-Menson sell thousands of dollars worth of NFT; Osinachi sell $75,000 worth of crypto art in 10 days; and Nyasha Warambwa\u2019s work got featured on the New York Times Square billboard.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened in Malawi.\n\nThe world\u2019s first 3D printed school opened its doors in July, in Malawi. The school was built by 14Trees, a joint venture between a British development firm and a Swiss company that specialises in building materials. The school\u2019s walls were printed in just 18 hours, compared to the several days it takes to build with conventional building materials. The process in general significantly minimises the time, cost, and materials used for building houses and schools. Hopefully, this technology can help address the severe shortage of schools in the country.\n\nThe African startup ecosystem raised a record $4 billion+ in venture capital funding\n\n2021 year was a landmark year for the African tech ecosystem, raising over $4 billion via 754 deals in venture capital funding. The Big Four\u2014Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Egypt\u2014accounted for 80% of the total amount raised and 76% of the deals.\n\nAn autonomous drone was deployed to attack humans in Libya, the UN says\n\nA report published in March 2021 by the United Nations (UN) Panel of Experts on Libya stated that a drone had been used to \u201chunt down and remotely engage\u201d soldiers who are believed to have been loyal to Libya\u2019s General Khalifa Haftar. This case revisits the conversation on the ethics of using drones in military attacks. How reliable is the technology behind drones, and what could be the implication of a malfunction or error?\n\nApple appointed its first-ever country leader for Nigeria\n\nApple has sold over a billion smartphones (iPhones), yet they account for less than 10% of the smartphone market in Nigeria. In March, the announcement of the appointment of Teju Ajani as Apple\u2019s first-ever managing director for Nigeria is an indication of the tech giant\u2019s interest in Nigeria.\n\nAfrican regulators began responding to the unethical practices of digital lenders\n\nAfter many years of complaints about the predatory tactics of digital lenders, regulators in Nigeria and Kenya began taking steps to curtail it. A Nigerian regulator imposed a \u20a610 million naira ($18,000) fine on Soko Lending company and the Kenyan government recently put a law in place to curtail the excesses of digital lenders.\n\nApple Pay launched in Africa\n\nEight years after Apple launched Apple Pay, its payment and digital wallet system, the tech giant finally brought it to Africa, with its launch in South Africa this year. This launch came three years after Samsung launched its Samsung Pay in South Africa. This move speaks of Apple\u2019s intention to increase its penetration in sub-Saharan Africa where the adoption of digital payments has increased since the start of the pandemic.\n\nGhana kicked off its first fully digital census in West Africa\n\nIn June, Ghana started its first fully digital national census\u2014the first ever in West Africa. The country\u2019s last census was in 2010, and it put the population at 24.6 million. The country has, every 10 years since 1981, conducted the Population and Housing Census (PHC) but was forced to postpone the 2020 census due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nNigeria became the first African country to roll out a digital currency\n\nOn October 25, Nigeria became the first country in Africa, and one of the first in the world, to introduce a digital currency. Developed by Barbados-based fintech company Bitt Inc., the eNaira is a legal tender just like the naira. According to the country\u2019s central bank, it must be accepted by all merchants and business outlets as a form of payment in Nigeria. The digital currency is expected to boost cross-border trade and financial inclusion, make transactions more efficient as well as improve monetary policy.\n\nSenegalese TikTok megastar Khaby Lame hit a 100 million followers milestone without saying a word\n\nIn August, Senegalese-born Khaby Lame became the second person ever to hit and cross the 100-million-followers mark on TikTok. Lame, a 21-year-old former factory worker living in Italy on a Senegalese passport, has crafted a comedic brand that has resonated around the world by putting so-called life hacks or complicated manoeuvres through the lens of intuitive everyday options.\n\nGoogle announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Africa\n\nAt the first virtual Google for Africa event, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced the company\u2019s plan to invest $1billion over five years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\neCommerce giant Amazon stepped up its presence in Africa\n\nFor a long while, there have been questions about when Amazon will kick off operations in Africa. Well, Amazon answered that question this year. First, it affirmed its commitment to Egypt by replacing Souq.com as Amazon\u2019s selling platform in the country with Amazon.eg. This announcement also came with the inauguration of an Amazon fulfilment centre in Egypt. There was also the announcement of Amazon\u2019s controversial African headquarters in South Africa.\n\nThere was an acquisitions spree across Africa\n\nThis year saw a number of companies being acquired, most of them for undisclosed amounts. MainOne, a West African data centre and connectivity solutions provider, was acquired by Equinix for $320 million.\n\nMFS Africa acquired Baxi. MaxAB, an Egyptian B2B marketplace, acquired WaystoCap. Ghanaian fintech startup, Zeepay, acquired 51% of Zambian counterpart Mangwee. Plentywaka acquired Stabus Ghana after $1.2m seed funding. Other notable acquisitions include JIji acquiring Cars45, and Ourpass acquiring Storemia.\n\nThe Ethiopian government launched its own mobile money service\n\nIn May 2021, Ethio telecom launched its own mobile money service, TeleBirr, to cater for the 115 million people in Africa\u2019s third most populous country. Two months after its launch, TeleBirr reported that it has gained six million users. The new service is expected to make a difference in Ethiopia where the banking system is seen as inefficient, with only 19 commercial banks serving the entire population.\n\nFrancophone Africa got its first unicorn in Wave\n\nWave, a spinoff from Asia- and Africa-focused remittance company Sendwave, raised $200 million in a Series A round to become the first unicorn from the French-speaking region of Africa. Why Wave? The startup\u2019s low-cost transaction service has helped it take on incumbents, eat into their market share, and turn the entire mobile money industry on its head.\n\nSix months and counting: Nigerian Twitter ban\n\nThe Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operations in June, following the social media platform\u2019s decision to delete a tweet by Buhari, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The state\u2019s decision to ban Twitter has since then triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits; and national assembly hearings meant to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nSudanese tech got its first foreign funding in 30 years\n\nalsoug, the largest digital marketplace in Sudan, raised a $5 million investment round co-led by Egyptian fintech unicorn, Fawry, and a \u201cwider consortium of Western venture capital firms\u201d. This investment marked the first foreign venture capital investment into the Sudanese tech ecosystem since international sanctions on the country were lifted in 2020, following a 30-year isolation period.\n\nSomalia got its first Visa card payment service\n\nVisa partnered with the International Bank of Somalia (IBS Bank) to launch Somalia\u2019s first Visa card payment service. This came six years after Mastercard became the first international payment network to enter the Somalia market. This partnership is an important indicator that Somalia, a country that had no formal banking or financial system since the collapse of its government in 1991, has been making serious headway towards reawakening the pulse of its financial entities.\n\nEthiopia awarded its first telecom license\n\nIn May, Ethiopia awarded its first telecom licence to a consortium made up of Vodafone, Nairobi-based Safaricom Ltd, CDC Group Plc, and Sumitomo Corp. The next month, Ethiopia launched a tendering process for the proposed sell-off of a 40% stake in the state-owned Ethio Telecom to private investors. These actions are all parts of the government\u2019s broader plan to open up the economy.\n\nTwitter opened its first Africa office in Ghana\n\nIn April 2021 social media giant Twitter announced Ghana as its choice for an African headquarters. The move came as a surprise to some who expected it to be Nigeria, a country with more Twitter users and a larger population overall. Twitter cleared the air by stating that its reasons for choosing Ghana were because the country was a \u201csupporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet\u201d.\n\nThe continent produced a record number of new unicorns in a year\n\nThere are a total of eight tech unicorns in Africa right now, with five of them\u2014Flutterwave, Andela, ChipperCash, Wave, and Opay\u2014attaining this status in 2021. Notably, fintech is having its moment as the majority of the unicorns are fintechs. The other companies that attained unicorn status before this year are Interswitch, Jumia, and Fawry.\n\nThat\u2019s all for 2021! What events did we miss out on, and what first-time surprises do you think await us in 2022?\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

That\u2019s how significant the exponential growth in the fintech space has been in recent years, and it creates room for bullishness in the space. But then, no one can see the future, and we can only use past experiences to gauge future expectations.\n\nFor instance, Nigerian fintech funding in 2021, $800 million, was 120% higher than funding in the last three years combined. Also, there are new dimensions to our understanding of fintech companies.\n\nIn 2020, we saw the rise of API fintech companies, which we examined closely. In 2021, we saw the launch of an open banking framework and lending companies deepen their tentacles in the Nigerian market.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling what to expect, but for the fifth year running, Adedeji Olowe, a Trustee of Open Banking Nigeria, has made interesting predictions for the fintech space in 2022. While you can find the predictions on his website, our tradition for the past two years has been to give them relevant context and leave you with the caveat: No one can really predict the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom foreign exchange disruptions, expected acquisitions, and a new KYC king, here\u2019s a peek behind the curtains for Olowe\u2019s fintech predictions for 2022.\n\nThe market goes super-hot. New unicorns are born. Old players die.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Kglavin via Wikipedia Commons\n\nIn 2021, Africa minted five unicorns, two of which were Nigerian fintech companies. With $800 million in fintech funding in 2021 and the CBN licensing new payment services providers, Olowe believes there will be heavy competition in Nigeria\u2019s fintech space in 2022.\n\n\u201cThe market becomes competitive like crazy; fintechs would use dollars as weapons to snap talents and do marketing; larger and ballsy fintechs may start doing their APIs directly, bypassing Mono and others. When the smoke clears, the battlefield would be full of dead bodies,\u201d he declared.\n\nOlowe maintains that the aftermath of this battle would see new players crowned unicorns and any of the older players born before 2015 sink.\n\nThere\u2019s not much to reflect on here that hasn\u2019t been said already, but in these kinds of battles, the only clear winner is usually the customer. The only exceptions would be cases of companies using severely unethical practices to gain a competitive advantage. In this case, the media\u2019s watchful eye will be very important.\n\nA global giant comes to play; I will pay you with WhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cStripe came in 2020 to buy Paystack but not to play. But in 2022, my blurry eyes see a global player coming to play big time,\u201d Olowe says.\n\nThough Africa has witnessed much growth in recent years, most global tech giants do not take the African market seriously. But we began to see a shift last year, with Google playing a major role and launching a $1 billion fund to build giant subsea cables and fund startups, among others.\n\nLast year, we saw TechCrunch hire its first African reporter to increase its coverage of Africa. Also, in 2021, Apple appointed a country manager for Nigeria and Twitter opened its first African office. However, these moves do not show full intent to set up shop in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle and Apple stores are unavailable in Nigeria; PayPal still only allows Nigerians to send money. It appears the market is still too nascent for most prominent players, so why would a global fintech player come in?\n\n\u201cThe market is hot as hell; alternative payments methods, such as virtual accounts, have proven to be very successful. API players like OnePipe and Mono are doing very well and shipping data around like smugglers, and lastly, open banking would go live once the standards are approved by the CBN. There is simply no better time to be here,\u201d Olowe argues.\n\nHe\u2019s betting that WhatsApp comes back with payments and could build on their shaky launch in Brazil and India with a push for the African market.\n\nRecall that when WhatsApp launched its payment service in Brazil earlier in 2021, the country\u2019s central bank put a hold on things. It\u2019s unlikely that WhatsApp\u2019s payment play would be good news to existing banks and fintech players.\n\nConsidering how Paystack and Flutterwave helped trigger a wave of startups in Nigeria, would global players\u2019 entry into the Nigerian market open the doors to more big tech players in other sectors?\n\nVisa and Mastercard acquire Interswitch and eTranzact, respectively\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlowe made this prediction in 2021, and remains adamant that both moves make perfect sense for the two major incumbents of global payments services.\n\n\u201cNaira is at an all-time low, and Interswitch fundamentals are anchored on the naira, which makes them cheaper and because they are a grown-ass fintech, they can\u2019t enjoy the 20x EBITDA multiple that smaller and younger fintechs use for their valuation. But then, they are a behemoth, and they control 90%+ of ISO card traffic in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSide note: EBITDA (Earnings Before Interests, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortisation) multiples are used to calculate startup valuations, and it varies depending on the growth potential perceived in that industry. For instance, a tech company would have a higher EBITDA multiple than a manufacturing company because of the perceived growth potential.\n\nSo far, Mastercard has dominated more in Nigeria, and Olowe believes Visa\u2019s next big play would be to buy Interswitch. Considering Interswitch\u2019s influence, he insists that the only option is for Mastercard to acquire Visa.\n\nMTN launches PSB and blows everyone away\n\nTelco-led mobile money has not gained much traction compared to Kenya and Ghana. Nigerian telcos have struggled to get a banking licence from the CBN, and though 9mobile and Glo received theirs in 2019, other players like TeamApt and OPay have stolen the headlines.\n\nLeveraging a strong belief in the execution prowess of MTN\u2019s CEO, Karl Toriola, Olowe predicted that MTN would finally get a PSB licence in 2021, and it did, alongside Airtel.\n\n\u201cMTN would drive its PSB so hard and super agents so amazingly, they would quickly suck the oxygen out of the market. \u201cI expect a rapid decimation of Super Agents when MTN\u2019s PSB goes live,\u201d Olowe declared.\n\nOlowe\u2019s bullishness is not without good cause. He explains to Techpoint that MTN has a history of executing with surgical precision, aptly exemplified by their dominance of the Nigerian and Ghanaian markets.\n\nWith 73.6 million subscribers, MTN controls 38% of Nigeria\u2019s telecom market. But that\u2019s not the whole story. At its annual general meeting in September 2021, it announced that it had 88% nationwide network coverage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m super curious about who Karl would anoint as the CEO of the bank, though; I smell some ex orange-coloured EDs who know all the tricks of the traditional banks and where dead bodies can be buried,\u201d Olowe mused.\n\nThe reference to ex orange-coloured executive directors seemingly points to Guaranty Trust Bank, with its orange-themed colours. But it\u2019s too soon to say.\n\nPer Olowe, MTN would also learn of the difficulties of working with two regulators, the CBN and the NCC, one of which is very strict.\n\nIn Ghana, MTN\u2019s mobile money dominance triggered legislative actions in 2020, to stem a monopoly. While that\u2019s a possibility in Nigeria, the market is way bigger and more competitive.\n\nFree transfers and realisation of financial inclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, the CBN implemented policies that reduced transaction fees for bank transfers, but nothing happened in 2021. For Olowe, this could either be a prediction or a wishlist, as he maintains that if it doesn\u2019t come to pass on its own, he will devote his energy to making it a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n\u201cMake transfers below a certain amount free for everyone, and you have a good chance of bringing financial inclusion to every Nigerian,\u201d he argues, saying that \u201cThe last time the cost of transfer went down to \u20a610, the market jumped like drops of water inside hot oil.\u201d\n\nAll things considered, free transfers would largely benefit people with bank accounts and drive cashless adoption, but that might only be the starting point for financial inclusion. Credit and insurance remain big mountains to climb for financial inclusion, but free transfers would not hurt the vision at all.\n\nLending becomes hot; bigger banks jump in and get shocked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to an analysis by Lendsqr, a lending tech startup, Nigeria has a \u20a674 trillion lending gap across SME lending, asset, smartphone, laptop, education, vehicle, and mortgage financing. Despite the regulatory attention being directed towards unethical players, the space is still exploding.\n\nAs a result of this opportunity, Olowe holds that five of Nigeria\u2019s top ten banks would delve into the lending space without looking and, consequently, have disastrous experiences.\n\n\u201cThey will fail because their loans would be packed like corporate bank credits.\u201d\n\nOpen banking goes live. API players are shaken off the tree\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, we saw the rise of API-fintech startups such as Okra, Mono, and OnePipe, which have all raised impressive amounts of funding. In 2021, the CBN launched an open banking framework, and Olowe believes it will go live in 2022.\n\n\u201cNow, open banking is significantly more comprehensive, faster, and safer than the APIs being sold. And because only licensed players would be allowed, the market may shake some old API providers out the way mobile Internet killed business centres,\u201d he argues.\n\nOlowe is a Trustee at Open Banking Nigeria and has been deeply involved in ensuring open APIs become a reality in Nigeria. If you\u2019re not sure how open APIs work or what an API is, check out the analogy in this piece.\n\n\u201cAPI fintechs are seen as the broker between two parties. How? By accepting messages from the sender, passing them as requests to the receiver, and returning data to the sender. Similarly, via API calls, users can request information from the broker at any time,\u201d reads an excerpt from our previous article.\n\nThough Olowe holds this position, Abdul Hassan, Mono CEO, maintains that API fintechs are building the infrastructure to enable open banking. There\u2019s more.\n\nIf you have any interest in fintech, then check out the two articles linked in this section and either keep a close eye on proceedings or become an active player yourself.\n\nNIN dethrones BVN. CBN\u2019s fear comes true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunched in 2014, the Bank Verification Number (BVN) is a unique identifier for every user of financial services in Nigeria. To date, there are over 51.8 million registered BVNs in Nigeria.\n\nIn 2021, citing the misuse of the BVN, the CBN clamped down on several fintech providers and limited access to the BVN. However, this move coincided with the resurgence of the National Identity Number (NIN), which had enrolled over 71 million people as of December 31, 2021.\n\nThe NIN is increasingly becoming the digital identity of choice, but there are some question marks around its security.\n\n\u201cThe only problem is NIN being government property means data security and privacy may be poor. Soon, a major breach happens, and DSS is called to fish out fintech founders,\u201d Olowe surmised.\n\nDigital identity has been a significant problem for most Nigerian businesses, and while enrollments for the NIN are skyrocketing with the help of private companies, questions around security would have to be addressed. With the presence of VerifyMe and Youverify, there\u2019ll be plenty to talk about on this front in 2022.\n\nFX goes the crypto way. P2P FX transactions power investment apps. CBN is upset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: majjed2008 Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nIn 2021, the CBN clamped down on several companies operating anything remotely connected to foreign transactions. It started in 2020. The naira\u2019s value was in free-fall against the dollar, and the country\u2019s apex bank was taking no prisoners as it dealt brutal blows to any party it deemed responsible.\n\nIt came after remittance services providers, mobile money operators, then it went after crypto startups, next was the investment tech startups, and soon after, FX platform, abokifx.com. With many Nigerians shopping online and interacting with several foreign websites, there\u2019s still pressure on the naira.\n\nOlowe believes that these clampdowns could lead to a P2P play by FX dealers, a move that saved the crypto space from regulatory scrutiny, for better or for worse.\n\n\u201cWhile some investment apps may have gotten an injunction to prevent CBN from locking their accounts up, trust them to throw a party if P2P can save their business model,\u201d Olowe stated.\n\nSo there you have it.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nAfrica\u2019s $4.9bn funding in 2021\n\nCrypto price predictions for 2022\n\nmPharma\u2019s $35m Series D\n\nAfrican startups raised $4.9bn in 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTowards the end of 2021, Twitter went agog with tweets of people claiming to have 2x, 23x, and even 47x their incomes during the year. Personally, every prayer point this year will have 23x in it; I must not be left out.\n\nAs people announced an incredulous increase in income levels, the African startup ecosystem also saw a significant rise in funding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ecosystem wasn\u2019t left out of the 2x trend. Briter Bridges\u2019 African Investment Report 2021 has revealed that African startups raised $4.9 billion in 2021. That\u2019s more than the $1.3billion raised in 2020.\n\nFintech still rules: As usual, fintech startups received the lion share, going as high as 62% \u2014 $3 billion. Healthtech came in second with 8%, followed by other top sectors, including logistics, edtech, cleantech, and agritech. Interestingly, fintech accounted for 31% of funding in 2020, while cleantech was second with 22%.\n\nNigeria held the top position as the country with the most deals and funding, coming from second place in 2020. South Africa was second while Kenya and Egypt were third and fourth, respectively.\n\nWhich sector will overtake fintech? My money is still on fintech leading the pack in 2022.\n\nHowever, some other sectors have been gaining significant investor attention. Briter Bridges\u2019 report showed that after payments, transfers, and banking, medical delivery, and B2B eCommerce are some of the most funded products.\n\nOur reporter, Chimgozirim, will be doing a detailed article on the report. Kindly look out for it before the week runs out.\n\nCrypto price predictions for 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by CardMapr.nl on Unsplash\n\nThe crypto market in 2021 started on a very bullish note. The first and biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, Bitcoin, began the year with an all-time high (ATH) of $28,994.\n\nIn April 2021, surpassing ATH after ATH, it reached $63,285, a 118% increase between January and April. However, a downtrend began in May; Bitcoin fell by almost 51%, trading at less than $35,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore the end of the year, Bitcoin proved why it was number one with an epic bounce back, recording another ATH of over $66,000 in October. However, it could not sustain the price as it dropped to a low of $47,000 at the year\u2019s close.\n\nBesides Bitcoin, 2021 had interesting tokens such as SHIBA INU that grew by 49,000,000%. Investing $100 in the token in 2020 would have culminated into a whopping $53 million during its 2021 ATH.\n\nWhat does the future hold for the crypto market in 2022? 2021 has taught us that innovation has a huge role to play when it comes to crypto prices. The Solana blockchain came up with faster transactions at low costs, offering innovative capabilities like NFTs and decentralised finance just like Ethereum.\n\nIts native coin, Sol, grew by more than 16,000% in 2021. We also saw gaming and metaverse tokens such as Decentraland and Sandbox record impressive gains.\n\nAnalytics Insights has highlighted predictions that include Bitcoin reaching $100,000 and SHIBA INU recording another 300% gain.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ll be examining these predictions and how they correlate with innovations in the blockchain space. Make sure you watch out for editions of Crypto Explorer this month.\n\nmPharma secures $35m Series D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: TechCrunch\n\nGhanaian healthtech startup, mPharma, has closed a $35 million Series D to become the primary healthcare provider for millions of Africans.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the funding comprises $30 million equity funding and $5 million debt financing by Citibank. The $30 million equity financing saw investments from JAM Fund, Unbound and Lux Capital.\n\nFounded in 2013 by Gregory Rockson, Daniel Shoukimas, and James Finucane, mPharma started as a prescription drug inventory. Now, it has mutti pharmacies that serve as mini hospitals, providing services including medical consultation, diagnostic, and telehealth services which it added in October 2021.\n\nAccording to Joseph Opoku, Global Operations Manager, mPharma, the company is building the largest telemedicine network in Africa through its mutti pharmacies.\n\nmPharma plans to use the funding to build out its data infrastructure and invest in skilled talents like doctors and nurses, and other professionals relevant to its cause.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nOn the National Red Line.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019re discussing today:\n\nTwitter\u2019s second African office?\n\nGahez\u2019s pre-seed funding\n\nFedaPay secures funding\n\nTwitter\u2019s second African office\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter over six months of accessing Twitter using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), Nigerians may soon access the social media platform freely. The Nation reports that the company has met the six conditions imposed by the Nigerian government.\n\nTo refresh your memory, here are the conditions that the Federal government insisted on: an office in Nigeria, a country representative, payment of fair taxes, register with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC)/get a license from the National Broadcasting Commission, sensitivity to national security and cohesion, and train Nigerian IT personnel and strategic intelligence officers on how to report Twitter abuse/infractions noticed by the government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a source quoted by The Nation, Twitter\u2019s hesitance to open an office in Nigeria last year stemmed from it not being part of its 2021 budget. The source also expressed optimism that as the new year rolls out, the company will open an office.\n\nWhile it sounds like good news, this raises a few concerns. The first is that going by the report, Twitter is being coerced into opening an office in Nigeria. Ideally, this should create jobs and government revenue but could ensure government control over the microblogging site.\n\nAppointing a country representative also enables the government to hold someone accountable whenever they believe that Twitter has infringed on some of its laws.\n\nThis is the second time that reports have suggested that the ban could be lifted, and Nigerians would hope that things play out differently this time. However, owing to Twitter\u2019s silence on negotiations, it could be that it takes some time before the ban is lifted.\n\nGahez raises $2 million in pre-seed funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEgyptian eCommerce startup, Gahez, has raised $2 million in pre-seed funding. Disruptech Ventures led the round with Egypt Ventures, Tanmeyah, Afropreneur fund, and other angel investors participating.\n\nLaunched last year, the startup joins a slew of B2B eCommerce startups trying to digitise operations for Africa\u2019s merchants and manufacturers. Having worked with over 15,000 merchants and 142 manufacturers since its launch, the startup plans to use this fresh injection of capital to build its technology and recruit more staff.\n\nCo-founder and CEO, Wael Olama, in a statement, said, \u201cWe are on a mission to revolutionise the way retailers shop for their stores by relieving the stress of managing and sourcing. We believe that the Egyptian/African apparel market is untapped and widely fragmented, which provides Gahez with the perfect opportunity (relying on technology) to scale and position itself within the sphere.\u201d\n\nFedaPay secures funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeninese startup, FedaPay, has announced a first round of investment from the Benin Business Angel Network (BBAN).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaunched in 2018, FedaPay provides merchants with an efficient and secure payment system, enabling them to receive payments using cards and mobile money. Although the startup was founded in Benin, it has recently launched its services in neighbouring Niger.\n\nIn a statement, FedaPay\u2019s technical team lead and co-founder, Boris Koumondji, said, \u201cFedaPay is better than its Beninese competitors because it distinguishes itself by offering customised and flexible pricing that corresponds with its merchants\u2019 business models.\n\n\u201cFedaPay\u2019s payment method coverage allows them to take payments from customers via mobile money and bank cards in a single integration. All transactions that flow through the platform also adhere to the PCI DSS security criteria.\u201d\n\nCatch up on some of our best stories from 2021\n\n6 Nigerian agencies unite to fight data privacy abuse by money lending fintechs\n\nHow agritech startups are helping to check food inflation in Nigeria\n\nNigerian eCommerce platform, MallforAfrica, has shut down operations, possible rebranding could be imminent\n\nOpportunities\n\nAre you a 2021 Batch C Corps member with your PPA in a rural or semi-urban community in any of the 36 states of the country or Abuja?

          "title": "Inside Mafab\u2019s plan to become major Nigerian telco",
          "text": "After emerging as one of the two provisional winners of the 5G spectrum licence, Mafab Communications has set out plans to become a major Nigeria\u2019s telecommunications operator, according to a proposed document seen by BusinessDay.\n\nIn the document, the company discloses it is going to the market to raise $350 million via equity to finance the cost of the spectrum licence and other associated projects costs.\n\nThe little known telecom operator is hoping to complete the funding before the licence fee deadline. The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) had noted that the two winners were expected to complete payment of the winning bid price for the auction at $273.6 million for each lot of 100 MHz TDD licence by February 24, 2022. That means Mafab Communications has less than seven weeks to come up with the money.\n\nIn the document, Mafab is not only looking to raise $350 million via equity, but also intends to raise $1.59 billion via debt to complete a total of $1.9 billion funding activity. Mafab plans to offer 70 million units of its shares at N5 for equity funding.\n\nThe company has a broad target of deploying into over 6,000 sites within a five-year period. Sites here may refer to the 40,000 base transceiver sites that are located in different parts of Nigeria. It intends to deploy into 1,000 sites in the first year, 2,500 in the second year, 4,000 in the third year, 5,000 in the fourth year, and 6,000 in the fifth year. Within that timeline, the company also hopes to have grown its subscriber base to 7.5 million.\n\nTo achieve the targets, it has itemised three strategies \u2013 first of which is to secure the licence for 5G. However, deploying the 5G network without pre-existing 3G or 4G infrastructure will be a tall order for the company.\n\nTherefore, the second strategy is to obtain 3G and 4G deployment licences. In doing this, it outlines two options. The first is to propose this to the NCC as support for the New Entrant National Carrier to provide diverse services. The second is to acquire an existing telco and use the acquired telco\u2019s existing infrastructure and licence in the delivery of 3G and 4G services.\n\nThe third strategy involves the acquisition of operational assets such as a full Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV) architecture and modular data centres. NFV allows for the separation of communication services from dedicated hardware, such as routers and firewalls. This separation means network operations can provide new services dynamically and without installing new hardware.\n\nRead also: Mafab Communications, MTN face 4 hurdles ahead 5G deployment\n\nDeploying network components with network functions virtualisation takes hours instead of months, like with traditional networking. Also, the virtualised services can run on less expensive, generic servers instead of proprietary hardware.\n\nMafab, as well as MTN Nigeria, is required to pay the $273 million licence fee in naira at the prevailing Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) exchange rate. This may be the company\u2019s first major headache.\n\nThe naira is currently undergoing a period of high volatility. While the rate on the day the auction was concluded was N414, the naira has further weakened against the dollar ending the year on Friday, December 31, 2021, at N435 after the CBN adjusted the country\u2019s exchange rate on its website to N413.49 to a dollar.\n\nIn May, the apex bank devalued the naira from N379 to N411 per dollar after adopting the Investors and Exporters (I&E) window rate, also known as NAFEX rate.\n\nThe NAFEX rate, the official rate by the CBN, has oscillated between N414 and N415 in the past three months before the sudden fall to N435. The implication for Mafab is that if it had paid for the 5G licence on the day the announcement was made in naira at the prevailing CBN exchange rate as stipulated by the NCC, it would only have paid about N113 billion ($273 at N414 rate).\n\nExperts say the devaluation on December 31 may not be the last as the CBN could be using it as a strategy to balance the trade deficit. A country that imports more than it exports is likely to devalue its currency to reduce importation and thereby increase export.\n\nThis may not necessarily be to the advantage of Mafab and MTN, which would need to import most of the infrastructure they would need for the eventual deployment of 5G.\n\nAn expert, who pleaded anonymity, says Mafab\u2019s plan to raise equity is expected, but the concern for many investors would be how the company intends to pay back given that it is relatively new in the market and has little experience compared with its direct competitor, MTN Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe company and backers are relatively untested. I hope it doesn\u2019t end up like Etisalat\u2019s $1.2 billion bad debt,\u201d the expert says.\n\nAnother expert notes that the intention to raise equity would mean that Mafab did not have the money for the licence in the first place, nevertheless, it still went ahead to participate in the auction and as far as raising the price to such an extent that a notable existing operator like Airtel Africa, which last bid was at $270 million, had to exit the auction paving the way for Mafab to emerge.\n\nThe company\u2019s subscriber growth projection also comes across as too ambitious, especially for the internet market segment. It projects the acquisition of 1.5 million subscribers in the first year. It plans to double the figure to 3 million subscribers in the second year and going on to achieve a 65 percent growth in the third year at 5 million. It expects the growth to slow by about 35 percent in the fourth year at 6 million and the fifth year at 7 million.\n\nFirst, it needs to be said that subscriber growth in the telecom industry in recent years is not what it used to be like in 2014 and 2015, when broadband penetration was at less than 20 percent. Subscriber growth started fluctuating widely in 2016, with established operators like MTN and 9Mobile (then Etisalat) seeing declines in data subscription. Globacom and Airtel, which gained, did not see the big growth margins from the previous years.\n\nWhile 2017 was a big year for MTN and Airtel, it wasn\u2019t for Globacom and 9Mobile, which continued to see declines. Globacom managed to turn the tide in 2018, joining the likes of MTN and Airtel, whereas 9Mobile stayed on the losing end.\n\nIn 2019, Globacom missed a slide into decline by the whiskers to again join MTN and Airtel on the gainers\u2019 table, but 9Mobile wouldn\u2019t bulge from losing. 2020 was another big year for all the telcos with the exception of 9Mobile. However, 2021 ended in red for all four operators.\n\nMafab\u2019s five-year growth projection may not have taken appropriate considerations of the current realities. Growth generally has slowed down in the industry driven by the country\u2019s poor economic condition, which has affected many subscribers\u2019 income levels.\n\nTeniola Olusola, national coordinator, Alliance for Affordable Internet, told BusinessDay that a scenario was being played out with the transaction proposal from Mafab.\n\nFirst, the proposal is not based on the company\u2019s track record as a telecom operator hence the big investors in Nigeria are not likely to come on board as they would consider the risk of backing a relatively unknown operator as too high.\n\nMafab would then need to turn its attention to foreign investors. Even then, the company would need to prove a strong economic case for 5G in Nigeria to get the support of the big investors.\n\nThe biggest cost for Mafab is not just settling the licence fee. The bigger expenditure begins with setting up infrastructure that will power the service it has got the licence for. While acquiring an existing telco may give it a head-start, it also comes with new challenges, like assuming control of the old telco\u2019s existing liabilities, including debt and operational inefficiencies.\n\nOtherwise, Teniola sees a scenario where Mafab is not able to meet up with the licence fee as a result of its inability to raise funding and putting the NCC in a tight corner of whether to conduct a fresh auction or issue the licence to Airtel, which was outbid.\n\nThe transaction proposal also notes that Mafab\u2019s parent company, Althani Group of Companies Limited, a company established 15 years ago, makes an annual turnover of over $450 million. The company also holds an operational interest in the banking, banking, insurance, hospitality, and telecom spheres of the Nigerian economy. Should the parent company decide to help offset the licence fee, would it not be exposing the other business interests?\n\n\u201cIn this endeavour, the company has enlisted Parallel Wireless Incorporated (PWL) and IPLOOK Technologies Co. Limited (IPLOOK) as technical partners. PWL is a telecom company in the US licensed to design and maintain cellular networks. The entity is the only US company challenging the world\u2019s legacy vendors with the industry\u2019s only unified software-enabled solution. IPLOOK is a Hong Kong company that acts as software and consulting house that will supply and install the 5G spectrum,\u201d the transaction document notes.",

          "text": "Nigeria hit a record-shattering daily count of 4,035 cases of COVID-19 on December 22, 2021, an 847 percent increase that many by error attributed to the rise of the fast-spreading omicron variant.\n\nThe rare surge was fuelled by backlogs aggregated largely from Lagos in previous days and others from Akwa-Ibom, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has said.\n\nAdetifa Ifedayo, NCDC director-general, in an exclusive interview with BusinessDay, said over 2,000 of those cases accrued from unreported cases in Lagos between December 13 and 19. Complementing it were backlogs from Akwa-Ibom between December 20 and 21.\n\nThe centre collates COVID-19 cases based on reports from states across the country daily, and cases reported daily are often an aggregate of positive results of PCR and rapid diagnostic tests done the previous day.\n\nBut sometimes and maybe slightly more frequently, some states report backlogs of cases that failed to come in before NCDC\u2019s typical reporting.\n\n\u201cLagos contributed most of those backlogs. As you know, Lagos literally had the most cases and they had a bit of struggle to keep up with the numbers and recording,\u201d Ifedayo said, saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t have 100 percent of states reporting every day. When that happens, the backlog can get added to whatever we finally report.\u201d\n\nDaily case counts and their waves have been one of the most observed indicators during the outbreak and have been a reliable early warning sign of severe disease and death in previous coronavirus waves.\n\nThe record-shattering surge of December 22 shifted worries over undercounting of COVID-19 cases to the question of whether the NCDC data now reflect the true scale of coronavirus incidence.\n\nAlthough reported cases are basically laboratory results of some tests and not an encompassing count of the cases in the country, it still leaves a view of the state of things.\n\nFor instance, BusinessDay analysis shows that despite the rise and fall of infections, there are no wide margins in the rate of testing in months that recorded the lowest confirmed cases and months when waves peaked.\n\nRead also: Afe Babalola University founder claims COVID herbal drug healed 19 patients\n\nBetween March 29 and May 2 last year, nearly 188,000 tests were done and 5,160 cases were confirmed. This was one of the periods of a steep decline in infections.\n\nOut of 236,709 tests done last November, just 2,131 cases were confirmed.\n\nDuring the peak of infection last December, there were 19,981 cases confirmed from 136,456 tests, based on the epidemiology reports released for three weeks.\n\nThe data indicate that while Nigeria\u2019s testing lags rates in some African countries, the positivity rate is still largely driven by COVID-19 variants and their capacity to spread.\n\n\u201cThe way we test has been fairly consistent and the patterns can be assumed to be reliable. They have been reliable enough for us to pick up when cases start to go up and when cases start to go down. Do they reflect the entire universe of cases we have? No. Even in places that test more, considering that a lot of COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic, they have far more cases than any country is able to actually report,\u201d the director-general said.\n\nOmicron began to dominate cases in the country from mid-November, overtaking Delta as the most common variant identified from genetic sequences, according to the NCDC.\n\nBy December, Nigeria had triggered a full-blown fourth wave of COVID-19 wave, which saw the NCDC pushing a campaign for responsible yuletide celebration.\n\nInterestingly, the wave is declining as quickly as it surged with less than 700 cases recorded daily since the start of 2022.\n\nThere are now indications that case counts might begin to lose their relevance as experts observing the disease say more attention should shift to the rate of hospital admissions than the rate of infections, which might leave little or no symptoms.\n\nLast month, 12,547 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized as some states reopened their isolation centres on the rising fourth wave.\n\nIt was similar in 2020 with 12,126 active cases being monitored.\n\nInstead, Wafaa El-Sadr, director of ICAP, a global health centre at Columbia University, said at this stage of the pandemic, the focus should be \u201cshifting on preventing illness, disability and death, and therefore counting those,\u201d in a report.\n\nWith tests still largely privatised and profit-oriented, Nigeria might keep working with a partial view of the disease, which in any case has not been as brutal as seen in the US, for instance.",

My discovery is that only a few of them keep records of Edo Government activities. Hence, majority of them don\u2019t have accurate, compact information, knowledge and data base for undertaking proper analysis as well as critique of any government in office.\n\nFollowing this development, I resolved to start documenting all Edo State Governments in power since 2007 for public consumption beginning with Comrade Adams Aliu Oshiomhole whose administration oversaw the affairs of Edo State from 2007-2016.\n\nMaterials used for government documentation are from on/offline sources, most especially reports carried in the state-owned Nigerian Observer published by Bendel Newspapers Company Limited with headquarters in Benin City, capital of Edo State. Expectedly, a reader of the documentation is provided with an authenticated, correct platform for assessing the policies programmes and projects of government; as well as the reasons, emotions and behavioural idiosyncrasies behind all government actions.\n\nGovernor Godwin Nogheghase Obaseki assumed office as Edo State Governor on November 12, 2016. His administration is currently being documented and the exercise has resulted in these momumental works below.\n\n1.How Obaseki Became Governor In 2016\n\nThe work chronicles the hard road to the victories of Obaseki in the gubernatorial election of 2016 and in the law courts. It is a political biography of sorts that details his pains and triumphs enroute to the Governments House, Benin for his first tenure.\n\n2.Diary of Obaseki Administration first year in office. (November 12, 2016-November 11, 2017)\n\nThe work is a dossier on Obaseki\u2019s activities from November 12, 2016 to November 11, 2017 of his first tenure as Governor of Edo State.\n\n3.Comprehensive Promises of Governor Godwin Obaseki to Edo People (December 1, 2015-Nove 12, 2019)\n\nThis is a compilation of all the promises that Obaseki made to the people of Edo State during the early period of his electioneering campaign in December 2015 up to November 2019, a year to completing his first tenure in office. Through this work, you gain insight into the performance index of the Obaseki administration as at 2020 when his first tenure ended using the promises he made as measuring benchmarks.\n\n4.PUBLIC CRITIQUE OF OBASEKI ADMINISTRATION (NOVEMBER 12, 2016 \u2013 NOVEMBER 11, 2020)\n\nIn this work, you will be able to read the observations made by the critical segment of Edo people who perceive some imperfections in the administration\u2019s first tenure. The criticisms are presented in first and third-person narratives for identity confidentiality.

          "title": "FirstBank\u2019s focus on putting customers first continues to be a driving force \u2013 Adeduntan",
          "text": "Dr. Adesola Adeduntan, MD and CEO of First Bank Nigeria Limited, has said year 2021 saw his tenure extended as part of efforts to ensure the stability of the financial institution.\n\nThe First Bank boss who spoke in this interview with THISDAY, also about the intervention of the Central Bank of Nigeria, the future of the bank, trends that shaped the economy in 2021, his expectations for 2022 and other pertinent banking sector issues.\n\nExcerpts below:\n\nWhat is the level of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s involvement in First Bank?\n\nThe central bank\u2019s involvement in FirstBank is essentially about playing the role of the regulator. CBN\u2019s intervention has been in the best interest of the bank\u2019s stakeholders and its performance; aimed at restoring confidence in the bank as well as to reassure the depositors, creditors and other stakeholders of the bank of its commitment to ensuring the stability of the financial system.\n\nYour third quarter results saw a decline in some of the key indicators such as gross earnings, profit before tax and profit after tax, what was responsible for this?\n\nThe Commercial Banking reported a resilient performance resulting in a Profit before Tax of N44.3billion for the nine months period ended September 30, 2021. This result was delivered in a sustained low yield environment, which continues to compress margins as the macro-economic environment remained challenging amidst the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFirstBank\u2019s focus on putting the customers first continues to be a driving force as we keep supporting our customers in meeting their business needs. The evidence of this support is reflected in the 24.1% y-t-d growth in the loan book, underpinned by solid risk management practices and from which sustainable good quality earnings are being delivered as asset quality remains firmly under control. Furthermore, in our concerted efforts at sustaining our dominance in financial inclusion and digital banking, we continue to record growths in our agent banking business, supporting the 17.5 per cent growth in non-interest income.\n\nWe remain determined to continue strengthening our capabilities across our footprints, as we are confident that our investment in technology and the strong balance sheet, which the Group has built over the last six years, will provide the solid platform for more impressive results into the future.\n\nThe CBN recently introduced the eNaira, what has been the acceptance rate by FirstBank\u2019s customers, and do you think this will positively impact your bank?\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) as the regulator of the banking industry continues to lead and drive development in the industry. In the banking industry, digital currency is the future and the CBN is staying ahead of the curve in Africa with the introduction of the eNaira given the several benefits associated with the digital currency, such as safety, speed, and convenience. A review of the events over the course of the past few years has shown that digitalisation in its different forms has been net positive for the financial services industry.\n\nThe eNaira is no different; the digitalisation of the naira expands upon Nigeria\u2019s already advanced payment ecosystem; the roadmap for the eNaira over the next couple of months will reveal some exciting use cases that will further grow the ecosystem and encourage even more interaction with this new form of currency. Currently we have a whole segment of digitally curious customers who have started interacting with the eNaira, and as the eNaira ecosystem grows and acceptance increases as a store and exchange of value, so will those numbers.\n\nFirstBank\u2019s channels currently account for about 17 per cent of the total reported eNaira transaction volume. The bank is dependably dynamic and continues to be at the vanguard of innovation in the banking industry. Overall, I am confident that the eNaira will positively impact the bank as our customers continue to transact through the bank\u2019s channels, supporting the digital economy drive. The number of customers will increase as the eNaira will enable the sign-on of excluded people in the financial system, thereby supporting the financial inclusion drive of the CBN. The eNaira will reduce the cost of processing cash for the bank, thereby making it a cheaper, reliable and faster way of exchange and the bank will have access to customers across the continents, simplifying and facilitating cross border payments and trade.\n\nWhat\u2019s opinion about the CBN\u2019s FX and what long-term impacts will it have on the exchange rate and has your bank been able to meet the demands of customer?\n\nThe main objectives of exchange rate policy in Nigeria are to preserve the value of the domestic currency, maintain a favorable external reserves position and ensure external balance without compromising the need for internal balance and the overall goal of macroeconomic stability. The new CBN\u2019s foreign exchange (FX) policy is geared towards harmonising the FX rates across the various markets and increasing the availability of FX to those who genuinely need it and not for those who are speculators or those who deliberately try to distort the market. The current FX policy of the CBN has recorded some successes in improving the availability of FX for transactions and curbing the incessant decline of the naira exchange rate in the parallel markets.\n\nThe current policy is expected to strengthen the naira exchange rate, however, there are several other factors that are critical to the movement of the exchange rate, predominantly oil prices and capital inflows. If these factors continue to trend positively, then we can expect a relative stability of naira relative to other international currencies. I believe the long-term impact will be the relative stability of the naira, as the CBN continues to meet all legitimate needs, increasing the confidence of the people and sending the right signaling effect to foreign investors. Typically, FirstBank engages the regulators, providing all the necessary foreign exchange bid documentations and following defined processes to ensure that our customers\u2019 bids are successful, and we get as much allocation as possible for all our needy customers.\n\nHow prepared do you think banks are for Basel III?\n\nThe Basel III accord was developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and is built upon the frameworks of the existing Basel II accord, with the aim of strengthening regulation, supervision, and risk management within the banking industry, globally. Due to the impact of the 2008 global financial crisis on banks, it became imperative for the current frameworks under Basel II to be revised to improve the ability of banks to handle shocks from financial stress and to strengthen their transparency and disclosure. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on September 2, 2021, issued a circular to all banks in Nigeria titled Basel III Implementation by all Deposit Money Banks. The circular aims to inform all banks of the issuance of guidelines for the implementation of the Basel III standard which is a voluntary global regulatory framework that addresses banks\u2019 capital adequacy, stress testing, and market liquidity risk.\n\nBasel III standard will prevent banks from taking excessive risks that can negatively impact the players and the economy. Implementation of Basel III will have significant implications for capital requirement \u2013 there will be a higher minimum CAR requirement for players in the industry. However, the apex bank has engaged and defined a road map to ensure that operators in the banking industry meet and surpass the higher capital requirements. The Basel III will be implemented in phases and banks have developed their capital plan to ensure they meet and surpass the higher capital and liquidity requirements for the Basel III implementation. Many banks have revamped their operational and credit risk infrastructure to mitigate operational and credit risk losses. The effect is already being seen in the general decline in the industry\u2019s non-performing loan portfolio. The successful implementation of the Basel III frameworks would be beneficial to the banking industry and the economy at large.\n\nDo you think it would spur more mergers and acquisitions in year 2022?\n\nThe Basel III standard implementation by the Central Bank of Nigeria is aimed at decreasing the risk of the financial services sector. The main aim of Basel III is to improve financial stability \u2013 the standard is set to increase the soundness of Nigeria\u2019s financial services sector and the confidence of the people in the financial system. The implementation is expected to impact banks\u2019 capital adequacy by raising liquidity and lowering bank leverage. Analysts believe that the implementation of Basel III would increase the capital requirement of Systemic Important Banks (SIB) in Nigeria to 17 per cent from 15 per cent but, most banks in Nigeria are well-capitalised and are expected to increase capital buffer that can be drawn upon in periods of stress. However, despite being well-capitalised, the implementation of Basel III would reduce the capital headroom of operators and banks would have to resort to various strategies to strengthen their capital positions to drive credit and business growth. These strategies may include mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as Basel III policy implementation takes effect to strengthen their capital positions as the policy requires higher capital requirements/enhanced capital cushions. Nonetheless, I believe Nigerian banks are well-positioned to withstand regulatory headwinds whilst driving growth.\n\nHow would you assess your bank\u2019s performance through the pandemic?\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic disrupted several sectors of the economy, the banking industry was one of the most impacted given the critical role that banks play in the economy and across all sectors. However, FirstBank navigated the pandemic crisis successfully and recorded the best financial performance since 2015 in the 2020 financial year. FirstBank delivered a strong performance both on the financial and non-financial front underpinned by resiliency, digital innovation and customer centricity. On financial performance, despite the pandemic, the bank recorded significant growth in its revenue base, profitability and asset. Revenue and Profitability Performance: In the context of the pandemic, FirstBank Group delivered strong financial results, generating gross revenue of N539 billion for the year ended 31 December 2020. The Group\u2019s non-interest income grew impressively by 24 per cent between 2019 and 2020, closing at N154.5 billion for the year ending 31 December 2020.\n\nThe non-interest income growth was propelled by transactional and eBusiness income and credit related fees. In 2020, FirstBank Group delivered its most profitable year since 2015. The Group\u2019s profit before tax increased from N70.8 billion for the year ended 31 December 2019 to N73.6 billion for the year ended 31 December 2020, resulting in a year-on-year profitability growth of 4 percent between 2019 and 2020. Strong Asset Growth and Stable Funding Base: FirstBank Group experienced solid total asset growth of 25.5 per cent to N7.4 trillion as at December 31st, 2020 (2019: N5.9 trillion). The Group continues to maintain a strong liquidity and capital position driven by its high volume of customer deposits held in low-cost current and savings accounts, which amounted to over 75 percent of the Bank\u2019s customer deposit base as at 31 December 2020.\n\nRenewed emphasis by the Group in improving the service performance level in the retail segment, expanding digital touchpoints and repurposing of its branch network have resulted in 20.5 per cent increase in deposits to N4.7 trillion as at December 31st, 2020 (2019: N3.9 trillion); a reflection of our strong franchise value which has come to be associated with safety, stability and innovation. Through the bank\u2019s extensive physical footprint and expanding agent banking network and digital banking capabilities, the Group continues to reach an increasing number of customers, which drives customer deposits in low-cost current and savings accounts that serve as an important funding base. On non-financial performance, the bank\u2019s non-financial performance across disruptive innovation and customer focus lens has been impressive. Some of the milestones achieved during the pandemic was us launching the pioneer FastTrack ATM in Africa offering customers a touchless solution for ATM transactions and enabling customers to pre-order cash on ATMs via the bank\u2019s USSD or mobile banking platforms.\n\nWe unveiled FirstBank\u2019s Virtual Payment Card, a digital representation of the naira-denominated plastic debit card, launched the Firstmonie Agent Credit, a digital lending solution designed to provide bridge finance to help our Agents solve liquidity challenges, leveraged technology to promote digital account opening process through the Digital Sales Executive App, ATMs, Firstmonie Agents, *894# USSD banking, FirstMobile and Company website. Also, we upgraded the Bank\u2019s mobile banking application, FirstMobile, with new and improved features to promote a convenient and secured mobile banking experience for customers, rolled out FirstBank Digital Innovation Lab\u2019s proprietary developed Mobile Banking App for our wholly owned subsidiary FBNBank Senegal, Increased customer account base (including wallets) to over 30 million.\n\nMaintained the dominant digital bank rating in Nigeria with over 20 per cent market share of electronic banking transaction volumes, about 16 million users on our digital banking platforms (USSD *894#, FirstMobile and FirstOnline) and over 11 million card users. Expanded the Agent Banking network to over 86,500[1] agents across 772 out of 774 local governments in Nigeria and paid out over N18 billion as commissions to Firstmonie Agents.Reinforced the Bank\u2019s financial inclusion drive with the disbursement of over N22 billion and N35 billion in loans through FirstAdvance and Agent Credit digital platforms, respectively. Provided free e-learning solutions in partnership with Roducate, IBM and the Lagos State Government, thereby helping to reduce the negative impact of school closure following the COVID-19 pandemic on students in Lagos State. Additionally, the bank, in partnership with Junior Achievement, positively impacted over one million students through its financial literacy, entrepreneurship and career counselling programs and Improved customer ranking in the Wholesale Banking segment by four places in 2020.\n\nWhat are your expectations and forecast for the economy in 2022?\n\nGlobally and in Nigeria, economic recovery was strong in 2021 following improved vaccination exercise, and support from monetary and fiscal authorities for demand. However, I believe 2022 will witness slower pace in economic growth over lingering health crisis (the fourth wave of the covid-19 pandemic with the omicron variant) and rising price levels globally. Also, the boost from base effects and reopening of the economy will decline in 2022. Locally I expect economic growth to improve slightly; however, the following trends are expected in 2022 are disinflationary trend to continue in 2022 but inflation would still bite harder although potential PMS subsidy removal is the most consequential known factor that could push inflation to its worst-case estimates in 2022. Higher taxes may take the center stage as the federal government explores all options to cover for burgeoning budget deficit. Potential improvement in fiscal metrics given the bullish sentiment in the international oil market and savings potential from the PMS subsidy removal.\n\nCapital importation may improve as foreign portfolio investments, diaspora remittances and other sources of inflow witness gradual growth following global economic recovery and increased employment for Nigerians in diaspora. Monetary policy measures may normalise in 2022 with the Central Bank of Nigeria maintaining an accommodative stand. Economic growth in 2022 is projected to be with the range of 2.7 per cent and three per cent. However, the key activities to look out for in 2022 include electioneering, the penultimate year before the next general elections, increase in taxes, buoyant oil market, PMS subsidy removal, and exchange rate policy of the CBN.\n\nWith the recent push to increase lending by CBN, don\u2019t you think this would impact or drive up your bank\u2019s NPLs?\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria had in recent times taken some tough decisions to address the challenges affecting the growth of the real sector and the Nigerian economy. This includes ensuring that banks comply with the minimum 65 per cent loan to deposit ratio (LDR). This increased lending by CBN has proved potent in filling the financing gap as credit to private sector has indeed risen to an appreciable level. Although there is a concern that this push to increase lending by CBN would drive up bank\u2019s non-performing loans (NPLs), a report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) noted that despite the increase in LDR there is an inverse proportionate reduction in non-performing loans. FirstBank has achieved great strides in reducing its NPL from double-digit in 2016 to single digit in 2021 which attest to the fact that the bank is strong and resilient.\n\nI am happy to note that the recent drive to increase lending will not affect the bank\u2019s NPLs negatively as the bank has instituted a robust and automated operational and credit risk management processes and infrastructure. FirstBank has in the recent years built an enduring risk culture and governance system, strengthened the risk infrastructure through specialised training, digitalisation credit processes and imbibe disciplined and active portfolio management approach thereby ensuring strict regulatory compliance. FirstBank will continue to support CBN\u2019s lending initiative to achieving strong economic growth and diversification as the bank is well positioned to maintain good asset quality and profitable credit portfolio.\n\nWith the emergence of PSBs and telcos granted licences, how much would that deepen financial inclusion and do you see this competing with banks\u2019 agency banking?\n\nThe introduction of Payment Service Banks (PSBs) is another step taken by the CBN in line with its goal of promoting financial inclusion and enhancing access to financial services for the unbanked, underbanked, and underserved segments of the population across all parts of the country. The entrance of the PSBs will certainly deepen financial inclusion. It will impact the financial services landscape to the extent that the Telcos will be able to leverage their extensive infrastructure to offer last mile delivery of financial solutions to those currently unbanked. Today, we have 70 million Nigerians that have been issued the National Identity Number.\n\nAbout 20 per cent of this number are currently unbanked, and they can more easily be reached. The expected impact will ride on the back of synergy and collaborations across the industry. And this is what we are already seeing. For us at FirstBank, the development is not a threat, we see it more as an opportunity. You will agree that for an institution like ours that has been around and flourishing for over 127 years, our ability to read and effectively respond to market trends has been well proven. What we have done with our agent banking is to build a platform that could be leveraged to enrich customer offerings in diverse ways. We do not just possess spread, we possess depth. So, leveraging technology and open API, we are poised to work with the PSBs to deliver value to the banking public and citizenry.\n\nStill on agency banking, can you give us an update on the expansion of your bank\u2019s agency banking and the impact it had especially during the lockdown?\n\nFirstBank\u2019s agent banking, Firstmonie, has witnessed continuous growth since its launch. The Firstmonie agent network operates in 772 of the 774 local government areas in Nigeria and is the largest bank-led network in Nigeria, and indeed Sub-Saharan Africa, with over 150,000 agents including over 22,000 women agents, enabling the Bank to drive gender inclusive growth within rural communities. The Firstmonie network has processed over N17 trillion ($39.3 billion) in over 817 million transactions between 2018 and December 2021. The Firstmonie initiative has been a very formidable vehicle for job creation and economic development in several communities across the country, as over 150,000 direct jobs and 450,000 indirect jobs have been created, with an agent earning an average monthly commission/income of N85,000. Over 1.5 million individuals have been economically impacted through the jobs created via the FirstBank\u2019s Firstmonie agent banking proposition. Significant percentage of Firstmonie\u2019s agents are in the rural areas, contributing significantly to the development of the rural economy in Nigeria.\n\nOverall, FirstBank is supporting the social-economic development of Nigeria in a profitable way. During the peak of the lockdown, the Firstmonie network provided an alternative channel for the Bank\u2019s customers to conduct transactions and meet their basic financial service needs, serving as quasi-physical touchpoint for the bank\u2019s customers. This resulted in the Firstmonie network processing over N6.6 trillion worth of transactions during the period We are not resting on our oars and the growth in 2021 is equally impressive; as at Q3 2021, we had processed more value of transactions than we did in the whole of 2020. The outlook for 2022 and beyond is also quite exciting. We will continue to focus on impacting the lives of the communities we serve and deepening the services we offer through collaborations with partners, the regulatory authorities, other industry players, and our customers.\n\nYour tenure as CEO was last year renewed, can you speak on your achievements and milestones thus far?\n\nI was appointed Chief Executive Officer/Managing Director of this iconic institution \u2013 FirstBank of Nigeria Limited in January 2016.

During my tenure, the Bank\u2019s outstanding services have attracted numerous recognitions and awards. In 2021, FirstBank was named \u201cBest Private Bank in Nigeria\u201d and \u201cBest Consumer Digital Bank in Nigeria\u201d by Global Finance; \u201cMost Innovative Banking Application \u2013 Nigeria, 2021\u201d and \u201cBest CSR Bank \u2013 Nigeria, 2021\u201d by Global Banking and Finance Awards; \u201cMost Innovative Banking Product 2021\u201d by International Finance Awards; as well as \u201cTreasury and Global Markets Brand of the Year 2021\u201d and \u201cAlternative Delivery Channel of the Year\u201d by BusinessDay Banks and Other Financial Institutions (BAFI) Awards 2021.\n\nFor six consecutive years, FirstBank was named, \u201cMost Valuable Bank Brand in Nigeria,\u201d by the globally renowned The Banker Magazine of the Financial Times Group and \u201cBest Retail Bank in Nigeria\u201d eight times in a row by The Asian Banker Awards. We are grateful for accolades and achievements which attest to our exceptional commitment to promoting national, regional and global economic growth and development through constructive engagements with the public and private sectors of various economies, and our host communities across the globe.\n\nWhat should your customers and shareholders expect from your bank in the near future?\n\nThe industry has changed and will continue to evolve at a faster pace with new innovative technologies, and the customers will continue to gravitate towards institutions that provide the best digital payments services that address their changing needs for convenience, speed and security.\n\nFirstBank will remain at the cutting edge of innovation and technology in the industry. FirstBank has the right capabilities and competencies to lead and take advantage of the new developments in the digital payment space, and indeed, the banking industry. At FirstBank, we will continue focus on customer-led innovation as we put our customers first in everything we do.\n\nWe understand that although the needs of customers may remain the same, the channel of delivery remains dynamic, and we must stay ahead of the curve; Our stakeholders should expect to see a bank that is future-proof and ready to provide best-in-class products and services that will meet and surpass their needs.\n\nFirstBank remains dependably dynamic and will ensure that the needs of all stakeholders are met to the customers, we will provide the best products and deliver exceptional customer experience, to the shareholders, capital appreciation and good dividend payout,to employees, competitive emolument and good career path, to regulators, voluntary compliance to all rules and regulations and to communities, we will be good corporate citizens and give back to the society where we operate.\n\nTell us about some of the impact of FirstBank on the communities where it operates?\n\nAt FirstBank, we are committed to nation-building and have been driving sustainable social, economic and environmental growth for over 127 years of our existence. Our community development initiatives are anchored on our strategic Education, Health and Welfare pillars. Our engagement in sustainable business practices is based on our promise of enhancing economic development and ensuring economic stability for the present and future generation. Our key programmes include Infrastructure Development programme; Endowment programme; Future First (Financial Literacy, Entrepreneurship and Career Counseling); E-Learning Initiative; SPARK (Start Performing Acts of Random Kindness) and CRS Week. I will highlight achievements for a few. First Bank Infrastructural Development programme is aimed at promoting infrastructure development under its identified areas of support.\n\nThis includes providing infrastructure facilities in schools, hospitals and environmental infrastructure projects. This is in recognition of the importance of these facilities in improving the quality of life. We have built over 16 infrastructure projects which include universities and secondary and primary schools and recently commissioned a Primary Health Centre in Ijedodo Community in partnership with Lagos State Government. The FutureFirst programme in partnership with Junior Achievement Nigeria has impacted Over 1,000,000 people across the regions of the country including Lagos, Port Harcourt and Abuja with knowledge of financial literacy and entrepreneurship.\n\nOver 170,000 students have benefitted from the E-learning initiative thus far. This include 20,000 indigent students that have received free low-end devices preloaded with accredited content.\n\nThe Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability Week (CR&S) Week which started in 2017 is a dedicated week designed to offer opportunities for employees to give their time and resources to defined causes in line with the Bank\u2019s CR&S strategic approach. The Week\u2019s activities are an aspect of the Bank\u2019s Employee Giving & Volunteering Programme, which was instituted with the aim of encouraging employees to give back to the community as well as inculcate in them the integral corporate culture of giving. The main initiative implemented during this week is SPARK.\n\nSPARK is a values-based initiative designed to raise consciousness that we can choose to be kind. SPARK which was introduced in the maiden edition of the Corporate Responsibility & Sustainability (CR&S) week in 2017 espouses reigniting our values which appear to be eroding fast. The initiative focuses on creating and reinforcing an attitude of going beyond just meeting the material needs of people who are unable to help themselves to showing compassion, empathy, affection.\n\nIn 2021, the lives impacted include 60 Beneficiary schools; over 18,000 secondary students\u2019 participants in SPARK launch; 20,000 underprivileged including widows lives touched in 8 countries including United Kingdom, Ghana, DRC, Guinea, Sierra Lone, Senegal & Nigeria. We had partnerships with over 100 Charities / NGOs including LEAP Africa; International Women Society; UNGC; UN Women; Junior Achievement Nigeria.\n\nIn addition, SPARK Amplification has expanded and deepened staff involvement within our various host communities by integrating and institutionalizing acts of random kindness, which has seen 7 Directorates & Departments in the Bank implement various initiatives including empowering small businesses; infrastructure and books for schools, and providing household items for orphanages. In 2021, staff contributions spent to implement SPARK amplification stands at N13,570,743.10 and a total of 9,706.5 volunteering hours.\n\nWhen will the Elephant (FirstBank) stand \u2018Gidigba\u2019 again?\n\nAs I said earlier, the bank is consistently delivering a resilient performance within a challenging macro-economic environment amidst the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. I highlighted some key points as evidence in our commitment to and journey towards reclaiming our top position in the industry. These include firstly, our determined efforts at sustaining our dominance in financial inclusion and digital banking, reflecting growth in our agent banking business, supporting the 17.5 per cent growth in non-interest income. The second thing is our deliberate, planned and consistent efforts in putting the customer first as shown in the 24.1% y-t-d growth in the loan book, fortified by solid risk management practices and from which sustainable good quality earnings are being delivered as asset quality remains firmly under control.\n\nAnd the confidence that our stakeholders including our customers repose in us is reflective in 10.3% y-t-d growth customers\u2019 deposits. This is in addition to our constant investment in technology. We have always maintained that FirstBank is built to be resilient, stable and for the long-haul. And we remain committed to reinforcing our performance by the continued implementation of the Bank\u2019s strategy, which is designed to deliver accelerated growth in profitability and overcome the possible challenges of the environment.\n\nFirst published on THISDAY\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "The Southeast zonal and state executives of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), including political leaders and elders from the zone, have endorsed the presidential aspiration of former Senate President, Anyim Pius Anyim.\n\nThe endorsement was done during consultative session hosted by Anyim on Thursday in Enugu.\n\nThe leaders from five states of the Southeast, including Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu and Imo states, said they were endorsing Anyim after taking \u201cdue cognizance of his precious record of distinguished and unblemished service as President of the Senate and Secretary to the Government of the Federation.\u201d\n\nThe PDP zonal leaders and elders said in all his positions, Anyim has distinguished himself as a detribalized statesman, consensus builder and true nationalist.\n\nIn a ten-point resolution issued at the end of the meeting, and signed by Senator Theodore Orji, former governor of Abia State, who also chaired the session and Chief Duru-Iheoma, SAN, former chairman of PDP in Imo State, the Southeast PDP stakeholders reiterated that the people of the geo-political zone \u201chave earned the right to occupy the office of President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023 on account of their eminent qualifications and overwhelming contributions to the development of all parts of the federation through the years.\n\nThey said because of that, \u201cthe choice of a South East citizen as presidential candidate of the party in 2023 will guarantee to every Nigerian a sense of equity, justice and inclusion in the management of the affairs of the nation. In our view, this is the best way of ensuring that we build a nation that leaves no one or group behind.\u201d\n\nThe resolution further said, \u201cOn account of the foregoing, we congratulate Senator Anyim Pius Anyim for the patriotism of his decision to offer himself for national service by aspiring to contest in the 2023 Presidential race.\n\n\u201cWe take due cognizance of his precious record of distinguished and unblemished service as President of the Senate and Secretary to the Government of the Federation. In these positions, he distinguished himself as a detribalized statesman, consensus builder and true nationalist.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, unanimously endorse his aspiration with all conviction and enthusiasm and eagerly commend him to the rest of the nation as a worthy leader who will pilot the affairs of the nation towards greater security, unity and prosperity for all citizens.\n\n\u201cIn furtherance of the foregoing, we hereby oblige Senator Anyim his request that we all join him to persuade and reassure every part of the country to do justice to the South East and thereby promote equity and justice as core values of our nation.\n\n\u201cIn assuring Senator Anyim of our support for his aspiration, we wish to also extend the same hand of support and solidarity to all qualified and deserving sons and daughters of our zone with similar aspiration and who reach out to us as Senator Anyim has done.\n\n\u201cIt is our solemn appeal to all the peoples of the South East zone to remain steadfast in the hope that we can all join hands in solidarity with all other parts of the federation to build a prosperous nation founded on democracy, equity and inclusion to the benefit of this great nation.\u201d\n\nSpeaking during the meeting, Anyim said he is stepping out with a sense of humility, as a Nigerian with patriotic fervour, considerable knowledge of Nigeria, its diversities and current challenges; and so properly equipped with clarity of the needed solutions.\n\n\u201cLet me elaborate; as a young officer, at the then Directorate of Social Mobilization, I understood the need for value orientation as a tool for instilling patriotism,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI was also schooled to appreciate the value of social justice, equity and fairness as building blocks for social harmony and inclusion.\n\n\u201cAs a young politician I imbibed the founding vision of the PDP as a grassroot movement that would provide leadership that will respect the rule of law, ensure that power belongs to the people and deliver national cohesion and inclusiveness through good governance.\n\n\u201cI have been privileged to understand our national problems and appreciate their enormity and peculiarities in the last 21 years from my vantage positions in both the legislative and the executive arms of government.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I have a clear view of the task ahead as well as the solutions needed to advance the cause of our country.\n\n\u201cMy records as President of the Senate and as Secretary to the Government of the Federation clearly show that I am more interested in building strong institutions than seeking enhancement of personal power or position.\n\n\u201cMy records show effective and efficient management of the nation\u2019s diversity on the basis of equity, justice, fairness and inclusiveness.\n\n\u201cI am a committed believer in the rule of law; and will always promote and protect the sanctity of lives as well as the rights and liberties of all citizens.\n\n\u201cMy decision is a product of some years of prayers, reflections and introspection on not just my capacity and preparedness to take on the task ahead, but also deep thoughts on our national challenges and the solutions they demand.\u201d\n\nAnyim who reiterated his earlier position that he will contest whether the presidency is zoned to the South or not, however said if the presidency is zoned to South East, it will satisfy the just demand of equity and fairness.\n\n\u201cIf it is not zoned to the South East, it will remain a burden on the conscience of the nation.\n\n\u201cLet me therefore at this point join all wellmeaning Nigerians to appeal to all the political parties to take the fair, just and equitable decision to zone their presidential slots to the South particularly the South East.\u201d\n\nPresent at the meeting were all the zonal and state executives of the PDP, Senator T.A. Orji; Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe; Dr. Ali Odefa, PDP National Vice Chairman, Southeast; Iyom Josephine Anenih, Senator Obinna Ogba; Dr. Frank Nweke; Prof. Elochukwu Amucheazi; Nze Ozichukwu Chukwu; Senator Emma Nwaka; Senator Chuka Utazi, among others.",

          "text": "An App-based carpooling platform for inter-states travel, CoolRide Services, has debuted in Nigeria. It is a new innovation for travelers across Nigerian states and cities.\n\nFounded by a Nigerian based in Spain, Julius Omorogbe, in 2020. According to him, he got the idea in Europe in 2019.\n\nHe said travelers can connect with other users heading in the same direction and request a ride on the App, noting that car owners can also register on the platform and share their car with other passengers to earn extra money while traveling.\n\nAccording to Omorogbe, CoolRide App is secure as everyone is profiled, and all payments are made with Bank details for security purposes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said that he came up with the App in order to make transportation across Nigeria easier, safer and cheaper, and to make sure that people can travel at their own leisure, without wasting endless hours at the motor park.\n\nOmorogbe said CoolRide was also aimed at creating part-time jobs and income for Nigerians even as he maintained that it can serve as an alternative in the case of strikes by other transporters.\n\n\u201cIt is very risky to travel out of town with someone you don\u2019t know today.\n\n\u201cCoolRide provides a safer and cheaper way to travel out of town. And anyone interested can download the App and sign up.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWith CoolRide, you spend less traveling out of town with a verified driver going in your direction. You can also make a significant income by becoming a verified CoolRide driver with your personal car,\u201d Omorogbe stated.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has ruled out the option of pardoning the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nAlthough he acknowledges the possibility of a political resolution, he believes the IPOB leader must answer for his actions over the years, especially while he was out of the country.\n\n\u201cNigerians know that I don\u2019t interfere with the judiciary,\u201d the President told Channels Television in an exclusive interview that aired on Wednesday. \u201cLet him be listened to. For those who are saying that we should release him, no we cannot release him.\n\n\u201cThere is a possibility of political solution; if people behave themselves, all well and good, but you can\u2019t go to a foreign country and keep on sending incorrect economic and security problem against your country and thinking that you will never have to account for what you have been doing. Let him account for what he has been doing.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Chinese Loans: Anybody That Will Help Nigeria\u2019s Infrastructure Is Welcome \u2013 Buhari\n\nIn November last year, President Buhari had promised to consider the request of some leaders from the South East region to release Kanu who is facing treason charges preferred against him by the Nigerian Government.\n\nAlthough he told the Igbo leaders under the aegis of Highly Respected Igbo Greats that they had made an extremely difficult demand, he insisted that the best thing was to subject the IPOB leader to the judicial system.\n\nIn his interview with Channels Television, the President doubted if Kanu was willing to return to the country to clear his name from the allegations against him after he fled in 2017.\n\n\u201cThere is one institution that I wouldn\u2019t dare interfere with \u2013 that is the judiciary,\u201d he said. \u201cKanu\u2019s case is with the judiciary, but what I wonder is when Kanu was safely in Europe abusing this administration and mentioning too many things, I never thought really he wants to voluntarily come and defend himself on the accusations.\n\n\u201cSo, we are giving him an opportunity to defend himself in our system, not to be abusing us from Europe as if he was not a Nigerian. Let him come here to us and then criticise us here.\u201d\n\nImproved Security?\n\nApart from the trial of the IPOB leader, the President also spoke about a number of burning issues including security, economy, and politics, among others.\n\nHe began his interview with an assessment of his administration\u2019s performance since he assumed office in 2015, especially in the three key areas of security, improving the economy, and fighting corruption.\n\n\u201cFor Nigerians to be fair with this administration is to try and find out from the time we won the election in 2015 till now, in the three promises we made \u2013 improving security, improving the economy, and trying to fight corruption; securing the country in the North East, if you ask anybody from Borno State, from Yobe State, from Adamawa State, there are a number of local governments \u2013 about 18 \u2013 that were in the hands of Boko Haram, no local government now is strictly in the hands of Boko Haram or ISWAP. So, in that respect, we have done something,\u201d President Buhari asserted.\n\n\u201cIn the economy, don\u2019t forget and I challenge so many people to go and check with the central bank or NNPC. The production from 1999 to 2014 was 2.1 million barrels per day. When we came, somehow the militants were unleashed in the South South.\n\n\u201cProduction went down to half a million barrels per day, and coincidentally, the price again collapsed to about $37 per barrel. But look at what we did within the time frame and the resources available to us relative to the government we inherited.\u201d\n\nDespite the gains made so far in improving the economy, the President is not happy with the present state of power because no country can develop without infrastructure, and infrastructure, for him, means road, rail, and power.\n\nHe, however, gave an assurance that his administration was working hard to bridge the gap, although the privatisation of the sector was another problem to worry about.\n\nChinese Loans\n\nPresident Buhari lamented that the owners of the distribution companies bought them based on geo-political zones rather than merit, stressing that removing a system and reintroducing one was no joke.\n\nHe went on to defend his government\u2019s decision to source loans from China, saying anyone willing to help Nigeria\u2019s infrastructure was welcome.\n\n\u201cWe take that (loans) where it is necessary \u2026 we got the Chinese to help us in the rail and the roads, how can we turn that down? If we had turned that down maybe between Lagos to Ibadan, you will have to walk,\u201d the President said.\n\n\u201cSo, the Chinese are welcome, anybody that is prepared to come and help us and our infrastructure to do the roads, the rail, and power will be welcomed.\u201d\n\nIn the area of education, President Buhari told Nigerian youths to use their exposure to improve themselves and not see them as tickets to depend on the government.\n\nHe said, \u201cI wish when they go to school when they work hard when they earn their degree; they don\u2019t do it thinking that government must give them jobs.

Give them other options so they can make a choice.\u201d\n\n\u2018Why They Lost\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari had withheld his assent to the bill, citing the cost of conducting direct primary elections, security challenges, and possible manipulation of electoral processes by political actors as part of the reasons for his decision.\n\nIn their reaction, lawmakers in the House of Representatives could not immediately take an action but they said they would adequately address the matter in January.\n\nDuring a plenary in December, Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, had explained that the time was short to address such a sensitive issue.\n\nAt the upper chamber, the Senate also resolved to consult with the House of Representatives in January when both chambers would be in session.\n\nWhile the lawmakers have yet to resume from recess or deliberate on the bill, President Buhari said it was wrong to force an option on the people.\n\nStressing the importance of allowing people to choose from available options, he relived the events that led to his election into office and ended the 16 years rule of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2015.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I do not support direct primary because I want people to be given a choice,\u201d the President stated. \u201cYou can\u2019t give them one option and think that you are being democratic. Let them have three options \u2013 there is the consensus.\n\n\u201cPDP was so overconfident that they thought they would rule Nigeria till the end of time, but the opposition (parties) came together, and we overthrew them. Not as a result of direct primary, it is as a result of opposition parties coming together and fighting the PDP.\n\n\u201cIt is because we agreed to come together. The fact that we came together gave us the success we had, and that was the mistake they made; that is why they lost.\u201d",

Egbon Lekan Balogun is the most senior in our line and so he is the next in line to the throne.\n\n\u201cFor those asking, my \u2018body and mouth language\u2019 is that Egbon Lekan is my senior and he is next in line to the Olubadan stool.\n\n\u201cI do not have the powers to make anybody Olubadan. In 2017, we instituted a case to challenge the needless reform that Abiola Ajimobi as governor wanted to do. Almost all of us as High Chiefs and members of the Olubadan-in-Council agreed to the filing of a suit to challenge him and we gave the task to Michael Lana.\n\nLana later called me to say some of the High Chiefs told him to remove their names from the suit, leaving only my Egbon Balogun and myself.\n\nTwo weeks after we started the case, Egbon Balogun said he was no longer interested in the case. I asked Lana if I could do it alone and he told he \u2018yes\u2019 and we continued.\n\n\u201cBy the time, there had been a new government headed by Seyi Makinde who said he did not want the distraction of the suit and called for out-of court settlement which we agreed to and did.\n\n\u201cAfter the terms of settlement were agreed to, the court gave a consent judgment based on the terms. But they said they were not happy and instituted two fresh cases which are still in court till today.\n\n\u201cSo, I need people to understand that I am not causing any trouble. The cases that are in court today in respect of the Obaship tussle were instituted by Egbo Balogun and his colleagues who are still calling themselves Obas.\n\n\u201cIt is they that the people should talk to. Let them go and withdraw the cases they instituted.

          "title": "UK to Scrap Pre-Departure Covid Tests for Fully Vaccinated from Friday",
          "text": "Following the announcement for England, Health Minister for the Welsh government Eluned Morgan said: \u201cI have today reluctantly agreed to remove the requirements for fully vaccinated travellers and under 18s to take a pre departure test (PDT) and a day 2 PCR test when arriving in the UK.\u201d\n\nWhat are the current travel rules?\n\nCurrently, all travellers to the UK aged 12 and over have to show proof of a negative test, which can be a PCR or a lateral flow test, and must be taken up to two days before departure for the UK.\n\nThey then have to take another test \u2013 which this time must be a PCR test \u2013 within the first two days after their arrival in the UK.\n\nBut at the time that rule was brought in a month ago, the number of new cases reported in the UK each day was running between 40,000 and 50,000 \u2013 and was only rising relatively slowly because it was almost entirely made up of the Delta variant of Covid.\n\nBut UK cases have now risen sharply and Omicron is the dominant variant \u2013 so airlines can argue that there is no longer any hope of relying on testing to \u201ckeep out Omicron\u201d.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll feel unsafe on flights\u2019\n\nJohn Wyndham, who is currently planning a third trip to the US for February, said that scrapping pre-departure tests will make him feel unsafe on flights.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m frustrated because pre-departure was the most important as an effective control and also the cheapest test,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\nMr Wyndham runs a start-up company that is organising marching bands across the world to participate in London Band Week. He went to the US in December along with three colleagues, who paid \u00a3212 each for PCR testing.\n\nHowever, he said that the eliminating pre-departure testing will only save him around \u00a330 per person and wasn\u2019t worth the added worry about new variants.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bonkers that we could now sit on the plane with someone who has it,\u201d he said, adding that it would \u201cworsen what has already been the most stressful travelling of my life\u201d.\n\n\u00a3800 saving\n\nHowever, holidaymaker David Hughes welcomed the scrapping of PCR tests before returning to the UK. Currently on holiday in Dubai, the rule change will save his family of 4 around \u00a3400 and another removing the Day 2 PCR will also save the family another \u00a3400.\n\n\u201cHaving returned from a country where there were strict entry requirements and we were tested on arrival I would be very confident that we\u2019ll be returning to the UK Covid free,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\nCancellation fees and no longer having to test before returning would mean significantly less hassle and stress, Mr Hughes added.\n\nPeak booking period\n\nIn response, Mark Tanzer, Chief Executive of ABTA \u2013 The Travel Association, said the two announcements were \u201cpotentially very positive\u201d for the travel sector, but that damage had \u201calready been done\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe now hope to see confidence return as we enter what is usually the peak booking season for summer holidays,\u201d he added.\n\nSteve Heapy, boss of the airline Jet2 and tour operator Jet2 Holidays, also said the timing of the announcement will make a \u201chuge difference\u201d. Numbers of customers on their website, he said, were already increasing \u201cexponentially\u201d after the rule change.\n\nShai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, agreed that the announcement meant customer demand would be boosted in a \u201ccritical booking window\u201d for the industry.\n\nEasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren also welcomed the news, saying it would make travel \u201cmuch simpler and easier\u201d, as customers could now book and travel with \u201cconfidence\u201d.\n\nThe trade body Airlines UK has argued that continuing the current measures would be financially disastrous for the industry.\n\nUK air travel sees huge slump in 2021 due to Covid\n\nWhere will I need to use a Covid passport?\n\nWill Omicron stall airlines\u2019 recovery in 2022?\n\nAhead of the test changes, Manchester Airports Group (MAG) sent the government research it commissioned, which it claimed shows that pre-departure testing has had little or no impact on the spread of Omicron.\n\nIt said that passenger numbers at MAG\u2019s airports fell by more than 30% after Omicron measures were introduced.\n\nTim Hawkins, chief of staff at MAG, told the BBC\u2019s Today programme the research showed there was a \u201cbasis for taking out all tests\u201d related to international travel, due to the high number of Covid cases in the UK.\n\n\u201cWe are beyond the point where international travel restrictions can play a role in managing that peak and if there is no benefit to it then we shouldn\u2019t be doing it and we should take those measures out,\u201d he added.\n\nSeparately, European airline and tour operator stocks rose on Tuesday amid a rise in investor confidence in the sector.\n\nHargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter told Reuters: \u201cWith so many people in the short-term being forced to isolate at home, it\u2019s likely many people will be spending the next few weeks browsing travel blogs for inspiration, given there is so much desperation for a holiday.\u201d\n\nA recent report by aviation analytics firm Cirium found that the Covid pandemic triggered a 71% drop in international flights in and out of the UK in 2021.\n\nBBC",

The Recording Academy said it made the decision to postpone the ceremony \u201cafter careful consideration and analysis with city and state officials, health and safety experts, the artist community and our many partners.\n\n\u201cGiven the uncertainty surrounding the omicron variant, holding the show on January 31st simply contains too many risks,\u201d the academy said in a statement.\n\nLast year, like most major awards shows in early 2021, the Grammys were postponed due to coronavirus concerns. The show was moved from late January to mid-March and held with a spare audience made up of mostly nominees and their guests in and around the Los Angeles Convention Center, next door to its usual home, the arena then known as Staples Center.\n\nIt was a big night for Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift, but the live performances that set the Grammys apart from other awards shows were set separately with no significant crowds, many of them pre-taped.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to celebrating Music\u2019s Biggest Night on a future date, which will be announced soon,\u201d the academy statement said.\n\nFinding that date could be complicated, with two professional basketball teams and a hockey team occupying the arena. The Recording Academy made no mention of a possible venue change in its statement.\n\nThe move was announced around the same time the Sundance Film Festival canceled its in-person programming set to begin on Jan. 20 and shifted to an online format.\n\nThe multitalented Jon Batiste is the leading nominee for this year\u2019s honors, grabbing 11 nods in a variety of genres including R&B, jazz, American roots music, classical and music video.\n\nJustin Bieber, Doja Cat and H.E.R. are tied for the second-most nominations with eight apiece.\n\nThe Grammys\u2019 move could be the beginning of another round of award-show rescheduling after another winter coronavirus surge, with the Screen Actors Guild Awards planned for February and the Academy Awards for March.",
