Activity levels were weaker than the prior week, as trading volume and value declined by 22% and 59.8% WoW respectively.\n\nCommenting on the market development, analysts at InvestData Consulting Limited, said: \u201cWe expect the market to sustain the trend on renewed positioning in fundamentally sound and dividend paying stocks, as oil price rebounds to touch $90, which is one factor that also continues to support economic and market fundamentals. Also, investors are targeting dividend paying stocks as they reposition portfolios ahead of 2021 fourth quarter, Q4 and full-year audited earnings reports that may start hitting the market any moment from now.\u201d\n\nAlso commenting, analysts at Cordros Research, a Lagos based investment house, said: \u201cWith the outcome of the MPC meeting aligning with market expectations amid negative real returns in the fixed income market, we expect investors to continue to cherry-pick stocks with attractive dividend yields. \u201dHowever, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the fragility of the macroeconomic environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.\u201d",

          "text": "By Peter Egwuatu\n\nAgusto & Co, a foremost credit rating agency in Nigeria, has projected that the country\u2019s debt-to-revenue ratio will cross 80 per cent mark in 2022 following the build up to the general election in 2023.\n\nIn their projections for 2022, the agency stated that in 2022, the major themes that will dominate Nigeria\u2019s economic landscape will be politics, the management of the fiscal deficit, foreign exchange policy of the Central Bank and changes in prices and economic growth (or the lack of it).\n\nREAD ALSO:Senate Constitution Review Committee bows to Buhari, rejects State Police\n\nAccording to them, \u201cOf all these factors, politics will dominate the landscape due to the general elections in 2023. \u201dNevertheless, the dominance of politics in 2022 will not diminish the importance of the other major economic themes. \u201dNigeria\u2019s failure to pursue macro-economic reforms over the last eight years has placed the country at a back foot and in 2022 we expect that this reform inertia will persist even till the expiration of the current administration. This could effectively be the legacy of the current administration.\u201d\n\nIt further explained that other socio-political factors that will shape the economic landscape in 2022 come in the form of headwinds, \u201cThe crisis of insecurity characterised by kidnapping and armed banditry across flashpoints in the north and parts of the south will be the most dominant of these socio-political factors. Another social factor to watch out for will be the management of risks around COVID-19.\n\n\u201dOverall, all of these factors will have a telling effect on industries in 2022. Thus, the success of industries in 2022 will largely be defined by the level of resilience within the industry\u201d it noted.\n\nIn its reactions to the management of the fiscal deficit in the country, the agency stated: \u201cIn 2022, we estimate that the debt to revenue ratio will cross the 80% mark and hover between 85% \u2013 90% as election induced spending ramps up. \u201dWhile we do recognise the initiatives to grow fiscal revenues, Agusto & Co is of the opinion that these efforts will not be enough without due consideration to the expenditure element of the fiscal balance equation. Plans to more than double the non-debt recurrent expenditure to aboutN6.9 trillion in 2022 from about N3.5 trillion last year, indicates an absence of fiscal discipline to rein spending largely financed by borrowings.\n\n\u201cWe also believe that this administration will not pursue other deficit financing options \u2013 particularly disposal of assets \u2013 in 2022. In 2021, the federal government estimated revenue projections from privatisation at N205 billion but ended the year without any proceeds from divestments of state- owned enterprises. \u201dIn 2022, the Federal Government has budgeted N90billion from the same source. We believe this will also not materialise.\u201d",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThere were fresh fears at the weekend over the possibility to hold the National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on the proposed February 26 date following the suggestion from the party\u2019s national leadership that the month of March would be more ideal for the exercise.\n\nThe APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) had last week issued a timetable and schedule of activities for the conduct of the convention, announcing that the activities would start on Monday (today) with the submission of the report by the National Reconciliation Committee.\n\nHowever, reacting to the February 26 proposed date, a member of the caretaker committee told Daily Sun that CECPC was still exploring other factors, especially the bye-elections fixed on the same date by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in addition to the outstanding Anambra State congresses, to confirm the viability of the February convention date.\n\nThe source further argued that the ideal date for the convention would have been March, but expressed the fear that the Caretaker Committee could come under severe attacks for the change of date. He, however, said the delay in writing to notify INEC has nothing to do with the consideration to shifting the convention till March.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned, February 26 is sacrosanct for now until we receive a counter order from major stakeholders. Yes, we have not written to INEC, but we still have until February 5 to do so. We are aware that our failure to stick to the constitutional stipulation will heighten speculation over our readiness to conduct the convention.\n\n\u201cAgain, our failure to start the implementation of the timetable and schedule of actions we issued for the convention will be another factor that will fuel speculations. But you have to wait till Monday January 31 when the activities on our timetable will start. All you should understand is that the Caretaker Committee has limited powers because we are taking orders from above. Ours is to implement what has been handed over to us.\n\n\u201cYes, we take orders from Mr President and the governors forum, but we don\u2019t allow ourselves to be controlled by any other external forces the way they did to the immediate past National Working Committee (NWC).\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cIt took the PDP three years to conduct their convention and are still struggling to conduct its zonal convention, why should Nigerians not put pressure on the PDP the way they are doing to the APC. If we have shifted the convention till March, won\u2019t Nigerians still be comfortable with us. We have appraised the situation and suggested that February 26 is not feasible, but many people accused us of all manner of things including the trick to delay the conduct of the exercise. March would have been the most appropriate time for us. We are still looking at many other variables and options.\n\n\u201cConducting convention is the simplest thing to do, but we have to be clinical about it. Ordinarily, the bye-elections would have affected our convention, but since many Nigerians want us to conduct the convention, we have to, even if INEC has 100 bye-elections. As far as the Caretaker Committee is concerned, the convention will hold as planned unless we receive a counter order from Mr. President, the Governors, and other major stakeholders. The general interest of the party should be paramount,\u201d he said.\n\nThe caretaker committee member, who prefered not to disclose his name, equally reacted to the pending conduct of congresses in Anambra, disclosing that security report was delaying it. \u201cI can tell you that the nomination forms are already on sale. We are just waiting for the security situation to know when we will go there and do something within one, two or three days.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, INEC has reminded the ruling party that February 5 is the deadline for issuing the commission with the notice of the convention, if it is still holding it on February 26.\n\nNational Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye and the Chief Press Secretary to the Chairman of the Commission, Rotimi Oyekanmi said the clash in the date for both the convention and bye-election will pose no challenge.\n\n\u201cWhat the commission will require to do is to just monitor the convention. I am also very sure the convention will not take place in any of the states we are going to conduct the bye-election. So, even if the date clashes, it will not pose any challenge to the commission conducting its bye-elections,\u201d Okoye said.",

          "text": "By Nosa Alekhuogie\n\nWith the curtain down on 2021, Nigerian women operating in the tech industry have closed mouth-watering deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars, started new ventures and promoted the cause of gender equality.\n\nWith just 22 per cent of the total number of engineering and technology university graduates each year in Nigeria, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Nigerian women have started to take charge of the critical technology sector.\n\nTHISDAY checks reveal that at least 10 individuals top the log of women in Nigeria and Africa doing wonders in the tech industry.\n\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, women constitute only 30 per cent of professionals in the tech sector. Checks revealed that only 12 per cent of global fintech founders and co-founders were women, and only six per cent of fintechs had female chief executive officers (CEOs).\n\nThe industry has experienced a high influx of women breaking grounds and leveraging financial technology (Fintech).\n\nAccording to the Fintech Association of Nigeria, foreign investors account for some 57 per cent of funding for Fintechs in the country. Furthermore, by increasing smartphone penetration, the association estimates that revenues in the space will reach $543 million this year.\n\nAlthough not having a fair share in the tech industry, Nigerian women are making genuine impact globally. In this report, THISDAY unveils 10 of these young women who are shattering the proverbial glass ceiling and making their marks in the world of technology and innovation.

He had stressed that Nigeria was the first country in Africa and one of the first in the world to introduce digital currency.\n\nThe president had stated, \u201cIndeed, some estimates indicate that the adoption of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and its underlying technology, called blockchain, can increase Nigeria\u2019s GDP by US$29 billion over the next 10 years.\n\n\u201cCBDCs can also help increase remittances, foster cross border trade, improve financial inclusion, make monetary policy more effective, and enable the government to send direct payments to citizens eligible for specific welfare programmes.\u201d\n\nCBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, also said the eNaira would support a resilient payment ecosystem, encourage rapid financial inclusion, reduce the cost of processing cash, enable direct and transparent welfare intervention to citizens, and increase revenue and tax collection.\n\nEmefiele had added, \u201cTherefore, the eNaira is Nigeria\u2019s CBDC and it is the digital equivalent of the physical naira. As the tagline simply encapsulates, the eNaira is the same naira with far more possibilities.\n\n\u201cThe eNaira \u2013 like the physical naira \u2013 is a legal tender in Nigeria and a liability of the CBN. The eNaira and naira will have the same value and will always be exchanged at one naira to one eNaira.\u201d\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) noted recently that the eNaira had been \u201cdrawing substantial interest from the outside world\u201d since it was unveiled.\n\nHowever, IMF pointed out that, like digital currencies elsewhere, eNaira carried risks for monetary policy implementation, cyber security, operational resilience, and financial integrity and stability. It noted that although the digital currency was expected to increase financial inclusion and facilitate remittances, CBN should be prepared to manage the potential risk associated with managing a digital currency.\n\nIt stated that eNaira was the second central bank-backed digital currency fully open to the public after that of the Bahamas.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022$3.54bn joint venture debts offset since 2016\n\n\u2022$1.143bn still outstanding\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) paid an additional cash call arrears of $452,535,270 to its joint venture (JV) partners between November 2020 and November 2021, bringing to $3.54 billion the total debts it paid to the international oil companies (IOCs) since 2016, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nNew data from the national oil company indicated that among the five International Oil Companies (IOCs) being owed the backlog, Mobil Nigeria Producing and Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL) had been fully settled as of November 31, 2021.\n\nThe figures gleaned from the NNPC\u2019s presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) for January 2022, revealed that the two oil majors got a total of $833.7 million and $1.097 billion, respectively, since the arrears repayments started in 2016.\n\nHowever, a THISDAY analysis of the data showed that the NNPC still has an outstanding balance of $1.143 billion, according to the latest data, out of the negotiated total debt of $4.689 billion with the Joint Venture (JV) partners over five years ago.\n\nAside from Mobil and Chevron, other oil majors that are being owed arrears by the NNPC include Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), Total Energies and Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC).\n\nWhile the SPDC has been paid $680.6 million so far, with an outstanding $691.9 million out of the initial $1.37 billion owed, Total as of November 31, 2021, had been paid $411.73 million with a balance of $199.2 million, out of total debt of $610.97 million.\n\nFurthermore, with an initial debt of $774.6 million owed NAOC, payment to date made to the oil company was $522.6 million, with an outstanding of $252 million.\n\nThe NNPC, in 2016, signed a cash call repayment agreement with its JV partners to defray cash-call arrears within five years after many years of its indebtedness to its partners.\n\nBefore then it had consistently for years failed to meet its indebtedness to the IOCs, a situation the operators said caused loss of new investments in the oil and gas sector.\n\nAt the time, the Ministry of Petroleum Resources had negotiated a discount with the IOCs, comprising SPDC, Total, Mobil, Chevron and Agip from about $5.1 billion down to $4.68 billion and had since then continued to reduce the debt payments in instalments.\n\nThe NNPC further explained that in the case of SPDC, repayment was from the price balance distribution on Project Santolina; while in the case of CNL, repayment was from price balance distribution on Projects Cheetah and Falcon.\n\n\u201cNNPC has fully repaid its cash call arrears to MPN and all incremental barrels have reverted to base,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe cash call arrangements, under which NNPC had to pay for its 55 per cent to 60 per cent share of investment in the upstream joint ventures, had been in place for over 40 years before it was restructured.\n\nRecently, President Muhammadu Buhari had declared that the reforms initiated by his administration in 2015 when he took office, including the JV renegotiations, succeeded in saving the oil and gas industry in the country from total collapse.\n\nBuhari noted that, for instance, the payments of huge cash call backlog owed the country\u2019s JV partners took off a huge burden from the NNPC, saying that the current transparency drive in the national oil company was a product of those critical restructurings.\n\nThe president lamented that the sector which accounts for a huge source of foreign exchange for Nigeria, was in dire straits when he took over.\n\n\u201cWhen we were elected into office in 2015, the industry was in a very dire situation worsened by a backlog of Joint Venture (JV) Cash Call arrears.\n\n\u201cThe industry needed reforms to attract more investments and attract the needed revenue to support the nation\u2019s economic growth.\n\n\u201cAs a new administration, we needed to act fast to address the declining prospects of the industry and aggressively drive economic recovery and improve the country,\u201d Buhari had said.\n\nAside from the cash call presentation before the joint committee, the NNPC in its data further explained that it would deduct N127 billion during next month\u2019s FAAC, for what it termed under-recovery.\n\nBut the N127 billion February projected petrol subsidy payment (for January) is far less than the N270 billion netted off the company\u2019s revenue in December 2021, accounting for the highest under-recovery paid yet.\n\n\u201cThe November 2021 value shortfall recovery on the importation of PMS (petrol) amounted to N270,831,143,856.56. The recovery consists of the November 2021 value shortfall of N220.110.853.427.56, plus the outstanding value shortfall recovery of N50,720,290,429.00 for October 2021.\n\n\u201cThe estimated value shortfall of N127.035,585.354.25 is to be recovered from January 2022 proceed due for sharing at the February 2022 FAAC meeting,\u201d it stated.\n\nAccording to the information, the overall NNPC crude lifting of 8.31 million barrels (export & domestic crude) in November 2021 recorded a 7.78 per cent increase relative to the 7.71 barrels lifted in October 2021.\n\nTHISDAY had reported that Nigeria recorded an average production of 1.27 million barrels per day in November/December, while crude oil and gas export revenue received in December 2021 amounted to $5.13 million and $40.14 million respectively.\n\nNigeria LNG feedstock gas receipt was $113.39 million, including receipts of $51.85 million which slipped to December that ought to have been received in November 2021.\n\nFor other receipts, the NNPC data showed that the sum of $62.35 million, being miscellaneous receipts, gas fees, as well as interest income was received in December 2021.\n\nIn addition, the sum of N352,518.463,538.25 was the gross domestic crude oil and gas revenue for December, while strategic holding cost and pipeline repairs amounted to N3,976,516,985.27 even as product losses amounted to N3,307,613,578.863.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The final statement will come from its National Chairman after a National Working Committee (NWC) or National Executive Council (NEC) meeting.\n\n\u201cI believe the PDP will see the reason why it should not present a northern candidate, knowing also that the Middle Belt Forum and the South strongly advocate the mobilisation of their members to work against any political party that selects a northerner as a presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWe need to address our security and development issues, and the North does not have the moral right to the presidency after eight years of President Buhari,\u201d he explained.\n\nBe Ready for a Requiem, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Tells Main Opposition Party\n\nOn its part, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo yesterday described PDP\u2019s plan to throw its presidential ticket open as the most unfortunate decision that if not quickly reversed would lead to the eventual collapse of the opposition party.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of the organisation, Chief Alex Chiedozie Ogbonnia in an interview with THISDAY said it was sad that the party had refused to reciprocate the kind gesture of the people of the South-east over the years.\n\nWhile describing the current agitation for the emergence of the next president from the South-east zone as one based on equity, Ogbonnia said the organisation remained unfazed in its agitation.\n\n\u201cI must tell you that we feel so bad that a party that has enjoyed tremendous support of the Igbos would come out boldly to throw the presidency open not minding our very just and fair agitation.\n\n\u201cFrom 1999 till date, we have continued to support the PDP. In 1999, despite what the party did to our leader, Dr Alex Ekwueme, we still supported Obasanjo. In 2007, we supported Yar\u2019Adua, sustained the support for Jonathan. And today, the best way to pay us back is for the party to throw its ticket open. This is very unfortunate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ohanaeze spokesman further noted that the Igbo nation will sustain its agitation until such a time when the whole world will come to the reality that we must have the presidency.\n\n\u201cToday, we have so many of our people who have declared their intention to seek the presidency of the country come 2023, that\u2019s to show you how ready we are,\u201d he said.\n\nOgbonnia however warned that should the PDP refuse to change its decision and reserve the ticket for only candidates from the South-east, it must be ready to face a requiem.\n\n\u201cThis will certainly be the end of PDP. They still have the opportunity of doing the needful. If they fail to do the right thing, it will be the end of the party. From 1999 till date, the other two legs of the tripod have had the presidency, the Hausas, the Yorubas have had their fair share, Even the South-south have had their share and yet the Igbos are treated with levity,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso reacting, the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) has described as ridiculous the move by the main opposition party to jettison zoning and throw open the 2023 presidential race to all interested aspirants.\n\nThe group also said it would watch and see how far the party can go with the arrangement.\n\nPANDEF\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Hon. Ken Robinson, made the position of the group known in an interview with THISDAY yesterday.\n\n\u201cSuffice to say, it\u2019s a ridiculous decision. We have sufficiently made our position known on this matter. We\u2019ll wait to see how it will go,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Welfare of average Nigerian paramount to ruling party, says Osinbajo\n\nDeji Elumoye and Chuks Okocha\n\n\n\nBarring any unforeseen circumstance, the National Caretaker Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) led by the Yobe State Governor, Mallam Mai Mala Buni, will meet this week on the zoning of all the party offices, ahead of the party\u2019s February 26 national convention, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nThis is coming as the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo has disclosed that the ruling party would remain committed to the welfare of the common man.\n\nA member of the CECPC told THISDAY at the weekend that the caretaker committee would also set up a zoning committee to address the issue of the zoning of the party\u2019s elective positions.\n\nAccording to him, the zoning committee will consider equity and justice before coming up with its position on zoning.\n\nThe CECPC member, who urged members of the party to ignore all former reports of zoning, also described such reports as fake.\n\nHe said that the expected zoning committee would be guided by justice and fairness by ensuring that all zones and states are fairly represented.\n\nWhen asked whether the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the APC would be summoned to approve the zoning arrangement before implementation, he said the Buni-led committee would play the dual role of the NWC and NEC of the party.\n\n\u201cWe are a child of circumstance. We are playing two roles in one. CECPC is playing the role of both the working committee and the NEC.\n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be any NEC meeting, but we are working with the governors of the party and others to ensure that everything about the convention is set on course and that there will be no trouble. We shall deliver a smooth and transparent convention.\n\n\u201cAfter our meeting this week, every doubting person will keep quiet. At the end of the day, because there is no NEC, the report of the zoning committee will be sent to the President who is the leader of the party and the governors for their perusal and advice and we are set to go for the February 26 date,\u201d he explained.\n\nHowever, one of the chairmanship aspirants, Mr Saliu Mustapha has insisted that the North-central geopolitical zone should produce the next national chairman of the APC. \u201cIt is for balancing and equity. We are the bridge linking the North and South,\u201d he said.\n\nWelfare of Average Nigerian Paramount to Ruling Party, Says Osinbajo\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President Osinbajo has disclosed that the ruling APC would remain committed to the welfare of the common man.\n\nHe attributed this to the party being that of the people and the resolve of the APC to continually ensure that the common man benefits maximally from the government.\n\nOsinbajo, according to a statement issued yesterday by his Media Assistant, Mr Laolu Akande, made this disclosure when he played host to a delegation of the APC Professionals Forum at the State House, Abuja.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThis is a party of the common man, a party of the people, a party that takes as its cradle, the importance of ensuring that the common man benefits maximally from the government which is why we have the big programmes like the Social Investment Programmes, the largest of its kind in the continent and several of such other programmes that emphasise how serious we take the lot of the common man\u201d.\n\nReminiscing on the party\u2019s formation about nine years ago, the VP noted that APC has made an impact and it is determined to improve the well-being of Nigerians.\n\nHe added that the party is also where many young people are, stressing that \u201cwe are the ruling party in Africa\u2019s largest democracy, which by itself is a phenomenal achievement for such a young party.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ll find that in the particular ideological direction of our party, it\u2019s one that was clear to the founders of the party, the initial persons and groups that came together to form the party and they came from different parties, but it was to present a left of centre, a social democratic alternative to the ruling party.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo further stated that the APC is determined to ensure the country\u2019s further growth and development, noting that the party carries with it, the hopes and expectations of millions of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe party is not a mere platform for running for political office, it carries with it the hopes and expectations of millions of Nigerians and we must make it a place where they are comfortable, a place where they feel this belongs to us. We can even put our resources into it; it is not just for politicians; it is for us all.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo said leaders and politicians are there to serve the people and give them reasons to believe in a better country.\n\n\u201cOur people, the Nigerian people, need hope; they need to be able to believe in the politicians; they need to be able to believe in their leaders and if the leaders are within the political party, that political party must have an ideology that is attractive to them, that makes them feel wanted, that makes them feel cared for and I think that role is so crucial.\n\n\u201cIt is the role this Professional Forum must take on to itself. And what it entails aside from that logical objective of the forum; what it entails is defining in writing in various ways what our party stands for.\u201d\n\nAcknowledging the significance of the APC Professionals Forum in the scheme of things, the vice president urged the Forum to play more important roles in shaping the party\u2019s ideology.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are many people that say well, we have not done this, we have not done that. There are so many ways of looking at it, but the truth of the matter is that the party was committed and is seen across the country as a party of the common man, which is why I think the role of the Professionals Forum is particularly important because we are trying to shape the ideology of the party\u201d.\n\nHe stressed that professionals are integral to ensuring the party stays focused on the wellbeing of Nigerians and its ideals, as stated in the Constitution and manifesto, respectively.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cif the professionals cannot do that, then our party becomes all comers, anything goes so long as we have a platform to run for political office. But I think that we, especially professionals, have a unique advantage.\n\n\u201cWe have many who have run their businesses, who have professional organisations or who have excelled in their professions and we know that the only way to do things properly is if we can press on without relenting.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo further hoped that the APC Professionals Forum will also carry the hopes and expectations of millions of the party\u2019s supporters nationwide.\n\nHe also believed that the Forum, made up of professional elites, will be of great benefit to the party and Nigeria because of its leadership and quality of professionals on its board of trustees and as members, who he noted \u201care not just politicians, but people who have distinguished themselves\u201d in their respective fields.\n\n\u201cI think our party will rely a great deal on this forum and I hope and pray that the Forum will realise all of its objectives, including the extra ones that our party must place upon you, especially at this time in the life and history of our dear country,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE Anti-graft Agency, EFCC Suspends Operative Caught On Audio \u2018Lecturing\u2019 Brother Of Nigerian Rear Admiral Wanted For N2billion Fraud",
          "text": "An operative of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) who was caught on tape giving hints on how to defeat the anti-graft commission at the Court of Appeal to one Abdulbari Yusuf, the younger brother to a former Director of Nigerian Navy Accounts, Rear Admiral Tahir Yusuf (retd.) has been suspended.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that Yusuf is currently being prosecuted by the Nigerian government through the EFCC for stealing N2billion while serving as Director of Nigerian Navy Accounts.\n\nAccording to a source, the operative, who is a lawyer and policeman, Mohammed Idris, was suspended after a leaked audio conversation he had with Abdulbari was released by SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cMohammed Idris has been suspended by the commission over the recent audio. Remember he was detained last year after the first audio went viral, but he was released after that. But immediately this recent audio was released by SaharaReporters, he was suspended by the chairman of the commission while they investigate the audio,\u201d the source told SaharaReporters. See Also Scandal Leaked Audio: EFCC Operative \u2018Lectures\u2019 Brother Of Nigerian Navy Admiral Wanted For N2billion Fraud On How To Win Case Against Commission\n\nIdris had in a leaked audio conversation with Abdulbari said he was angry when he saw the judgment against the retired naval officer.\n\nHe added that the forfeiture case filed against Yusuf at the Federal High Court by his colleague (in the EFCC) was \u201cnot strong\u201d, wondering why his lawyer could not defend it.\n\n\u201cBut the lawyer that represented at the high court did not do anything. He is a clueless and a useless lawyer. I went to the court, I saw the process and response, they filed forfeiture of his money on non-conviction basis,\u201d he was heard saying.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the lawyer did not do well; he did not demonstrate much to allow the court in Abuja to finally forfeit it; because even the courts in Abuja are not in support of the commission. So if it were in Lagos, it would\u2019ve become something else. But Abuja, he did not put much defence. The defence is not really strong. But like Kabir told me, they employed a Senior Advocate.\n\n\u201cThere are so many Senior Advocates that don\u2019t even have understanding of what the EFCC does. If we file an application or charges, we will get away with it because they don\u2019t even know anything in relation to criminal proceedings. The said Ameh is very good.\u201d See Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: EFCC Operative Who Exposed How Nigeria\u2019s Attorney-General, Malami, Ordered Unfreezing Of \u2018Big Cases\u2019 Bank Accounts Detained After Leaked Audio\n\nWhen asked about Yusuf\u2019s chances at the appellate court, the EFCC operative had said, \u201cThe chances are that first of all, he must show that the properties he acquired were not through the government, he must show that he acquired the properties through other means. If he cannot show that he acquired through other means, that means he cannot claim the money.\n\n\u201cAnd based on the provision that he has proved to be a public servant and he works with the government of a country and he is still in service and all this money is not his entitlement, he has not acquired them. So if he cannot show that the property or the money was acquired through other means, then he must forfeit the said property.\n\n\u201cRecently, a court of appeal set aside a case of the Executive Director of First Bank, Dauda Lawan. It was set aside recently. Although I and my colleague, we got the settling at the lower court and I later stopped following up on the case. We voluntarily forfeited some of the money, some time. At court of appeal lately, they declared judgment against us because he demonstrated how he got the properties. But if he tries to go ahead to file ordinary brief of argument, we will lose the case again.\n\n\u201cThis person that filed this brief of argument against your brother did not file something that is very strong, despite that she got judgment. That really got me angry, when I saw that, immediately the lady went out, I called Kabir and told him everything.\n\n\u201cWalahi, he (lawyer) was so stupid to surrender. He could have fought the case and demonstrated like that of inheritance, if he had fought hard, maybe they wouldn\u2019t have pronounced the judgment by now.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of a Federal High Court in Abuja ordered the permanent forfeiture of about N500million found to be fraudulently amassed by the military officer to the Nigerian government.\n\nThe total amount forfeited was N392,695,857.87, including $91,955.38 and the sum of \u00a315,050 held in domiciliary accounts.\n\nYusuf, previously second-in-command to the Chief of Account and Budget, Naval Headquarters (NHQ), held the cash in seven accounts- both private and corporate in two banks.\n\nThe seven accounts were operated under the name of a company, Bitmas Enterprise, in Zenith Bank while two were held in Yusuf\u2019s name in the defunct Skye Bank, now Polaris Bank.\n\nFollowing the forfeiture, SaharaReporters gathered that Yusuf fled Nigeria to Dubai, United Arab Emirate.\n\nThe EFCC and National Intelligence Agency also asked the Nigeria Immigration Service and Interpol to place him on a watch list and have him arrested at the point of entry or exit.\n\nHowever, Yusuf sneaked back to the country in October 2021 after he illegally obtained an international passport with the help of some corrupt government officials through Niger Republic, a source had told SaharaReporters.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how Yusuf once boosted of giving money to many EFCC operatives including the commission\u2019s Director of Operations.\n\nThe retired military officer had disclosed this to his workers after illegally reopening two of his hotels sealed by the anti-graft agency.\n\n\u201cAfter EFCC marked Rtd Tahir Yusuf\u2019s hotels in Kaduna and Sokoto, guess what he did, he asked his people to wipe and clean the EFCC markings.

          "text": "Babangida Aliyu, former governor of Niger State, has said some Northerners made it impossible for former President Goodluck Jonathan to defeat Boko Haram.\n\nAccording to PUNCH, the former governor said it was unfortunate that insecurity had been allowed to escalate.\n\nEx-President Goodluck Jonathan\n\nHe said, \u201cWhen Boko Haram started and Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s government started doing something about it, it fell on former President Jonathan to carry on. Many Northerners misconstrued his (Jonathan) position at that time and for political purposes, they threw many arguments that made it impossible for the proper articulation and proper implementation of policies that would have got rid of Boko Haram and now, we still have them till today.\n\n\u201cThe banditry that many of us thought was impossible to happen, I am yet to hear from anybody about the statement credited to Kawu Baraje, our former PDP national chairman in Kwara State, when he stated that they brought the bandits or Fulani from other places. I think based on the thinking that probably former President Jonathan wouldn\u2019t have handed over power even if they had won, but he handed over.\n\n\u201cHe congratulated them even before the conclusion proper counting of votes which then took away whatever purposes of bringing those people would have served and I would have thought that if that is true, then those who brought them in would compensated them to go back to where they came from.\n\n\u201cIf the governors had really done a lot from 2015 to date, we would have got rid of the banditry.\n\n\u201dToday it\u2019s so unfortunate that you probably have to be praying when you leave Abuja for Kaduna or Kaduna to Abuja or indeed, particularly in the Northern states.\n\n\u201cNow, even in the day time, you can\u2019t drive freely and comfortably.

Many Northerners misconstrued his (Jonathan) position at that time and for political purposes, they threw many arguments that made it impossible for the proper articulation and proper implementation of policies that would have got rid of Boko Haram and now, we still have them till today.\n\n\u201cThe banditry that many of us thought was impossible to happen, I am yet to hear from anybody about the statement credited to Kawu Baraje, our former PDP national chairman in Kwara State, when he stated that they brought the bandits or Fulani from other places. I think based on the thinking that probably former President Jonathan wouldn\u2019t have handed over power even if they had won, but he handed over.\n\n\u201cHe congratulated them even before the conclusion proper counting of votes which then took away whatever purposes of bringing those people would have served and I would have thought that if that is true, then those who brought them in would compensated them to go back to where they came from.\n\n\u201cIf the governors had really done a lot from 2015 to date, we would have got rid of the banditry.\n\n\u201dToday it\u2019s so unfortunate that you probably have to be praying when you leave Abuja for Kaduna or Kaduna to Abuja or indeed, particularly in the Northern states.\n\n\u201cNow, even in the day time, you can\u2019t drive freely and comfortably. So, I believe that the first port of call for fighting insecurity is the governors.

Its users can access all equities available on the US stock exchanges, that is, the stocks of roughly 6,000 companies.\n\n\u201cOur goal is simple: we want to give Africans and their asset managers easy, fast and secure access to global investment options that will allow them to earn real returns,\u201d Bassey said in a statement released Monday.\n\nWith the new funding, Bamboo plans to further accelerate its growth, doubling down on unlocking new markets and launching more products, it said while Bassey told TechCabal in an emailed response that Bamboo will be providing more asset classes and investment opportunities for its users.\n\n\u201cBamboo is enabling Africans to build wealth by creating an investing platform that is helpful to both experienced investors and to those new to the stock market. We are thrilled to support the innovative, user-first approach the Bamboo team is bringing to market,\u201d Greycroft Partner Alison Lange Engel said on the investment.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLast year, the company launched Powered by Bamboo, its API solution that allows asset managers, fintech companies, and other financial institutions to plug into Bamboo\u2019s API to provide their customers access to global securities. The company has been testing the product with a small group of companies and expects to onboard more this year.\n\n\u201cEveryone building for African investors is welcome. We plan to add other products and tools that offer greater access and make global investing simpler from Africa,\u201d Bassey said. \u201cWe\u2019re building the technology infrastructure powering financial services in Africa.\u201d\n\nIn April 2021, Bamboo announced plans to launch in Ghana and has since seen more than 50,000 Ghanaians join the waitlist, according to the company. In the near future, Bamboo plans to expand into more markets such as Kenya and South Africa, Bassey said.\n\nCompared to developed markets such as the United States, investing in stocks is relatively new in Nigeria, and Africa at large. For instance, nearly 75% of Bamboo users have never traded stocks before.\n\nThus, the company has had to put significant effort into educating its users on how to invest and become better investors, using a mix of regular educational content published on its social media, a stock market course, an investment bootcamp, newsletters with investing tips and exclusive value-added services from top investment advisors like The Motley Fool and MyWallSt.\n\nThese efforts appear to pay off, going by Bamboo\u2019s figures. In 2021, repeat depositors made up 85% of deposits on the platform, an indication that Bamboo users are rapidly gaining confidence in trading US stocks.\n\nBut with the US equities market experiencing its worst January in well over a decade\u2014since 2009\u2014how are Bamboo users reacting to the downturn?\n\n\u201cEven though they are new to stock investing, Bamboo users tend to handle their emotions like more seasoned investors,\u201d Bassey said. \u201cWe saw this during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic crash and we\u2019re seeing it again now.\u201d\n\nBamboo allows Nigerians buy and trade US stocks in real-time from their mobile phones or computers.\n\nAfrica\u2019s wealth management market remains largely underdeveloped but holds high potential. According to data cited by Bamboo, Africans account for over 16% of the world\u2019s population, yet they own less than 1% of global wealth.\n\nBut that is expected to change over the next decade, with private wealth in the continent expected to increase by 30% to reach $2.6 trillion by 2030, according to AfrAsia Bank.\n\nBassey is upbeat platforms like Bamboo will play a major role in realising the projected growth, by helping to develop an investing culture among Africans.\n\n\u201cWe think investing in stocks has a bright future in Nigeria. Nigerians are hungry to earn a return on their investments and build wealth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are bullish on platforms such as ours in bringing more Nigerians into the world of investing.\u201d\n\nWithout revealing many details, Bamboo says in the statement it plans to make it seamless for African investors in the diaspora to discover the best investment opportunities on the continent.\n\nIn August, Nigeria\u2019s central bank received court approval to freeze the bank accounts of Bamboo and other similar Nigerian fintech platforms for a six-month period. However, Bassey confirmed the company received a court order unfreezing its accounts. \u201cAll have been unfrozen now,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "What do blockchain, NFT, DAO and crypto mean?",
          "text": "Do you need a guide for all the big tech terms people are throwing about on the internet? What do blockchain, NFT, DAO and crypto mean?\n\nOver the past couple of years, there\u2019s been an influx of words that explain certain tech concepts. Some of them like crypto, or even NFTs, have been around for a while. In fact, NFT\u2014as a word\u2014was first used in 2014 and now, 7 years later, it\u2019s still a concept that escapes a lot of us. Others like DeFi or DAOs are fairly new, but they\u2019re still getting thrown around a lot.\n\nWhether you\u2019re new or old to tech, reading about concepts can feel like learning a new language. So TechCabal is creating a guide\u2014short explainers\u2014for common tech terms. In this, you\u2019re sure to find simple short explanations that can help you understand NiFTy concepts.\n\n1. Blockchain\n\nA few of the concepts we\u2019ll explain here are based on blockchain so it\u2019s important this goes first.\n\nBlockchain is a record-keeping tech that\u2019s designed to make it impossible to hack the system or forge the data stored on it.\n\nHow it works: Standard databases store data in rows, columns and files, but blockchain stores data in blocks that are chained together. The data on the blocks are continuously updated, encrypted, and stored on several computers so there\u2019s no single computer to hack or control the data from.\n\nIn explaining blockchain, Buchi Okoro\u2014CEO and co-founder of African cryptocurrency exchange Quidax\u2014said: \u201cImagine a book where you write down everything you spend money on each day. Each page is similar to a block, and the entire book, a group of pages, is a blockchain. With a blockchain, everyone who uses a cryptocurrency has their own copy of this book to create a unified transaction record. The software logs each new transaction as it happens, and every copy of the blockchain is updated simultaneously with the new information, keeping all records identical and accurate.\u201d\n\n2. Cryptocurrency\n\nImage source: Aceris Law\n\nWe all know what currencies are\u2014dollars, pounds, shillings. Well, cryptocurrencies are digital currencies. You can\u2019t hold it the way you\u2019d hold fiat currencies like CFA coins or naira notes, but you can still spend it on things you love.\n\nHow it works: Cryptos are digital currencies created on blockchain technology. If you got a sense of what blockchains are, then you\u2019ll understand what we mean when we say that cryptocurrencies are decentralised; no one person or government controls them. They are created by algorithms and used to award engineers\u2014called miners\u2014who carry out maintenance on the blockchain.\n\nUnlike fiat currencies which derive their value and validity from states, cryptocurrencies derive their value and validity from the blockchain.\n\n3. Non-fungible token (NFT)\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by its mushroom-sounding title, NFTs are in fact inedible, even the NFT flavours. NFTs are unique digital assets created on a blockchain.\n\nHow it works: To put it simply, NFTs are digital works that exist on blockchain. They can be images, sounds, game skins, or even clothes for your digital avatars. These digital works are impossible to duplicate or forge; they\u2019re one of a kind and that makes them valuable. If you\u2019re asking yourself why a screenshot of an NFT isn\u2019t as valuable, it\u2019s because NFTs have been embedded with code which is what makes them exist on the blockchain.\n\nThink of it this way, when you go to a museum and take photos of artefacts, what you have is just a photo which isn\u2019t quite valuable. The museum still has the original valuable artefact.\n\nIt\u2019s similar with NFTs. We can take screenshots of Niyi Okeowo\u2019s $2,800 Indigo Child (below) but it doesn\u2019t mean we own the asset. The original copy\u2014the property rights and certificate of authenticity\u2014belong to the buyer.\n\nNiyi Okeowo\u2019s \u201cIndigo Child\u201d\n\n4. Web3\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen tech bros throw the word \u201cWeb3\u201d around a lot. It\u2019s the answer experts give to questions from \u201cWhat is the future of the internet?\u201d to \u201cWhat does Spiderman navigate the internet with?\u201d\n\nBut what exactly is Web3? To put it simply, Web3 is taking democracy to the internet.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at Web3\u2019s ancestors, Web1 and Web2, so we can understand what it\u2019s all about.\n\nWeb1 was the earliest version of the internet, which existed between the 1900s and the early 2000s. In this version, content was delivered via texts and graphics to users who could only consume the content but not interact with it.\n\nWeb2 is what we have now, an interactive and social web where companies can build revolutionary apps that allow users to become creators. It\u2019s centralised, i.e. controlled by companies or governments who can decide when websites, apps or content can be taken down with little input from users.\n\nOn Web2, apps are only available for as long as the company that owns them decides. Streaming sites can shut down, online games can upload patches users don\u2019t like (yes, I\u2019m looking at you Riot Games), and traditional banks can freeze bank accounts when the government demands it.\n\nHow Web3 works: Web3 will be built on the blockchain working independently from different parts of the world.\n\nOn Web3, decisions regarding the design and operation of products and funds\u2014including crypto\u2014will be made by communities of people called Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs), and not governments or companies. So if you find an app or product you like, you can join the DAO of that product, buy shares and vote on which changes should be made.\n\nFor example, if you joined TechCabal\u2019s DAO, you\u2019ll get to decide how we upgrade or downgrade depending on how much shares you have in the DAO.\n\n5. Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)\n\nDAOs or Decentralised Autonomous Organisations are social communities that will create rules and regulations which will be embedded in programming codes.\n\nHow it works: Unlike conventional organisations like TechCabal, which have managers and boards of directors that govern it, DAOs are governed by communities\u2014who don\u2019t have to be developers of the product. DAOs are created by developers who decide on a set of rules and embed it in\u2014digital contracts on blockchain that are executed when certain conditions are met.\n\nThe communities decide what happens to the products attached to that DAO, what upgrades to make and when to make it. Each DAO will have its own token which will be sold to its community members, and the more tokens you have, the heavier your stake and voting rights.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "He built TikTok's strategy in Africa, now he's building Kippa",
          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Seth Onyango/bird\n\nTikTok made huge waves when it announced its sponsorship of the African Cup of Nations, the continent\u2019s biggest football tournament. Kennedy Ekezie-Joseph who helped lead TikTok\u2019s entry into Africa, was no longer with the company for that moment of triumph. Instead, he was grinding away at a new startup. Big mistake? Maybe not.\n\nLeaving a budding career at social networking behemoth that has big ambitions on your home continent, to launch a startup, sounds like a suicidal move. But for Ekezie-Joseph, 23, who was part of a small group that led TikTok\u2019s foray into Africa and was well-positioned to benefit from the company\u2019s continental ambitions, it actually wasn\u2019t. That much became clear when his startup attracted record seed funding.\n\nEkezie-Joseph\u2019s startup, Kippa, is a bookkeeping and finance app that he founded with Duke Ekezie (his brother) and Jephthah Uche in February 2021. It has had a meteoric trajectory since its launch in June.\n\nIn November, the startup hauled in $3.2 million in pre-seed funding, arguably one of the largest early-stage fund-raises in Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMobile phone and Whatsapp-friendly, Kippa targets small and medium-sized enterprises (SME\u2019s) providing them with free, easy-to-use accounting software. Kippa then looks at potential financing opportunities and makes revenue by taking commission fees and earning interest by lending companies working capital.\n\nTo date, more than a billion dollars in transactions have been recorded by the platform, according to the founders.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria today, there are 47 million SMEs, according to SMED Analyst statistics out there. About 280,000 merchants out of that number, have used the product. And our goal is over the next five to 10 years to capture as much of that number as possible, by building out new features, by launching new product lines,\u201d Ekezie-Joseph said in an interview with bird.\n\nAs a child, Ekezie-Joseph saw first-hand how the absence of judicious record-keeping could impact fragile and shock-prone micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n\u201cMy dad had a small business around when I was born, which he lost. And so for me, it really means a lot to build for a segment that I feel very intimately familiar with,\u201d Ekezie-Joseph said.\n\nF-R: Duke, Japhthah, and Kennedy, co-founders of Kippa\n\nKippa (a play on book\u201dkeeper\u201d) is a bookkeeping mobile app that allows small business owners to keep track of their daily income and expense transactions, issue invoices, provide receipts to their customers and create marketing materials like business cards.\n\nThe app also keeps track of debtors who owe the subscriber companies money.\n\nWhen he launched Kippa, Ekezie-Joseph knew from personal experience that he was addressing an existential threat to businesses. This gave him and his team confidence.\n\nTrue to their projection, Kippa was an instant hit at launch, striking a chord with thousands of SMEs in Nigeria, underlining the opportunities and the demand for this particular service.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, SMEs have been laggers when it comes to the adoption of digital technology. What we\u2019ve seen is digital technology has changed very many other industries \u2013 healthcare, transport \u2013 but the way businesses are run and the overall back-office operations are still very manual, they\u2019ve really not changed since the 60s,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cSo what we\u2019re trying to do here is unite the tailwind of the deep penetration of the internet that is continuing to grow across the continent and the smartphone penetration. So by 2025, Nigeria alone will contribute 4 per cent of total new smartphone users in the world. And we think that\u2019s such an exciting deal in that, companies like us are building on the back of to provide tools that business owners can use on these devices that they have.\u201d\n\nKennedy Ekezie-Joseph presented with a Queen\u2019s Young Leaders Award in 2018 for his work in promoting women\u2019s rights in the areas of female genital mutilation (FGM), domestic abuse and forced child marriage and access to education for girls.\n\nEkezie-Joseph and his team are now planning another round of fundraising to scale the company\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cSo we will be talking to investors over the next couple of months. And one of the big things we believe in is building relationships early and taking time to identify the right partners to work with. So if we do meet investors who are the right fit, we\u2019ll be able to work with them,\u201d he said.\n\nEkezie-Joseph was an early recipient of the prestigious Yenching Scholarship, a masters program at the elite Peking University in Beijing, China.\n\nA top Nigerian debater while still at college, as a 16-year-old college freshman, he had already begun using his voice to change his community, founding a social enterprise that worked to end the practice of female genital mutilation in communities and increase access to education for young girls.\n\nWith two TEDx talks under his belt, a Barack Obama Young African Leaders Fellowship and a Resolution Fellowship and numerous recognitions and accolades, Ekezie-Joseph has a track record of success despite his young age.\n\nA master\u2019s degree from an elite academy at Beijing\u2019s top research university must have made Ekezie-Joseph a shoo-in at TikTok, owned by Beijing-based Bytedance. He was part of the early expansion of TikTok into Africa. But the experience at a university that has given rise to some of the world\u2019s greatest tech companies and spawned dozens of top global entrepreneurs, may have also given him bigger ambitions.\n\n\u201cI was the first line here and had the team to lead our acquisition and growth for the company\u2019s expansions. Africa? We had a couple thousand users of the product, then. And you know, we\u2019ve gone from then, 2018, to today being the third-most-used social app in Africa, with tens of millions of users,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile acknowledging the economic impact of COVID-19 on the continent, Ekezie-Joseph noted that it had helped fuel the growth of the tech industry and internet adoption in Africa.\n\n\u201cThat was the first time many merchants understood that they could do business online. That was the first time many consumers understood that they could transact with merchants online. So it almost helped us leapfrog the absence of trust around digital tools. And that\u2019s been super helpful. And more and more people are doing business online now. So that is very significant for our growth as a business,\u201d he said.\n\nBeyond the early conversion of bookkeepers and small business owners, Ekezie-Joseph is the first to admit that there are plenty of hurdles ahead.\n\n\u201cTo bring the right people in the door, bring the most experienced people in the industry and have them around the table working with us pursuing the mission. And so that means bringing regulators on board, you know, people will have experience engaging with them, and industry veterans. So that is a very big one for us,\u201d he said in an interview with the bird story agency.\n\n\u02dc\u201dThe second thing is also executing on our roadmap\u2026the way we think about it last year, we built a really solid product and validated the need for it in the market. And this is truly the year we build processes around that and leverage that and we continue to build at breakneck speed for all users and establish our place in the market.\u201d\n\nSo have there been misgivings over leaving TikTok?\n\n\u201cNo! The plan was always to eventually move back to Nigeria and build a startup and the onset of the pandemic in China, gave me the perfect reason to make the move back and take the leap,\u201d Ekezie-Joseph said.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "American tech conglomerate Meta (formerly Facebook) on Monday joined the list of tech companies like Microsoft and Nvidia who have built an AI supercomputer, with the recent announcement of its new Artificial Intelligence (AI) Research SuperCluster (RSC). Meta claims RSC is already among the fastest supercomputers and, when completed in mid-2022, will be the world\u2019s fastest.\n\nSupercomputers are high-performance computers that perform computationally intensive (high-speed) tasks such as weather forecasting, climate research, and oil and gas exploration. AI supercomputers are an improved version of supercomputers that can carry out more calculations per second than regular supercomputers, using the same hardware.\n\n\u201cRSC will help Meta\u2019s AI researchers build better AI models that can learn from trillions of examples; work across hundreds of different languages; seamlessly analyse text, images and video together; develop new augmented reality tools; and more,\u201d the company explained in a blog post.\n\nWith more than 2.6 billion monthly active users, Meta\u2019s Facebook is the most popular social media in the world. In Africa, Meta\u2019s suite of social messaging tools\u2014Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp\u2014serve as the internet for hundreds of millions of people. Businesses and consumers depend heavily on these messaging platforms because its use is ubiquitous and access to these apps and sites are free or discounted on many African telecom networks.\n\nRSC is expected to aid Meta in identifying harmful content on Facebook and Instagram; processing larger and longer videos with higher sampling rates; and in developing new augmented reality tools. It\u2019s a valuable tool that\u2019ll aid Meta in accomplishing its plans to move billions of users into the Metaverse in the near future.\n\nBefore this announcement, Meta has been using the first generation of the supercomputer designed in 2017, which could design 22,000 NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs in a single cluster that performs 35,000 training jobs a day.\n\nRealising the need to accelerate progress, work on the RSC began in early 2020, with Meta engineers designing and building a new AI supercomputer system from ground up.\n\n\u201cRSC today comprises a total of 760 NVIDIA DGX A100 systems as its compute nodes, for a total of 6,080 GPUs\u2014with each A100 GPU being more powerful than the V100 used in the previous system,\u201d the company said.\n\nCompared to the first generation of Meta\u2019s supercomputer, early benchmarks on RSC show that it \u201cruns computer vision workflows up to 20 times faster, runs the NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) more than nine times faster, and trains large-scale NLP models three times faster. That means a model with tens of billions of parameters can finish training in three weeks, compared with nine weeks before,\u201d Meta said.\n\n\n\nAware of privacy concerns, the company added that RSC has been designed from the ground up with privacy and security in mind. Meta\u2019s researchers can safely train models using encrypted user-generated data that is not decrypted until right before training.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2014, Uber, the poster child for tech disruption, decided to enter its second African country, Nigeria. Basically, when a company makes such a decision, it would have to take the necessary steps to be considered legally operative in that country and do specific research on how to fit the product brand into that locality.\n\nAs Uber was the first of many ride-hailing apps in the country, it was virtually high-risk for the company. It had to comply with all local standards and rules relating to its product offering and model even when there wasn\u2019t a competitor to benchmark against.\n\nTo handle this, Uber contacted a law firm that provides such services \u2014 market entry, permit authorisation, and advisory requirements \u2014 for multinational companies looking to enter Africa. Typically, the law firm goes the route of getting multiple legal counsels in all the jurisdictions they want to operate in.\n\nEunice Olopade (CEO) and Usman Sotunde (CTO), lawyers working in the law firm, thought about how cool it would be if all these could be done on a single interface. With years of experience in the bag, they decided to build a simple system that works. Soon, along with Abdulwaheed Yusuf (COO), they co-founded Sidebrief, a registration tech (regtech) startup.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEunice Olopade, Co-founder/CEO, Sidebrief. Source: Supplied\n\nUp until the last decade, continental and international expansion wasn\u2019t a thing among African startups. The region\u2019s fragmented nature has been a major challenge for global companies looking to enter the continent.\n\n\u201cThere was no single platform where you could get information about access into the African market. If you wanted to get into the African market today and you had the intention to enter five countries, you\u2019ll have to interface with multiple lawyers, multiple advisors, multiple regulatory bodies to be able to set up across these different markets,\u201d Olopade hints.\n\nUnfortunately, startups based in Africa aren\u2019t insulated from this challenge. On paper, the introduction of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) in 2019 was expected to cause a boost in trade, economic growth, and integration across the continent. However, not much has been achieved so far.\n\nAnd this is where Sidebrief comes into play. Its intention is \u201c\u2026 sharing the roadmap on how to effectively expand across jurisdictions without having to hire somebody here and there.\u201d\n\nAnd this is not limited to African countries, as Olopade confirms that the regtech startup also assists African founders with incorporation, tax registration, tax returns, and overall structuring for those that have their holding companies outside the continent, like Delaware, US.\n\nHarmonising cross-border expansion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlopade points out that simply hiring lawyers in all the locations could affect the validity of the overall set-up of the business as they may not always provide definitive information about all requirements.\n\nShe adds that the role of legal entities often ends with company incorporation. Meanwhile, there are tax registration requirements to be fulfilled, business-specific certifications to acquire, and industry licences/permits to get. With no access to such information, set-up is always incomplete.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a platform that helps not only with market entry but with business compliance across several countries in Africa. Ongoing business compliance is arguably more important than just setting up, so the platform that we\u2019ve built over time is what we primarily use to ensure that our clients and prospective clients are up to date on their business compliance requirements while running their businesses. There was a gap here.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrusting the process\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSidebrief does not only give access to the necessary information and assist companies with all the steps, but it also saves them the stress of having to make any contact with issuing companies. Basically, engaging lawyers directly would demand more money and time \u2014 in terms of billable hours \u2014 same with trying to get the attention of regulatory authorities.\n\nOlopade boasts about the seamless nature of the Sidebrief platform\u2018s transaction process.\n\n\u201cEverything that we do, from corporate registrations to tax to intellectual property registrations can be done on the platform. Once you sign-up on the platform, we take it from there. If we need to reach out to you for more information, we\u2019ll do that. But primarily, once you provide all the necessary information and upload the required documents, you could go ahead and pay.\u201d\n\nDue to the low-trust nature of the African market, Sidebrief also issues invoices on request or arranges virtual calls or physical visits for negotiations.\n\nAfter payment, Sidebrief engages the regulatory authority on behalf of the client, gets the requested document, and uploads it into the customer\u2019s account. This is followed by a prompt. As is standard practice, duration and cost are determined by the market and services required.\n\n\u201cProduct pricing differs across markets, we offer one time fees and bundled services depending on add ons but we are moving towards a uniform fee across markets. Entity Incorporation, Tax Registration and IP Registration are just the basics. There are several other layers we are now building on the stack which we will be rolling out, like cross-border tax management.\u201d\n\nServices can be delivered between 24 hours to a few weeks and could cost between $200 to $5,000, which Olopade believes is highly competitive compared to individuals.\n\n\u201cIn Kenya, for instance, we would charge $2,000 for registration, KRA pin for the company and one of its directors, and provide support for handling bank account opening,\u201d Olopade says.\n\nOne major metric considered in ranking countries\u2019 ease of doing business is how long it takes to set up and begin operating a business. This indicator comprises the procedure, time, and cost of corporate registration, asset registration, securing permits, and enforcing contracts, among others. To an extent, these could be determining factors as Sidebrief offers its services.\n\nThe founder, however, says this doesn\u2019t affect the entire value offering chain. She adds that the team is currently working on product pricing and creating a synergy such that the fragmented nature of the African market does not adversely impact its offerings. Nevertheless, there are currently fixed prices per market.\n\nNot just \u2018a\u2019 competitive advantage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFounded in 2019, Sidebrief is the brainwork of two lawyers and an accountant who have played in the companies registration space and have occupied similar roles in various global companies.\n\nCurrently, the startup comprises 15 professionals manning its different rolling parts in different markets. The team\u2019s efforts are complemented by existing relationships with a network of regulators across all the African markets it operates in, which tells the story of its success so far.\n\nAlthough Sidebrief\u2019s coverage spans 54 African countries, it has capacity in 21 countries, including Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Senegal, Egypt, Morocco, Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania, South Africa, and Zambia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSidebrief team. Source: Supplied\n\nHow did the startup pull this off in less than three years?\n\nOlopade attests that this is in part hinged on the founders\u2019 solid professional backgrounds and interests.\n\n\u201cHaving worked on the World Bank Doing Business project, it exposed me to a lot about starting and doing business in Africa, the challenges and the prospects. Interacting and interviewing lawyers across several countries and understanding the diverse legal and regulatory compliance framework as part of the data collection process across several countries highlighted the need for digitalizing and automating processes,\u201d she speaks of her experience.\n\nAs easy as this looks, some countries have proven more difficult than others. In the World Bank Doing Business Report for 2019, Rwanda (38th) was the only African country among the top 50 countries; Morocco and Kenya came close, ranking 53rd and 56th, respectively. Meanwhile, Nigeria occupied the 131st position.\n\nFor Olopade, the situation hasn\u2019t improved in Nigeria, which has proven to be one of the toughest markets to deal in. Meanwhile, in East Africa, it has been quite challenging with respect to the hiring process and getting the right talent fit. In addition to that, technological adoption is a general problem with the African market because regulatory parastatals have only a few automated processes.\n\nWith no external funding, Olopade confirms that the startup has been profitable for a while, having served over 200 clients using their services either on a subscription basis or one-off.\n\nSidebrief plans to attract and serve more clients within the coming months such that it becomes a household name when it comes to cross-border expansion in Africa. Olopade mentions how the startup has enjoyed a first-mover advantage and referrals from startups like 54gene, OkHi, Spleet, and Shuttlers, among others.\n\nThere are also plans to build a robust technology that will automate virtually all processes on the platform to make it seamless for customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster.

This comes with a free debit card available at all NIPOST outlets.\n\nThe postal services provider also unveiled 27 new logistics vehicles for courier services in partnership with international cargo and freight company, Speedaf Express.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Isa Pantami, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, this would aid Nigeria\u2019s digital economy plans and foster financial inclusion.\n\nEssentially, think of NIPOST as acting as another OPay or Kudi with Point of Sales (PoS) outlets where you can send and receive money using NIPOST\u2019s debit card.\n\nBecause the card relies heavily on the user\u2019s biometric information \u2014 like fingerprints \u2014 it would work both online and offline.\n\nThe last few years have been interesting ones for NIPOST. From interesting policies to a possible overhaul, it seems there\u2019s still more to come.\n\nUntil then, you can catch up on some of these stories here.\n\nCrypto beyond trading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRuth Iselema at Build 2021\n\nFor most of us crypto-indifferents, the current bearish \u2014 thank you Google for coming to my rescue \u2014 market is two-faced. To some extent, it rationalises our decision not to use that last \u20a610,000 ($24) to buy some Bitcoin or Shiba Inu.\n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s also an opportunity to possibly cash in and get good returns whenever the market turns bullish. \u201cBuy the dip!!\u201d has been the chosen mantra since November 2021, when Bitcoin prices began to fall.\n\nBut as I\u2019ve heard so many times in the last year, there\u2019s more to crypto than trading. Notice I don\u2019t mention blockchain? There are alternative uses to cryptocurrency other than the most popular use case in Africa, which appears to be buying and selling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUse cases like lending, insurance \u2014 or decentralised finance (DeFi), as Bolu calls it in his article \u2014 speak of alternative and, dare I say, exciting applications of cryptocurrency.\n\nAt Techpoint Build 2021, our Reporter, Bolu Abiodun, talked to Ruth Iselema, Bitmama\u2019s CEO, about crypto, DeFi and everything else in between. You can find his article here: There\u2019s more to crypto than buying low and selling high\n\nIf you are more into audio-visuals, then you can follow this link to watch.\n\nMeanwhile, you can browse through pictures of the event here.\n\nCredit analysis with Periculum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow of hands if you\u2019ve ever tried to get a loan from the bank and gave up after seeing the stringent conditions and the many steps.\n\nI can\u2019t pinpoint the exact time I started hearing about loan apps like Renmoney, Carbon, FairMoney, but apps like this rose to give the average citizen quick access to loans.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing, that doesn\u2019t solve the underlying problem: creditworthiness data.\n\nWhen giving out loans, banks \u2014 and any other financial institution really \u2014 need information about the loan applicant. One of the most important is whether the applicant can repay the loan, also known as creditworthiness.\n\nAfter working at several Canadian banks and starting a few businesses, Michael Temitope Collins found some information that informed his decision to start Periculum.\n\n\u201cI started out working in the bank and discovered that we have many underserved customers, so I decided to do some research.\n\n\u201cI realised that even in Canada, there\u2019s a pretty significant number of people that are underserved by the financial system. When you scale that out to emerging markets like Africa, Latin America, and South-east Asia, that number of underserved individuals is a lot higher.\u201d\n\nArmed with this information, Periculum was born.\n\nCurious about what they do?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria-based healthtech, roHealth has rolled out a free health coverage plan for Small and Medium-scale Businesses in Nigeria.\n\nThis announcement coincides with its partnership with PayCentre and ConnectNigeria as CEO Olalekan Olude told Techpoint Africa at roHealth\u2019s official launch in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are a platform that gives employees greater decision-making control over their health insurance with cashback when it is not used. Employers use the platform by uploading their employees and setting a budget. Employees can then choose from over 100 Health Plans from top HMOs in Nigeria\u201d Olude told Techpoint at the event.\n\n\u201croHealth is on a mission to increase access to healthcare in Nigerians by providing free health insurance for a limited period. A lot of companies do not trust HMOs and believe that they do not provide value to their employees. We are here to give them the opportunity to get their employees to try it out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlalekan Olude, roHealth CEO\n\nPaycentre is one of the biggest Agent Banking Networks in the Country with over 80,000 Agents nationwide while Connect Nigeria is an online database with more than 300,000 companies offering information about businesses, real estate, technology, entertainment, and more.\n\nConnect Nigeria houses close to 300,000 companies and for us, it is a strategic synergy \u2013 between a healthcare platform and another platform that wants to preach the message of delivering healthcare to its customers.\n\nWith access to roHealth\u2019s APIs, its partners can achieve their goals of bringing Healthcare closer to their customers and staff. These partnerships would help roHealth reach millions of Nigerians faster.\n\n\u201cNigerians have different health needs and budgets, but what we\u2019ve realised from our partners is that partnering with one HMO excludes them from working with another. But working with roHealth as a partner creates that opportunity to be able to connect as many HMOs as possible by connecting to the roHealth APIs as a service\u201d.\n\nBusinesses with a minimum of 5 Staff can access this offering on the roHealth website \u2013 https://www.rohealth.ng/free-trial and benefits covering Laboratory, Accidents, Surgery, and other medical expenses.\n\nLaunching in Nigeria\n\nOlalekan believes that the future of healthcare Insurance would largely be a function of coverage funded by someone.\n\n\u201cIn most countries, Healthcare is usually paid for by the government, through taxes or by the employer in part or in full, but a lot of Nigerians are exposed to zero healthcare coverage and this is because the channels through which they consume services haven\u2019t thought about giving healthcare to them or covering them as their customers or workers.\u201d\n\nThe goal is to deliver the opportunity for all Nigerians to have healthcare coverage wherever they may be through an employer, the informal sector, or services \u2014 buying data, airtime, food, etc \u2014 that they use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis launch is a pilot for expansion across Africa where it can deploy its solution which allows employees to choose healthcare plans that fit them within a set budget by their employer.\n\nAt the event, Olude said there are plans to work with banks, retail shops, and businesses, among others, to enable customers to get healthcare coverage after spending a certain amount within a month.\n\n\u201cSay, for example, you buy stuff at Shoprite, based on some of the partnerships we are working on, once you buy products up to a certain amount, Shoprite automatically covers your healthcare for that month.\u201d\n\nA customer who meets the requirements is automatically covered for that month, without having to change their lifestyle or their spending pattern.\n\nSince its inception 6 months ago, over 500 businesses and 10000 lives actively use roHealth to make their health coverage decisions.

          "title": "How harsh visa requirements spur fraud in Nigeria",
          "text": "Getting Schengen, United Kingdom, United States, and certain other countries\u2019 visas can be a nightmare. A retired Nigerian diplomat tells BusinessDay that, \u201cwhile a Japanese businessman or citizen who has business or travel to do in the US or in EU countries would simply buy a ticket and fly to these countries, his Nigerian counterpart, on the other hand, faces humiliating and oppressive barriers in accessing a visa.\u201d\n\nA Nigerian would typically have to produce such array of daunting documents, including a letter of employment, current bank statement of the last six months, leave permission from an employer, income tax return form or certificate of income tax deducted at the source of salary, copy of company registration, company bank statement of the latest six months, as well as proof of accommodation, introduction letter, invitation letter from the host, host\u2019s work details, host\u2019s bank statements, and utility bills.\n\nWestern diplomats say that these immodest requirements are needed to ensure that only \u2018genuine visitors\u2019 are allowed into their countries. However, these ostentatious requirements have led to the creation and burgeoning of an ecosystem of corruption built around visa racketeering in Nigeria. This biome of fraud and sleaze permeates the judiciary, the banking sector, foreign diplomatic missions, and business centers across the country.\n\nWithin the court system, false affidavits aided by court officials are sworn to daily by those seeking to acquire visas. In addition, fake marriage certificates arranged by court officials are procured.\n\nIn Abuja, the Federal Capital, Commerce Plaza in Area 3, as well as UTC Shopping Complex in Area 10 with their unassuming maze of miscellaneous business centers have grown into major epicenters for the production and dissemination of fabricated documents presented to embassies by visa seekers.\n\nAlfa (not real name) is a clinical pharmacist in one of the General Hospitals in Abuja. He told BusinessDay that he has used non-genuine documents designed by specialists in Area 10 to get visas to France, Australia, and the UK in the past. He specialises in providing this false documentation to those who need them.\n\n\u201cIf you want Buhari\u2019s signature, we can get it for you here,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWe help those who need them by providing them with documents such as utility bills, income tax certificates, company registration certificates, and others\u201d.\n\nHe further tells me that he helps clients to source for other critical documents desired by foreign missions. \u201cWhat we cannot produce here, we get it from other people across the world. So, if an embassy needs a letter of invitation, I know people in the US, UK, and Europe from whom we can get letters of invitation. I know people abroad who would provide proof of accommodation, and I know people in Nigeria and overseas who I can get bank statements from, including bankers.\u201d\n\nBut the pervasive corruption goes beyond the network of dishonest document production. It goes right into the embassies themselves.\n\n\u201cI was going to one of the Caribbean countries last August,\u201d Bola tells me. She had applied for a UK transit visa, which had been rejected by the British High Commission. \u201cI was introduced to this gentleman, who I would ordinarily have dismissed as a boor had he not been introduced to me by a dear friend. He assured me I would get the visa and asked me to re-apply again. He requested N400,000, which I paid him and in less than two weeks, I got the visa.\n\nShe further says she recently paid N400,000 to get a visa interview date at the US Embassy. \u201cIf you go to the visa site of the US Embassy to get interview date, they will tell you that there is no date until 2023, but I can tell you that I paid to get a date for the first quarter of this year. My friend also paid to get an interview date.\u201d\n\nHow is this possible? It is possible because a thriving industry around visa fraud has over the years developed in the country, with Nigerian cartels working for hand in glove with local and foreign consular officers in foreign missions.\n\nWhile the application fee for a Schengen visa in Nigeria is \u20ac80 (N37,906), for British visas, the fee ranges from over N200,000 to over N400,000. Yet, Nigerians pay as much as N3 million to acquire them.\n\nAlex runs a travel agency in Abuja. He has been in the business since 2003. He arranges tickets and visas for clients. Alex explains to me the sophisticated means by which visas are acquired for desperate Nigerians keen on leaving the country.\n\nFrom his safe, he withdraws a Nigerian passport and shows me a recently stamped French visa. \u201cI just collected this,\u201d he says, adding, \u201cthe owner paid N1.7 million for this visa. It is a one-month visa.\u201d\n\nThe money, he says, was paid to him by his client. Alex used to be a lecturer in one of the Colleges of Education in the Southwest. He had since left the poor paying job. Getting visas for desperate Nigerians, he says, is more lucrative than teaching impressionable young minds. \u201cWhat my friends and I do is that we take on the task of procuring visas for our clients. A lot of people want to leave this country. They leave the entire process in our hands. From the completion of the forms to the sourcing of the supporting documents, we do it. The reason is that getting a visa in Nigeria is a war, and most people have already thrown up their hands in surrender even before the process starts.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that the process of getting a visa can be exhausting. I have people in the UK, some EU, Turkish, and South African visa sections,\u201d he tells me. \u201cFor the US, UK and EU, they are not the foreign consular officials,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey are Nigerians working there.\u201d\n\nHe goes on to inform me that foreign consular officers who make the final decisions at the various EU embassies and consulates, as well as the UK mission, rarely do get to see applicants\u2019 requests for visas. \u201cThe truth is this and you can quote me because I know. No consular officer sights any Nigerian document. No consular officer in these embassies gets to see your account statement, your tax certificate, or anything at all. It is the pre-submission team that does all that.\n\n\u201cAt the British mission, for example, TLS collects all applications and sends them to the consular section. The consular officers do not see these loads of applications. It goes to the pre-submission team there. The pre-submission team works individually with a checklist, and using that checklist, they go through the many applications, determine which application meets the checklist requirements and which doesn\u2019t. They then write a summary of what they think of each application.\n\n\u201cOne they write that \u2018I am not satisfied with this applicant\u2019s claims\u2019, it is what the consular officer, who is the visa issuer will adopt. You will not get a visa. In the past, they would have just stamped the visa with a rejection notice. But because many Nigerian passports had been defaced with such rejection stamps, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had to step in and stop it. Once the pre-submission team recommends your application for approval, all the consular officer does is to release his sticker and place that visa on your passport\u201d.\n\nIt is here that corruption works, Alex tells me. He goes on to explain that, \u201call members of the pre-submission team that I know of are all Nigerians. We work with them across various embassies. They tell us how many applications to bring. Don\u2019t forget that consulates have a maximum number of visas to issue each month and the pre-submission team knows this. So, they work with some of us to ensure that our candidates get visas. My client pays N2 million and I pay my contacts in the pre-submission team between one million and one and half million naira. Whether it is Area 10 papers or Area 3 papers or Zone 5 papers that we bring, our visas will be approved\u201d.\n\nRead also: 100 more countries in your pocket \u2013 Visa-Free or Visa-on-Arrival\n\nBut, it is not just the pre-submission team that Alex works with. He says that he works with senior government officials to place the names of his clients on institutional requests for visas. \u201cIt is a lot easier and cheaper than working with the pre-submission team,\u201d he acknowledges. \u201cSo, what we do is we work with contacts in the Ministries and Agencies, they are mostly Directors and we pay them hundreds of thousands of naira; as much as half a million to eight hundred thousand per candidate. Our clients\u2019 names are placed on the endorsed list of Ministry officials travelling for official duties or for training. The list is sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which then sends a \u2018note verbale\u2019 to the respective diplomatic missions requesting for the issuance of visas for the people on the list\u201d.\n\nBusinessDay sent emails to both the United States Public Affairs section as well as the British High Commission for response to these allegations, as at the time of going to press, no response had been received.\n\nForeign governments, especially western nations, tend to rail now and again against corruption in Nigeria. In May 2016, former UK Prime Minister, David Cameron in an embarrassing diplomatic gaffe caught on the camera called Nigeria a \u2018fantastically corrupt country\u2019.\n\nA 2019 Konrad Adeneur Stiftung report aptly noted that corruption \u201cpermeates every level of society, from high-level politicians and civil servants to the security forces, businesspeople and the country\u2019s poorest citizens. So, it is hardly surprising that Nigeria has languished in the lower quarter of Transparency International\u2019s \u2018Corruption Perceptions Index\u2019 for many years. In 2018, the country was ranked 144 out of 180, alongside countries such as Comoros, Kenya, and Mauritania.\u201d\n\nIn the 2020 index, Nigeria slipped five places, ranking 149th place. The country dropped another five places in the 2021 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) index, scoring 24 out of 100 points and ranked 154 out of 180 countries.\n\nThe scope and complexity of corruption in Nigeria is immense. It is complex, multifaceted, and multi-directional. This polyvalence encompasses the process of getting a visa in the country.\n\nWhile corruption is expansive in Nigeria, it must be admitted by all stakeholders that the contributing factors are also many and diverse.\n\nThe profiling of all Nigerians and criminalisation of genuine travellers by foreign diplomatic missions have been a driver of the visa growth of criminal cartels, and the resort by Nigerians who seek to honestly do business to travel to Europe and the United States.",

The list is sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which then sends a \u2018note verbale\u2019 to the respective diplomatic missions requesting for the issuance of visas for the people on the list\u201d.\n\nBusinessDay sent emails to both the United States Public Affairs section as well as the British High Commission for response to these allegations, as at the time of going to press, no response had been received.\n\nForeign governments, especially western nations, tend to rail now and again against corruption in Nigeria. In May 2016, former UK Prime Minister, David Cameron in an embarrassing diplomatic gaffe caught on the camera called Nigeria a \u2018fantastically corrupt country\u2019.\n\nA 2019 Konrad Adeneur Stiftung report aptly noted that corruption \u201cpermeates every level of society, from high-level politicians and civil servants to the security forces, businesspeople and the country\u2019s poorest citizens. So, it is hardly surprising that Nigeria has languished in the lower quarter of Transparency International\u2019s \u2018Corruption Perceptions Index\u2019 for many years. In 2018, the country was ranked 144 out of 180, alongside countries such as Comoros, Kenya, and Mauritania.\u201d\n\nIn the 2020 index, Nigeria slipped five places, ranking 149th place. The country dropped another five places in the 2021 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) index, scoring 24 out of 100 points and ranked 154 out of 180 countries.\n\nThe scope and complexity of corruption in Nigeria is immense. It is complex, multifaceted, and multi-directional. This polyvalence encompasses the process of getting a visa in the country.\n\nWhile corruption is expansive in Nigeria, it must be admitted by all stakeholders that the contributing factors are also many and diverse.\n\nThe profiling of all Nigerians and criminalisation of genuine travellers by foreign diplomatic missions have been a driver of the visa growth of criminal cartels, and the resort by Nigerians who seek to honestly do business to travel to Europe and the United States.",

          "title": "The political economy of migration in Nigeria",
          "text": "People have an innate desire to be mobile. The recently released 2022 Henley Global Mobility Report noted that given the international misalignment between resources and populations, people \u201cneed to be able to move to survive and pursue educational, employment, and business opportunities.\u201d\n\nIncreased inward and cross-border migration, the report further noted, \u201cis a necessity, both to address the growing mobility divide and to help revive the global economy by boosting productivity and restoring business dynamism.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, a combination of rising unemployment, booming demographics, and unfulfilled aspirations is increasing the pressure on young Nigerians to migrate internationally in search of gainful employment.\n\nMany Nigerian households are dependent on remittances from household members who have migrated abroad. The country continues to dominate remittance inflows into sub-Saharan Africa given the exceptional size of the Nigerian migrant base (an estimated 800,000 persons) concentrated in two key host countries, the United States (375,000) and the United Kingdom (220,000).\n\nThough changes in legislation in the US and the EU have tightened requirements for immigration, the movement of African nationals to key host countries has continued at a quick pace, says the World Bank. Between 2010 and 2018, the African-born population in the US surged by 52 percent to more than 2 million, versus 12 percent growth for the total foreign-born population. Immigrants to the US have included refugees from conflict-ridden countries, and highly skilled workers and students from Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa. Asylum applicants have driven the flow of migrants to Europe, amounting to 1 million between 2010 and 2018.\n\nAgusto Consulting in its 2021 Nigeria Diaspora Remittance Report found that Nigeria gets over $21 billion annually in inflows from diaspora remittances, making it the second-largest recipient of remittances on the continent, only after Egypt. The remittances from the Nigerian diaspora, it suggested, have become a major mainstay of the country\u2019s economy. The report further found that, at the macro level, diaspora remittances represent the second-largest source of foreign exchange inflow into the country, second only to crude oil earnings.\n\nThe World Bank in November 2021, noted, \u201cAfter contracting by 14.1 percent in 2020, remittance flows to sub-Saharan Africa are expected to recover in 2021\u2014registering a growth of 6.2 percent to reach $45 billion. Nigeria, the largest recipient in the region, is experiencing a moderate rebound in remittance flows, in part due to the increasing traction of novel policies intended to channel inflows through the banking system.\u201d\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest economy\u2019s working-age population data were reported at 122,049,400.000 persons in December 2020, an increase from the previous number of 116,871,186.000 persons for June 2020, at the same time, unemployment is surging towards 40 percent.\n\nThe country is seeing rapid growth in its working-age populations. Yet often, noted the World Bank in a 2021 report, \u201cthese increasingly educated and skilled young people cannot find meaningful work within their countries of origin, either because their skills are not well aligned to the needs of employers or because there is an absolute lack of roles available. This is creating emigration pressure, with many seeking opportunities elsewhere, leading to fears of \u201cbrain drain\u201d within countries of origin.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, high-income countries such as those in Europe are seeing rapid decreases in their working-age populations. Employers within these countries are facing significant skill shortages, which is reducing productivity and investment.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s youth are increasingly looking to other economies for work. A Gallup poll conducted before the 2019 presidential elections showed that roughly half of all Nigerians said it was a \u201cbad time\u201d to find a job in the economy.\n\nThe proportion of youth planning to leave Nigeria permanently increased from 36 percent in 2014 to 52 percent in 2018, one of the highest levels in sub-Saharan Africa. The desire to migrate is highest among unemployed yet educated urban youth.\n\nThis desire is translating into increased emigration rates from Nigeria. In absolute numbers, the number of international migrants from Nigeria has increased from around 450,000 in 1990 to 1.4 million in 2019.\n\nRead also: Hospitals struggle to retain staff amid migration tsunami\n\nMigration from Nigeria will continue and is likely to increase. Michael Clemens in 2020, demonstrated the existence of a \u201cmigration hump\u201d, whereby low-income countries exhibit increasingly high emigration pressure up to a turning point (approximately $10,000 GDP per capita). Given Nigeria\u2019s current economic growth, it is likely, the world bank report asserts, that emigration pressure will continue from the country for decades to come.\n\nHenley & partners note, \u201cDespite the apparent increase in global mobility, the gap between those at the top of the Henley Passport Index and those at the bottom is at its widest in the index\u2019s 17-year history.\u201d\n\nPassport holders from top-ranking Japan and Singapore are able to travel visa-free to 166 more destinations than Nigerian nationals, who sit at 98th place on the index with access to just 45 countries, mainly in Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the Caribbean without requiring a visa in advance. This growing gap in mobility inequality, between the global haves and the have nots, has been aggravated by the covid pandemic.\n\nKwame Anthony Appiah, professor of philosophy and law at New York University, noted in a recent essay that, \u201cdisparities between the global north and south are likely to be a feature of crises to come. The tale of two pandemics\u2026is a tale of two international orders. The post-pandemic challenge, in turn, is to take seriously the rhetoric of an \u2018international community\u2019, and integrate the two into one.\u201d\n\nThe number of people in extreme poverty around the world, he further noted, has risen for the first time since 1997. \u201cThe story of rising global interdependence is also one of rising equality among the nations.\u201d\n\nAs long as there is global inequality and a local economy that excludes millions of Nigerians, Nigerians will continue to leave the country.",

Since inception. The programme has been hailed as a workable, effective and sustainable template for basic education service delivery reform.\n\nFollowing the success of the programme in the state many States in Nigeria, including Lagos, have launched similar reform programmes mirroring EdoBEST while other countries have also visited the state to under study the programme.\n\nIn November 2021, the Executive Chairmen of all 37 State SUBEBs and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and the management of the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) met in Benin City and an understudy of the EdoBEST programme resulted in glowing endorsements and unanimous calls for a nation-wide implementation of similar technology-backed education reforms.\n\nThe exit of former SUBEB Chairman Joan Osa-Oviawe and the entrance of a new Executive Chairman Edo SUBEB Mrs. Ozavize Salami has not stop more developmental gains of the programme as more grounds have been covered for the advancement of EdoBEST to the benefits of every Edo child.\n\nHolding up to the vision of Mr. Governor Mrs Salami created more platform for more teachers to undergo professional development as EdoBEST penetrates hard-to-reach areas in Edo State.\n\nThe SUBEB Chairman believed that the professional development for teachers in Edo State is necessary to boost the capacity of Edo State\u2019s teaching corps and further spread the gains of EdoBEST.\n\nDetermined to tread the path of developing, the EdoSUBEB has commenced the training of over 2,000 primary and secondary school teachers to further drive the gains of EdoBEST to the grassroots.\n\nAdditionally, 109 newly employed Learning and Development Officers and 26 Quality Assurance Officers are also being trained to strengthen the school supervisory system.\n\nThe professional development training, which is ongoing in Benin City the Edo State Capital is designed to provide qualified teachers and field officers for more communities in rural and hard-to-reach areas in Edo State.\n\nSalami said \u201cThis training will enable more of our esteemed pupils and students get the full benefits of EdoBEST as it brings junior secondary schools and more primary schools under the EdoBEST reform umbrella.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nLAGOS \u2013 In it\u2019s contribution to the Federal Government coffers in 2021, the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) revealed that it paid N37.69 billion to the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF) last year.\n\nThe NIMASA Director-General Bashir Jamoh who disclosed this during a media chat in Lagos at weekend noted that the N37.69 contribution was higher than N31.83 billion contributed by the agency in 2020.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn 2020, the agency contributed to the consolidated revenue account by paying N31,839,917,978.20k. We went ahead to increase the amount we paid in 2021 with a total amount of N37,691,630, 450.22k.\u201d\n\nJamoh said NIMASA was striving to strengthen its security mechanism, while enhancing revenue collection process to the Federal Government.\n\nThe NIMASA DG also revealed that the N50bn floating dock being built would be operational before the end of the first quarter of 2022, noting that the facility would, however, be subjected to a privatisation process to help lessen the cost burden.\n\n\u201cWe expect before the end of the first quarter the floating dock to be operational. Our floating dock is owned by NIMASA and we handed it over to a public-private partnership. The issue of privatisation is not a product but a process\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cThe DG of the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) was here to give us the first certificate, telling us that privatising the modular floating dock is profitable. We have gone ahead to do negotiations with the Managing Partner, the Nigerian Ports Authority. We expect that by the middle of February, we would get the final no-objection certificate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NIMASA DG stressed that the privatisation of the floating dock must be approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC) because it was a national asset. He added that the agency suffered a lot of challenges when work began on it, but the cost could not be borne by the Federal Government alone.\n\n\u201cWhen it is privatised, the managing partners can decide and move it to the proper position it should be. Operationality of the floating dock would be taken over by foreigners to service it before the approval of the FEC. By the time we receive approval and the floating dock is in use, we will move it to where it belongs,\u201d he added.\n\nA floating dry dock is one of the five types of dry docks used for ship repairs. It is a submersible platform that is specifically designed and used to repair vessels.\n\nThe multi-million dollar modular floating dock acquired by NIMASA since June 11, 2018, has been lying idle in Lagos, with the cost of maintenance estimated at about $30,000 daily.\n\nThe floating dock, which was conceptualised and acquired by the Dakuku Peterside-led administration, was expected to serve as a maintenance base for visiting vessels and those domiciled in the country, with the intention to save about $100 million yearly in capital flight, generate employment and boost local capacity.\n\nSpeaking on the involvement of the European Union in the safeguarding of the Gulf of Guinea, Jamoh said the agency had to make the collaboration since Nigeria\u2019s integrity was at stake.\n\nHe stressed, \u201cWhatever happens in the Gulf of Guinea affects Nigeria. Our integrity is strained and nobody respects us. Sometimes, they see us as part of the criminals. We took it upon ourselves to have a meeting called the Joint Industry Working Group. It was from this we got the shared Gulf of Guinea where international communities contributed to lessening insecurity in the Gulf of Guinea\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe cannot sit down and watch Nigerians being accused anyhow. That\u2019s how the European Union came to the Gulf of Guinea. They consist of Denmark, France, Italy, Britain, United States (US) and even the Danish. The Gulf of Guinea is large and we allowed them in. In a bid to address this issue, we experienced the issue with the Danish Frigate. That\u2019s why the issue was there,\u201d he explained.\n\nWhile noting that there were lots of errors on the rules of engagement of the foreign navies in the Gulf of Guinea, he disclosed that the frigate, which was deployed off West Africa in October, intervened in an alleged attack on a commercial vessel in November, killing four pirates and taking four other suspects on board the frigate, according to Reuters. Three of them suspected to be Nigerians were freed by the authorities in the country.\n\nThe fourth, who was injured and had his leg amputated, appeared in court in Copenhagen, where he was charged with the attempted manslaughter of Danish soldiers. He could not be released due to his condition, though he pleaded not guilty to the manslaughter charge.\n\nHe disclosed that wreck removal had reached an advanced stage from Badagry to Tin Can Island.\n\n...",

          "title": "Bugbear Of Coups And Future Of Democracy In Africa",
          "text": "Africa is on the spotlight once again with the resurgence of military takeovers of democratic governments sweeping across the continent with the concomitant negative implications for the beleaguered continent and its hapless citizens.\n\nFrom 2019, it is either one successful coup or coup attempt across the continent as the soldiers seem to have abandoned their professional call to usurp power. Regional organisations such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African Union (AU) appear to be bewildered and lacking coordinated measures to forestall the scourge of coups.\n\nThe latest in the gale of coups was Burkina Faso, the land of the famed Thomas Sankara. Last Monday, January 24, 2022, 41-year-old Paul- Henry Damiba rallied his troops to topple the democratic government of Marc Christian Kabore and took charge of the country.\n\nThere was a deluge of reasons offered by the soldiers who removed Kabore ranging from his alleged incompetence in handling the menace of armed groups killing the citizens of Burkina Faso, to poor economic atmosphere leading to massive suffering.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nECOWAS has suspended Burkina Faso from its institutions but the coup leaders are not bordered about that.\n\nDespite the spirited condemnation and sanctions by international community, the soldiers have refused to budge and in some cases initiated a transition programme that is headed nowhere.\n\nThis ugly trend became very pronounced last year 2021across Africa. On September 5, Colonel Mamady Doumbouya led a group of soldiers to overthrow the democratic government of President Alpha Conde in Guinea. The deposed Conde may have provided the leeway for the junta when he manipulated his country\u2019s constitution to force himself on his people for tenure elongation after he had served out his constitutionally required two terms of office. However, democracy pundits believe that on no situation should the military take power because of the massive disruptions in the development process that it engenders.\n\nDoumbouya had accused the 83-year-old Conde of high-handedness and incompetence in the face of glaring economic hardship facing ordinary citizens. ECOWAS and other regional organisations have since imposed suspension on Guinea but the coup leaders have remained unperturbed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn Sudan following the uneasy power sharing arrangement between a civilian government and the military, army General Abdel Fattah al-Burnhan, on 25 October 2021, removed the civilian government, citing political infighting.\n\nThe coup leaders dissolved civilian rule, arrested political leaders including the Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and declared a state of emergency. Waves of protests have since hit the country with pro-democracy groups, despite massive crackdown by soldiers, vehemently demanding a democratic transition process that is devoid of the trappings of the army.\n\nRecall that this is the second coup in Sudan after the military shoved aside the government of long-serving dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019 following huge protests.\n\nHowever, the coup leaders buckled under intense pressure and reinstated Mr. Hamdok in order to appease pro -democracy groups who have refused to allow the army to have its way. Hamdok has since resigned leaving the situation tense.\n\nIn May 2021, Colonel Assimi Goita carried out a second coup in nine months in Mali. He overthrew the transition President Bah Ndaw and Prime Minister Moctar Ouane accusing them of sidelining the army in a cabinet appointment.\n\nIncidentally Goita had in August 2020, removed the democratically elected government of Ibrahim Boubacar Keita after mass protests against Keita\u2019s government. Despite condemnation by the international community, Goita has remained unyielding. He has elicited severe sanctions on his country by the ECOWAS which banned flights and taken other stringent measures to force him to stick to the initial election timetable scheduled for February, which he has jettisoned and demanding for five more years in power.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn Chad, long-serving despot, President Idris Deby, was killed on Tuesday April 20 2021, in a battle with a rebel group -the Front for Change and Concord in Chad (FACT). But instead of his death to usher in a new democratic dispensation, soldiers loyal to the Deby dynasty quickly imposed his 37-year-old son, Mahamat, as successor in blatant violation of the country\u2019s constitution.\n\nChad\u2019s constitution stipulates that the head of the country\u2019s parliament should assume power in the event of the death of the President within a time frame in which elections are to hold.\n\nAlthough Chadian military leaders have initiated an 18- month transition period to conduct elections, the transitional process is headed to a certain outcome- which is to entrench Idris Deby dynasty that started in 1990, now represented by his son.\n\nApart from the aforementioned countries, there was an attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Ethiopia in 2019. Also between 2020 and 2021 Central African Republic had its fair share of coup attempts and there seem to be no end in sight to this bugbear.\n\nExperts feared that the succession of coups can only lead to destabilization of the continent and worsening the already bad situation because the military do not always have what it takes to direct things towards positive change.\n\nThe implication is that military coups and coup attempts are becoming a regular occurrence in Africa in the decades since independence and this poses a great danger to democratic development.\n\nInternational constitutional law expert, Livingstone Wechie told LEADERSHIP Sunday that the root causes of Coups in Africa in recent years are largely hinged on greed and \u201cpower absolutism.\u201d\n\nHe said the implication is that a programme aimed at sustaining instability in Africa has been mapped out because of the besetting impacts coups have on the state.\n\nHe added that coups lead to \u201cthe reversal of government programmes that are already in place, beacsue a new system that totally negates development is put in place by decrees. It turns the state several years backwards and the ripple effect is that when more states are subjected to this type of situation it eventually spirals across Africa which end we never get to see.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, none of the reasons for the coups are based on a genuine concern for good governance and democracy. The bait of corruption and malgovernance remains a smokescreen used to mislead the people so the coup leaders can continue to perpetrate themselves in power for ulterior motives.\n\n\u201cThe absence of genuine patriotism is a clear indication of high appetite for unbridled power,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking on the issue, public affairs analyst, Austin Onuoha, said the coups have become constant because democracy has failed to deliver its dividends to the people of Africa and so coup leaders are trying other models of government.\n\nHe said \u201cIf democracy has delivered may be we won\u2019t be where we are today. I think is a vote of no confidence on democracy. There is nothing wrong with democracy but the way we have practiced it. Democracy addresses three challenges; one is leadership challenge, which deals with who we recruit as leaders and how we remove them if they failed.\n\n\u201cThe second challenge that democracy addresses is the issue of development, clearly mapping out what our development priorities are because in every nation there are so many things to be done. And the final challenge that democracy should address is governance. So, if democracy cannot address the challenge of leadership, development and governance, then there is likely to be coup.\u201d",

The terrorists had given a four-day notice before they attacked,\u201d he said.\n\nNews of the attack spread on social media Saturday night.\n\nA youth leader, Jubrin Allawa, said the terrorists had a field day because there was no security presence.\n\nA group, the Concerned Shiroro Youths of Niger State, slammed the alleged withdrawal of security from the community.\n\nIn a statement by the co-conveners Sani Abubakar Kokki and Bello Ibrahim, the group said they found the bodies of 12 people.\n\n\u201cThe decision taken by the government to withdraw the security personnel is reckless and insensitive.\n\n\u201cConsidering how porous, prone to insecurity and vulnerable to deadly attacks by the rampaging terrorists Galadima Kogo is, one can easily conclude that the withdrawal of security personnel at that material time was a deliberate attempt to further jeopardise people\u2019s lives and put them in the line,\u201d the group said.\n\nOur correspondent learnt that the bodies of 18 victims were brought to the Minna General Hospital late on Saturday night.\n\nMany of the injured are receiving treatment at the hospital and the IBB Specialist Hospital in Minna.\n\nCommissioner for Local Government, Chieftaincy Affairs and Internal Security, Mr Emmanuel Umar, said only eight bodies were recovered.\n\nHe denied that the government withdrew soldiers from the community.\n\nHe said the operatives were on the routine operation and were moving from one community to the other.\n\nIn Kaduna, no fewer than 11 people were confirmed dead and several others were left with bullet wounds as gunmen attacked Kurmin Masara and Zaman Dabo villages in Zangon Kataf Local Government Area.\n\nThe villages came under attack early yesterday, with almost 40 houses ablaze.\n\nA resident, who did not want to be named, said he hid as the attackers stormed his village at about 3 am, moving from house to house.\n\n\u201cWe are yet to ascertain the actual number of those killed and injured by the attackers until we go round the community, but so far, I can confirm 16 dead. A boy of about five to six years was shot during the attack, he said.\n\nCommissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said in a statement that 11 residents were confirmed dead.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cSecurity forces have reported to the Kaduna State Government that Kurmin Masara general area of Zangon Kataf LGA was attacked in the early hours of today (yesterday).\n\n\u201cAccording to the reports, troops of the Nigerian Air Force Special Forces who responded to distress calls from the area also fell into an ambush as they mobilised to the scene of the attack.\n\n\u201cThe troops cleared the ambush and reached the general area, along with troops of Operation Safe Haven (OPSH).\n\n\u201cAs of 4:30 pm, 11 residents were confirmed killed, and some inflicted with gunshot injuries.\n\n\u201cThe victims confirmed killed are listed as follows: Elizabeth Ayuba, Veronica Auta, Bege Daniel, Kephas Waje, Promise Jacob, Damaris Istifanus, Hauwa Joshua, Dogara Gambo, Lidia Ishaya, Michael Achi and Gabriel Michael.\n\n\u201cOver 30 houses and properties were burnt in the attack.

Francis Angwa Sani confirmed the attacks, but declined comment on the number of casualties and houses burnt, saying he was yet to receive the report.\n\n\u201cYes, there was attack, but I don\u2019t have complete details. I learnt people were killed and houses burnt but I\u2019ve not gotten the report yet,\u201d Sani said.\n\nHowever, a source, who preferred anonymity, said a young boy between five and 10 years and two women, were among the 13 people killed, adding that the gunmen came around 3:00am and started shooting sporadically killing anybody at sight.\n\n\u201cI was at home sleeping when I heard gunshots at 2:58am. I found somewhere to hide for safety. I learnt that the soldiers in charge of Zonkwa were called immediately but they didn\u2019t come.\n\n\u201cAround 3:45am, the commandant was called again that the situation is worse, then, he switched off his phone.\n\n\u201cThe attacks happened in Kurmin Masara and Zaman Dabo, this morning we went to the place and discovered 13 corpses.\n\n\u201cThere was a young boy of between five and 10 years who was shot in the leg and later died, two women were also killed in the attack. They burnt down almost 40 houses in the two villages.\n\n\u201cWhen the soldiers came early this morning, they said they were pinned down by some gunmen, that the gunmen blocked the road,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen contacted, Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of the Kaduna state command, ASP Muhammad Jalige said he would confirm and get back to journalists.\n\nBut he couldn\u2019t get back as at the time of this report.\n\nThe source further said apart from the houses burnt, the villagers\u2019 foodstuffs and other valuables belonging to residents of the communities, were also destroyed.\n\nBut in a statement, the state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr Samuel Aruwan said: \u201cSecurity forces have reported to the Kaduna state government that Kurmin Masara general area of Zangon Kataf LGA was attacked in the early hours of today.\n\n\u201cAccording to the reports, troops of the Nigerian Air Force Special Forces who responded to distress calls from the area also fell into an ambush as they mobilized to the scene of the attack. The troops cleared the ambush and reached the general area, along with troops of Operation Safe Haven (OPSH).\n\n\u201cAs of 4:30pm, eleven residents were confirmed killed, and some inflicted with gunshot injuries.\n\n\u201cThe victims confirmed killed are listed as follows: Elizabeth Ayuba, Veronica Auta, Bege Daniel, Kephas Waje, Promise Jacob, Damaris Istifanus, Hauwa Joshua, Dogara Gambo, Lidia Ishaya, Michael Achi, Gabriel Michael.\n\n\u201cOver thirty houses and properties were burnt in the attack. The injured were evacuated for treatment. Search-and-rescue operations and pursuit of the attackers are in progress on different fronts.\n\n\u201cThe government of Kaduna state will make public further details as soon as they are received from security forces.\n\n\u201cGovernor Nasir el-Rufa\u2019i, who has been in touch with the security forces and is receiving hourly briefings, expressed sadness at this report of the latest in a series of attacks in the area. He prayed for the repose of all those killed and conveyed his condolences to their families. He further wished the injured a speedy recovery.\u201d\n\n12 killed in Niger\n\nIn a related development, bandits carried out fresh attack on Galadima community of Shiroro local government of Niger state killing no fewer than 12 people.\n\nIn the incident that occurred weekend, sources said many other people were injured in the attack with several others still missing.\n\nCoordinator of Concerned Shiroro Youths Sani Abubakar Yusuf Kokki confirmed the attack Sunday in Minna, adding that it took place in broad day.\n\nHe said: \u201cPreliminary findings indicate that, about twelve (12) people were gruesomely massacred, many more injured through multiple gunshots and yet to be ascertained numbers of people are still missing.\u201d\n\nKokki said the bandits took advantage of the withdrawal of military personnel from the community to launch the attack.\n\nHe said, \u201cHitherto yesterday\u2019s broad daylight attack, Galadima Kogo was relatively peaceful and secured due to the presence of security personnel stationed in the town. Yesterday\u2019s tragedy that recorded wanton killings among other casualties could have been avoided if those security personnel had not been withdrawn previously.\u201d\n\nIn view of the calamity at hand, the youth called with the loudest voice on the authorities concerned to restore the withdrawn security personnel to Galadima Kogo area of the state.\n\nThey also called for the deployment of additional security personnel to other areas prone to insecurity with immediate effect.\n\nEfforts to get reaction from the Police was not successful as the PPRO, DSP Wasiu Abiodun could not be contacted.",

          "text": "Nigeria professionals living in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have commenced a narrative campaign online to appeal the work permit restriction by the country.\n\nPresident of the group, Professional Nigerians in UAE, Kayode Ogungbohun is leading the campaign.\n\nHe spoke on Monday during an interview on Channels Television programme, Sunrise Daily that the campaign started after the problem was identified and it is aimed at projecting Nigerians living in UAE, positively.\n\n\ufeff\n\n\u201cWe saw the problem, although we don\u2019t have any official reason why UAE took the decision. We speculated that some things were done by Nigerians in terms of not obeying the law of the host country. So, we came up with the solution to speak to ourselves to be law-abiding, to appeal and pacify to the UAE government to allow all categories of jobs to be given to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cBecause these jobs that they are not giving to Nigerians is being given to people of other nationalities.\n\n\u201cThe #iamNigerian campaign is aimed to project us positively. Nigerians are now aware that there is a problem in our hands. We have left the stage of denial and realised that there is a problem, and it is everyone\u2019s responsibility to play a role,\u201d Ogungbohun explained.\n\nHe added that the campaign which commenced 14 days ago is helping to project Nigerians and how Nigerian professionals contribute to UAE\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t fold our hands and do nothing,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a resident of Fujerah in UAE, Esther Adedokun insists that the problem is not necessarily due to atrocities committed by Nigerians resident in UAE but a diplomatic row between both countries.\n\nRELATED: \u2018We Are Starving Here,\u2019 Nigerians In UAE Lament Work Permit Restrictions\n\nShe also explained how the permit restriction has left her stranded.\n\n\u201cMy situation is so critical that I have spent all my savings.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want us to have the impression that because of the atrocities committed by some Nigerians, that is why we have this problem. Nigerians are not the only citizens in UAE that commit worse crimes and they are there are no restrictions on their work permits.\n\n\u201cI am against crime and criminality but the diplomatic issue if resolved will ease the problem of this restriction,\u201d she said in the interview.\n\nOver seven months, hundreds of Nigerians in UAE became jobless and homeless following a change in diplomatic policy which led to the restriction of work permits.\n\nThe policy has left many Nigerians in pathetic conditions and most of the victims have lost their jobs.\n\n\ufeff\n\nThis has led to frustration with many rendered homeless. A work visa is the most common route to getting residency in the Middle East country, so all those caught in the web of the lingering work permit restrictions row have also lost their residency status.",

A booster shot to work with the HIV vaccine was also being studied.\n\n\u201cFor four decades, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has managed to dodge the immune system\u2019s attempts to destroy it.\n\n\u201cScientists have not been able to develop a vaccine, though they have made advancements in treatments, such as long-acting injectables for pre- and post-exposure prevention and treatment. HIV can lead to AIDS, which can be fatal,\u201d it added.\n\nThe release stated that 56 healthy HIV-negative adults took part in the clinical trial, with 48 getting one or two doses of the mRNA vaccine and 32 also getting the booster.\n\nEight people would just get the booster. All of them would be monitored for up to six months after receiving a final dose, it stated.\n\n\u201cThe immunogens \u2013 antigens that elicit an immune response \u2013 that are being tested were developed by the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) and Scripps Research. They will be delivered using the same messenger RNA (mRNA) technology in Moderna\u2019s successful COVID-19 vaccine,\u201d it explained.\n\nAbout 1.2 million people in the United States had HIV at the end of 2019, according to the CDC, with more than 36,000 people being diagnosed in 2019.\n\nThe World Health Organisation says 37.7 million people in the world had HIV in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe are tremendously excited to be advancing this new direction in HIV vaccine design with Moderna\u2019s mRNA platform,\u201d MD, president and CEO of IAVI, Mark Feinberg, was quoted to have said.\n\n\u201cThe search for an HIV vaccine has been long and challenging, and having new tools in terms of immunogens and platforms could be the key to making rapid progress toward an urgently needed, effective HIV vaccine.\u201d",

He said the villagers were woken up by the sound of gunshots and started running helter-skelter, adding that those killed were burnt in their houses.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe bandits came around 3am when the people were asleep.

Majority of Nigerians including his die-hard supporters in 2015 and 2019 do,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIn the light of the foregoing, it is clear that Governor Ortom, rather than President Buhari, is the true leaders. As Shehu has rightly put it, Nigerians has had enough of failed politicians and would be too glad to see one of them (President Buhari) leave office next year,\u201d the Commissioner said.\n\nAccording to the Information Commissioner, Shehu had in the said write up classified Nigerian politicians under two categories: \u201cThe first are politicians who are leaders that offer solutions to the challenges facing voters and the country. The second politicians who offer excuses for the challenges voters face.\n\n\u201cIn Shehu\u2019s perverted sense of judgement and in a bid to earn his pay, he placed President Muhammadu Buhari in the first category and Governor Samuel Ortom in the other,\u201d Inalegwu said.\n\nWhile describing the categorisation as an absurdity, the Information Commissioner said most Nigerians knew too well that the reverse was the correct position as, according to him, \u201cNigerians can hardly wait to see the back of the President leaving Aso Rock Villa next year because of his inept, directionless and failed leadership.\u201d\n\nHe said contrary to what the president\u2019s aide wanted the world to believe, the Ortom\u2019s ranching law has proven to be effective in checking the murderous assault of herdsmen on Benue communities.\n\nInalegwu said it was not surprising that the law has been recommended by the National Council of States, recommended by Southern Governors and is being adopted by many states of the federation including the President\u2019s home state of Katsina.\n\nWhile also shedding more light on the issue of salary owed Benue civil servants, the Information Commissioner who noted that in northern Nigeria, Benue pays the highest salary to its workers, added that Ortom has cleared all salary arrears being referred to by Shehu in the said write-up and is now up to date.\n\nGeorge Okoh In Makurdi",

          "text": "There appears to be no end in sight to the financial and resource haemorrhage in Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry, with the country once more losing as much as 6.596 million barrels of oil in its December 2021 production.\n\nAt an average of $75 per barrel that crude oil sold last month and an official exchange rate of N415/$1, Nigeria failed to take advantage of high international oil prices for the month, losing a whopping $487.5 million (about N202.3 billion).\n\nLatest figures from the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) indicated that the losses were due to a combination of factors, including force majeure declared by a Joint Venture (JV) partner. Other reasons listed by the national oil company included community issues, maintenance work, sabotage, and technical matters, like leakages, pressure build-up, and faulty valves.\n\nBut in the month that the company experienced the N202 billion loss, it remitted a meagre N20 billion of its projected N209 billion to the Federation Account. The amount was, however, about 100 per cent higher than the N10.5 billion it contributed in November 2021.\n\nNNPC\u2019s presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) indicated that Bonny took the greatest hit, losing 2.712 million barrels in the month due to the force majeure declared on the Nembe Creek Trunk Line (NCTL).\n\nThe Urha terminal followed with 1.468 million barrels loss, which curtailed production within the period and hobbled exports. The loss from that particular terminal exceeded the country\u2019s production for the entire month.\n\nOdudu terminal also suffered the same fate due to decrease in production as a result of maintenance work on the Odudu and Ima terminal.\n\nFurthermore, Forcados shed 456,575 barrels of oil as a result of what NNPC described as community issues, which delayed reinstatement of the facility.\n\nBesides, Yoho dropped 420,000 barrels during the month under review, owing to a faulty valve; Ajapa lost 30,000 barrels due to shut down, while Aje terminal curtailed production within the period to the tune of 62,000 barrels.\n\nSimilarly, Brass suffered sabotage around Tebidada and Ogbaibiri flow stations as well as valve issues, pressure build-up, high sand production, leak repairs, resulting in a total loss of roughly 198,200 barrels.\n\nLast week, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) lamented that with the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production quota of 1.683 million bpd in January and 1.701 million bpd in February, Nigeria was only able to pump 1.396 million bpd currently.\n\nIn all, it stated that this was leading to a loss of at least 115,926 million bpd on a daily basis, put at roughly $300 million monthly.\n\n\u201cWe are losing about 115, 926 barrels per day, so that literally translates to roughly $300 million and that\u2019s a huge loss to a nation that actually requires these funds,\u201d the commission\u2019s Chief Executive, Mr Gbenga Komolafe, stated.\n\nKomolafe attributed the underperformance to mostly oil theft, sabotage, vandalism, and technical issues, including ruptures associated with the assets.\n\nIn its Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) for December, OPEC stated that given a comparison of that month with the previous month of November, a daily underperformance figure of 78,000 barrels per day was recorded by the country in December.\n\nCumulatively, THISDAY analysis showed that Nigeria lost as much as 2.418 million barrels of crude due to under-production in that month.\n\nThe month also saw Nigeria slump lower than other previous production performances, compared to, for instance, October, when 1.228 barrels were pumped per day, and November, when 1.275 million barrels were produced per day.\n\nGiven a conservative estimate, the inability of Nigeria to pump more oil in that month might have cost the country approximately $205.5 million for the entire month.\n\nLast week, NNPC requested a total of N3 trillion from the federal government to fund fuel subsidy in 2022 after the current administration suspended its earlier plan to end the policy.\n\nSpeaking on Arise Television, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm, last week, a former Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), Waziri Adio, stressed that since Nigeria first reported oil losses, the situation had escalated and was taking a heavy toll on the country.\n\nIn a period of 10 years, Adio stated, an analysis of losses to oil theft by NEITI revealed an enormous to $41.9 billion, about $4.1 billion per year. He argued that aside its economic implications, the losses also had security ramifications.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
