          "text": "Thirteen months after joining the All Progressives Congress officially, Iyiola Omisore was elected as the National Secretary of the party.\n\nHe was elected (by consensus) at the 2022 national convention of the party alongside 76 others.\n\nChecks by The PUNCH showed that Omisore was arraigned in 2002 for the murder of former Attorney General of the Federation, Bola Ige. He was later acquitted alongside 10 others that were tried.\n\nIn 2016, Omisore was arrested by the Economic and Financial Crime Commission for N1.3 billion he allegedly received from the Office of the National Security Adviser.\n\nHere are 10 things to know about Omisore\n\n1 \u2013 Senator Iyiola Omisore attended St. John\u2019s Grammar School, Ile \u2013 Ife between 1972 \u2013 1976. He attended the Ondo State Polytechnic, Owo, Ondo State, 1976 \u2013 1980 and proceeded to Full Technology College, Reading at the United Kingdom where he obtained a Diploma Certificate in Electrical/Electronics Engineering in 1983.\n\n2 \u2013 Omisore bagged his Bachelor of Engineering Degree in FTC Power and Machines, from Brunnel University, Uxbridge. He later did his Postgraduate Certificate in Building Service and Engineering Management and Masters of Science Degree in Building Service respectively from Brunnel University Uxbridge, United Kingdom.\n\n3 \u2013 He also obtained a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D) in Infrastructure Finance & Public-Private Partnership from the International School of Management, Paris, France.\n\n3- He emerged as the Deputy Governor of Osun State in 1999.\n\n4 \u2013 Omisore was re-elected as a Senator in 2007. He was Chairman/Member of committees: Industries, Culture and Tourism, Federal Character and Inter-governmental Affairs, Navy , Communications, Appropriations and UND/PINASS Support Implementation Committee.\n\n5- He is a Fellow of Chartered Institute of Building Service Engineers, Association of Cost Engineers, Nigeria Institute of Mechanical Engineers and Nigerian Society of Engineers.\n\n6 \u2013 Omisore was among various people arrested and tried for involvement in the murder of Bola Ige, who was shot dead on 23 December 2001, at his home in Ibadan. Omisore and others were all acquitted.\n\n7. In 2016, Omisore was arrested by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission for allegedly collecting N1.3billion from that then former National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki. He was later released by the EFCC .\n\n8 \u2013 Omisore had moved from one political party in his bid to govern Osun State. From Alliance for Democracy to the Peoples Democratic Party to the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and now All Progressives Congress.\n\n9 -He is believed to have assisted Gboyega Oyetola in becoming Osun State Governor. This was after the Independent National Electoral Commission declared the September 22, 2018 governorship election inconclusive on the ground that the 353 votes margin between Ademola Adeleke and Oyetola was lower than the number of cancelled votes (3,498) in seven polling units, which fell in Omisore\u2019s stronghold.\n\nIn the race, Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party was leading with 254,698 votes ahead of Oyetola who polled 254,345 votes. Omisore came a distant third with 128,049 votes. Omisore immediately became the beautiful bride to be courted by his two leading rivals.\n\nDelegations from both the APC and PDP met with Omisore after the first ballot of the 2018 poll but he eventually threw his support behind APC, saying the ruling party had accepted the conditions he gave them.\n\n10 \u2013 Omisore officially defected from the SDP to the APC in February 2021. He was welcomed into the party by Osun Deputy Governor, Benedict Alabi, and the state chairman of the party, Famodun.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "From Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja\n\nFormer governor of Rivers State, Sir Celestine Omehia, has said that the zoning of offices in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is sacrosanct as far as the 2023 elections are concerned.\n\nIn this interview with Sunday Sun, Omehia said that for equity, justice and fair play, the Southern part of the country deserves the presidency in 2023 since the position is currently in the North.\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nAmong other issues, Omehia said that if PDP zones the position of the president to the North, which is not likely, where the power is currently residing, it simply means that the PDP\u2019s constitution has been neglected, abandoned, and destroyed by members of the zoning committee and Nigerians will not forget them so easily.\n\nA lot of activities are going on in your party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Just yesterday (Wednesday), former Vice President Atiku Abubakar formally declared for the 2023 presidency. Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal and others from the North have also shown interest which appears that the PDP is not ready to allow the zoning principle of North and South. Why are your party chieftains flouting it?\n\nAs you know, this is the period of political activism in all the political parties in Nigeria. It is more so because the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has drawn up her programme of activities for the parties and the 2023 elections. My party, the Peoples Democratic Party, and her members are preparing towards the INEC programmes. According to our national chairman, we will not take anything for granted. Just last week, the National Executive Council (NEC) of the party agreed and directed that the presidential position should be zoned. This agreement and directive is in the spirit and the provision of our party\u2019s constitution. I must categorically state here that it is in the same spirit that the offices and positions of the party were zoned. Today, we have the members of the National Working Committee (NWC) in place and democratically working for the party. We are happy for it. PDP has enjoyed the zoning arrangement as it breeds peace, unity and love amongst the members of the party. Zoning and power rotation bring into the party, the spirit of equity, justice and fair play amongst the members. The interest of the members of the party from the units of the wards to the National Executive Council of the party and indeed, Nigeria as a whole, are covered as the aims and objectives of our party. This is provided for in Chapter 1, Section 2, Paragraph F of our constitution. But most notable is Chapter 1, Section 3, Paragraph C of our constitution. This section provides thus: \u201cThe party shall pursue its aims and objectives by: adhering to the policy of rotation and zoning of the party and public elective offices in pursuance of the principle of equity, justice and fairness.\u201d This provision is clean and clear even to those who are not legal practitioners. Though some people may not be happy with the zoning arrangement for personal interest and not for the general interest of the party or Nigerians as a whole. I am sure you must have read or watched from the media that the PDP Zoning Committee has been inaugurated with the mandate to zone and not to leave it for all comers. The committee cannot conclude that every person is free to contest. No, no, no. PDP must lead the way by obeying the provisions of the party constitution. To arrive at the formula on where to zone it to, my view which would be the view of all the reasonable members of the party and the committee is to consider where in Nigeria the presidential power is resident irrespective of the political party that is in power. PDP alone does not constitute the whole Nigeria and the president is the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Not the president of PDP or APC. North is Nigeria and South is Nigeria and the presidency is presently in the North. In this regard, the zoning committee is expected to do the needful according to the spirit of the PDP constitution and zone the next presidential competition to the southern part of the same Nigeria. It doesn\u2019t matter that some people from the northern part of Nigeria have picked the intent form. This is merely an expression of interest to run for the position of the president. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nThe ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), is showing that it is going South. If the PDP succeeds in going North, what will be the impact of the decision on the party being in the opposition?\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\nIf PDP zones the position of the president to the North, which is not likely, where the power is currently residing, it simply means that our party\u2019s constitution has been neglected, abandoned, and destroyed by members of this zoning committee and Nigerians will not forget them so easily. What APC has done in this regard is to borrow a leaf from the PDP constitution as cited above and the zoning committee of the PDP cannot fail the party by going to the North. This is the principle of equity, justice and fair play.\n\nIf the PDP decides to give the ticket to the South, where do you think it should go to? Is it the South-south that has ruled for five years, or the Southwest that ruled for eight years and has the current Vice President?\n\nIt is not the responsibility of the zoning committee to micro-zone the position. If in their wisdom and interest of justice it is zoned to the South, party leaders will be expected to meet and micro-zone it or allow a fair playing ground for all interested members of the party to participate to emerge as the party candidate.\n\nFor the sake of equity and fair play, don\u2019t you think it is the turn of the Southeast?\n\nMay I advise that we shall get the animal from the bush first and foremost before we decide on who shall go home with the head of the animal.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nGovernor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has done very well for the state. What political tour of duty do you suggest for him in 2023 at the expiration of his tenure? Should he join the fray and contest for presidency?\n\nLet me thank you for acknowledging that Governor Nyesom Wike has done very well in Rivers State. But let me also add that he has done so very well not only in Rivers State, but also in Nigeria as a whole. Because of his role in several democratic activities, Governor Wike is known as the face of democracy in Nigeria. I am sure you know me and you know that I am not one of the hosanna chanters. Nigerians know his competence, capacity, courage and ability to say things as he sees them. He is a peculiar person in politics. If he decides to run for the position of President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, he is qualified according to the provisions of the constitution of Nigeria. Beyond that, he is fully experienced and has full political and administrative knowledge of Nigeria and politics. Should he decides to run, I will encourage him to do so.\n\nIn clear terms, what is your idea of the President Nigeria deserves as far as 2023 is concerned?\n\nIn my terms, Nigeria will desire in 2023 presidency, a person with experience of the needs of Nigerians, a detribalized person, a person with the fear of God and respect for humanity and human life, a person with democratic blood flowing inside him, and a person who thinks of Nigeria first and self last.\n\nThere are those who believe that there should be a paradigm shift in 2023. In fact, former President Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida said the next president should be in his 60s. Do you share this view?\n\nNo, no, no. I don\u2019t share that view of 60 years to be president. The constitution of Nigeria has provided the age circumference for elective positions, including the age qualification for presidential aspirations. Productive is within 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s. Capacity, competence and courage come within 50s and 60s to 75. Above these is a diminishing return. A down hill syndrome.\n\nIn 2023, APC will complete eight years in office. When they came in 2015, they dislodged the PDP that has been in power for 16 years on the promise to fight insecurity, improve the economy and stamp out corruption from the country. Has the party succeeded in the almost seven years in office?\n\nThe answers to this question are glaring on our faces. You know and I know them too. The tears and the cries of Nigerians are before God. There is nothing to add.\n\nIf we find ourselves in this worsened situation, don\u2019t you think anybody taking over from President Muhammadu Buhari will have a herculean task? Is it not better to allow APC to continue in office?\n\n\u2018Nawa for you ooo\u2019. You have qualified the situation and have also stated the inability to remedy it. Why should we leave the critical situation as it is? A critical situation requires a radical response. A friend described Nigeria as \u201cthe bleeding giant of Africa.\u201d PDP must do something immediately to rescue Nigeria and restore and if possible, reposition her past glories. I can tell you for free that Nigerians are seriously waiting for the rescue by PDP through the 2023 elections. You know that leadership and rulership are not magic wands. Only the determined persons can make the difference. Only PDP can boast of them.\n\nWhat is the best way to tackle insecurity in the country?\n\nI am not a security consultant or professional. Only these bodies can give an effective solution to the security problems in Nigeria. Whether there are security problems in Nigeria, I will say yes, there are. But I am not in a position to advise on them.",

          "title": "Buni: I\u2019m Leaving APC Better, Stronger than I Met It",
          "text": "\n\n*Renames APC national secretariat after Buhari\n\nEmameh Gabriel in Abuja\n\nOutgoing Caretaker Committee Chairman of the ruling All Progressive Congress and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, has said that he would leave behind a strong and united APC family to his successor.\n\nBuni on his valedictory speech at the APC national convention, gave account of his stewardship as the caretaker chairman of the party in the last two years, noting that his efforts have repositioned the party.\n\nBuni had come under fire in recent times over how he managed the cracks in the party, and was almost removed from office by some powerful forces that were allegedly backed by President Buhari in his last days in office through what many had described as a palace coup.\n\nBuni was appointed to steer the affairs of the party after the removal of Adams Oshiomhole from office in 2019. His mandate however was to manage the crisis in the party and thereafter conduct a national convention that will produce a National Working Committee for the party.\n\nBut the convention was postponed several times. However, in his speech last night, Buni attributed it to the larger problems he inherited from a party he said was more polarised then and needed more time to be cured from its internal ailments.\n\nWhile he thanked the President and stakeholders of the party for the support they gave to him in his days in office, Buni boasted that he was \u201cmore confident than ever, that with a population of over 41 million registered members and still counting, APC has the potential and capacity to remain Nigeria\u2019s ruling party and indeed, Africa\u2019s largest political party.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cI am delighted with your esteemed presence at this epoch-making occasion in the life of our party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), as we assemble here for the National Convention, climaxing the transition process which started with the conduct of ward, local, and state congresses. Today, we are going for the zonal and national offices as well as, the ratification of the amended constitution of Africa\u2019s largest political party, the APC.\n\n*As you are aware, the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee which l am opportune to chair, is a child of circumstance constituted by the National Executive Committee (NEC), to restructure and reposition the party.\n\n\u201cYour Excellencies, distinguished personalities, ladies and gentlemen, permit me to quickly reflect on some of the modest achievements recorded by the party under the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee whose tenure is ending today, for us to appreciate how far we have gone in revamping and improving our beloved party.\n\n\u201cUpon assumption of office, the committee embarked on a genuine and all-inclusive reconciliation process to give everyone a true sense of belonging, confidence, and reassurance in the collective ownership of the party.\n\n\u201cWe, first of all, visited some critical stakeholders to engage them in resolving the disputes and other hanging disagreements in the party. While some of these visits were made public, others were done out of the public glare and without media publicity. Similarly, we visited some aggrieved chieftains who sincerely shared their ill feelings with the committee. We spoke to each other frankly, placing party interests above personal interests.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am glad to state that those frank discussions built a new hope in the hearts of the aggrieved persons such that, those who earlier left the party returned back, while those contemplating to forsake the party, never left.\n\n\u201cHowever, when we commenced the assignment, we realized that the problems on the ground had far outweighed our estimation of the time required to resolve the huge problems bedeviling the party. This made the initial Six months dateline grossly inadequate, unrealistic, and not practicable and therefore, the need for extension of more time. Happily, for every extension, we brought in additional values with positive developments into the party.\n\n\u201cHaving reconciled substantial stakeholders, members and groups, the committee commenced membership registration and revalidation exercise, being one of the mandates of the CECPC, to establish the party\u2019s numerical strength for proper planning and mobilization. The exercise provided our new members the opportunity to register as legitimate members of APC with equal rights, privileges, and opportunities, as well as, to give back the ownership of the party to the members, using the bottom-top approach.\n\n\u201cI am glad to state with all sense of fulfillment that the membership registration and revalidation exercise, recorded over 41 million members who registered with the details of their Permanent Voter Cards (PVC) and passport size photographs. This unprecedented increase in membership from the previous 11 million registered members to over 41 million registered members, provides the party with an added advantage of winning elections in Nigeria with landslide victories\u201d, he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Caretaker Committee, made history with an unparalleled record of high-powered defections into the party. Three serving governors of Ebonyi State, His Excellency Engr. Dave Umahi, Cross River State, His Excellency Dr. Ben Ayade, and Zamfara State, Alhaji Bello Mutawalle, defected along with Millions of their supporters from PDP into the APC.\n\n\u201cI am glad to add that the fortunes of the party were further enriched with the defection of former Speakers of the House of Representatives, former PDP national chairman, member PDP Board of Trustees, several Distinguished Senators and Honourable members of the House of Representatives and state assemblies, and several other heavyweights cutting across all the geo-political zones of the country.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Abdullahi Adamu, late Saturday night emerged as the new National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the 2022 National Convention of the party.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Adamu emerged as the consensus candidate of the party after six other aspirants stepped down.\n\nNAN observed that prior to the commencement of the convention on Saturday, former Gov. George Akume, had earlier on Saturday revealed that six of the APC Chairmanship aspirants had withdrawn from the race.\n\nAkume, presently the Minister of Special Duties, was a frontrunner in the chairmanship race before the reported endorsement of Sen. Abdullahi Adamu by President Buhari.\n\nAkume made the revelation in a letter addressed to the APC Election Sub-Committee, National Secretariat, Abuja.\n\nAdamu was therefore declared winner at the convention after a voice vote in which the \u2018ayes\u2019 had it.\n\nNAN reports that the convention was attended by President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo.\n\n,Others are: President of the Senate, Ahmed Lawan, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, APC governors, former Governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu and other party members as well as delegates. (NAN)\n\n.\n\n12:55pm\n\nBuni: I\u2019m Leaving APC Better, Stronger than I Met It\n\n\n\n*Renames APC national secretariat after Buhari\n\nEmameh Gabriel in Abuja\n\nOutgoing Caretaker Committee Chairman of the ruling All Progressive Congress and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, has said that he would leave behind a strong and united APC family to his successor.\n\nBuni on his valedictory speech at the APC national convention, gave account of his stewardship as the caretaker chairman of the party in the last two years, noting that his efforts have repositioned the party.\n\nBuni had come under fire in recent times over how he managed the cracks in the party, and was almost removed from office by some powerful forces that were allegedly backed by President Buhari in his last days in office through what many had described as a palace coup.\n\nBuni was appointed to steer the affairs of the party after the removal of Adams Oshiomhole from office in 2019. His mandate however was to manage the crisis in the party and thereafter conduct a national convention that will produce a National Working Committee for the party.\n\nBut the convention was postponed several times. However, in his speech last night, Buni attributed it to the larger problems he inherited from a party he said was more polarised then and needed more time to be cured from its internal ailments.\n\nWhile he thanked the President and stakeholders of the party for the support they gave to him in his days in office, Buni boasted that he was \u201cmore confident than ever, that with a population of over 41 million registered members and still counting, APC has the potential and capacity to remain Nigeria\u2019s ruling party and indeed, Africa\u2019s largest political party.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cI am delighted with your esteemed presence at this epoch-making occasion in the life of our party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), as we assemble here for the National Convention, climaxing the transition process which started with the conduct of ward, local, and state congresses. Today, we are going for the zonal and national offices as well as, the ratification of the amended constitution of Africa\u2019s largest political party, the APC.\n\n*As you are aware, the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee which l am opportune to chair, is a child of circumstance constituted by the National Executive Committee (NEC), to restructure and reposition the party.\n\n\u201cYour Excellencies, distinguished personalities, ladies and gentlemen, permit me to quickly reflect on some of the modest achievements recorded by the party under the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee whose tenure is ending today, for us to appreciate how far we have gone in revamping and improving our beloved party.\n\n\u201cUpon assumption of office, the committee embarked on a genuine and all-inclusive reconciliation process to give everyone a true sense of belonging, confidence, and reassurance in the collective ownership of the party.\n\n\u201cWe, first of all, visited some critical stakeholders to engage them in resolving the disputes and other hanging disagreements in the party. While some of these visits were made public, others were done out of the public glare and without media publicity. Similarly, we visited some aggrieved chieftains who sincerely shared their ill feelings with the committee. We spoke to each other frankly, placing party interests above personal interests.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am glad to state that those frank discussions built a new hope in the hearts of the aggrieved persons such that, those who earlier left the party returned back, while those contemplating to forsake the party, never left.\n\n\u201cHowever, when we commenced the assignment, we realized that the problems on the ground had far outweighed our estimation of the time required to resolve the huge problems bedeviling the party. This made the initial Six months dateline grossly inadequate, unrealistic, and not practicable and therefore, the need for extension of more time. Happily, for every extension, we brought in additional values with positive developments into the party.\n\n\u201cHaving reconciled substantial stakeholders, members and groups, the committee commenced membership registration and revalidation exercise, being one of the mandates of the CECPC, to establish the party\u2019s numerical strength for proper planning and mobilization. The exercise provided our new members the opportunity to register as legitimate members of APC with equal rights, privileges, and opportunities, as well as, to give back the ownership of the party to the members, using the bottom-top approach.\n\n\u201cI am glad to state with all sense of fulfillment that the membership registration and revalidation exercise, recorded over 41 million members who registered with the details of their Permanent Voter Cards (PVC) and passport size photographs. This unprecedented increase in membership from the previous 11 million registered members to over 41 million registered members, provides the party with an added advantage of winning elections in Nigeria with landslide victories\u201d, he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Caretaker Committee, made history with an unparalleled record of high-powered defections into the party. Three serving governors of Ebonyi State, His Excellency Engr. Dave Umahi, Cross River State, His Excellency Dr. Ben Ayade, and Zamfara State, Alhaji Bello Mutawalle, defected along with Millions of their supporters from PDP into the APC.\n\n\u201cI am glad to add that the fortunes of the party were further enriched with the defection of former Speakers of the House of Representatives, former PDP national chairman, member PDP Board of Trustees, several Distinguished Senators and Honourable members of the House of Representatives and state assemblies, and several other heavyweights cutting across all the geo-political zones of the country.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Adamu emerged as the consensus candidate of the party after six other aspirants stepped down\n\n\n\nNAN observed that prior to the commencement of the convention on Saturday, former Gov. George Akume, had earlier on Saturday revealed that six of the APC Chairmanship aspirants had withdrawn from the race.\n\nAkume, presently the Minister of Special Duties, was a frontrunner in the chairmanship race before the reported endorsement of Sen. Abdullahi Adamu by President Buhari.\n\nAkume made the revelation in a letter addressed to the APC Election Sub-Committee, National Secretariat, Abuja.\n\nAdamu was therefore declared winner at the convention after a voice vote in which the \u2018ayes\u2019 had it.\n\nNAN reports that the convention was attended by President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo.\n\n\n\n,Others are: President of the Senate, Ahmed Lawan, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, APC governors, former Governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu and other party members as well as delegates. (NAN)\n\n12:35pm\n\nConvention: Buhari Charges APC Members to Remain Strong, United\n\nUdora Orizu in Abuja\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila has expressed the optimism that the best days of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) are still in the future.\n\n\n\nGbajabiamila who stated this in his remarks at the national convention of the party in Abuja, said that the success of the convention has triumphed over all cynicism and apathy.\n\nHe urged party faithfuls to set aside personal interests and ambitions to work together to deliver a successful convention that they can all be proud of.\n\n\n\nThe Speaker said, \u201cFellow progressives, we have travelled a long and hard road to arrive at this day. Through trial and tribulation, disagreement and reconciliation, misunderstanding and compromise, we have convened here to elect for our party a new national leadership to lead us at this critical time in the history of the progressive movement. But our gathering here today is more than just about an election.\n\nThis convention honours the courage and sacrifice of the men and women across the length and breadth of Nigeria who banded together to build a new political movement capable of seeking and achieving political power and using that power to improve the lives of the Nigerian people.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe All Progressives Congress (APC) is a triumph of vision over cynicism and principled action over apathy. As it was in the beginning, so it remains today. Together, we are a living monument to the principle that when patriots stand together in a righteous cause, God is ready to bless the works of their hands. And from our union of progressives has emerged substantive, long-lasting change that will stand to the benefit of our country for years to come. Through multiple electoral contests, many battles won and lost; through growth and expansion, it sometimes feels like the bonds of our brotherhood have frayed, and we have moved farther apart from each other. I urge this convention to remember the ideals and principles of our founding and let us, in that remembrance, rediscover the promise of our union.\n\n\n\nHe added, \u201cI believe that for the All Progressives Congress (APC) and for the Federal Republic of Nigeria, our best days are ahead of us. Our party, like our country, is going through a process of rebirth. We have the power and opportunity to build a political party that can stand the test of time and lead our country to a future of abiding peace and universal prosperity. We have answered that call and must now work together to make ourselves worthy, and by so doing, write our names, each and together, in the good book of history for all generations to come.\u201d\n\n11:35pm\n\nAPC Convention: Our Best Days Ahead, Says Gbajabiamila\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has called on members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to remain united and strong and also support the incoming leadership of the party ahead of the forthcoming 2023 General elections in the country.This is just as the President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, said President Buhari will remain the compass of APC even after leaving office by May, 2023.\n\nSpeaking at the Eagle Square, Abuja, venue of the extra ordinary National Convention of the party on Saturday night the, the President said the Convention was coming at a crucial time when there is need to prepare for another round of a general election. He said: \u201cTherefore, the need to remain strong and united for the Party to exploit the rich and abundant potentials at its disposal cannot be overemphasized. We appreciate the right to hold different opinions and aspirations, however, such differences must not be to the detriment of the Party.\n\nEarlier in his remarks at the convention, President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, declared that President Buhari will continue to provide leadership to the All Progressives Congress (APC) beyond 2023 after his exit from office.\n\nAccording to him, President Buhari\u2019s ability to sustain unity within the party against all odds, positions him favorably as the \u201ccompass\u201d needed to give direction to the party at all times.\n\nDetails.later\u2026\n\n11:30pm\n\n6 APC Chairmanship Aspirants Step down for Adamu\n\nSix national chairmanship aspirants in the All Progressives Congress (APC) chairmanship race have stepped down for Sen. Abdullahi Adamu, adjudged the preferred candidate of the party\u2019s leadership for the position.\n\nAdamu had been endorsed by President Muhammad Buhari after series of meetings with governors of the party in the build up to national convention.\n\n\n\nThis was stated in a letter addressed to the Chairman, APC Election Sub-Committee and signed by one of the aspirants, Sen. George Akume, made available to newsmen on Saturday in Abuja.\n\n\n\nThe letter reads: \u201cMay I kindly refer to the appeal by President Muhammad Buhari for the chairmanship aspirants of our great party to agree to a consensus arrangement wherein our colleague Sen. Abdullahi Adamu is made our consensus candidate for the chairmanship position,\u201d said Akume.\n\n\n\nHe forwarded letters of withdrawal from Sen. Tanko Al-Makura, Sen. George Akume, Abdulaziz Yari, Sen. Sani Musa Muhammed, Etsu Muhammed and Malam Saliu Mustapha.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the APC had earlier in a tweet, said no fewer than 7, 584 delegates would vote at the convention.\n\n\n\nGov. Abudulahi Sule of Nasarawa State had earlier hinted that President Buhari had appealed that the party should come up with a consensus candidate to ensure a peaceful and rancour-free convention\n\n\n\nSule, chairman APC Sub-Committee on Media and Publicity for the National Convention, said the decision followed President Buhari\u2019s appeal for a consensus candidate.\n\nHe said the party\u2019s leadership might refund money paid by aspirants for the purchase of Expression of Interest and Nomination forms after the emergence of consensus candidate.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis was an appeal made by Buhari to show leadership; he said once we agreed on the consensus, it is only fair that what they paid to purchase the forms be returned to them.\n\n\u201cThat is his request, and I am telling you, his request will be honoured, because we know he is doing it sincerely for the benefit of the party.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was a request actually made by the president to the leadership of the party and the leadership were there, so, I will say that the leadership of the party also agreed,\u201d Sule had said.\n\n\n\nThe APC chairmanship aspirants paid N20 million each to purchase the party\u2019s Expression of Interest and Nomination forms to contest the position zoned to the North-Central by its leadership.\n\nNAN reports that the APC National Convention is a climax of activities which started with Wards, Local Government and State Congresses.\n\n\n\nSixty-five National Working Committee (NWC) members are expected to be elected at the convention, including 21 NWC members and 45 non NWC members.\n\nThe party\u2019s affairs until now, was being managed by the Gov.

Sunday Frank Okputu, while speaking in Yenagoa on Saturday, argued that the decision not to allow all delegates of the party from Bayelsa State is right and has saved the party from any disaster that may arise from the subsisting litigation over the authenticity of the last ward, local government and state congresses.\n\nFrank-Okputu commended the caretaker leadership, the Reconciliation Committee and every member of the APC for upholding the agitations of those against impunity in Bayelsa APC.\n\n\u201cThey have saved the national leadership of the party from doom because the pending litigations could damage the outcome of the convention. It will ensure that there is sanity in the process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe decision is worthy of emulation and will ensure that there is sanity in the way things are done within the party. You can not run into a house from the back door and claim to be right. The decision to exclude purported delegates from Bayelsa will ensure that the right things are done in line with the provisions of party rules and the Electoral Act as amended.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI thank all party faithful in Bayelsa that kept faith with the true progressives led by Sen. Heineken Lokpobiri. It shows we were on the right path and to ensure the right people are allowed to lead the party in the state.\u201d\n\nIt would be recalled that few hours to the National Convention of the party, the Secretary of the subcommittee of Accreditation, Alhaji Tijani Musa Tumsah, had announced that only statutory delegates from Sokoto, Bayelsa, Akwa-Ibom and Taraba States will be allowed to vote due to pending litigations.\n\n4:31pm\n\n2023: Youth Groups Storm APC Convention, Endorse Emefiele for President\n\n\n\nSunday Aborisade in Abuja\n\nVarious groups of youths across the country, in their hundreds, stormed the Eagles Square Convention ground of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja Saturday and demanded that the Central Bank Governor (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, should declare his ambition to contest the 2023 presidential election without further delay. The mammoth crowd consisted of women, young professionals and other Nigerians who wore Emefiele\u2019s branded colourful apparels.\n\nThey were led by the APC League of Young Professionals, Ethnic Youth Leaders\u2019 Council, and the Emefiele Support Group.\n\nThe groups overran the convention ground with calls on the CBN Governor, to contest the presidency in 2023. Addressing the media, the group reiterated the need for a worthy successor to President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe claimed that Nigeria cannot afford to miss the golden opportunity of electing a financial expert and globally renowned economist like Emefiele at this time in Nigeria\u2019s history.\n\nMallam Kabir Buba, who spoke on behalf of the group, explained the type a leader Nigeria deserves in 2023, added that: \u201cSuch a successor must be a professional, loyal to the president, a technocrat, a patriot and detribalised Nigerian.\n\n\u201cHe must be one who has been part of the progress recorded in this administration and a less controversial leader.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, he must be a unifier and peace builder, someone to douse the South-south quest for one more term and satisfy the Igbo agitations for the presidency.\u201d\n\nThe groups added that Emefiele fits the bill and is the man to continue to consolidate and expand the progressive legacies of President Buhari. The groups\u2019 leaders emphasised the CBN Governor\u2019s patriotism and his irrepressible commitment to the growth and development of the Nigerian economy.\n\nThey said his good character and attributes would make him a worthy successor to the president.\n\nThey said: \u201cAs an experienced economist with more than 26 years of commercial banking experience, Emefiele is well equipped to place Nigeria amongst developed and wealthy nations in the world.\u201d They insisted that his recorded achievements were too many to mention.\n\nThey re-emphasised that Emefiele, having worked in the two political divides, appointed by the Peoples Democratic Party government, and retained by the APC as the CBN Governor, has continued to show great dedication and commitment regardless of political alliances.\n\nAccording to the groups\u2019 spokesperson, \u201cOver seven years as the CBN Governor, he has saved Nigeria twice from economic recession and created initiatives that target job creation with over seven million jobs.\u201d\n\n4:14pm\n\nOshiomhole Arrives Convention Ground amid Cheers from APC Members\n\nEmameh Gabriel in Abuja\n\nFormer Governor of Edo State, Adams Oshiomhole, stole the show at the APC national convention when he walked into Eagle Square amid cheers by party faithful.\n\nThe former APC national chairman was seen dressed in his usual labour uniform, escorted by his supporters.\n\nOshiomhole danced to the admiration of delegates who chanted \u201cOshobaba\u201d, \u201cOshioquake\u201d and showered him with encomium.\n\nFielding questions from journalists, Oshiomhole said God had shamed few enemies of the party who wanted to cause confusion in the party.\n\nHe said that the convention was holding today, was a sign that God was at work.\n\n4:09pm\n\nSouth-South APC Consensus List Emerges\n\n*Delta gets national publicity secretary, Rivers settles for vice national chairman\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nSouth south zone has released the list of consensus candidates with Delta state picking the office of the National Publicity Secretary, while Rivers got the office of the national vice chairman for the South south.\n\nThe list of nominees as consensus candidates was signed by Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State, Secretary of the CECPC, Senator John Akpanudoudehe; Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Ameachi, and Minister of Niger-Delta, Godswill Akpabio.\n\nOthers who signed the list were the party\u2019s former Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole; a former Minister of State for Agriculture, Heineken Lokpobiri, and former Edo State Deputy Governor, Lucky Imasuen.\n\nAlso at the meeting where the decision was made was Mrs Stella Okotete, the representative of women in the Caretaker Extraordinary Committee; representative of the South-South in the CECPC, Mr David Lyon; Sen. Ita Enang, Sen. Magnus Abe, Mr Victor Giadom and Deputy Senate President, Sen. Ovie Omo-Agege.\n\nHowever, all the six states in the region were allocated at least an office as shown in the list.\n\nTop on the list of the beneficiaries is the former deputy National Secretary of the party, Victor Giadom, who is returning to the party as National Vice Chairman (South-South) and a member of the NWC.\n\nGiadom, a former commissioner of works in Rivers State, became popular when he pronounced himself the acting national chairman of the party, an action that finally led to the sacking of a former Governor of Edo State, Adams Oshiomhole as the party\u2019s national chairman almost two years ago.\n\nOther adopted candidates are Delta State Commissioner for Health, Dr Betta Edu (National Women Leader), and Mr Felix Morka (National Publicity Secretary).\n\nA statement issued by the stakeholders said that the three party members were adopted at the last meeting of the stakeholders held in Abuja.\n\nThe National Vice Chairman South-South is zoned to Rivers/Bayelsa states, National Women Leader to Akwa Ibom/Cross River states and National Publicity Secretary to Edo/ Delta States.\n\nWhile Governor Ayade picked Edu (Cross River) for the National Women Leader, Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, was said to have picked Giadom (Rivers State) for the position of National Vice Chairman.\n\nOmo-Agege was also said to have picked Morka (Delta State) for the National Publicity Secretary position.\n\nThe position of others who obtained the expression of interest and nomination forms to contest the positions was not clear as at press time.\n\n3:57pm\n\nStampede at Convention Venue, Police Deploy Dogs to Control Crowd\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThere was stampede at the ongoing NationaI Convention of the All Progressive Congress, at the Eagles Square, Abuja. More than 30 people were injured, including a pregnant member of the party.\n\nPolice dogs were however deployed to control the large crowd of delegates.\n\nAccording to an eyewitness, police and Civil Defence Corps chased the delegates and the party supporters with dogs.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the delegates had stormed the venue waiting for clearance since 6:30am.\n\nDelegates and other party men and women lost their patience and started pushing themselves as they complained about the slow pace of the clearance.\n\nIt was gathered that the police had to use teargas as the crowd became uncontrollable and in the process, stampede ensued.\n\nThe policemen were seen beating people with batons as they tried to control of the crowd.\n\nSome were said to have sustained injuries at the entrance of the venue where the massive crowd was waiting to be screened by the security agents.\n\nIt was learnt that the screening pace was slow because of the large crowd, when the stampede occurred and the security agents at the gate were helpless.\n\nSome APC stalwarts and leaders were seen coming to the venue at about 12 noon.\n\nThe lateness was because of the various meetings to finalise arrangement for the consensus candidate.\n\n2:38pm\n\nGovernor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State and Femi Fani Kayode arriving the venue of the convention\n\n2:14p.m\n\nOsinbajo, Tinubu, Emefiele, Amaechi\u2019s Posters Flood Abuja\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe banners, poster and billboards of key political figures believed to have interest in picking the presidential ticket of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have been placed in strategic places in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja ahead of the convention holds today.\n\nThe personalities whose pictures were displayed conspicuously in the banners, posters and billboards included Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, former Lagos Governor Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, and Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi.\n\nOne of the banners showing the minister along Umaru Musa Yar\u2019adua Expressway read: \u201cAmaechi: Our Hope 2023\u201d.\n\nThe billboards of Tinubu, Osinbajo, and Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State were also seen along the Airport Expressway. Also seen were APC national chairmanship aspirants\u2019 posters, including those of Abdullaziz Yari and Senator Sani Musa (Niger East).\n\nThe billboards of former governors of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, and Senator Tanko Al-Makura, as well as those of the Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs, Senator George Akume; a former deputy national chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), Saliu Mustapha, were placed in other strategic locations in the FCT.\n\nThe posters were also conspicuosly displayed around the APC convention ground at Eagle Square, Abuja\n\nAlso several first term governors used the occasion to display posters of their campaigns for second term in office\n\nSeveral posters and banners of Lagos, Osun, and Ogun governors were on display, while posters of governorship candidates of Ekiti and others were also seen.\n\nTinubu campaign posters for presidential ticket of APC dominated most viable corners of the Eagle Square.\n\n1:15PM\n\nBreaking: Akume, Yari, Al-Makura, Others Step down for Adamu\n\nIn line with President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s advice, six aspirants contesting the national chairmanship position of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have withdrawn from the race.\n\nIn a letter dated 25th March, which was signed by Senator George Akume, the aspirants said their decision was premised on the advice of the leadership of the party to pick Abdullahi Adamu as a cencensus candidate for the position.\n\nThe aspirants are: Senator George Akume, Senator Tanko Al-Makura, Abdilalziz Yari, Etsu Muhammed, Sani Musa Muhammed and Turaki Salifu Mustapha.\n\nThe Letter\n\n\n\n12:19P.M\n\nBreaking: Musa Withdraws from APC Chairmanship Race, Backs Adamu as Consensus Candidate\n\nEmameh Gabriel in Abuja\n\nA few hours to the convention, a frontline national chairmanship aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Mohammed Sani Musa, has announced his withdrawal from the race in line with President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s advice for a concensus national chairman.\n\nMusa\u2019s spokesman, Nasir Mohammed, confirmed this a few minutes ago.\n\nMusa, currently representing Niger East Senatorial District at the Nigerian Senate, announced his withdrawal from the race after the aspirants\u2019 meeting with President Buhari the Friday and 24 hours to the convention scheduled for Saturday March 26, 2022 in Abuja.\n\nHe pledged to back Senator Abdullahi Adamu as the consensus candidate for the seat in today\u2019s convention.\n\n11:43A.M\n\nConvention: Security Personnel Battle to Clear Delegates at Venue\n\n* Over 70% of delegates yet to gain entry into convention centre at 10 am\n\nEmameh Gabriel in Abuja\n\nDelegates to the APC National Convention at the Eagle Square, Abuja encountered intense scrutiny, as security personnel struggled to screen and clear them for participation.\n\nTHISDAY reports that the delegates started arriving at the venue as early as 7 a.m, amid tight security with their supporters playing music and chanting in different languages.\n\nThe convention venue and every axis in the 3 Armed Zone were littered with posters and placards carrying photographs of aspirants for various national offices, presidential hopefuls an other positions.\n\nThe situation at the venue later became chaotic, as delegates struggled to enter through the only gate reserved for them, leading almost to a stampede.\n\nAs at the time of this report, most journalists assigned for the event were still struggling to gain access into Eagle Square.\n\nJournalists, who were also caught in the web in efforts to enter the venue, were chased away.\n\nA THISDAY reporter also sustained a minor injury in the process from a police officer.\n\nAt a point, the police had deployed force and security dogs to deter delegates from forcing their way into the first gate and this sent the crowd scampering for safety.\n\nThe programme of events for the convention indicated that delegates were to arrive for screening at 10 am but over 70% of them were still battling to gain access to the venue as at 10am.\n\nAlthough security personnel have been able to manage the challenges, with only one entrance provided for thousands of delegates from the 36 states and FCT, it would be an impossible task to clear all of them today.\n\nFood vendors and small business owners at the venue are making brisk business selling snacks and drinks at the venue.\n\nSee photos\n\n7:44AM\n\nTight Security at Eagle Square, as APC Holds Convention Today\n\nEmameh Gabriel in Abuja\n\nThere is a heavy security presence at Eagle Square Abuja, venue of the national convention of the All Progressive Congress (APC).\n\nSecurity personnel are manning strategic locations and roads around the Eagle Square and Federal Secretariat, while armoured personnel carriers are stationed at the adjoining junctions.\n\nMeanwhile, the roads along the axis have been closed to traffic, resulting in gradual build up of gridlocks.\n\nSome APC supporters from across the country who arrived Abuja yesterday slept on roads at the Three Arms Zone to enable them gain easy access to the venue.\n\nSee photos\n\n7:00AM\n\nAfter Months of Rancour, APC Convenes to Endorse Abdullahi Adamu as Chairman\n\n*Few hours to voting, governors still struggling with Unity List for other NWC positions\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nAfter several months of intense fighting, over 5,000 delegates from across Nigeria will today gather at the Eagle Square, Abuja, to endorse former Nasarawa State Governor, Senator Abdullahi Adamu as the National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\n\nThe Abdullahi Adamu deal was concluded last Wednesday after President Muhammadu Buhari summoned the 22 governors of the party to a meeting and decreed the adoption of consensus candidates for all the offices of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party. Thereafter, he nominated Adamu for National Chairman.\n\nAs at last night, all the chairmanship aspirants had withdrawn from the race in line with Buhari\u2019s directives.\n\nThe Unity List for other NWC positions of the party was not decided during the governors\u2019 meeting with Buhari. The President told the governors to meet and agree on this; that refunds of money spent on purchasing forms be made to all the aspirants unable to make the Unity List.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, as at last night, just a few hours before voting began, the governors could still not agree on the Unity List. So, no list had been sent out.\n\nOne of the positions still in dispute is that of the party\u2019s National Secretary. Some governors want Iyiola Omisore, former deputy governor of Osun State, while some others want Ifeoluwa Oyedele, a 2020 governorship aspirant of the party in Ondo State.\n\n\n\nThe choice of Waziri Bulama (Borno State) as National Organsing Secretary by the governors is also in dispute. Some top party members, including Governor Babagana Zulum prefer Senator Abu Kyari for the job.\n\nThose looking good to make the Unity List are Ken Nnamani (Enugu State) as Deputy National Chairman, South and Adamu Farouk (Jigawa State)) as Deputy National Chairman, North.\n\n\n\nHowever, if the governors are able to resolve the Unity List and send it out this morning as indicated by another source, it means the election today would be a mere academic exercise.\n\n\n\nIt would also mean that any aspirant still bent on contesting is free to do so, but once outside the Unity List, it is surely going to be a losing game, as the governors control the delegates who will vote at the convention.\n\nGovernor of Nasarawa State Abdullahi Sule, who is Chairman Media and Publicity sub-committee for the National Convention, refused to comment on the delay in the release of the Unity List at a press briefing yesterday, but simply said the list would still be released and would be used today.\n\n\n\nOn the issue of political appointees voting at today\u2019s convention, Governor Sule said: \u201cOur delegates\u2019 list is actually statutory. So, if you have a former president as a political appointee, if you have a former Senator as a political appointee, these are already automatic delegates, you know. So, let us not confuse the two because being an appointee does not necessarily take you out of being a delegate, because our delegates are classified clearly.\n\n\u201cSo, most of the lists that we submitted, if you are talking of the ones who have submitted now, we don\u2019t have commissioners, we don\u2019t have advisors, we don\u2019t have all those unless if somebody particularly was a former this or former that, in that case, you know, just being an appointee doesn\u2019t completely exclude such a person from being a delegate.\u201d\n\nThe President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan on Thursday expressed optimism that most of the new NWC members of the APC today will emerge by consensus.\n\n\u201cThe next two days are so important to us that we must get everything spot on so that we don\u2019t allow anyone to cause any problem. Thank God we are reaching consensus all over the states and zones and by the time we go into the convention ground, I\u2019m sure there will be very few elective offices that will have to be voted for. Most would have been achieved through consensus,\u201d Lawan said.\n\n\n\nLawan adds: \u201cWe, as a party, feel that this is a moment that is so critical to the existence of APC in Nigeria. We need to get the convention right. We need to have a very successful, peaceful convention where we elect our leaders that will run the affairs of the party for the next four years. Therefore, every hand must be on deck and what we have done is to come and say our hands are available to be on deck as always.\n\n\n\nProgramme of Activities\n\n\n\nEagle Square, venue of today\u2019s convention, was sparkling yesterday, while virtually all the delegates had arrived.\n\nAccording to the convention programme released by the APC, accredited delegates are expected to start arriving at the Eagle Square by 10 am. Members of the National Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) will arrive by 1:30p.m.\n\n\n\nAPC state governors, National Assembly members, ministers and other party leaders are expected by 2:p.m. The President of the Senate and the Speaker, House of Representatives, will arrive between 2:10p.m and 2:20p.m.\n\nVice-President Yemi Osinbajo will arrive by 2:45p.m while President Buhari will arrive by 3:15p.m. The convention will then kick off.\n\n\n\nThere will be goodwill messages by Youth Wing, Women Wing, People Living with Disability (PLwD) and Diaspora Wing between 3:40 and 4:50p.m.\n\nRemarks by the Chairman, Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF) and Representatives of Governors\u2019 from each of the six geo-political zones will take place between 4:50 and 5:20p.m.\n\nRemarks by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate will be between 5:25 and 5:35p.m.\n\n\n\nRemarks by the Vice-President follow between 5:35 and 5:40p.m, while Special Remarks by President Buhari will be between 5:40 and 5:55p.m\n\nAfter the welcome address by the CECPC Chairman, there will be a presentation of two motions.\n\nThese are the motion for the approval of Constitution as amended and the motion for the ratification of all activities carried out by CECPC.\n\n\n\nElections into Zonal and National Offices of the APC will then follow. Then, there will be the declaration of results and swearing in of the newly elected executives. The newly elected National Chairman is expected to make an acceptance speech.\n\nAltogether, 21 NWC positions and 33 non-NWC positions are expected to be filled today.\n\n\n\nAPC Governors, Ministers Present Scorecards\n\nGovernors and Ministers of the ruling APC yesterday in Abuja presented a seven years\u2019 scorecard to the party, to back their performance status over the former ruling PDP as they march towards 2023 campaigns.\n\nThe scorecard was presented at the party\u2019s Pre-Convention Conference with the theme: Consolidating Democratic Change: Scorecard, Impact and the Road Ahead at Shehu Musa Yar\u2019Adua Centre, Abuja.\n\n\n\nAt the event, governors and serving ministers on the platform of the APC took their time to chronicle the events leading to the formation of the party and the successes, challenges, and achievements made by the party, both at the state and national levels in the last seven years.\n\n\n\nPresent at the event were: Governors Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State, Babagana Zulum of Borno, Fayemi Kayode of Ekiti, Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola\n\nMinister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, said the APC government social investment programme was yielding good results as Nigeria had emerged the nation with the fastest growing social investment programme in the world.\n\nZainab also disclosed that Nigeria\u2019s economy was now fully diversified due to different economic intervention strategies introduced by the Buhari-led APC government.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The defendants also pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nBut the then presiding judge, David Okorowa, ruled that Adamu would stand trial as he had a case to answer.\n\nIn 2013, the senator and other defendants filed a suit at the Court of Appeal, challenging the decision of the lower court.\n\nIn 2018, Adamu claimed the EFCC had dusted his file on alleged case of corruption since 2016.\n\nIn the same year, his son was arrested alongside one Felix Onyeabo by the anti-graft agency for allegedly getting a contract with forged documents.\n\nJustice J. K. Daggard of the Federal High Court sitting in Kano on February 7, 2018, granted Nuraini Adamu and Onyeabo bail in the sum of N8 million each and two sureties in like sum.\n\nThe defendants were arraigned on January 17, 2018, on 5 counts of money laundering.\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerians on social media have reacted to the withdrawal of some of the candidates from the race and subsequent emergence of the \u2018preferred\u2019 candidates at the APC National Convention.\n\nA tweep @mosky101 wrote, \"People traveled to Abuja for nothing only to hear the names of preferred candidates #APCNationalConvention what a shame.\u201d",

One of the 1993 graduating set of the law school in Lagos confirmed never to have met the former governor throughout the one-year programme.\n\n\u201cThe use of an affidavit for loss of certificate to replace proper documentation is fast becoming a norm amongst Nigerian politicians.\"\n\n\u201cWe challenge the former governor to mention at least three of his classmates while in the Law school to clear the air and stop embarrassing the prestigious members of the Nigerian Bar Association,\u201d another top source said.\n\nEarlier, SaharaReporters reported how Adamu, who served as governor of Nasarawa between 1999 and 2007 was in March 2010 arraigned by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) at the Federal High Court in Lafia.\n\nThe EFCC had instituted N15 billion fraud allegations against Adamu and others.\n\nThe EFCC said Adamu was arrested over the fraudulent award of contracts mostly on capital projects during his eight-year rule as governor of Nasarawa.\n\nThe former governor and his co-accused, however, filed a motion countering the charges on the grounds that since the funds alleged to be embezzled belonged to the state, the EFCC was out of line in its investigation. The defendants also pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nBut the then presiding judge, David Okorowa, ruled that Adamu would stand trial as he had a case to answer.\n\nIn 2013, the senator and other defendants filed a suit at the Court of Appeal, challenging the decision of the lower court.\n\nIn 2018, Adamu claimed the EFCC had dusted his file on alleged case of corruption since 2016.\n\nIn the same year, his son was arrested alongside one Felix Onyeabo by the anti-graft agency for allegedly getting a contract with forged documents.\n\nJustice J. K. Daggard of the Federal High Court sitting in Kano on February 7, 2018, granted Nuraini Adamu and Onyeabo bail in the sum of N8 million each and two sureties in like sum.\n\nThe defendants were arraigned on January 17, 2018, on 5 counts of money laundering.\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerians on social media have reacted to the withdrawal of some of the candidates from the race and subsequent emergence of the \u2018preferred\u2019 candidates at the APC National Convention.\n\nA tweep @mosky101 wrote, \"People traveled to Abuja for nothing only to hear the names of preferred candidates #APCNationalConvention what a shame.\u201d",

          "text": "A former Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun, says she was very ashamed and couldn't work for over three months during the National Youth Service Corps certificate saga.\n\nIn 2018, an exclusive report by Premium Times revealed how Adeosun did not participate in the mandatory one-year national youth service scheme but rather forged an exemption certificate many years after graduation.\n\nThree years after this, Taiwo Taiwo, a judge at the court in Abuja granted a declaration that Adeosun cannot be subjected to any penalty or forfeiture in relation to her occupation or assumption due to her NYSC certificate.\n\nReacting at the time, Adeosun said the ruling of the Federal High Court that she could serve without the certificate of the National Youth Service Corps has vindicated her.\n\nHowever, speaking on her experience at the time, Adeosun said she cried for three months and was unable to do any work.\n\nSpeaking at the 10th anniversary of the Uncommon Woman Conference organised by the Jesus House Church, United Kingdom, Adeosun explained that she felt like she was in a horrible pit.\n\nShe said, \u201cThat period of life was tough for me. I went to step into the shoes of someone like Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. So, I was under fire from day one, it looked like things were not working. Then all of a sudden, the economy started to improve. It was like I was beginning to see the desired result. Then out of nowhere, the certificate scandal came. And before I knew it, everything turned upside down. And that was how the issue went viral.\u201d\n\nAdeosun said it was sad that she was unable to tell her side of the story and had to resign when she could no longer bear it.\n\nThe former minister said, \u201cI was born and raised in the United Kingdom; indeed, my parental family home remains in London. My visits to Nigeria up until the age of 34 were holidays, with visas obtained in my UK passport. When I finished school, there was no opportunity for dual citizenship; I either renounce my British citizenship or hold on to it and work here. I didn\u2019t renounce mine. I finished school at 21 and started working at 22.\n\n\u201cI obtained my first Nigerian passport at the age of 34 and when I relocated, there was debate as to whether the NYSC law applied to me. Upon enquiry as to my status relating to the NYSC, I was informed that due to my residency history and having exceeded the age of 30, I was exempted from the requirement to serve. Until recent events, that remained my understanding.\n\n\u201cOn the basis of that advice and with the guidance and assistance of those I thought were trusted associates, the NYSC was approached for documentary proof of status. I then received the certificate in question. Having never worked in the NYSC, visited the premises, been privy to or familiar with their operations, I had no reason to suspect that the certificate was anything but genuine.\n\n\u201cIndeed, I presented that certificate at the 2011 Ogun State House of Assembly and in 2015 for the Department of State Services clearance as well as to the National Assembly for screening. I sought legal advice and there was no problem I could get an exemption for the NYSC.\n\n\u201cI was so ashamed at that time because I was into teenagers\u2019 mentoring and all of that. So, the experience negated the lessons I had taught my teenagers. I cried every day for three months; I didn\u2019t do anything for anyone or myself for those months. I just cried, cried, and cried.\n\n\u201cI thought I would feel better when I got vindicated by the court but I still wasn\u2019t happy. The court cleared my name three years later but it took another time of counselling and therapy before I felt better.\n\n\u201cIt was thereafter I forged ahead with life and started my charity work.\"",

          "text": "Waziri Adio, former executive secretary of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), says oil theft is not the only reason for the underperformance of the petroleum sector.\n\nNigeria has been recording low production and dwindling revenue in recent times and is unable to take advantage of the rising oil prices resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nOn Wednesday, a federal government team visited a site in Rivers state where they said oil theft was going on.\n\nTimipre Sylva, minister of state for petroleum, led the team that included Lucky Irabor, lt general and chief of defence, Mele Kyari, managing director of the Nigeria National Petroleum Company (NNPC), and Gbenga Komolafe, CEO of Nigeria Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWriting in his weekly column in THISDAY on Sunday, Adio commended government for \u201cseeming\u201d to finally take the issue more seriously, noting that \u201cthe increasingly audacious and humongous theft of crude oil and refined products poses a multiplicity of threats to oil companies and all tiers of governments, to the environment, to the livelihoods of citizens and communities, and, mostly importantly, to national security\u201d.\n\nHowever, he said \u201cit is important to go beyond clever soundbites and photo-ops. It will also be necessary not to return to the same measures that have proven grossly ineffective over the time, and not to succumb to schemes designed merely to take advantage of the situation\u201d.\n\nAdio, who presided over NIETI between 2016 and 2021, said it is critical to get the accurate figures of the theft as a starting point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere have been screaming headlines and viral tweets that between 80% and 95% of Nigeria\u2019s crude oil is lost to oil thieves. This cannot be true. Anyone with little familiarity with the sector, and this should include most Nigerians, should question the figures being touted,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s oil production figures can easily be accessed locally and internationally. Our oil production, minus condensates, has hovered between 1.2 million and 1.4 million barrels per day for some time now, due to reduced OPEC quota and other factors.\n\n\u201cAs low as they are, these figures do not represent 20% or 5% of our daily production. Even if we put Nigeria\u2019s daily oil production at one million barrels, saying the country is losing between 80% to 95% of its oil production will suggest that Nigeria is producing between five million and 20 million barrels of crude oil per day. That would be nice but it is simply not true. Our record daily production till date remains 2.7 million barrels, and that record was set in 2005.\n\n\u201cAnother way of looking at the figures being bandied will be to say we are actually producing between 1.2 million and 1.4 million barrels per day but losing between 80% to 95% of these to oil thieves. This would mean that the thieves leave between 60, 000 barrels and 280, 000 barrels per day for the oil companies and the Federation to share after carting away between 80% and 95% of oil production. This is simply implausible. Given that the Federation gets about 30% of oil produced, are they suggesting that the Federation now gets only between 18, 000 barrels and 84, 000 barrels of crude oil per day?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said as serious as the issue of oil theft is, \u201cwe don\u2019t need to sex up the numbers or encourage misrepresentation\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that some misreporting or misrepresentation is going on here, and those with the responsibility to provide clarity are looking away for less than noble reasons,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cSurely, issues have different gestation periods. Now that oil theft has finally got our attention, it is important we go beyond just putting up appearances, making a grand show of destroying illegal refineries as if that is all there is to oil theft, devising schemes to further milk the state, and presenting oil theft as the sole reason for the decline in oil production and revenue.\n\n\u201cWe have no option but to tackle oil theft. It has become an existential challenge. But we need to address this in a comprehensive and strategic way, not in the usual impulsive and episodic manner. And in the little time left for oil, we need to pay serious attention to the many issues, including suboptimal decisions and choices, that have led to the underperformance of our hydrocarbon sector.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can read the full article here.",

          "text": "Waziri Adio, former executive secretary of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), says oil theft is not the only reason for the underperformance of the petroleum sector.\n\nNigeria has been recording low production and dwindling revenue in recent times and is unable to take advantage of the rising oil prices resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nOn Wednesday, a federal government team visited a site in Rivers state where they said oil theft was going on.\n\nTimipre Sylva, minister of state for petroleum, led the team that included Lucky Irabor, lt general and chief of defence, Mele Kyari, managing director of the Nigeria National Petroleum Company (NNPC), and Gbenga Komolafe, CEO of Nigeria Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWriting in his weekly column in THISDAY on Sunday, Adio commended government for \u201cseeming\u201d to finally take the issue more seriously, noting that \u201cthe increasingly audacious and humongous theft of crude oil and refined products poses a multiplicity of threats to oil companies and all tiers of governments, to the environment, to the livelihoods of citizens and communities, and, mostly importantly, to national security\u201d.\n\nHowever, he said \u201cit is important to go beyond clever soundbites and photo-ops. It will also be necessary not to return to the same measures that have proven grossly ineffective over the time, and not to succumb to schemes designed merely to take advantage of the situation\u201d.\n\nAdio, who presided over NIETI between 2016 and 2021, said it is critical to get the accurate figures of the theft as a starting point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere have been screaming headlines and viral tweets that between 80% and 95% of Nigeria\u2019s crude oil is lost to oil thieves. This cannot be true. Anyone with little familiarity with the sector, and this should include most Nigerians, should question the figures being touted,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s oil production figures can easily be accessed locally and internationally. Our oil production, minus condensates, has hovered between 1.2 million and 1.4 million barrels per day for some time now, due to reduced OPEC quota and other factors.\n\n\u201cAs low as they are, these figures do not represent 20% or 5% of our daily production. Even if we put Nigeria\u2019s daily oil production at one million barrels, saying the country is losing between 80% to 95% of its oil production will suggest that Nigeria is producing between five million and 20 million barrels of crude oil per day. That would be nice but it is simply not true. Our record daily production till date remains 2.7 million barrels, and that record was set in 2005.\n\n\u201cAnother way of looking at the figures being bandied will be to say we are actually producing between 1.2 million and 1.4 million barrels per day but losing between 80% to 95% of these to oil thieves. This would mean that the thieves leave between 60, 000 barrels and 280, 000 barrels per day for the oil companies and the Federation to share after carting away between 80% and 95% of oil production. This is simply implausible. Given that the Federation gets about 30% of oil produced, are they suggesting that the Federation now gets only between 18, 000 barrels and 84, 000 barrels of crude oil per day?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said as serious as the issue of oil theft is, \u201cwe don\u2019t need to sex up the numbers or encourage misrepresentation\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that some misreporting or misrepresentation is going on here, and those with the responsibility to provide clarity are looking away for less than noble reasons,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cSurely, issues have different gestation periods. Now that oil theft has finally got our attention, it is important we go beyond just putting up appearances, making a grand show of destroying illegal refineries as if that is all there is to oil theft, devising schemes to further milk the state, and presenting oil theft as the sole reason for the decline in oil production and revenue.\n\n\u201cWe have no option but to tackle oil theft. It has become an existential challenge. But we need to address this in a comprehensive and strategic way, not in the usual impulsive and episodic manner. And in the little time left for oil, we need to pay serious attention to the many issues, including suboptimal decisions and choices, that have led to the underperformance of our hydrocarbon sector.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can read the full article here.",

          "title": "Digital Nomads: The pastor turned tech bro",
          "text": "\u201cEven if I have the call of God, it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t have a career. I shouldn\u2019t have to rely on church offerings to survive. Here\u2019s where people have a problem with pastors: they believe that most pastors wait for tithes or offerings. But that\u2019s not me.\u201d\n\nWhen Jay*, a pastor-turned-data-scientist, was in his final year as a computer engineering student at the Oduduwa University in Osun state, Nigeria, he decided his final year project would focus on e-voting in Nigeria. \u201cBut that topic wasn\u2019t approved,\u201d he says. The reason, Jay says, was that the lecturers in charge, at the time, knew nothing about the applications of tech. \u201cThey told me to be realistic. This was 2018, mind you, but they said that tech wasn\u2019t that important in the country, and that I should research something else. I can\u2019t remember what I finally wrote about, but I know it had nothing to do with tech and its potential impact on our society.\u201d\n\nIf the impact of tech on voting would not be important in 2018, the year before Africa\u2019s most populous country conducted its last general elections, when would it ever be?\n\nFor Jay, this event pushed him towards putting his degree to good use and becoming an all-round tech bro. He doesn\u2019t think his lecturers meant any harm, but he believes their lack of knowledge on the impact of tech will have damning consequences on the students they teach.\n\nAlthough he\u2019d been studying computer engineering, Jay already had a first love: ministering. Born to a Muslim mother and Christian father, he believes he\u2019s been ordained by God to preach the gospel. \u201cMy father died early, so I had to live with my paternal grandmother, and that\u2019s where I got introduced to the word.\u201d\n\nFrom his university days, Jay had been working as a minister, teaching the bible under his own ministry. His only worry was how to make an income independent of the church\u2019s income. \u201cI knew I had to have a career outside ministering. The problem most people have with pastors is that a lot of us depend on the church\u2019s income. I didn\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\nSo, during his National Youth Service\u2014a mandatory 1\u2013year programme all Nigerians must participate in, in service of their country\u2014Jay branched out into tech. He developed design skills and worked as a graphics designer for 17 months before moving to another company to work as a user interface designer.\n\nMonths later, in 2020, Jay landed a hybrid role working as a data annotator for a US-based company that uses artificial intelligence to measure consumer needs.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering what a data annotator does, you\u2019re right to wonder. It\u2019s an unsung profession. \u201cAs a data annotator, my job is to collect and label data that the AIs will use to forecast how consumers will react to e-commerce products,\u201d Jay explains. \u201cFor example, we take the iPhone 13 and try to figure out its impact on users in the next few years.\u201d\n\nThink of data annotation as teaching or training a computer. Focus on AI increased significantly this decade with $77 billion getting invested in the sector, a 113% increase from 2020\u2019s $36 billion investment. In Africa, though, investment in the AI sector is low, accounting for only 3% of total startup investments. It\u2019s no surprise then that data annotators, whose work primarily focus on AI, are scarce on the continent.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t really hacked the importance of AI on the continent, and that\u2019s why there aren\u2019t many data annotators. Whenever I tell people about my job, there\u2019s a bit of scepticism and doubt. There are always questions about what I do, even from top professionals in the field.\u201d\n\nOn his experience with the job, Jay says he enjoys the process and hopes more Africans would get into the field. If there\u2019s any complaint he has, though, it\u2019s the pay gap between him and his non-Nigerian colleagues working for the same company. In the Nigerian context, the job pays fairly well, with Jay getting \u20a6250,000 ($600)/month plus benefits, including pension, HMO, and a work laptop. The benefits are the same with the company\u2019s non-Nigerian employees, except for one big difference.\n\n\u201cI know some of my US colleagues earn about \u20a62.5 million per month, even though we\u2019re doing the same job for the company.\u201d\n\nEven with the pay disparity, Jay is still pretty comfortable with his job. \u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing, and it helps me provide for my family without having to depend on the church\u2019s income.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his design, product, and data annotation skills, he\u2019s also learning software engineering to help him become an all-round tech bro.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not just doing this for me,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the same way I\u2019m teaching the word, I also want to teach tech, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m learning these skills.\u201d\n\nIn the near future, he hopes to bring more people to the altar of tech and preach to them the good news of how much tech can improve their lives.\n\n*Name has been changed to protect the owner\u2019s identity.\n\n\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech. A new episode drops every Wednesday. If you think your story fits the Digital Nomads bill, reach out to us here.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In an email circular that went out from Bento Africa\u2019s board of directors to the company\u2019s customers and partners on Wednesday evening, the board announced that Ebun Okubanjo will be taking \u201csome time off\u201d and handing over all people-related decisions to his co-founder and COO, Chidozie Okonkwo. Chidozie will lead people operations alongside the company\u2019s country directors.\n\nBento\u2019s board\u2019s decision comes a few days after TechCabal exposed the harrowing experiences of ex-employees of payroll startup Bento Africa and how Okubanjo had allegedly been the orchestrator of that through direct and indirect bullying, verbal abuse, and threats to employees.\n\nIn their email to Bento\u2019s customers and clients, the board condemned Ebun\u2019s initial reaction to the story, especially his tweets attacking the credibility of publication TechCabal.\n\n\u201cAs professional Investors and Operators, we were aghast at the defensive and escalatory first tweets of Ebun on the matter, which we quickly moved against. Our responsibility and charter is to the Company, not the founders we invest in,\u201d the board said in an email sent to all Bento employees, past and present.\n\nFurthermore, the board said that while Okubanjo is taking a back seat with immediate effect, an internal investigation into Bento\u2019s workplace culture has begun. It also announced that it would be reviewing Bento Africa\u2019s internal management practices and processes.\n\n\u201cWe are reviewing the HR and People practices and guidelines at Bento and will work with HR consultants and the company\u2019s in-house team to make sure that it is reflective of human values that drive sustainable performance,\u201d said the board in the email.\n\nThe board claimed to have \u201c\u2026ensured that the current team is safe and free to speak freely. We voided any NDA\u2019s that may have been in place and instructed Management to let the Team know they were free to speak to any journalist that contacted them.\u201d TechCabal reached out to current Bento Africa employees who confirmed that they had been granted permission to speak freely without worrying about consequences.\n\n\u201cI think not restricting us from talking to journalists and cancelling our NDAs is the right thing to do,\u201d said one of the 3 employees TechCabal reached out to for the expose.\u201d\n\nOkubanjo also published a personal apology to current and past employees of the company via his Medium page. In the post titled From ebun. With Love, Okubanjo admits to encouraging a work culture of \u201clong workdays and weeks\u201d and apologised for his abusive outbursts. He also confirmed the board\u2019s decision to appoint Chidozie to lead people operations at the company.\n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d Okubanjo writes. \u201cI have some work to do here and there is a lot of room for growth. It will [sic] be a lie if I say this is a switch I can make overnight, I would [sic] need to learn how to balance passion with empathy. I will step away from all people decisions in the company. Chidozie will take over along with our new Head of People \u2014 Her arrival could not have been more timely. The country leads will also be instrumental in helping shape a more humane people policy.\u201d\n\nIn a bid to repair broken bridges, the CEO also encouraged former and current employees who have \u201cfelt that fire that burns [sic] so hot when we are in the thick of it\u201d to reach out to him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in support of the way Ebun handled the situation, and we\u2019re currently running an internal investigation to quantify the scale of the damages his actions have brought to employees and the business,\u201d said board member and CEO at Zedcrest, Adedayo Hamza. \u201cWe\u2019re open to speaking to anyone about this process.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "\u201cBento took everything from me\u2014my sense of humanity, sanity, confidence, and trust,\u201d Pascal*, an ex-sales executive at Nigerian payroll startup Bento Africa, said about his time working there. \u201cWe worked around the clock. Ebun [CEO and co-founder of the company] would send you messages by 2 AM and expect a response asap. No rest. We went to bed every night praying our jobs would still be there when we woke up the next morning.\u201d\n\nOn March 18, 2021, Pascal\u2019s prayer, which had seemed to work for over a year, stopped working. He was abruptly fired from his job. He fell into a depressive state, and everything stopped making sense. He stopped going out, and his relationships with friends and family suffered. Even though he said working at Bento for over a year had been torture, it was all he had at the time.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng) is the brainchild of Ebun Okubanjo and Chidozie Okonkwo, his friend, business partner, and Bento\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO). Headquartered in Lagos, Nigeria, Bento provides payroll management software to 900 businesses, including Hygeia, Paystack, Kobo360, Branch, and LORI Systems.\n\nOkubanjo and Okonkwo built, and still run, multiple businesses together. While both co-founders flock together, they aren\u2019t quite of the same feather. All ex-employees who spoke to us described Okubanjo as fire and Okonkwo as neither water nor fire; Okonkwo simply remains in the background, silent and rarely engaged in the company\u2019s day-to-day operations. These ex-employees therefore believe that Okonkwo\u2019s attitude outsources all authority to Okubanjo and enables his toxicity.\n\nIn Okubanjo\u2019s termination email to Pascal, he was fired because of a \u201clack of cultural fit and poor performance\u201d. But Pascal wondered: \u201cHow could I have been culturally unfit and incompetent after working for you for over a year? Why did it take you that long to clock my incompetence?\u201d\n\nOkubanjo\u2019s email terminating Pascal\u2019s contract\n\nThe termination letter\n\nHe said, despite the daily verbal assaults he endured in the hands of Okubanjo, all he wanted to do was to be the best salesperson in the company and make his employer proud. He hadn\u2019t done much work in sales prior to Bento, so he put in the work. Within 5 months, according to him, he had the second-highest number of clients on their sheets at the time. He closed some of the biggest clients\u2014some of them with over 1,000 employees and a monthly payroll worth \u20a615\u2013\u20a620 million (~$47,000).\n\nDespite his achievements, however, Pascal did not succeed in making his boss proud. \u201cThere was no free day from Ebun\u2019s verbal abuse. If he wasn\u2019t calling me a useless person, he was threatening to beat me up,\u201d Pascal said. At some point, while recounting his experience to TechCabal, he paused to catch his breath.\n\nPascal described his time at Bento as the darkest period of his life.\n\nPascal narrated how employees would weep during the sales team\u2019s check-in call at 8 AM every weekday. Okubanjo harshly criticised their work and threatened to fire them all at these meetings.\n\nEzekiel*, who had worked with the company\u2019s growth marketing team, shared his experience with TechCabal. He had joined one of the sales calls and heard Okubanjo calling them \u201cpussies and deadweights\u201d. He also heard Okubanjo tell the team that they smelled. \u201cEven though he never attacked me personally,\u201d Ezekiel said, \u201cI always wondered how anybody could go through that every morning and remain sane.\u201d\n\nBento Africa\u2019s cofounders: Ebun Okubanjo (left) and Chidozie Okonkwo (right)\n\nEx-employees also revealed gaps in Bento\u2019s employment contract, specifically where leave days and time off were concerned. Okubanjo promised employees that they could take time off when they needed it, but Bola*, another ex-employee from the company\u2019s sales team, dispelled that promise as a myth.\n\n\u201cI can count on one hand how many people took leave during my stay there. Ebun said breaks are for pussies and fuckers, and whoever takes time out of the office for a whole week is a weak member of the team and not needed in the organisation,\u201d said Bola.\n\n\u201cEbun scarred me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have spent money on therapy, yet, I still suffer from anxiety.\u201d\n\nIn her early days at the startup, Bola asked a lot of people to come work with her at Bento. At that time, she was ignorant of Okubanjo\u2019s \u201cterrifying personality\u201d. \u201cHad I known about it, I wouldn\u2019t have asked anybody to join Bento. Now, when a prospective Bento employee reaches out to me, I just tell them to run!\u201d\n\nAccording to the sources we spoke to, Okubanjo rarely welcomed alternative opinions and monopolised making key business decisions; the punishment for criticising his ideas was immediate termination of employment. For a number of Bento ex-employees, termination simply entailed deactivated Slack accounts and emails.\n\nTinu*, who had been poached from another company to come join Bento, woke up one day and found out she\u2019d been fired and logged out of her Slack and work email. She\u2019d only been with the company as Communication Lead for less than 3 weeks.\n\n\u201cIt was a nerve-wracking experience and the worst 5 months of my adult life,\u201d said Amaka*, who was excited to join a tech startup in Nigeria after finishing her studies in the US. She was fired after enduring Okubanjo\u2019s insults and unwarranted comments about her body.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a plus-size woman and Okubanjo would always have opinions about my dressing. He once told me to stop wearing dresses, that I need to wear jackets, trouser and suit all the time (presumably to cover my breast) after his girlfriend Alice commented that she liked my breast. What did I wear? Regular dresses that even my mother approved of.\u201d\n\nAmaka likened the day she was fired to a scene out of a movie. \u201cWe were on a sales call, and Ebun kept saying I wasted company resources while bringing in zero value.\u201d Okubanjo accused her of charging her personal Bolt ride on the company\u2019s debit card, unaware that Amaka had stopped using the card entirely and even ran the company\u2019s errands with her own car.\n\nFollowing Okubanjo\u2019s accusation, Amaka asked that the card be audited to ascertain whether she had indeed been wasting the company\u2019s money. Okubanjo checked the card and discovered that she hadn\u2019t been using the card for personal expenses. Rather than apologise to her, he changed tack and started accusing her of not working.\n\n\u201cHe called me useless and told me to f*ck off from the call. Next thing I knew, my colleagues were texting to inform me that he\u2019d fired me after I dropped off the call.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, when Kunle*, a lead engineer who worked for the company for over 2 years, was fired last November, he only found out about it when he couldn\u2019t access his Slack and work email the next morning. \u201cEbun fired me because he felt like I was trying to wrest authority from him,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo announcing on the company\u2019s slack after firing Kunle\n\n\u201cLeave Ebun, that man can literally kill you and brag about it. He\u2019s that vindictive,\u201d Ezekiel had mentioned while speaking to TechCabal. Ada*, another ex-staff, had also specifically declined to speak to us because she was worried about her safety, fearing that her former employer, could hurt her.\n\nIn the images above, Okubanjo referred to himself as Marlo Stanfield on Bento\u2019s Slack. Who is that, you may ask?\n\nMarlo Stanfield is a fictional character on the HBO television drama The Wire. He is a young, ambitious, intelligent, and ruthless gangster. In the drama series, Stanfield demanded unconditional respect, which superseded all other concerns. He was murderously narcissistic, and frequently ordered the deaths of those who disrespected or undermined him. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked him number 2 on their list of \u201c40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\u201d.\n\nThe day before Kunle was fired, the company\u2019s CTO Lede Adeniyi was on leave, so Kunle stepped up to lead the engineering team. Kunle recalled that one of the account executives had told him that a customer wanted a feature that was not in Bento\u2019s product roadmap for the year. Kunle said he explained to the executive that the company had prioritised other fixes and features for the year and would include the requested feature on their first sprint in 2022. He, however, suggested that if the customer wanted the feature added quickly, he could talk to Okubanjo.\n\n\u201cI referred the executive to Ebun because Ebun had already accused me, previously, of setting priorities behind him. But even that was a crime,\u201d said Kunle. The executive went to Okubanjo with their request, as Kunle had suggested, and all hell broke loose.\n\n\u201cI remember how Ebun came to shout at me: \u2018Hey motherfucker, what did you say to a customer about their ask?\u2019 He shut me up before I could even answer and called me names, which was normal. I was his usual point of reference whenever he wanted to benchmark weaknesses and redundancy in the team. Imagine being disrespected in front of your team members every day.\u201d\n\nNow, before the November firing, Okubanjo had fired Kunle once before. It happened on a trip to Ghana. Kunle had asked Okubanjo to stop calling him a monkey. Okubanjo responded to that by firing him on the spot. \u201cHe told me to find my way back to Nigeria, and that he didn\u2019t care how I did it.\u201d But then, he called Kunle after a few hours to give him his job back, knowing he needed him to sort out the business operations they had come for in Ghana.\n\nOn November 22, when Okunbanjo fired Kunle for the second and final time, he refused to pay his November salary and severance pay. Kunle reached out to Adeniyi, the CTO, to help him speak to Okubanjo about his owed payments, but Adeniyi couldn\u2019t do anything about it. \u201cYou know Ebun does what he wants,\u201d Kunle recalled Adeniyi saying to him.\n\nWhen TechCabal reached out to Adeniyi for comment on the incident, he confirmed Kunle\u2019s report: \u201cYes, Kunle asked me to follow up with Ebun, which I did, and Ebun promised to pay him.\u201d It\u2019s been 4 months now and Okubanjo still hasn\u2019t paid Kunle.\n\nBut after Kunle got fired, it seemed his former boss wasn\u2019t done with him.\n\n\u201cLast month, just when my mental health was getting back in shape, Ebun popped up on my LinkedIn, offering me my old job back,\u201d Kunle said. \u201cI declined. Such effrontery! No form of apology. I haven\u2019t found a new job yet because I\u2019m scared of working in another Nigerian startup.\u201d\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo reached out to Kunle* 4 months after to offer him his job back\n\nKunle claimed that Ebun sacked his friend John*, a former member of Bento\u2019s design team, because John was talking a lot about web3 on social media. Okubanjo accused John of finding Bento \u201cless interesting\u201d. TechCabal reached out to John through Kunle but he hasn\u2019t replied.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give Okubanjo notice period when you\u2019re leaving the company. He\u2019d fire you and tell you off,\u201d Ezekiel said. \u201cWhen Ebun fires you, he tells you to watch how he\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t get a job anywhere else in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nTare Johnson, Bento\u2019s ex-accountant and financial analyst, believes this was why he couldn\u2019t find a job for 6 months after leaving Bento in August 2020. When Johnson joined Bento in February 2020, his contract stated that he was coming in to lead the finance team. He would later find out that there was no team, and that he would be leading himself while reporting to a \u201cnarcissistic boss\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was basically the only one handling all the company\u2019s finances. I was also doing clerical jobs and running errands like a personal assistant, which was confusing and not even remotely close to my job description,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cMy initial thought was, \u2018It\u2019s a startup and things move around a lot.\u2019 But I was wrong. This place was designed to break employees. Ebun abused me verbally, which is standard behaviour for him with employees. He\u2019d call me a motherfucker, dullard, and every vulgar word in the dictionary. He even insulted my family.\u201d\n\nJohnson, running a one-man finance team, was stuck in a mess he hadn\u2019t bargained for. The pandemic lockdown hit barely a month after he got the job, locking him into the job at a time when companies were laying people off and not hiring. So he stuck around and took all the verbal abuse Okubanjo hurled at him. After 5 months, he figured he was coping, until an event on Monday, August 17, 2020 made him resign without notice.\n\nThe WhatsApp conversation between Johnson and Okubanjo\n\nThat Monday, Johnson\u2014like he had done every morning\u2014shared the company\u2019s daily bank statements to Okubanjo and Okonkwo on WhatsApp. Upon receiving them, Okubanjo replied with: \u201cBro, are you drunk???\u201d Johnson thought he must have made a mistake somewhere on the statements, so he quickly double-checked before re-sharing the statements with Bento\u2019s founding team. Okubanjo was still not satisfied with the statements. Apparently, some recent transaction hadn\u2019t reflected yet in the company\u2019s account at the time Johnson compiled the statement; there was no way Johnson could have included it in his report. But Okubanjo, \u201cin his usual fashion\u201d, asked Johnson to fix the spreadsheet or he\u2019d fire him. Finally fed up, Johnson resigned with a simple message: \u201cNo need, I quit\u201d and exited the WhatsApp group. An hour later, he sent in his resignation letter.\n\nFor Johnson, joining Bento Africa was \u201ca bad idea\u201d and leaving \u201cthe best thing he\u2019d ever done for himself\u201d.\n\nWhy were Okubanjo\u2019s red flags ignored?\n\nSome of the ex-employees said Okubanjo\u2019s ruthless leadership style was obvious from the first day they met him. \u201cThe day I met him for my interview, he told me he could read poverty all over my face,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cOn the first day we met,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cI witnessed an altercation that ended with Ebun threatening to punch a stranger in the face.\u201d\n\nAmaka, on her part, said she recognised Okubanjo from a video that had gone viral a year before, where he was in a heated argument with a female customer of Fitness Central, a gym he co-founded with Okonkwo. In the video, Okunbanjo\u2019s threatening personality was evident and on full-display.\n\nSo, why did these former Bento staff accept to work for the company after seeing these red flags from the CEO?\n\n\u201cI felt bad, but what could I do? I needed the job. I was just coming off the HNG Internship,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cThe money was good, for someone who hadn\u2019t even done the mandatory, one-year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC),\u201d said Amaka.\n\n\u201cI had already stayed about 7 months without a job, after NYSC, and was even planning to go back home [which is outside Lagos] when the job came. So, it was my best option at the time,\u201d said Adanma*, a former employee of the company.\n\nCulture shock after leaving Bento\n\nFormer employees who spoke to TechCabal confessed to experiencing culture shock at their subsequent jobs.\n\nAdanma \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe it when my current boss asked for my opinion on things. \u201cFor the first few months [at my current job], I was too scared to voice an opinion at meetings, for fear of being called stupid.\u201d\n\nBola \u201cwas surprised when my current boss said switching off Slack notifications is good to reduce anxiety, and that we should all try it.\u201d\n\nAccording to McKinsey, hundreds of experiments show that encounters with rude, insulting, and demeaning people undermine workers\u2019 performance, including their decision-making skills, productivity, creativity, and willingness to work harder and help coworkers.\n\nOkubanjo often claims that Bento is \u201ca mission and not a company\u201d hence his iron-fist leadership.\n\nBento is still toxic\n\nThree current Bento employees contacted by TechCabal were diplomatic about their responses, but they agreed that everything this publication has unearthed about Bento Africa\u2019s work culture \u201cis not false\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne minute it\u2019s silence; the next it\u2019s chaos. It\u2019s unstable here, and the pressure is too much,\u201d one of them said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really bothered,\u201d the second employee said. \u201cMy former place of work was also toxic, so I\u2019m kinda used to it. At this point, I think all startups are the same.\u201d\n\nThe third employee wouldn\u2019t \u201cdeny that Bento can be toxic for some people but not in my personal experience. We work very hard, and we play harder. Most people on the team love their jobs. It\u2019s not for everyone, really.\u201d\n\nWhile several ex-Bento employees agree that the company has a great and important product, they believe both founders in charge of the startup are unfit for their roles. The company\u2019s Glassdoor reviews tell more stories of its unconducive work culture.\n\nIn December last year, Bento expanded into Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, with plans to set up operations in 6 other markets\u2014Egypt, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, Angola, and Ethiopia\u2014by the end of this year. The company also leveraged the influence of music veteran and record label boss Don Jazzy to push a campaign supporting the African entrepreneurship spirit\u2014a campaign that arguably boosted its pan-African brand equity. These strides mean that the company is growing to a stage where its apparent lack of structure, process, and attention to employee welfare can no longer be ignored.\n\nTechCabal reached out to Okubanjo and Okonkwo for comments. Okonkwo didn\u2019t respond, but Okubanjo did. In his response, he called our then-developing story \u201cfiction\u201d and posted our email request to Twitter, claiming our article was a \u201chit job\u201d. He has followed his tweets with a series of abusive personal messages to members of the TechCabal team.\n\nEbun Okubanjo posted our email request on Twitter, he has since deleted the tweet.\n\nWhile Johnson, Bola, Amaka, Kunle, Ezekiel, Adanma, and others still scared to speak up have licked their wounds and moved on, Pascal\u2019s family refuses to let the abuse he suffered at Bento slide. They have sued Okubanjo. \u201cI just want him to rescind the lies he told in the termination email to me, I have all the evidence to prove he lied,\u201d Pascal said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: * Besides Tare Johnson who specifically asked not to be anonymous, other names have been changed to protect the identities of those involved. Furthermore, two current members of Big Cabal Media\u2019s team were former employees at Bento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng).\n\nUpdate: Amaka\u2019s account on Okubanjo\u2019s comment about her dressing was updated at 12:30 AM on March 22, 2020.\n\nUpdate: Tangerine Africa was removed from the Bento\u2019s client lists because the company said they have only provided insurance to Bento clients in the past, but never been a client themselves. This update was done 1:20 PM on March 23, 2022.\n\nTechCabal is working on a follow-up story exploring hostile work culture in African startups.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a 9-5er with great colleagues who own cars, you are probably already familiar with the concept of hitching a ride. Let\u2019s say your office is in Ikeja, you live in Surulere, and your colleague who also lives in Surulere has a car. So, you tend to get a ride with them, sometimes paying for fuel, saving you quite a bit of money that you\u2019d have spent on transport.\n\nBut what if you could hitch a ride with a stranger going in the same direction? Doesn\u2019t sound too safe, right? Especially if you\u2019ve been following the recent news on social media about insecurity on some ride-hailing and even government-owned transport systems.\n\nWell, Laolu Onifade thinks he might have found a sweet spot with his newly launched ride-sharing startup, Hytch.\n\nBut what does Hytch do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaolu Onifade, Hytch Founder\n\nAccording to Onifade, Hytch connects car owners and passengers going in the same direction. Using our earlier example, say you\u2019re trying to get to Berger from Surulere, all you have to do is launch the app, find drivers within a 2-3km radius going in that direction and, voila, you\u2019ve \u201chytched\u201d a ride.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilar to the defunct GoMyWay, the ride is shared with three other riders going in the same direction, making the fare cheaper\n\nModelled after popular ride-hailing companies like Bolt and Uber, Hytch doesn\u2019t own any of the cars on the platform and only onboards drivers, with certain safety restrictions \u2014 which we\u2019ll get into later \u2014 built in to prevent mishaps.\n\nHytch takes a 15% commission off every ride and operates a cashless payment method. All users \u2014 drivers and passengers \u2014 have a wallet, so passengers are automatically debited the amount for the trip when it ends.\n\nThe idea for Hytch was birthed between 2019 and 2020, following Onifade\u2019s frustrations with ride-hailing platforms.\n\n\u201cI have encountered this problem myself moving around and with Uber being so expensive; I\u2019ve had this problem with Uber since 2019/2020. I noticed that Uber and Bolt were getting so expensive and I used to wonder, how about I just hitch a ride?\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t I just be in someone\u2019s car? Sometimes when I\u2019m in an Uber that\u2019s costing me say \u20a65,000, I don\u2019t mind sharing the ride with three other people in the back seat going in the same direction.\u201d\n\nRoping in his friends, Femi Omoniyi (CTO), Olawale Adeyeye (Chief Imagineer), and Kemdirim Akujobi (Product and Design Lead), they began building Hytch in 2021.\n\nAfter several months of beta testing, which saw them onboard 200 people, Hytch comes out of stealth mode today, with the app available on the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnsuring user safety\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week Friday, March 18, 2022, this tweet by twitterer, @_kimaura set Nigeria\u2019s Twitter streets ablaze.\n\nso guys, i got robbed on wednesday night at ikoyi by my bolt driver, he took my phone, my cards, my ID, all my money and savings, lemme tell you how it happened. I ordered a bolt ride going to lekki, after i got into the ride which was a heavily tinted car and we started \u2026 \u2014 KIMBORO\ud83c\udf3a\ud83c\udf51 (@_kimaura) March 18, 2022\n\n@_kimaura described being robbed by the Bolt driver who took her phone, debit cards, and IDs, among other things. Barely a month after the tragic death of Oluwabamise Ayanwole on a BRT in Lagos, it was enough to cause an uproar, with many people narrating various incidents.\n\nAnother Twitter user, @ade_IDD, narrated how she was almost kidnapped by a Bolt driver whose appearance was different from the picture on the platform. He told her that he was using his brother\u2019s account because his had been blocked.\n\nSo @Boltapp_ng i have strength today. I ordered a ride from school to my house yesterday Friday 18th of march and i got a driver. He came and i confirmed car type and number plate and i put my stuff in the car and he started the ride. \u2014 AdaUgo.\ud83e\udd84\u2728Busiswadede. \ud83e\udd75 (@ade_IDD) March 19, 2022\n\nThankfully, she got to safety, before anything untoward happened.\n\nIn a since-deleted tweet, another user, @shugadupri reported encountering the same driver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, while Bolt\u2019s support team acknowledged some complaints on Twitter, it is yet to release an official statement on the matter.\n\nTechpoint Africa asked Onifade how Hytch hopes to ensure user safety.\n\nOnifade explained that user safety is provided for both drivers and riders.\n\n\u201cFor drivers, we verify driver\u2019s licence. For riders, you have to take a picture at the moment. So that means, the same picture you take at the time that you are signing up is what the driver is going to use to recognise you. So you have to make sure you\u2019re taking an actual picture or else the driver is not going to pick you up.\n\n\u201cYou also have to put in your legal first and last name while signing up.\u201d\n\nTo ensure that it is an actual picture, Hytch has partnered with Nigerian digital compliance and security company, IdentityPass, plugging in an API that determines whether it is a human face.\n\nFor added security, the driver and rider are sent a pin which both users must confirm on the app before a trip commences. This could also prevent issues of drivers starting trips before arriving.\n\nLike other ride-hailing/ride-sharing companies, Hytch provides a panic button that enables users to alert family and friends when they are in danger.\n\nWhere a rider receives a streak of three bad ratings, they are automatically blocked from using the app, although they can be reinstated. The driver would have to reach out to get the account unblocked after an investigation is carried out.\n\nOnifade said there are currently plans to include National Identification Number (NIN) verification as a security measure; however, he agrees this could be limiting for users with no NIN.\n\nThere\u2019s still much for the startup to do with plans to eventually include interstate travel and as Onifade laughingly told Techpoint Africa, the ability to book a seat on a private jet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuidax, Africa founded cryptocurrency exchange, unveiled its brand ambassador on Tuesday, March 22, 2022.\n\nAfter giving his opening remarks, Buchi Okoro, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and co-founder, Quidax, briefly talked about the brand, what they do, and what they have achieved over the years.\n\nHe said that Quidax makes it easy for users to buy, sell, store and transfer cryptocurrencies.\u201d There is a lot of exclusion that happens because we are Nigerians, Africans.\u201d Crypto is the solution. Quidax was built to solve issues affecting accessing funds and transferring them easily for Africans.\n\nQuidax On CoinMarketcap\n\nOver the years, Quidax has grown to be one of the largest crypto exchanges in Africa and the first African exchange listed on CoinMarketCap. By May 2021 they had processed over 3.2 billion dollars in transactions in less than three years and were awarded Business Day\u2019s 2021 digital assets company of the year.\n\nNew Year, New Quidax\n\nBuchi mentioned that improvements are constantly made to their platform through customer feedback, with the new price alert feature on the platform being a notable example. Quidax has also found a way to engage users to learn crypto on its platform and recently launched Quidax academy to train crypto beginners.\n\nAnswering how secure the platform is, Buchi said they have a custody solution that includes fund insurance; every fund in Quidax is insured. Also, there is a 13-man team constantly working on securing the platform from attacks and a three-factor authentification (3FA) feature that helps to confirm the user\u2019s identity.\n\nQuidax and Don Jazzy\n\nBuchi said that they started the #TheQuidaxCall recently, aiming to help put crypto in front of more people. \u201cThe point is to help preach the gospel of crypto,\u201d he said.\n\nBuchi introduced Michael Collins Ajereh, professionally known as Don Jazzy as a new member and brand ambassador of the Quidax family.\n\nWhen asked why crypto and why he feels it is important, Don Jazzy said he tries his best to stay ahead of the curve and know what is next to avoid being left behind in a fast-moving world. He added that he wants to get more people into crypto as he believes it is the future.\n\nDon Jazzy, who started his crypto journey during the Covid19 pandemic in 2020, said he finds crypto relatively easy to use and transfer money to various world parts.\n\nDon Jazzy also expressed his opinions on Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and their many use cases. He sees NFTs becoming a thing in the music industry, and he highlighted the other use cases like property ownership in the metaverse.\n\nBuchi said their choice in selecting Don Jazzy was because he is very easy to relate to and approach, and he is genuinely interested in crypto.\n\nCalling it a match made in heaven, Buchi said, \u201cAt Quidax, we believe that learning crypto should actually be fun. Learning crypto should be something you can relate to, and Don Jazzy exemplifies and shows what it means to be a Quidaxian.\n\nAlso in attendance at the unveiling event were Uzo Awili, Quidax Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and CO-Founder, Morris Ebieroma, Quidax\u2019s Chief Information Officer (CIO) and CO-Founder, members of the Quidax staff; Miss Techy, Money Africa, members of the media, among others.\n\nQuidax is an African-founded cryptocurrency exchange that makes it easy for anyone to buy, sell, store and transfer cryptocurrencies.

Humla Ventures, Nabuboto, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot, and Pulse Africa founder Leonard Stiegeler also participated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaunched in 2019 by Romain Poirot-Lellig, CEO and Founder, the company\u2019s goal is to \u201cbring the informal economy into the formal economy,\u201d focusing on last-mile delivery, eCommerce (warehousing and fulfilment), and financial services.\n\nThe company claims that it has made significant progress in providing merchants with last-mile delivery and eCommerce fulfilment services.\n\nBy the end of 2022, they plan to launch a B2B lending marketplace to help merchants obtain financing. Also, Kwik will use the funds to acquire customers and finance operations in Ibadan, Kano, Port Harcourt, and Kaduna.\n\nAccording to the CEO, Kwik intends to increase the number of merchants on its platform from over 100,000 to 800,000 by the end of 2022.\n\nThe big question: How does the company hope to accomplish this in the face of competition? I mean, the company claims to have over 100,000 merchants since launching in 2019. So, with less than 200,000 merchants in over two years, what magic will it perform in nine months?\n\nWell, I\u2019m looking to expand my platforms organically, and maybe, I could become one of those 800,000 merchants.

The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) stated that disclosing the source of funds ensures that lenders are not engaging in financial crimes like money laundering, cybercrime, fraud and terrorist financing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new regulation was published on Monday, March 21, 2022, and requires digital lenders to obtain a licence from the country\u2019s monetary authority or cease operations by September 2022.\n\nTo begin operations in the country, digital lenders were previously only required to register their businesses without showing proof of funds.\n\nNow, the new law requires digital lenders to disclose all loan terms and fees, including interest rates and the total amount owed. They will also be required to obtain permission from the Central Bank of Kenya before changing their pricing models.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, they are also prohibited from sharing customer data with third parties, using threatening language, accessing or contacting their customers\u2019 phone contacts, and engaging in \u201cunconscionable debt collection tactics.\u201d\n\nWhat happens when digital lenders don\u2019t comply? Those who violate the regulations \u2014 like sharing loan defaulters\u2019 personal information with third parties \u2014 could face sanctions or licence revocation.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nThe Willie Lynch Letter: History or Hoax?\n\nLet\u2019s talk about ADHD.

          "title": "Desperate moments as politicians weigh options",
          "text": "Ahead of party primaries, which according to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)\u2019s released timetable start from April 4 to June 3, politicians are weighing their options in their current parties.\n\nBusinessDay Sunday gathered that following the outcome of the just concluded National Congress of the All Progressives Congress (APC), a lot of feathers were ruffled, which may lead to those who felt had-done-by to seek exit routes.\n\nSpeaking with our correspondent weekend, a member of the APC said the consensus option adopted by the party, particularly in the chairmanship category, generated a lot a bad blood.\n\n\u201cIt is true that the Convention is holding, the enmity created from the consensus arrangement will be difficult to heal. How can anybody justify a situation where the President just decided those he wanted to emerge as chairman and vice chairman, without listening to the advice of those who have been in the party for a very long time?\n\nThis is just convention, we have not even gotten to primaries. I can tell you for free; many people are not happy,\u201d the member who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.\n\nThe convention, which is a precursor to the conduct of primaries for candidates of the party, has a direct bearing on the fortunes of the party in the 2023 general election.\n\nThose who lost out in the consensus arrangement are said to be aggrieved that they were not carried along in the arrangement and said to be reconsidering their future in the APC ahead 2023.\n\nAfter a meeting by President Muhammadu Buhari with key stakeholders in the party, including governors and leaders of the National Assembly the APC agreed to adopt Senator Abdullahi Adamu, as consensus national chairmanship candidate.\n\nAdamu, who was until recently the chairman of the APC National Reconciliation Committee will be the third substantive National Chairman of the party, as he takes over from Adams Oshiomhole.\n\nSince Oshiomhole was sacked in June 2020, the party had been run by a 12-member caretaker committee led by the Yobe state Governor, Mai Mala Buni.\n\n\u201cIt seems the choice of Senator Abdullahi Adamu has thrown the party in deeper trouble,\u201d an observer said Saturday.\n\nSigns that the idea of a consensus may breed trouble surfaced some weeks ago when some groups warned the party against breaching existing accord by not allowing party members to participate in delegates primaries.\n\nThey say that all the aspirants need to agree on the consensus whereby all the aspirants would sign a written document to show they agree with the consensus.\n\nMeanwhile, observers say that Adamu and Nnamani\u2019s nomination could be a pointer that President Buhari is less concerned about pampering those who ushered in his emergence in 2015.\n\nThey noted that for President Buhari to nominate them, was an indication that he is not only for the CPC or the ACN blocs of the party but always trying to satisfy certain unseen interest.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that their nomination was a product of power-sharing and stylish imposition by the Aso rock cabal. You will see that the President suddenly becomes the chief marketing manager of Adamu immediately after he got back to Nigeria from the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cAnother thing Nigerians care less to understand is that Buhari would never do anything against the decision of some people with close links to him, either at party level or governance level. Adamu and Nnamani are close allies of these people,\u201d Kunle Okunola, political analyst, said.\n\nSpeaking further, Okunola said the decision to impose the duo on the party may be a calculated move ahead of the party\u2019s presidential primary next.\n\n\u201cBuhari would not want to go against the choice of these unseen forces because he knows that the two of them would play a key role in the emergence of both the presidential candidate of the APC and as well the winner of the presidential election in 2023,\u201d he added.\n\nSimilarly, the PDP on the other hand appears to be engulfed in similar trouble. Part of it is the inability of the party to zone its presidential ticket despite clamour in some quarters. Rather, the party is encouraging anyone interested to contest.\n\nLast year, some political leaders of the South East warned that it would be forced to vote against any political party that does not pick its presidential candidate from the region.\n\nIn the last few months, political leaders in the South East have insisted and warned that the region must be given a chance to rule in 2023 judging that it had not produced a president since the beginning of current dispensation in1999.\n\nThus, observers say that last week\u2019s declaration by Atiku Abubakar for the presidency may further complicate issues ahead of the party\u2019s presidential primaries in May.\n\nDespite his influence, Atiku has faced criticisms in some quarters over his decision to contest the presidency after several attempts, they urged him to drop his ambition and support a younger candidate.\n\nWhile urging his party to consider him during the Board of Trustees (BoT) meeting, Atiku had said: \u201cI am worried and you should be worried too that if we do not win, it means we will be in opposition again for the next eight years. By the next eight years, I don\u2019t know how many will be left in politics and it may even ultimately lead to the death of the party because people gravitate, particularly in developing countries, towards governments.\n\nOrdinary people naturally gravitate towards government. So this is a very, very crucial and historical moment in history, for our survival. I want you to think about it.\n\n\u201cWe are now at a crucial moment in this country. Many of you here, it is either we retire together or we move on together\u201d, he told the BoT members.\u201d\n\nThe declaration came when the PDP has not even made any pronouncement on whether to zone the slot of not. After his public announcement, Peter Obi, a former governor of Anambra State, who also was the running mate of Atiku in 2019, declared his intention to run for the presidency in Awka, Anambra State.\n\nRead also: Atiku declares for 2023 presidential race [FULL DECLARATION SPEECH]\n\nIn the last few months, leaders of the party across Nigeria have spoken in different tunes on the issue of zoning.\n\nLast week, the Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal says the party should give its presidential ticket to a candidate that can win the election, not minding what part of the country the candidate comes from.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m appealing to my party that we should be talking about how to win the election, not just zoning of where the President is coming from,\u201d Tambuwal said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cZoning was a deliberate action by the political class of this country midwifed by the government at the centre to address a particular concern, the June 12.\n\n\u201cHow come when we saw the advent of COVID-19, we were not applying HIV drugs to COVID-19? The power shift in 1999 was to the South-West to assuage a particular situation.\n\n\u201cGo back to the history of democracy in Nigeria. In 1979, NPN had Shagari, NPP had Azikiwe, UPN had Chief Awolowo, GNPP had Waziri Ibrahim and PRP had Aminu Kano.\n\n\u201cThere was no zoning. When you go to 1992/1993, SDP had Abiola, NRC had Bashir Tofa, and there was no zoning.\n\n\u201cThis is to show you that when you go back to our history, zoning has not been the main issue. The main issue is that political parties throw up candidates and Nigerians decide on who to elect president.\u201d\n\nThe governor noted that the president can come from wherever provided he has the capacity and competence to fix Nigeria of the moment, adding that the Nigeria of 1998 is different from the Nigeria of 2023.\n\nObservers says that Atiku see the coming general election as his last shot and would fight with his last blood, stressing that despite the challenge by younger politicians like Tambuwal, Saraki and Bala Muhammad he may likely emerge victorious at the primaries.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think the PDP is ready to zone the ticket to any region. Would that led to division? I don\u2019t see, I think there may be initial annoyance by the South East if they don\u2019t get the ticket, but in the long run it would be resolved.\n\n\u201cFor me, I think the PDP should work in accord and support any candidate now for them to defeat APC for now,\u201d Lanre Ogunyemi, public affairs analyst said.\n\nChristian Okeke, a Political Science lecturer at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka, said: \u201cUnderstanding that politics in our country is mainly and unfortunately driven by self-interest rather than national interest will clearly give a clue into what will happen among the national political elites in the coming days. It is this self-preservation that will push them into alignment and re-alignment as they rush into destinations where their bread is buttered the most.\n\nIt is sad that some of the negatively defining features of Nigerian politics right from independence have not given way for a more positive political participation in the country.\n\nIt is quite unfortunate that we still witness lack of internal party politics and dominance of money in politics.\n\n\u201cThese issues are going to shape outcomes of politicking within the dominant political parties as we approach the next general election.\u201d\n\nAccording to Okeke: \u201cAs expected, until the candidates for each of the major parties finally emerge, the politicians will keep moving from one party to another and making the much they can from the process. If you check well, the majority of members in APC were formerly in PDP, and some of the current members of the latter were in the former.\n\n\u201cThis kind of thing kills ideology, beauty and consistency in parties. Today, it is difficult to pin down what constitutes ideology of these parties. Actually, Nigeria is not showing leadership to other African countries in many fronts, including how to organise political parties to win elections.\u201d\n\nHe also faulted political parties of not having any worthy legacy for the younger generation.\n\n\u201cThe political class is not yet ready to bequeath decorum to upcoming politicians.\n\nInstead, they have sown the seed of chaos, discord, instability and gluttony, and those negatives have now become part of our political culture. It is very sad.\u201d\n\nPatrick Adewunmi, a political analyst, said that the likes of Tinubu, Atiku have plan B and C, being political strategists, adding that he does not see any of the two leading parties zoning their presidential slots.\n\n\u201cThe permutations thus far show clearly that mass defection is possible. I think neither of the two leading parties would come out and say they want to zone for now knowing the implication of such a decision. Atiku would get the PDP ticket I am sure of that and I don\u2019t see the party zoning,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Putin And The Corruption Of Power \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n\u201c I sat at the back of a man\u201d, wrote the great Russian writer, Leo Tolstoy \u201cchoking him and making him to carry my weight; yet, I assured him and I assured myself that I wish I could lighten his burden\u201d.\n\nWhy not climb down the man\u2019s back if you are indeed concerned about mitigating the suffering you have inflicted.\n\nIn all of the modern history of human conflict, there has not been a war more unjust and more anchored on the power dynamics of tyranny as this nauseating invasion.\n\nYet, there are some persons who continue to see this tyranny-let-loosed as a fallout of NATO\u2019s alleged promise not to expand eastward.\n\nWe are all creatures of emotions, we are as regulated by primordial instincts and idiosyncratic biases as by reason. This is why some folks can, in all honesty, attempt to defend such immoral and barbaric invasion. Miguel de Unamuno , the Spanish existentialist philosopher was right when he argued that reason is not man\u2019s towering crown but emotion. The man who philosophizes is a man of flesh and blood who feels more than he thinks. Reason and logic can never cause him to stray a hair\u2019s breath from his biases no matter the soundness of the logic or the strength of the facts.\n\nThere are despots who would have us believe that the era of an open society with its democratic ethos is over. They insist, blindly, that the pace of modern states cannot allow for democratic debates and consensus choices in running a nation. That democracy is inherently weak, time consuming and structurally unsustainable. That is what the Xis and Putins of this world would have us believe.\n\nIt was the great Scottish psychiatrist, R.D. Laing that warned us that the \u201crange and extent of the things that we think and do is limited by what we fail to notice. That because we fail to notice that we are failing to notice, there is little we can do to change, until we notice how failing to notice shapes our thoughts and deeds.\u201d\n\nThe danger of liberal democracies today is that inhabitants of the West are failing to notice that the freedom they presently enjoy and the democracy that underpins it, is in grave danger. They fail to see that democracy is a fragile thing and that the condition upon which God has given liberty to men, is eternal vigilance.\n\nTrump assaulted democracy from within and Putin is now attacking it from without and yet , there are good-natured people who would make case for both men. The argument today is that democracy and freedom are out of sync with the realities of modern states. At least, that is the unspoken creed of Xi and Putin and it is sad that some otherwise reasonable folks would strenuously attempt to justify such a brazen bare-faced invasion by a brute on any grounds even when the groundlessness of Putin\u2019s invasion yearns deeper than Grand Canyon. The West may not be as saintly as they claim but I tell you a truth : should the light of democracy be extinguished by the likes of Putin, mankind would spiral back to the Hobbesian state of nature where life was solitary, nasty, brutish and short.\n\nIt is sad to notice that were Hitler alive today and undergoing his monstrous pogrom, some folks would still make case for him: blame international Jewry for their perceived greed or America for some perceived mischievous globalization or the Poles for not willingly genuflecting before the German war machines.\n\n\u201cRemove law and justice,\u201d warned St. Augustine, \u201cand what are states but gangs of criminals on a large scale\u201d. It is fidelity to a set of moral code and decency that largely defines a civilised society. President Biden was on point when he described Putin as a thug: is anything more thuggish than sending armed mob into your neighbour\u2019s house without any provocation?\n\nThe point here is that America, for its faults and failings, remains the beacon of freedom, justice and opportunity for the world. It is only a fool that throws the baby away with the bath water. Democracy may not be the elixir that transforms base metals into gold, but it is definitely the best platform that guarantees that the light of justice, freedom , opportunity is not extinguished from the midst of men.\n\nDoes it not portend universal danger that one man could rally a military power like Russia into war?\n\nDoes it not bother a sane man that there are no institutions inside Russia that can checkmate or even mildly regulate Putin?\n\nShould one man possess such powers?\n\nIs it not indicative of tyranny and a failed system that one man should wield such powers?\n\nIt is only the most naive amongst us that would readily equate the West with total moral rightness. Frantz Fanon may have his points when he said that anytime he searches for man in the technique of the West , he sees only a succession of the negations of man and a avalanche of murders. However, the institutional guardrails of Western democracies are the best indicators of the survival of the human species.\n\nAbsolute power, said Woodrow Wilson, is what precedes the destruction of human liberty. Putin is pure, unadulterated evil and trying to defend him amounts to demons in search of logic and trying cosmos out of chaos.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nOsazuwa Osahon Daniels, Esq.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The infusion of $500 million in investment into the development of oil palm estates and plantations has given a new lease of life to the state\u2019s agricultural sector, leading to increased productivity and better livelihoods in the state.\n\nThis was disclosed by the Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, during a chat with journalists, noting that the reforms initiated by the state government have led to an improved business environment.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn agriculture, we have attracted almost $500 million investment into palm oil cultivation having allocated the first phase of 60,000 hectares of land under the Edo State Oil Palm Production Programme (ESOPP). Nigeria has not witnessed this scale of oil palm cultivation since independence.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe placed the people at the center of our politics, which led to huge investment in human capital development, particularly across all tiers of the state\u2019s education system, starting with the Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EdoBEST) programme, which has transformed the lives of over 400,000 pupils across the state and improved learning outcomes.\n\n\u201cThere has been a deliberate emphasis on strengthening partnership with the private sector, from which we have reaped the immense benefit.

          "title": "FG says it doesn\u2019t know exactly how much fuel Nigerians consume daily",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government has it has no exact knowledge of how much fuel Nigerians consume daily.\n\nMinister of state for petroleum resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, who stated this, said the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited had also agreed that the country could not tell the exact amount of petrol consumed on a daily basis.\n\nHe disclosed this in an interview with his media team, led by his Senior Adviser, Media and Communications, Horatius Egua, which was made available to PUNCH in Abuja on Friday.\n\nAsked to react to the N3tn fuel subsidy proposal by NNPC, amid concerns about the country\u2019s PMS consumption figure, Sylva replied, \u201cI would have preferred that this question be directed to the NNPC.\n\n\u201cI have made my views known about this issue in the past. NNPC has agreed with me that they are not certain about the exact consumption figure.\u201d\n\nHe said the truth was that if the country\u2019s petroleum products were smuggled outside the country, nobody could say what volume was involved today, tomorrow or next week, adding that NNPC could not say they know these figures.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more or less fueling a criminal economy. The NNPC imports the products, and nobody knows the exact destination of the products at the end of the day,\u201d Sylva stated.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe imported products come to Nigeria, and from there filters out of our borders to neighbouring countries.\n\n\u201cSo, as a country, we cannot tell the exact volume of petroleum products that we consume on a daily basis. All we have been doing is to assume the level of consumption over a period and work with that.\u201d\n\nHe, however, expressed belief that the NNPC probably had a better answer to this, stressing that \u201cpersonally, I dont.\n\n\u201cI have said this publicly before that I don\u2019t know the figure. When I assumed office, initially I was told that our daily consumption was 66 million litres.\n\n\u201cThen, when fuel prices increased from N145 to N162, the consumption figure temporarily fell to about 40 something million litres per day, because the arbitrage opportunity reduced,\u201d Sylva stated.\n\nHe added, \u201cThen the value of the naira dropped again, and the number went up again to over 60 million litres. I am told the figure sometimes rise to as high as 90 or over 100 million litres. I don\u2019t know how that happens.\n\n\u201cAt this rate, I have said if anyone is looking at a criminal enterprise, look no further than the fuel subsidy.\u201d\n\nThis, the minister said, was why he had continued to advocate the removal of fuel subsidy from the country\u2019s PMS pricing template and deregulate.\n\nAccording to him, President Muhammadu Buhari, had done everything to resolve the issue, including the closure of the country\u2019s borders with neighbouring countries, yet the criminality was not stopped.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that what the President could do was to close the \u2018formal\u2019 borders. What about the illegal routes?,\u201d Sylva asked.\n\nOn what could be done, the minister said if the subsidy component was taken out through deregulation, smuggling of PMS to neighbouring nations would cease.\n\n\u201cOf course, we need the market from there. But now we are punishing ourselves because every litre we import at our expense will always find its way outside the country,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe added, \u201cNow, the government is trying to subsidise our citizens so that our people will at least get the benefit of the subsidy on petroleum products.\n\n\u201cBut, now because of how our borders are, it is very difficult. Now, we are inadvertently subsidising the whole of Africa. This is the thing we cannot handle.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU! You need to login to view and post FB Comments!",

As of 12.30 pm , we could still hear gunshots at the airport,\u201d the source said.\n\nThere was no reaction from the police as of time of this report, even as journalists were told that fighting was still going on to repel the terrorists away at the airport .\n\nMeanwhile, Airport Manager, Mrs. Amina Ozi Salami, said no flight was stopped by the terrorists as two flights that departed the airport had long taken off before the terrorists started firing shots at the runway from the parameter fence.\n\n\u201cThe terrorists have their route behind the parameter fence and were always passing there\u201d, Salami said.\n\n\u201cOne of the security guards who was at runway 05 was hit by bullet from the terrorists on the head and he died on the way to hospital.\n\n\u201cAZMAN had long taken off at the time the bandits started shooting. In fact AZMAN may have forgotten that they came to Kaduna.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately on their way to hospital, the guard died.\n\n\u201cBehind the parameter fence is their route, they are always passing through that place.I don\u2019t know whether they wanted to come to the airport.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately they shot at the runway and their bullet hit the security guard on the head. But the two flights we had, had taken off.\n\n\u201cThere are military personnel in the airport and they gave it to the terrorists. They seized some of their motorcycles. The military succeeded in chasing them away.\u201d\n\nNAMA, last night, confirmed that gunmen killed the guard attached to the site of its very high frequency omni-directional range (VOR), a navigational aids equipment at the airport.\n\nManaging Director of NAMA, Matthew Pwajok, said the guard at the site of the navigational aids (Navaids), about one kilometer away from the runway, was killed, adding that the technical staff ran for safety after the guard was killed.\n\nPwajok said : \u201cIt\u2019s true, bandits attacked our Navaids site which is a kilometer away from the runway, they killed the watchman while the technical staff ran back, we alerted the military and they responded swiftly, the situation is now under control by the military, the few flights were able to take off afterwards\u201d.\n\nSamuel Aruwan, Commissioner, Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs, Kaduna State, also confirmed that troops repelled bandits who attacked the Kaduna airport.\n\nHe said in a statement, \u201cSecurity forces have reported that an attack by armed bandits was repelled in the vicinity of the Kaduna International Airport.\n\n\u201cTroops stationed within and around the airport responded and repelled the attackers.\n\n\u201cHowever, the bandits unfortunately shot and killed a staff member stationed at the perimeter fence who raised the alarm on sighting them.\n\n\u201cAirport operations resumed with scheduled flights departing after the incident.\n\n\u201cSecurity forces are conducting operations in the airport general area. Further updates will be communicated to the public.\n\n\u201cGovernor Nasir El-Rufa\u2019i commended the security forces for their prompt response to the attack, and for repelling the attackers.

          "text": "The minister of women affairs, Mrs. Pauline Tallen, and other female stakeholders in the country have called for the need to give women more chances to excel in government and politics, saying Nigerian women need to always be celebrated because they contribute to national development and stability of the nation.\n\nMrs. Tallen spoke yesterday in Abuja at the National Council for Women Societies (NCWS) special award ceremony and presentation of the book titled: Journey to Equity and Songs for Women, written by Dr. Gloria Shoda, the president of NCWS.\n\nAccording to the minister, Nigerian women should also be celebrated because they have contributed so much to the development of the nation and they have left their marks sands of time.\n\n\u201cWe still have great women that are still contributing their quota till this time in all phases of life, in sciences, arts, and other things. We must celebrate the women for that.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe must also celebrate the men in women and who support the struggle that women are contributing meaningfully to national development. As we do this, we will encourage more women to contribute to the development of the nation,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Gloria Shoda, president of NCWS, appealed to men in the House of Representatives to open the door for women, saying the five bills they threw out should be reconsidered.\n\n\u201cThat is the way to equity. We are born the same, we go to school together, so we should also do what the men have. In the private sector and other aspects, women are excelling, so we should also be allowed to excel in government and politics, so that is why we are seeking equity.

          "title": "Snakebite victims flood hospitals as cost of anti-venom drug soars",
          "text": "By Ephraims Sheyin\n\nVictims of snakebites are flooding treatment centers across the country as the scorching heat forces the reptiles out of their holes into bushes, farms, roads, and people\u2019s homes in search of fresh air.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that states\u2019 worst hit include Gombe, Plateau, Borno, Benue, Taraba, Nasarawa, and Bauchi, with herders, farmers, and rural dwellers mostly the victims.\n\nOur correspondents, who visited some snake treatment centers, found that most of the patients were on the floor with medics complaining that facilities were being overstretched.\n\nThe situation of the victims appeared worsened by the sharp rise in the cost of the usually imported Anti-Snake Venom (ASV), following the high cost of foreign exchange.\n\nWith a vial of the Echitab drugs \u2013 the brand of ASV that cures bites of snakes in Nigeria \u2013 going for more than 55,000, stakeholders have heightened calls on the Federal Government to support the Echitab Study Group in Nigeria to produce the vaccine locally to lower production cost.\n\nAt Snakebites Treatment and Research Centre, Kaltungo in Gombe State, Dr. Sulaiman Mohammed, its Principal Medical Officer, told NAN that about 300 patients had been admitted from January to date.\n\nHe attributed the sharp rise in the number of cases to the hot weather.\n\n\u201cThe heat is at its peak; this period is usually the peak season of snakebites,\u201d he told NAN.\n\nHe said that some were treated and discharged while four deaths had been recorded.\n\nGiving a breakdown, he said that 69 patients were admitted in January while 79 came in February.\n\nAccording to him, more than 135 have been admitted in March with the figures increasing by the day.\n\n\u201cThe figures are usually high in March which is the onset of the rainy season; on the average, we receive a daily average of nine victims or more.\u201d\n\nHe said that the victims were mostly peasant farmers and cattle rearers because \u201cthey normally enter bushy areas\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, most of the patients come from the North-Eastern States to access the treatment.\n\nHe explained that most of the victims were bitten by carpet vipers, \u201cthe snake that bites without warning; once you are close it, it will strike\u201d.\n\n\u201cOther snakes like puff adder and cobra will show you the sign and will not bite unless provoked. If you are smart, you leave the place quickly,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe said the center currently has some ASV supplied to it by the North East Development Commission (NEDC).\n\n\u201cWe received 2,000 vials from NEDC which we give free to patients. It should last for some time.\n\n\u201cLast year a vial was N40,000. It is far beyond that now,\u201d he said.\n\nHe listed some of the challenges the center was confronted with, including inadequate manpower as the number of patients far outnumber the staff strength.\n\nAnother challenge was the late arrival of patients for medical attention.\n\n\u201cSome victims spend days at home taking herbs and only remember the hospital when the condition becomes critical. Most times they arrive too late as the venom would have gone deep into the system.\n\n\u201cSuch patients take a considerable number of ASV vials unlike those that come early that may require just one or two vials.\n\n\u201cOnce the patient comes early, especially the very day he was bitten, he will get better within five days and be discharged.\n\n\u201cIf a person bitten by a snake, especially a carpet viper, decides to stay at home for some days before coming to the hospital, blood will be coming out in all the openings in his body.\n\n\u201cIf he comes late, besides the ASV, he will definitely need blood and the cost of taking care of such patients will be much,\u201d he said.\n\nHe regretted that herbalists, who know that herbs will not work, still keep the ignorant victims just to exploit them\n\nHe appealed to rural dwellers, especially farmers and herders, to always wear rain boots and hand gloves to protect themselves against snakebites.\n\n\u201cSuch precautions will reduce the high incidences of snakebite and save them the cost of medical bills,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammed emphasized the need for local production of ASV.\n\n\u201cThe Echitab drug is produced in England and Costa Rica after the venom is extracted from the snakes here. We can transfer that technology here and produce the drug locally.\n\n\u201cIf we can do that, the drug will be cheaper. We have the raw materials, we can do it,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the Zamko Comprehensive Medical Centre, a specialist snakebite treatment centre in Langtang, Plateau State, NAN met a similar situation of rising cases of snakebites.\n\nAt the rural medical outfit owned by the Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH) Dr. Nyam Azi, a medical officer, told NAN that a vial of ASV, that cost between N23,000 and N25,000 in 2021, had risen to N50,000 or even more.\n\n\u201cThe price of ASV is almost double its former cost owing to the rise in dollar rates and scarcity.\n\n\u201cConsidering that it is peasants that are mostly affected, N50,000 per vial is too heavy.\n\n\u201dIt is a hard situation, especially coming at a time when a high number of cases are being recorded.\u201d\n\nAzi revealed that the health facility records more than 20 cases per week and attributed the high figure to the heat season, usually one of the peak periods of snakebite cases in the area.\n\nHe said that victims came from Benue, Taraba, and Nasarawa States.\n\nThe physician lamented the current scarcity of the Echitab ASV which he said was so far the only proven vaccine for the species of snakes in Nigeria.\n\nHe added that the situation was worrisome as patients required four or more doses for standard treatment.\n\n\u201cThe standard dose a patient requires is four vials of polyvalent or one vial of monovalent, while some patients require even more,\u201d he said.\n\nAzi urged the government to resume subsidizing the ASV for victims to ease their suffering.\n\nHe urged the government and private organizations to train health workers in the treatment and management of snake bites to minimize mortality or limb loss.\n\nReacting to the situation, Prof. Abdulsalam Nasidi, Chairman, Echitab Study Group in Nigeria, said that a vial of ASV costs N55,000 and blamed that on the rising cost of foreign exchange.\n\n\u201cThis price will keep growing dependent on Naira fluctuations,\u201d he told NAN.\n\nHe, however, said that efforts toward local production of ASV had reached an advanced stage.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government is fully supportive of the efforts. The Federal Ministries of Health, Industry and Commerce, as well as the Central Bank of Nigeria, are working with us on the project.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government is encouraging self-sufficiency to save herders and farmers who are at highest risk,\u201d he said.\n\nHe acknowledged receipt of rising cases of snakebites at the treatment centers due to increasing heat but expressed satisfaction that all the treatment centers were functioning.\n\n\u201cThe cases have continued to rise because snakes are invading human habitats due to excessive heat.\n\n\u201cA major good news is that the number of deaths has decreased substantially when the ASV are available. But deaths do occur when snakebite victims report late or arrived when ASV is not available,\u201d he said.",
          "summary": "The situation of the victims appeared worsened by the sharp rise in the cost of the usually imported Anti-Snake Venom (ASV), following the high cost of foreign exchange.\n\u201cSuch precautions will reduce the high incidences of snakebite and save them the cost of medical bills,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe price of ASV is almost double its former cost owing to the rise in dollar rates and scarcity.\nAzi urged the government to resume subsidizing the ASV for victims to ease their suffering.\nBut deaths do occur when snakebite victims report late or arrived when ASV is not available,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Following his anticipation to emerge the consensus presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for 2023, former President Goodluck Jonathan has started rallying round his kinsmen in Ogbia Local Government Area (LGA) Bayelsa state.\n\nIt was gathered that part of his strategies was to get some of his kinsmen and political associates in support of his ambition in Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) into electoral offices in the forthcoming general election.\n\nJonathan was said to have carried out an audit of all aspirants in his council and decided to support persons he believed would easily defect with him to the APC at the appropriate time.\n\nClose sources said the former President was preparing his kinsmen for his new ambition having been promised a return to Aso Rock by a cabal at the Presidency working for a northern agenda.\n\n\u201cJonathan is working for his new ambition to return to Aso Rock as a President in 2023. He is using his position in Ogbia to call the shots of who will get the PDP\u2019s electoral tickets for various positions in Ogbia.\n\n\u201cHis intention is to select people, who will easily and willingly defect with him to the APC at the appropriate time. So, he is working against loyal PDP members, who are determined to win and remain in the party.\n\n\u201cBut Governor Douye Diri is playing into his hands. If Diri allows Jonathan to have his way, he will be the greatest loser because he will be alone to fight for his second term\u201d, the source, who craved anonymity said.\n\nJonathan was said to have settled for Prof. Edmund Allison-Oguru as his choice to fly the flag of PDP for the Ogbia Federal Constituency seat in the National Assembly.\n\nThe former President reportedly by-passed aspirants, who initially indicated interest for the constituency\u2019s ticket only to ask Oguru, who was not even in the picture to go and pick the expression of interest and nomination forms to contest the primary of the PDP schedule for May.\n\nTherefore, to protect his ambition, Jonathan was said to have settled for Allison-Oguru ahead of the current occupant of the position, Fred Obua; Local Government Chairman, Ebinyo Turner; a member of the House of Assembly, Chief Mietema Obodor and a former Commissioner, Daniel Iworiso-Markson.\n\nJonathan reportedly ruled out Obua because of the issue of zoning: Turner for immaturity and Obordor for having enjoyed his political patronage for a long time ahead of others.\n\nBut another close source said Jonathan believed he could only entrust his ambition on Allison-Oguru because of his long-standing relationship with him.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThis is the reason he is not even considering Iworiso-Markson. He believes that Iworiso-Markson will never defect with him to the APC. He knows that Iworiso-Markson will remain in PDP and that will be a big let down for him\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe former President has been thinking of the direction to take until recently when he was convinced by some stakeholders to choose Prof. Edmund Allison-Oguru. If you recall, it was Jonathan who nominated him as Secretary to the State Government in the first tenure of Senator Seriake Dickson\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cHe also recently nominated him to be among the members of the governing board of the University of Africa, Toru-Orua in Sagbama. So it is him that he has chosen\u201d.\n\nIt was further gathered that while Jonathan would discuss his choice for the House of Representatives with Governor Douye Diri next week. He had asked the Ogbia PDP caucus to meet on Monday to agree on Allison-Oguru as the consensus candidate.\n\nHowever, some of the stakeholders were concerned that if the PDP picked Allison-Oguru as its candidate, the party would lose the main election because of his unpopularity.\n\n\u201cWe will lose to any party if Allison-Oguru is our candidate. It is a huge joke for the former President to be insisting that we endorse him as our candidate. I mean this is why people like me are against it. Jonathan is blindfolded by his ambition. The earlier th governor knows this the better for him and for the PDP.\n\n\u201cThe man is not popular and we shouldn\u2019t make that kind of huge mistake. This is an election and not comedy. We need our very best and those on parade are worth winning election for us and not the Professor\u201d the stakeholder said.\n\nIt was gathered that for Bayelsa East Senatorial ticket zoned to Ogbia, Jonathan was in dilemma whether to settle for the Chief of Staff, Benson Agadaga or Rex-Jude Ogbuku, a lawyer and former Executive Secretary of Federal Character Commission, who recently defected to the PDP.",

The source at the Airport told our Correspondent that the bandits have vowed to shutdown the Airport.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cthe bandits attack started around 12:00am today (Saturday). They started attacking the Airport around the midnight. The bandits were alleging that the military personnel took away their cattle.\n\n\u201cThe military were able to repel them that midnight and we thought that was all. In fact, our staff resumed work this morning as usual. They worked around the runway five till around 12:00pm.\n\n\u201cThen, shortly after that, some NAMA staff went to check some of their equipment, then these people (bandits) appeared and started shooting. The NAMA engineers scampered for safety, they could not even go and enter the vehicle that took them to the site.\n\n\u201cIt was in the process that their security man was shot in the head. The security man was rushed to the hospital and he was confirmed dead.\n\n\u201cAs I am talking to you now, the military are still battling those guys, and they are proving difficult to be repelled. Now, they had shutdown the Airport,\u201d the source said.\n\nIt was however gathered that, many of the staff have already fled the Airport, while more military personnel have been deployed to the scene on clearance operation with a Armoured Personnel Carrier.\n\nHowever, at the time of filing this report, the Kaduna State Police Command\u2019s Public Relations Officer, ASP Muhammad Jalige, promised to get across to the DPO in charge of the area and get back to correspondents.",

The people have been deprived of water and food for two days,\u201d she wrote on Telegram, blasting Russian troops for \u201ccreating obstacles\u201d.\n\nAuthorities have said they fear some 300 civilians in Mariupol may have died in a Russian air strike on a theatre being used as a bomb shelter last week.\n\nIn Kharkiv, where local authorities reported 44 artillery strikes and 140 rocket assaults in a single day, residents were resigned to the incessant bombardments.\n\n\u2018Used to explosions\u2019\n\nAnna Kolinichenko, who lives in a three-room flat with her sister and brother-in-law, said they don\u2019t even bother to head down to the cellar when the sirens go off.\n\n\u201cIf a bomb drops, we\u2019re going to die anyway,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are getting a little used to explosions\u201d.\n\nArtillery attacks in the city of Brovary, easy of Kyiv, cost three lives, regional officials said in a statement, and a 19th century Orthodox church was destroyed.\n\nRussian forces have taken control of Slavutych, the town where workers at the Chernobyl nuclear plant live, briefly detaining the mayor, regional Ukrainian authorities said.\n\nResidents of the town protested, prompting the invading forces to fire shots in the air and lob stun grenades into the crowd.\n\nKyiv said it was shortening a planned 35-hour curfew to just Saturday 8:00 pm to Sunday 7:00 am, as Britain\u2019s defence ministry said Ukrainian counter-attacks were underway near the capital.\n\nUkrainian forces were also attempting to recapture Kherson, the only major city held by Russian invasion troops, a Pentagon official said.\n\nIn the face of unexpectedly fierce Ukrainian resistance, Russia\u2019s army has exhibited poor discipline and morale, suffering from faulty equipment and employing tactics sometimes involving brutality toward civilians, Western analysts say.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "Following the war between Russia and Ukraine, which is threatening the supply of gas to European countries by Russia, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr Timipre Sylva, has revealed that Nigeria is ready to offer its services as an alternative gas supplier to Europe.\n\nHe urged the European Union (EU) to increase investments in gas and hydrocarbons in Nigeria to enable the country to meet the bloc\u2019s energy needs.\n\nThis is coming as the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), has declared that the emergence of China as almost the sole destination for Nigeria\u2019s solid minerals resources export poses a risk to the country\u2019s economy.\n\nNEITI advised the federal government to develop a business relationship with other countries to reduce over-dependence on China.\n\nSylva spoke when he received a delegation led by the EU Ambassador to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Samuela Isopi on a courtesy call to his office in Abuja.\n\nThe minister\u2019s call comes on the heels of the festering war between Ukraine and Russia, which threatens gas supply to European countries.\n\nRussia currently supplies about 30-40 per cent of the EU\u2019s gas needs.\n\nIn a statement issued Saturday by his Senior Adviser \u2013 Media and Communications, Mr Horatius Egua, the minister said Nigeria was ready to step in as an alternative gas supplier to Europe, urging the EU to encourage its oil and gas companies such as Shell, Eni, and Total Energies to scale up investments in the Nigerian gas sector.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we warned against earlier was the speed with which the EU was taking away investments in fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cWe warned that the speed was faster than they were developing renewable energy. You can see now that what we were warning against is what is happening now,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe told the delegation that what stunted growth in the development of gas in Nigeria was the lack of fresh investments, and called for a change of attitude on the part of the EU if its requests to increase supplies to Europe would be realised.\n\nAccording to the minister, one of the biggest challenges the sector has is a lack of investments.\n\n\u201cIn the last 10 years, over $70 billion worth of investments came to Africa, but sadly less than $4 billion came to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSurprisingly, we are the biggest in Africa. If we cannot attract investments to Nigeria, you know where we are heading.\n\n\u201cYou have been our longtime friend. As of today, our gas reserve is one of the biggest in the world. We have a proven gas reserve of 206 tcf and if we focus on gas exploitation we can get up to 600 tcf.\n\n\u201cWe are already building gas infrastructure such as the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) pipeline project, expected to take gas to Algeria, and the West Africa Gas Pipeline project designed to take gas to Morocco,\u201d Sylva explained.\n\nThe minister further said that after the Russia-Ukrainian war, the EU must have a buffer or an alternative source of gas, and collaboration with Nigeria in that regard was paramount.\n\nHe reiterated Nigeria\u2019s commitment to working with the EU to bridge the gap in terms of gas, adding that from the Russian-Ukranian crisis, it was evident that gas had been weaponised and unless it created an alternative, it would only get worse.\n\nHe reassured the EU diplomats of Nigeria\u2019s readiness to be an alternative supplier of gas to the EU but urged its companies operating in the country to invest more here.\n\n\u201cWe would like to be reliable partners to solve the energy problem in Europe and we can only achieve this by working together. It is only when investing in these areas is increased that Nigeria can meet that obligation,\u201d Sylva said.\n\nWhile emphasising the need for the transfer of technology in gas and renewable energy, he said Africa must be allowed to continue to exploit its hydrocarbon deposits to develop the continent.\n\nIn her response, Isopi urged Nigeria to take advantage of the opportunity offered by the present crisis in Europe to shore up gas supplies to Europe.",

          "text": "Foreign ministers from four Arab League countries, along with the US secretary of state, are holding an historic meeting in Israel.\n\nIt is the first time the ministers from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Morocco and Bahrain will meet their Israeli counterpart in his home country.\n\nIt comes after they normalised relations with Israel for the first time during the past year-and-a-half.\n\nThe foreign minister of Egypt is also joining the talks.\n\nEgypt was the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, in 1979, though relations between them have often been cool.\n\nThe six top diplomats are meeting on Sunday at a hotel in Sde Boker in the Negev desert in southern Israel and will hold talks on Monday.\n\nThe meeting coincides with a tour of the region by US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken.\n\nHe is visiting Israel, the West Bank, Morocco and Algeria on a five-day trip for talks on issues including Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, tensions with Iran and the Israel-Palestinian conflict.\n\nMr Blinken will also meet Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and later Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah.\n\nHis meeting with Mr Bennett is taking place at a time of growing Israeli fears that the US is on the brink of signing a new agreement with Iran to curb its nuclear programme in return for an end to crippling US-led sanctions.\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 global nuclear deal with Iran and restored sanctions in a move which led Iran to significantly advance its nuclear activities which had been barred by the accord.\n\nIsrael says it believes a new deal will be weaker than the previous one and enable Iran to intensify its military activities across the region.\n\nIsrael also fears that the US might remove Iran\u2019s powerful Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) from its list of terrorist groups as part of a new nuclear deal.\n\nThe IRGC, it says, has helped sustain the wars in Syria and Yemen and bolstered anti-Israel militant groups in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria.\n\nMr Blinken has also taken a different approach to the Israel-Palestinian issue to Mr Bennett. He supports the idea of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, something resolutely rejected by the Israeli prime minister.\n\nTalks will also focus on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, with Israel having taken a lead role as a mediator in the conflict.\n\nIsrael has good relations with both Ukraine and Russia, and Mr Bennett has held several face-to-face meetings and telephone conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of efforts to end the month-long war in Ukraine.",

          "title": "Russia Sowing a Deep Hatred Among Ukrainians, Zelensky Says",
          "text": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy angrily warned Moscow that it is sowing a deep hatred for Russia among his people, as constant artillery barrages and aerial bombings are reducing cities to rubble, killing civilians and driving others into shelters, leaving them to scrounge for food and water to survive.\n\n\u201cYou are doing everything so that our people themselves leave the Russian language, because the Russian language will now be associated only with you, with your explosions and murders, your crimes,\u201d Zelenskyy said in an impassioned video address late Saturday.\n\nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has ground into a war of attrition in many places, with the toll on civilians rising as Moscow seeks to pound cities into submission from entrenched positions.\n\nA nuclear research facility in the besieged city of Kharkiv, near the Russian border, again came under fire Saturday, and Ukraine\u2019s nuclear watchdog said that because of ongoing hostilities it was impossible to assess the extent of the damage.\n\nKharkiv has been besieged by Russian forces since the start of the invasion and has come under repeated shelling that has hit residential buildings and critical infrastructure.\n\nUkrainian authorities have previously reported that Russian shelling had damaged buildings at the facility, but there had been no release of radiation. The International Atomic Energy Agency has said the nuclear material in the facility is always subcritical and the inventory of radioactive material is very low, reducing the risks of radiation release.\n\nOn the western side of the country, Russian rockets struck Lviv on Saturday while President Joe Biden visited neighboring Poland, serving as a reminder that Moscow is willing to strike anywhere in Ukraine despite its claim to be focusing its offensive on the country\u2019s east.\n\nEarly Sunday, a chemical smell still lingered in the air as firefighters in Lviv sprayed water on a burned section of an oil facility hit in the Russian attack.\n\nA security guard at the site, Yaroslav Prokopiv, said he saw three rockets strike and destroy two oil tanks but no one was hurt.\n\n\u201cThe third strike threw me to the ground,\u201d he said.\n\nRussia\u2019s back-to-back airstrikes shook the city that has become a haven for an estimated 200,000 people who have had to flee their hometowns. Lviv had been largely spared since the invasion began, although missiles struck an aircraft repair facility near the main airport a week ago.\n\nIn the dim, crowded bomb shelter under an apartment block a short ways from the first blast site, Olana Ukrainets, a 34-year-old IT professional, said she couldn\u2019t believe she had to hide again after fleeing from the northeastern city of Kharkiv, one of the most bombarded cities of the war.\n\n\u201cWe were on one side of the street and saw it on the other side,\u201d she said. \u201cWe saw fire. I said to my friend, \u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 Then we heard the sound of an explosion and glass breaking. We tried to hide between buildings. I don\u2019t know what the target was.\u201d\n\nTwo cities on opposite ends of the country are seeing some of the worst suffering at the moment, Chernihiv in the north \u2013 strategically located on the road from the Belarusian border to the capital, Kyiv \u2013 and Mariupol in the south, a key port city on the Sea of Azov.\n\nBoth are encircled by Russian forces, but still holding out.\n\nChernihiv has been under attack since the early days of the invasion and over the last week, Russia destroyed the main vehicular bridge leading out of the city and rendered a nearby pedestrian bridge impassable, cutting off the last route for civilians to flee, or for food and medicine to be brought in.\n\nChernihiv\u2019s remaining residents are terrified that each blast, bomb and body that lies uncollected on the streets ensnares them in the same macabre trap of unescapable killings and destruction.\n\n\u201cIn basements at night, everyone is talking about one thing: Chernihiv becoming (the) next Mariupol,\u201d said 38-year-old resident Ihar Kazmerchak, a linguistics scholar.\n\nHe spoke to The Associated Press by cellphone, amid incessant beeps signaling that his battery was dying. The city is without power, running water and heating. At pharmacies, the list of medicines no longer available grows longer by the day.\n\nKazmerchak starts his day in long lines for drinking water, rationed to 10 liters (2 1/2 gallons) per person. People come with empty bottles and buckets for filling when water-delivery trucks make their rounds.\n\n\u201cFood is running out, and shelling and bombing doesn\u2019t stop,\u201d he said.\n\nMore than half of the city\u2019s 280,000 inhabitants have already fled and hundreds who stayed have been killed, Mayor Vladyslav Atroshenko said.\n\nRussian forces have bombed residential areas from low altitude in \u201cabsolutely clear weather\u201d and \u201care deliberately destroying civilian infrastructure: schools, kindergartens, churches, residential buildings and even the local football stadium,\u201d Atroshenko told Ukrainian television.\n\nRefugees from Chernihiv who fled the encirclement and reached Poland this week spoke of broad and terrible destruction, with bombs flattening at least two schools in the city center and strikes also hitting the stadium, museums and many homes.\n\nThey said that with utilities knocked out, people are taking water from the Desna to drink and that strikes are killing people while they wait in line for food. Volodymyr Fedorovych, 77, said he narrowly escaped a bomb that fell on a bread line he had been standing in just moments earlier. He said the blast killed 16 people and injured dozens, blowing off arms and legs.\n\nSo intense is the siege that some of those trapped cannot even muster the strength to be afraid anymore, Kazmerchak said.\n\n\u201cRavaged houses, fires, corpses in the street, huge aircraft bombs that didn\u2019t explode in courtyards are not surprising anyone anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are simply tired of being scared and don\u2019t even always go down to the basements.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s defense ministry said Saturday that it doesn\u2019t expect a reprieve for citizens of Ukraine\u2019s bombarded cities anytime soon.\n\n\u201cRussia will continue to use its heavy firepower on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses, at the cost of further civilian casualties,\u201d the U.K. ministry said.\n\nPrevious bombings of hospitals and other nonmilitary sites, including a theater in Mariupol where Ukrainian authorities said a Russian airstrike is believed to have killed 300 people last week, already have given rise to war crimes allegations.\n\nThe invasion has driven more than 10 million people from their homes, almost a quarter of Ukraine\u2019s population. Of those, more than 3.7 million have fled the country entirely, according to the United Nations. Thousands of civilians are believed to have died.",
