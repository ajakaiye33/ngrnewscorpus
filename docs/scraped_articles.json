          "text": "The Chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, Brigadier General Buba Marwa, has warned against moves to legalise the use of cannabis in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Marwa, such step will amount to taking a step forward and 10 steps backwards which will rob Nigeria of the gains it had made so far in the renewed war against drug abuse and trafficking.\n\nAccording to a statement by the agency\u2019s Director of Media and Advocacy, Femi Babafemi, titled, \u2018Marwa warns against attempt to legalise cannabis,\u2019 the NDLEA boss spoke at a national security summit organised by the House of Representatives.\n\nBabafemi quoted Marwa as saying that the present figure of 10.6 million Nigerians abusing cannabis was frightening.\n\nHe also said there was a link between drug abuse and the security challenges in the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cPresently, there is no bigger national issue than the issue of insecurity in Nigeria, it is one of the big challenges, if not the biggest threatening our country\n\n\u201cInsecurity is today a full-blown malady with many manifestations such as insurgency, banditry, kidnapping, murder, robbery, reprisal killings name it.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NDLEA boss, the persistence of the challenges had been traced to the abuse of illicit substances.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe relationship between substance abuse and crime is a fact.\n\n\u201cWhat is clear is that no sane human being will rise against society to commit the kind of gross atrocities as we are witnessing in recent years, except such an individual has first hardened his heart with mind altering substances.\n\n\u201cThe use of drugs for perverted purposes is not a new phenomenon, neither is it something that just started in Nigeria. There are precedents in world history.\n\n\u201cNigeria should be the last country to consider a law to legalize marijuana in any shape or form.\n\n\u201cShould we have such a law, we will soon become a nation of junkies and criminals.\n\n\u201cAs such, I will like to caution that our lawmakers should not legalise cannabis because it will amount to taking a step forward and 10 steps backward.\u201d\n\nMarwa said the agency had been able to seize over two million kilogrammes of illicit drugs worth over N90bn.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

We have been notified about these agreements and that the funds will be transferred to us. But we are yet to receive the fund at the NSIA.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question on if the money had been sent to Nigeria, he said he was not aware if the funds had been sent to the country.\n\n\u201cAll I know is that we were asked to send an account and we have sent the account to the Central Bank (of Nigeria). But we are not involved in those negotiations,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the committee grilled the Chairman of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission, Prof. Bolaji Owasanloye, who disclosed that the commission had recovered N7.5bn looted fund, out of which the government had accessed over N5bn, leaving a balance of N2.1bn in the account.\n\nHe also noted that the commission had also helped the government to recover about N188bn between 2019 and 2020 from money released to MDAs which they did not need.\n\nThe ICPC boss said the commission was currently investigating about 37,000 certificates for a particular ministry, which were suspected to be fake.\n\nOwasanloye also said the ICPC had an assets recovery account where recovered loot was usually deposited, adding that the commission had no business with the Consolidated Revenue Fund.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the committee queried some transactions made by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.\n\nThe committee said the EFCC transferred in 2017, which the current Chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa, denied knowledge of.\n\nIbrahim Magu was acting chairman of the EFCC during the period.\n\nBawa, who appeared before the committee, also told the lawmakers that the EFCC did not spend from recovered stolen funds.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t receive a single kobo from the recovery account,\u201d he stated.\n\nMeanwhile, a special prosecutor to the defunct Special Presidential Panel for the Recovery of Public Property, Mr Tosin Ojaomo, has accused Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), of frustrating the repatriation of $60bn from the United States.\n\nOjaomo made the allegation on Wednesday while also appearing before the House committee.\n\nThe accuser, however, failed to provide proof to back his claims against Malami, forcing the committee to ask him to come back with evidence.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "NGO calls for grassroots\u2019 inclusion in budget preparation, implementation",
          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nUnveils report titled \u2018Echoes of the People\u2019\n\nBy Gabriel Ewepu and Alice Ekpang\n\nA Non-Governmental Organisation, known as Hipcity Innovation Centre, on Tuesday, called for grassroots inclusion in budget preparation and implementation and also for the federal government to adopt a co-productive approach for budgeting and planning in the rural areas.\n\nThe Executive Director, Hipcity Innovation Centre, Bassey Bassey, made the call in Abuja, at the premiere of a documentary produced by the organization titled \u2018Echoes of the People\u2019 which intends to expose the pathetic plight of citizens in rural Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Bassey, the documentary is making grassroots people voice out their condition and also to be carried along in the scheme of things and not necessarily only to be recognized and remembered during political campaigns.\n\nHe also decried the neglect of rural people by the various levels of government, \u201cA lot of time we pay attention to the government at the Federal and the State levels, and no one really pays attention to the government at the grassroots, which is the Area Council and the Local Government.\n\n\u201cAnd by the makeup of our Constitution, Area Councils, Local Government are supposed to drive grassroots development and this to an extent they have been feeling.\n\n\u201cIn the last two years, we have worked across over 30 communities in the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, and one thing I would tell you is that from the basic budgeting process, the people are not carried along. So that is a step that the government needs to work on. How are we budgeting? What are we budgeting for?\u201d\n\nHe also decried huge money spent on overhead at the Area Councils including bloated spending on office renovation, buying computers rather than the main community development that is supposed to change the narrative of the people.\n\n\u201cMost times you find out that the communities are not consulted. So it begs the question. What informs the kind of projects that the Area Councils and Local Governments take on?\n\nHe also pointed that there is a disconnect in how communities are being communicated and engage with the community, which he maintained that, \u201cEchoes of the People\u2019 is that platform where citizens and the government are supposed to have a dialogue and for the government to listen to the people and therefore, the ability to also understand the workings of the area councils.\u201d\n\nHowever, speaking on the contending issue of local government autonomy, (Bassey) called for a legal framework for community involvement in local government financial processes should be put in place before pursuing local government autonomy.\n\n\u201cLocal government autonomy any time is something that we feel should be implemented, but one basic question that we must answer the area councils and local government must answer before that conversation is taking up, is what have they done with the available funds at the moment?\n\n\u201cI tell you that in the last two years, each time we try to access the budget of the area council it\u2019s like passing Carmel through the needle\u2019s eye; you either have to find someone who works within the area Council to tip. These are public documents, but you would have to go through a series of stress and you would not find the budget anywhere.\u201d\n\nHe called for synergy between local government and the private sector in order to fast-track community development and to have a recognized platform for easy access to information and communication.\n\n\u201cWe have six Area Councils in the FCT, and none of them have a functional website. The Abuja Municipal Area Council, AMAC, at a time had a website but the other five do not have a website, no social media platforms, and oftentimes when you write letters they get lost in transit. These are the challenges that we are talking about.\n\n\u201cThe government is not being open, transparent for people to come in. There are private organizations that want to work with them but doors are not open to them\u201d, he added.\n\nSpeaking also was a representative of the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency, RUWASSA), Chinyelu Ebrike, who promised that the agency is committed to providing water supply and sanitation to the various rural areas of FCT.\n\n\u201cFor water supply, we have done quite a lot. RUWASSA just came on board about five months ago, we had RUWASSA in several other states but in FCT we just started about five months ago.\n\n\u201cWe are on board and we are beginning to take this bit by bit. We were under Water Board before as a department handling the Rural Water Supply.\n\n\u201cWe have gone now, we have taken census of all those rural Villages, what they have, what they have on the ground, The water supply they have, the ones that are broken down. And by the grace of God, we are beginning to visit these communities one after the other.\n\n\u201cJust, as I said, we will need to do it in phases and in bits so that we will be able to measure the results that we are achieving. It\u2019s not a one-year plan it is a long-term plan. Our mandates are water supply and sanitation to the rural areas of FCT. So that is our job as long as this agency exists\u201d, Ebrike stated.\n\nShe added that \u201cWe have had some programmes to eradicate open defecation. We are taking it to ward by ward and area council by area council. So we have started from the Bwari area council. We visited about ten communities.\n\n\u201cWe used the CTLS approach which is the Community Total Led Sanitation which is a people-driven approach to get them committed themselves to end this open defecation.\n\n\u201cWe started with some advocacy, we discussed with them, we started preaching behavioral change for them to stop this open defecation and we\u2019ve been able to declare some of the communities open defecation free.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Ikechukwu Odu, NSUKKA\n\nThe former governor of Anambra State, Mr Peter Obi, on Tuesday said only restructuring can end the escalating criminality, banditry and other forms of insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nMr Obi who said that those fighting against restructuring are beneficiaries of the near failed state of the nation added that the greatest fight against insecurity in the country is to put food on the tables of Nigerians.\n\nHe spoke at the Princess Alexandra Auditorium, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, UNN, during the Association of Nsukka Professors\u2019 4th Adada Lecture, tagged \u2018Restructuring, Security Challenges and Development.\u2019\n\nHe equally bemoaned the rising poverty index in the country, adding that Nigeria has more poor people than China and India put together.\n\nAlso read:\n\nHe also said that if Nigeria must grow, the nation must diversify the economy and equally invest in her youths to acquire a knowledge-based economy.\n\nMr Obi also said \u201cSecurity is the most vital ingredient in a country\u2019s existence. Any government which fails to secure the lives and properties of the citizens has failed. Unfortunately, today, we have seen the impact of insecurity in our country.\n\n\u201cNow that we have found ourselves in this mess, the best thing to do is to restructure the country. People do approach me to contest for the presidency in order to fix Nigeria, but I had always told them that I am not the solution to our problems. If you have a car that has an engine problem, would you change the driver instead of the engine? The engine of our problem in Nigeria is restructuring and until that is done, things would continue to go wrong. It is when we do this that national development can take place.\n\n\u201cWe must invest in human development through education because the more educated a society is, the more development it can attract. The per capita income of Nigerians has kissed the dust. In 1980, Nigeria\u2019s per capita income was $875, China was $ 190. This is to show that China was far below Nigeria then. Today, China\u2019s per capita income has risen to about $12,000, while Nigeria is about $2000. This is one of the reasons we should restructure Nigeria in order to put things right,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier in his address, the President, Association of Nsukka Professors, ANP, Prof. Osy Okanya, said the lecture became necessary in order to provide solutions to the heightened and fragile security situation in the country.\n\nHe also said \u201c\u2026 perhaps it is correct to admit that Nigeria\u2019s political architecture has become so dislocated and disrupted that without urgent structural and institutional re-alignment, Nigeria, likened to a floating Calabash, will on its own implode sooner than later. What is, however, depressing and frightening is that while a vibrant section of the Nigerian State has continued to point at the official actions and inactions that accentuate the fault lines, certain sections of the state appear impervious to the steady manifestations of symptoms of state failure and collapse.\u201d\n\nAlso, in his address, the chairman of the occasion, Sir Chinyeaka Ohaa, charged members of ANP, to use their platform to explore all the areas of life necessary for the growth and development of their environment and the nation at large.\n\nOhaa equally enjoined the association to champion the reactivation of Ogurugu River Jetty, which according to him, was the landing post for the British colonial influence in the region.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Tordue Salem \u2013 Abuja\n\nThe House of Representatives has again summoned the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) for allegedly halting the repatriation of $60 billion loot from Texas, United States of America.\n\nThe Chairman of the Ad hoc Committee on Assessment and Status of All Recovered Loots \u2013 Movable and Immovable Assets from 2002 to 2020 by Agencies of the federal government for Effective Efficient Management and Utilisation, Rep. Adejoro Adeogun, summoned Malami on Wednesday in Abuja when a former Special Prosecutor to the Special Presidential Investigation Panel (SPIP), Mr Tosin Ojaomo, appeared before it.\n\nHe also revealed that before the panel which was headed by Okoi Obono-Obla was disbanded, it investigated the Auditor General of the Federation for the withdrawal of N10 billion from the account of NHIS in two tranches.\n\nOjaomo also revealed that the panel investigated a Director in a Ministry and recovered 86 luxury vehicles, some of the vehicles are bulletproof cars worth the sum of N700 million.\n\nHe also pointed out that a certain account domiciled at Polaris Bank was uncovered by the panel where the sum of $223 million was kept under the guise of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) operations account\n\nOjaomo added that the account was not linked to the Treasury Single Account (TSA), but a stand-alone account of NNPC.\n\nHe said the panel invited the Bank to explain what the money was meant for, adding that when the explanation of the Bank was not satisfactory, it was ordered to remit the money to TSA, and the bank later pleaded that it should be allowed to pay N10 million every month.\n\nALSO READ: 100 people feared dead in boat mishap in Niger state\n\nThe Special Prosecutor noted that after the Chairman of the Panel and some members were suspended in 2019, the AGF was directed to take over the cases being investigated by the panel.\n\nHe stated: \u201cThe projection of the panel based on what we were working with at that time, we had a projection of even making other foreign recoveries, because intelligence was given to the panel that the sum of $60 billion belonging to the Nigerian government is currently been domiciled at Texas, United States of America, at that time, which the panel has started working on to making recovery.\n\n\u201cThe money was stolen from Nigeria through the NNPC. All this has been taken over by the AGF.\n\nIn his ruling, the Committee chairman said the allegations are weighty, saying there was a need to ask the AGF to cause an appearance.\n\nAdeohun said, \u201cThese are weighty allegations, at this stage, we will have to stop you, not that we are trying to stop you from speaking, but because like we said in my place, you don\u2019t shave a man behind him when he is not there.\n\n\u201cWe think we will have to recall you at a different date and we will ask the Attorney General to make a reappearance here so that you can present this to him. You will avail us of all these documents so that we will formally write a letter to him.\n\n\u201cThis is not just inviting him to come and speak now, you have made weighty allegations alleging that this money belonging to Nigeria could have been recovered but for some reasons, he sat on them for whatever reasons.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to believe that that\u2019s really what happened but that\u2019s the allegation they have made.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Managing Director of Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), Mr. Uche Orji, while appearing before the committee revealed that the federal government through the\n\nMinistry of Justice entered into a trilateral agreement with the US, United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland for the repatriation of looted funds.\n\nHe added that an agreement has been reached with the US government for the repatriation of $311 million, while an agreement has been reached with the UK government for repatriation of \u00a34.2 million and \u20ac5.5 million from the Republic of Ireland.\n\nOrji added, \u201cWe are aware that there is an agreement struck with the Ministry of Justice and counterpart countries. We\u2019ve been notified that they have reached this agreement, that the funds will be sent to us, but we have not received it.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Chairman of Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, at the moment that the anti-graft agency has recovered N2.1 billion.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs of today, what is there is N2.1 billion. Over time, however, the cumulative of what we received is over N7 billion and N5 billion has gone back to the government. It has taken it over time.\n\n\u201cAs I said, during Covid, we did an analysis of what was no longer subject to investigation to court processes, it was about two something (over N2 billion).\n\n\u201cBased on current operations, ongoing investigations, we have N2.1 billion. It is not for the government to take. As I said earlier, we have the power to return money to the victim.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Olusegun Bamgbose, National Coordinator, Concerned Advocates for Good Governance, CAGG, has noted that the senior special assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Garba is now de facto leader of Nigeria.\n\nHe called on President Buhari to address Nigerians as soon as possible, adding that Shehu lacks the constitutional right to act as President of Nigeria.\n\nBamgbose, a chieftain of the New Nigerian Peoples Party, NNPP, also lamented that the office of the Vice President has been relegated to the background with Shehu taken charge at the Presidency .\n\nAccording to the senior lawyer, Nigerians no longer know when Shehu is airing his personal opinion or speaking the mind of the President.\n\nBamgbose was angered by the recent reactions of the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, and Shehu, to the outcome of the recent Southern Governors\u2019 meeting in Asaba Delta State.\n\nThe Governors had met to deliberate on the security challenges facing their region and thus pronounced a ban on open grazing.\n\nMalami had kicked against the governors\u2019 decision, comparing open grazing by herders, to spare parts dealers in the North.\n\nAnd a few days later, Shehu came up to rescue the situation by informing Nigerians that the resolutions of the Southern Governors were of questionable legality.\n\nBamgbose described this as ridiculous, adding that it clearly shows that the Presidency is uncoordinated.\n\n\u201cNigerians are confused as to identify who exactly is in control of the affairs of this nation,\u201d he told DAILY POST.\n\n\u201cWhen the Presidency discovered that the statement of Malami could not sail through, Garba Shehu came up to rescue the situation by informing Nigerians that the resolutions of the Southern Governors were of questionable legality.\n\n\u201cIt was equally reported that President Buhari backed Malami\u2019s stand on the resolutions of the Southern Governors. This scenario has clearly shown that the Presidency is highly uncoordinated.\n\n\u201cOne won\u2019t be wrong to assert that we have multiple presidencies in Nigeria, in essence, we have more than one President in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn the real sense of it, Buhari may not be in charge. We now have proxies ruling this nation. This is tantamount to the bastardization of the presidency.\n\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t President Buhari who went round the country to campaign, come out and address the nation on a national TV broadcast?\n\n\u201cGarba Shehu has now become the de facto leader of Nigeria. One does not know when he is airing his personal opinion or speaking the mind of the President.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s high time President Buhari addressed the nation. Garba Shehu lacks the constitutional right to act as President of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis confusion in the Presidency must be brought to an end. Its most unfortunate that the office of the Vice President has been relegated to the background. This is a constitutional mess. We need to correct this abnormally in the Presidency.\n\n\u201cThis is why we must have to embrace National dialogue. We need to give room for restructuring of the country.\n\n\u201cNigerians don\u2019t understand what is going on in the Presidency. Every Dick, Harry, and Tom claim to speak for the Presidency. This is not helping matters. This is belittling the Presidency.\u201d",

It has no any adverse effects as earlier rumoured in some quarters.

The question is must a son of a carpenter become a carpenter? Must a son of a peasant farmer become one? Don\u2019t we have a right to education a social responsibility?\u201d\n\nHe warned failure of the government to rescind its decision may heighten insecurity in the state as dropout may venture into sophisticated crimes as means of survival.\n\nPresident, Nigerian Association of Microbiology Students, Yusuf Rahama, noted education was one key thing that keeps students away from the street vices including banditry and kidnapping.\n\n\u201cOur parents are being sacked and we that are trying to acquire education to help them, the government, by increasing the fees is indirectly asking us to also go and sit at home.\n\n\u201cThis is not fair. The government should decrease the fees since some of our parents are being sacked and can no longer afford to pay our fees,\u201d he said.",

The governor lamented that the people are losing confidence in the country because a number of issues have been allowed to fester for too long.\n\nWhile reiterating his unwavering commitment to the unity of the nation, Governor Akeredolu noted that issues of insecurity and true federalism have affected many things in the county, including the trust of the people.\n\n\u201cI kept making a case anytime I have the opportunity. My circumstance cannot make me believe in secession. My wife is from the South East. My sons married from other regions outside the South West. But strong points have been made. Everybody wants to see fairness and federalism. Those are the areas \u2013 is this how to run a federal government? Is it an inclusive one? How do we have fair representation? People are worried. This constitution review, your efforts, I pray it should be accepted. Our people believe that there must be dialogue. People are saying \u2018we want national dialogue.\u2019 How we convoke it, I don\u2019t know. I believe those are issues we must look at,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Anglican Bishop of Diocese of Amichi, Anambra State, Rev. Ephraim Ikeakor has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to be transparent and take full charge of Nigeria and address the current insecurity ravaging the country or resign.\n\nHe also absolved the people of South East and Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) of any involvement in the security challenges, especially burning of police stations and killing of security agents in region, alleging d that mercenaries might have been hired from outside to destabilise peace of the zone.\n\nIkeakor made the comments while addressing journalists in a pre-synod press conference held at St Andrew\u2019s Anglican Church Ebenato, Nnewi South Local Government Area of the State. The cleric insisted that Nigerians would want to know who between the President and the Presidency was in charge of the affairs of the country.\n\n\u201cNigeria is at the crossroads; security has collapsed, education has collapsed, medical health system is in shambles. It is not only shameful, but also extremely embarrassing that our leaders, including Mr President still travel overseas to seek medical care. Why can\u2019t they fix our hospitals like what they see and use overseas.\n\n\u201cThe President, if he is still there, because we are confused on who is in charge, we do not know if the country is ruled by the President or the Presidency. Who is really in charge. People are being killed and places burnt, yet the President has not visited any of the states involved.\u201d",

          "text": "No security without youth involvement, says Ooni\n\n\u2022 Sultan calls for implementation of previous resolutions\n\n\u2022 Insurgency, others pose serious threat to nation\u2019s security, Lawan, Gbajabiamila warn\n\n`By Udora Orizu\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday said the worsening insecurity in the country affects the citizens and the economy, challenging the foundation of nationhood and stands in the way of his administration in achieving its highest ambitions for Nigeria.\n\nHe made the remarks as other stakeholders expressed their views on the security situation of the country.\n\nBuhari stated this while delivering his remarks in Abuja at the opening of a Special Summit on National Security organised by the House of Representatives.\n\nThe summit, organized as part of the Green Chamber\u2019s response to the country\u2019s security challenges, was to provide a platform for discussions by security stakeholders and other Nigerians in order to make far-reaching recommendations to the Executive arm of government.\n\nThe President who was represented at the event by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr. Boss Mustapha, said the issue of insecurity, remains the responsibility of all Nigerians in and out of government, hence all hands should be on deck to address the challenges.\n\nWhile commending the initiative of the House in organising the summit, Buhari expressed optimism that the challenges will eventually be overcome.\n\nHe called on the Legislature to use the opportunity to pass more laws to enhance the operations of national security agencies.\n\nHe also urged participants to set aside ethnic, political, religious, and other considerations in the national interest to speak frankly on the security challenges and the solutions.\n\nBuhari said, \u201dThis summit could not have come a better time because only a few days ago, Nigeria lost the Chief of Army Staff and a host of other Senior Military Officers in a fatal plane crash involving Nigeria Airforce Asset. This is a painful loss to the nation, the military as an institution and to our efforts to strengthen the security architecture and capacity.\n\n\u201dIn different continents of the world, terrorism, political conflicts, racism and other forms of criminal activities continue to threaten economic development, peace and security. At the regional level; Africa these concerns subsist and continue to rage. Nigeria shares land borders with Benin, Cameron, Chad and Niger; and maritime boundaries with Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Sao Tome and Principe. The challenges that these international borders pose to our national security and interest are enormous. The instability in the Lake Chad region alone deserves close attention. I am certain that we shall overcome just as we have done many times throughout our history. However, success at this time requires that we set aside all other considerations and commit ourselves to a common endeavour in the national interest.\u201d\n\nIn his goodwill message, the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, lamented that Nigeria was currently at cross roads and its very essence of existence was under serious threat due to the activities of insurgents and bandits.\n\nHe urged both the Legislative and Executive arms of government to work more closely together by ensuring that recommendations from sessions such as the summit were implemented.\n\nLawan, who said the Armed Forces needed improved funding, told the session that the National Assembly was ready at all times to partner security agencies in addressing their operational challenges.\n\nLawan said, \u201dWhat started as insurgency in 2009 or so in the north western part of Yobe has now snowballed into full scale insurgency in the entire north east. What was not known to us in the north west is now today the home of banditry and kidnapping. The north central as we all know is not safe. It suffers the clashes between the herders and our farmers. And the recent introduction in the south east is another serious threat to the existence of this country. Where government institutions are targeted, our police and security agencies personnel are being killed on a daily basis.\n\n\u201dOur institutions, buildings are burnt. I believe that these are threats not only to those areas but the entire nation. And our armed forces are doing their best. I must commend our armed forces and other security agencies for doing so much with the little we are able to give them. The National Assembly has always been on the side of giving the kind of support, either legislative, or the kind of financial support that our armed forces and indeed all other security agencies require, even though we have our limits.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman of the National Assembly further opined that a functioning local government system helps in providing security for lives and property of people, with the traditional rulers playing key roles in ensuring security in their domains.\n\nHe also called for an end to ethnic profiling, saying that criminals should be named, shamed and dealt with.\n\n\u201dA criminal has only one name and that is criminal. No criminal should have comfort in his ethnic enclave. Whoever, where that person is, once he is a criminal, he is simply a criminal and must be dealt with in the appropriate manner regardless of where he or she is coming from,\u201d he added\n\nAligning with Lawan\u2019s statement, the Speaker of the House, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, in his keynote address noted that the country was under attack by insurgents, bandits, kidnappers, and other criminal elements.\n\nHe said it would be difficult for the country to attain the peace it desired for development to take place if the present security situation remained unresolved.\n\nThe Speaker while saying that previous and current approaches to addressing the challenges of insecurity have not yielded the desired results, called for a united and coordinated security approach to contain the menace.\n\nGbajabiamila commended President Buhari for supporting the summit, adding that the President had assured him that the recommendations of the summit would be given due attention and implementation.\n\nAlso speaking, the Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, said government at all levels should quit the talks on insecurity and get to work.\n\nHe advised the federal government to implement resolutions reached at previous forums rather than creating new summits.\n\nAbubakar said, \u201dNow things are really very bad and it\u2019s a fact. I\u2019m happy to hear that the two leaders of the National Assembly are saying that in public. Let\u2019s not deceive ourselves that things are alright, things are not alright and we know and we see it. For some of us we\u2019ve seen so much in our life. From the time I became Sultan till now, for 11 years plus, we have been having such gatherings to talk about Nigeria, national security, development and so on. We have talked and talked, we have talked at Northern Governors Forum level, talked at National level where I I happened to be the chairman of that body, we have talked and talked.\n\n\u201dIn the last few months we have had serious gatherings like this with the highest leadership of this country. Today we are here once again on the same issue of National Security. Enough of this talks, let\u2019s work, let\u2019s work the talk , the more we sit here and talk, the more time we waste in getting real actions . We know the problems. I will not say anything here that I have not said in the last 7 years. We know the problems and I thought we are coming for a closed door program with the leadership of the House of Representatives and other stakeholders. My own take on this summit is yes, it\u2019s important to sit and talk but it\u2019s more important to implement what we talked about. We can\u2019t just continue to talk and not implement.\u201d\n\nThe Sultan also chided politicians who say some things in the open and act differently behind closed doors.\n\nAccording to him, \u201dCertain things our leaders do, you say something in public and they clap for you, you go back to your comfort zone and throw everything away. That\u2019s why I say whatever you do God is seeing you, and as leaders God will ask us to account for the leadership he gave us here on earth and we must account for our deeds. I call on our leaders to fear God, do what\u2019s right, don\u2019t look at ethnic, religious or personal interest while you\u2019re carrying out your duties.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, opined that insecurity cannot be solved without youth involvement.\n\nHe accused the lawmakers of abandoning the youths at the grassroots while they enjoy their lives in the cities.\n\nHe said lawmakers should engage the youths rather than hold such meetings and repeating what has been said a lot of times.\n\nHe said, \u201dIt is very idiotic and stupid for us to be doing the same thing over and over again and expect a different result. We will continue to get the same results. Let us be very truthful and honest to ourselves in this country, we all know the problems. How well are we carrying along these people in that age bracket. But whenever we want to go for political posts and appointments, we go back to them. We know the good, the bad and the ugly in their category. As traditional rulers, they are the most active in our system. Let us tell ourselves the truth, they are hungry and they are angry. I repeat: they are hungry and they are very angry. All of us that are here, I will be very happy if anybody can raise up their hand and say \u2018I can go to my constituency, my local government area, and I can stay there in peace for one week.\u2019 Who can do it here? Including our gatekeepers, who can do it here? Including the Senate President, including the Speaker. But you left the traditional rulers; you left district heads, the baales to continue to stay there. And you are saying all will be well in this country.\n\n\u201dLet us change our style. You leave this age bracket. If there will be problems, you give them guns to start to move around. You will never see anybody above our age in our comfort zone here that is really ready to face the music. It is very important for all of us to know that we are not all safe; we are not safe at all. Let us engage a lot of youth organisations that are very relevant; that understand the local government administration and governance within every district and locality of this country. You have neglected that category completely. What is the essence of you being a politician that you cannot even move around freely? You cannot! Do you think only Abuja is Nigeria? Or Lagos? Thirty-six states of this country, people are there and you left them. You abandoned them. And you are making laws and administering. What are you administering? I do not know. So, let us talk to ourselves very seriously. On this note, I want to thank the organisers and I want to tell us that, enough of talking the talk, let us walk the talk.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Southern govs insist no land for invaders\n\n\u2022ACF maintains position on cattle restriction\n\n\u2022Buhari\u2019s opposition to southern govs, ill-advised, says Clark\n\n\u2022SANs allege ethnic bias\n\nBy Alex Enumah, Emma Addeh in Abuja, John Shiklam in Kaduna, George Okoh in Makurdi and James Sowole in Akure\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari is opposed to open grazing of cattle, the presidency said yesterday in an apparent effort to douse the rising critique of its statement on Monday, quoting the president as querying the legality of Southern governors\u2019 ban on open grazing.\n\nPresidential spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, while fielding questions on ARISE NEWS CHANNEL, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, said many people misconstrued Buhari\u2019s views on the Southern governors\u2019 resolutions at their May 11 meeting in Asaba, Delta State as an endorsement of open grazing.\n\nHours before the clarification from the presidency, the Monday statement had drawn flaks from the Southern governors; the Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere; and some senior lawyers.\n\nThe presidency statement by Shehu had questioned the legality of the Southern governors\u2019 resolutions, in which they, among others, banned open grazing of cattle in the South.\n\nThe statement quoted Buhari as dismissing the ban, while accusing the 17 Southern governors of not proffering any solution to the intractable farmer-herder conflicts, largely driven by open grazing of cattle.\n\nThe presidency announced Buhari\u2019s approval for ranching and revival of grazing reserves nationwide.\n\nBut the Chairman of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum and Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, yesterday fired back at the presidency, warning that no land in the South will be ceded to those he described \u201cas a band of invaders masquerading as herdsmen under any guise.\u201d\n\nThe Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) also maintained its earlier stance that the ban on open grazing was in the best interest of all Nigerians.\n\nBut Benue State Governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, yesterday kicked against the presidential decision to revive grazing reserves, saying that the reserves, created when Nigeria had a population of 50 million have since been taken over by airports, schools, roads, hospitals and other infrastructure.\n\nSome senior lawyers also faulted Buhari\u2019s opposition to the open grazing ban, alleging ethnic bias.\n\nHowever, in an effort to douse tension generated by his statement, Shehu told ARISE NEWS Channel that Buhari would want to see an end to the archaic practice of open grazing of cattle.\n\nHe added that the objective of the president and that of the governors fully align.\n\nHowever, he stated that the only difference between the positions of both parties is the approach to achieving the aim, adding that the president is insistent that it should be done in an organised manner.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe president wants to see an end to open grazing; he wants to see ranching; but he wants it in a way that\u2019s organised and he has a plan for it and the plan will take off in June.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, all the ongoing attacks on the president are from people who are in the mood for a public fight.\n\nHe said states that were able to meet the minimum requirements would be encouraged to embark on ranching, and expressed optimism that those opposed to ranching will change their minds when it becomes fully functional.\n\nShehu said the president viewed open grazing as old-fashioned and was looking forward to a replacement for the medieval practice.\n\nBut he reiterated that banning open grazing without an alternative is not a good approach to the issue.\n\nHe said the president was worried about the crisis generated by the matter, adding that the generalisation of every herder as criminals is not the right thing to do.\n\nWhile admitting that the ranks of the nomads had been infiltrated with people now bearing AK-47 rifles to kill and maim, Shehu called for calm as the issue won\u2019t be solved by public show of strength.\n\n\u201cLet us stop this shadow boxing. You just brought one or two people here who said things that nobody said from our own end. Did the president say he didn\u2019t support\u2026? He\u2019s opposed to the way the governors have chosen to do it,\u201d he said.\n\nOn state policing, Shehu said the president was initially concerned that governors who are unable to pay salaries to their workers want to give guns to police set up by them, adding that if it is what Nigerians want, the president would have no option but to support it.\n\n\u201cYou hire a policeman. Give him a gun and for one year, you don\u2019t pay salaries, like you are doing to your teachers, that\u2019s a problem,\u201d Shehu stated.\n\nBesides, he added that to implement state policing will require amending the 1999 Constitution, and Buhari has never rejected constitution amendments.\n\nOn restructuring, he stated that the All Progressives Congress (APC) wasn\u2019t against devolution of power, as that is the work of the legislature to do.\n\nHe also dismissed speculations that Buhari was interested in extending his tenure, saying that those raising doubts over whether or not elections will hold in 2023 are doing so because they are unelectable.\n\nShehu also said he was not aware of any shoot-on-sight order against Igbo, adding that the rumour is meant to provoke unnecessary public anger.\n\nSouthern Govs Insist No Land for Invaders\n\nThe Chairman of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum and Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, yesterday faulted Monday\u2019s presidential statement querying the legality of the governors\u2019 ban on open grazing.\n\nAkeredolu, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant, Special Duties and Strategies, Dr. Doyin Odebowale, said Shehu could not be representing the presidency with his positions on issues of national concern.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnyone who has been following the utterances of this man (Shehu), as well as his fellow travellers on the self-deluding, mendacious but potentially dangerous itinerary to anarchy cannot but conclude that he works, assiduously, for extraneous interests whose game plan stands at variance with the expectations of genuine lovers of peaceful coexistence among all the peoples whose ethnic extractions are indigenous to Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cShehu cannot continue to hide under some opaque, omnibus and dubious directives to create confusion in the polity.\n\n\u201cThe declaration that the recommendations of the Minister of Agriculture, Alhaji Sabo Nanono, a mere political appointee like Garba Shehu, are now the \u2018lasting solutions,\u2019 which eluded all the elected representatives of the people of the Southern part of the country, exposes this man as a pitiable messenger who does not seem to understand the limits of his relevance and charge.\n\n\u201cMr. Garba contends that \u2018their announcement is of questionable legality\u2019, referring to the 17 governors of the Southern states, but the decision of certain elements to take the ancestral lands of other people to settle their kinsmen, including the \u2018gun-wielding \u2018killer herdsmen\u2019 and their families, and provide \u2018veterinary clinics, water points for animals, and facilities for herders and their families, including schooling through these rehabilitated reserves\u2019 for which \u2018the federal government is making far-reaching and practical changes allowing for different communities to co-exist side-by-side\u2019, does not appear to him as a comprehensive plan for land grabbing, a precursor to internal colonialism.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu said Shehu wanted to revive forest reserves \u201cbut seems particularly uninterested in the current position of the same law that he and his cohorts often misinterpret to serve parochialism and greed.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernors no longer have powers over the lands in their territories. They must take instructions from appointees of the federal government on such matters,\u201d he stated.\n\nWhile noting the rights of all Nigerians to move freely in all parts of the country as guaranteed by the constitution, Akeredolu said it was clear that Shehu seemed to have issues understanding the difference between licentious criminality and qualified rights under the law.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is our duty to continually nudge him off his current state of cognitive dissonance. His pronouncement betrays dubiousness and mischief.\n\n\u201cMost traditional families in Nigeria have occupations. Pastoralism is not an exception. Any ethnic group still trapped in anachronism may be assisted to embrace modernity.\n\n\u201cDispossessing communities of their ancestral lands, encouraging denizens of the forests to overrun lands belonging to other people and forcing alien bands of migrants on the local populace to live \u2018side-by-side\u2019 with other communities cannot be for the purpose of animal husbandry.\n\n\u201cIt raises suspicion on a grand, deliberate, persistent and insidious design to use naked force to subjugate the real owners of the land. Mr. Garba Shehu is a major supporter of the current pervasive anarchy in the land.\n\n\u201cMay, we warn Mr. Garba Shehu and his cohorts to desist from hurling insults at the elected representatives of the people. He lacks the authority to make policy statements for the federal government, unless directed, expressly. His acts are clearly those of an agent provocateur.\n\n\u201cNo inch of the space delineated and known, currently, as South-west, and indeed the whole South, will be ceded to a band of invaders masquerading as herdsmen under any guise.\u201d\n\nOrtom Condemns Moves to Reopen Grazing Reserves\n\nBenue State Governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, has condemned the moves by the presidency to reopen grazing reserves.\n\nThe governor said in a statement by his Press Secretary, Mr. Terver Akase, that he read with concern a statement issued by Shehu in which he said the federal government would commence rehabilitation work on grazing reserves in the country next month.\n\n\u201cIt is now clear that there is a hidden agenda, which only the presidency knows. Otherwise, all the regions of the country have accepted the fact that open grazing of animals is no longer fashionable and should be banned to pave the way for ranching, yet, the government at the centre is insistent that grazing reserves/cattle routes must be created across the country,\u201d he stated.\n\nOrtom added that the Northern States Governors\u2019 Forum (NSGF) had on February 9 agreed that open grazing was no longer sustainable, in view of growing urbanisation and population of the country.\n\nHe accused the presidency of pushing for the continuation of open grazing and the return of cattle routes of the 1950s and 60s, adding that the presidency\u2019s endorsement of open grazing has emboldened armed herders who lay claim to all land in Nigeria as belonging to Fulani, hence their invasion of farming communities and killing of original landowners.\n\n\u201cAt present, the routes have been taken over by airports, roads, schools, hospitals, as well as markets, houses and other human activities,\u201d he added.\n\nACF Maintains Stand on Open Grazing Ban\n\nAlso reacting to the presidency\u2019s rejection of the ban on open grazing by the Southern governors, spokesman of the ACF, Mr. Emmanuel Yawe, said the Chairman of the forum, Chief Audu Ogbe, had earlier made the position of the forum known.\n\n\u201cOur stand on the issue was already made known by our Chairman, Audu Ogbe, in a statement he issued on May 17, 2021,\u201d he said while responding to THISDAY\u2019s inquiry.\n\nOgbe, in the statement, had said that the decision to ban open grazing was in the best interest of all Nigerians.\n\nHe said: \u201cACF does not see any reason to object to a decision taken in the best interest of all.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is that the crisis emanates from the belief by most herdsmen that they are free to enter any farm, eat up the crops, and rape or kill anyone raising objections. Nobody or society can accept that.\u201d\n\nAfenifere said the presidential statement opposing the ban on open grazing showed that Buhari\u2019s government was not organised.\n\nThe Secretary-General of Afenifere, Chief Sola Ebiseni, said reacting to Shehu\u2019s statement again would amount to dignifying him.\n\nHe said: \u201cHaving reacted to the statement of the Attorney-General, I consider it infra dignitatem to still countenance Garba Shehu whose statement, claiming the president\u2019s authority, on the same ban on open grazing does not only show how unorganised the Buhari government is, but also a vote of no confidence on the AGF, who should save the honour of his office and the legal profession by resigning pronto.\u201d\n\nSANs Knock Presidency, Allege Ethnic Bias\n\nSome senior lawyers have faulted the position of the presidency on the open grazing ban in the South.\n\nSome of them described the president\u2019s statement as parochial, sectional and one that is capable of further tearing the country apart.\n\nMr. John Baiyesea (SAN), who described the statement as part of the bizarre situation the country is dealing with, wondered if such could ever emanate from Buhari.\n\nAccording to him, such statements are often made under the cover of the presidency.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is doubtful if the president knows about such annoying statements, which seem to suggest that he has narrowed his office to the North. I don\u2019t believe that the president will personally support one ethnic group against another or wilfully diminish the scope of his authority. I don\u2019t think he will make himself so irrelevant as president of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe, however, stated that if the president\u2019s silence to such tribalistic and ethnic posturing of his appointees means acquiescence or approval, then the country is endangered.\n\n\u201cHow many times are they to be told (for them to understand), that freedom of movement guaranteed by the constitution is for human beings and not for cows, or animals?\n\n\u201cAs long as Fulani herdsmen stay within the law, their freedom of movement is guaranteed. But their cows do not enjoy the same constitutional rights or protections.\n\n\u201cExcept for the mischievous intentions of these government officials who are bent on dividing this country, it is too elementary that the constitutional system does not give the rights of people to animals,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, advised the federal government to be careful not to allow the horrors experienced in Rwanda and Burundi to happen in Nigeria.\n\nAlso speaking, Mr. Dayo Akinlaja (SAN), faulted the presidency, saying that the Southern governors acted within the ambit of the law.\n\nHe added: \u201cI do not agree with him for the simple reason that it is not in tandem with my previously expressed view that the governors were right in their decision to ban open grazing.\n\n\u201cIn a constitutional setting as ours, the issue may have to be referred to the judicial arm of government for resolution. Until that is done, the governors are at liberty to stick to their position.\u201d\n\nHuman rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), also faulted the presidency and advised the government to study the Grazing Reserves Act of 1964, which provides for the establishment and operation of grazing reserves in the North.\n\nHe said since there was a popular demand for the proscription of open grazing, efforts should be made to immediately establish ranches.\n\n\u201cIt smacks of brazen official impunity on the part of the presidency to have said that the ban on open grazing is of doubtful legality. Last Friday, the Federal High Court ruled that state governments have the power to enact anti-grazing laws,\u201d he stated.\n\nConstitutional lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), accused Malami of ill-advising the president against the stance of the Southern governors.\n\nHe challenged the federal government to sue the governors if it is convinced that their position is legally flawed\n\nHe said: \u201cPresident Buhari has obviously been ill-advised on the well thought out Southern governors\u2019 stance against open grazing by the attorney-general whose views were made known only two days ago. Buhari, with all humility, is quite wrong to say the Southern governors\u2019 stance is an act of questionable legality.\n\n\u201cIf the federal government feels strongly and sure about its puritanical, but legally flawed stance, I challenge the federal government to challenge the governors\u2019 resolutions by suing all the state governors of Nigeria, through the invocation of the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under section 232(1) of the 1999 Constitution\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

General Ibrahim Attahiru, and 10 military officers and personnel.\n\nThe Kaduna aircraft crash, the third of such incident in the last three months involving NAF fleet, has raised concerns about the airworthiness of the aircraft the NAF has.\n\nThree NAF aircraft were involved in fatal crashes in Abuja, Borno and in Kaduna in the last three months, claiming the lives of a total of 21 personnel of the air force and the army.\n\nHowever, the air force, last week, inducted three newly procured JF-17 thunder aircraft into its inventory as part of activities to mark its 57th anniversary celebration and is expecting 12 Super Tucano fighter jets from the United State, which delivery is due by 2022.\n\nThere were also claims that of the four major Beechcraft planes in the force, notably, NAF 201, NAF 202, NAF 203 and NAF 204, two, NAF 201and NAF 203 had crashed in Abuja and Kaduna, remaining NAF 202 and NAF 204.\n\nThere have also been trending calls on the social media for the air force to ground the remaining two.\n\nBut the air force has insisted that the planes are in good conditions.\n\nThe air force, in a statement by its spokesman, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, said the committee, comprising serving and retired officers, would, among other terms of reference, analyse safety reports from operational and engineering units, conduct safety evaluation of NAF units and recommend measures to enhance safety of operations.\n\nThe committee is also to interact with unit operational and technical personnel for views, observations and contributions on safety measures.\n\nThe committee, chaired by the Deputy Theatre Commander, Operation Hadin Kai, Air Vice Marshal Abraham Adole, is expected to submit its report latest June 18.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, has constituted a committee of serving and retired senior officers to conduct a safety audit of all Nigerian Air Force (NAF) operational and engineering units.\n\n\u201cThe committee is to, among other terms of reference, analyse safety reports from operational and engineering units, conduct safety evaluation of NAF units and recommend measures to enhance safety of operations in the units.\n\n\u201cThe committee is also to interact with unit operational and technical personnel for views, observations and contributions on safety measures. Chaired by Air Vice Marshal Abraham Adole, the Deputy Theatre Commander, Operation Hadin Kai, the committee is to submit its report not later than 18 June 2021.\u201d\n\nThe Kaduna air crash killed the army chief and officers from the army and the air force.\n\nBesides Attahiru, other senior officers who died in the crash were Brig General Idris Abdulkadir, Brig Gen Olatunji Olayinka, Brigadier General Abdulrahman Kuliya, ADC to the late COAS, Major LA Hayat, Major Hamza and Sergeant Umar Saidu.\n\nThe list of the crew members are Flight. Lt. T.O Asaniyi; Flt. Lt. AA Olufade; Sgt Adesina Isaiah and ACM Matthew Oyedepo.\n\nThe remains of the fallen officers were buried at the National Military Cemetery, Abuja last weekend.\n\nThe federal government had also ordered that the national flag be flown at half-mast in honour of the late officers and others.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

I saw it and I said it,\u201d she maintained.\n\nWATCH: Remi Tinubu Assaults Woman, Calls Her \u00e2\u0080\u0098Thug\u00e2\u0080\u0099 For Speaking Up At Location Of Constitution Review Hearing@AsiwajuTinubu @OfficialAPCNg pic.twitter.com/5ySmdEcWPb \u2014 Sahara Reporters (@SaharaReporters) May 26, 2021\n\nThis is however not the first time the ordained pastor of the Redeemed Christian Church of God would be involved in a controversy since becoming a Senator in 2011.\n\nShe recently tackled her colleague, Smart Adeyemi, who raised pertinent questions about the growing insecurity in the country.\n\nAdeyemi had during a plenary session said that Nigeria was facing the worst instability since the civil war.\n\n\u201cThis is the worst instability we are facing. In fact, this is worse than the civil war,\u201d he had said.\n\nBut Tinubu interrupting him, had asked, \u201cAre you in PDP (Peoples Democratic Party)? Are you a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing?\u201d\n\nAdeyemi, however, ignored her comments and continued, \u201cWe cannot pretend that we are capable of handling the situation in our hands. America, as powerful as they are, when the pandemic came, it came to a point China came to their rescue.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t pretend that we need foreign support now. Billions of naira have been voted for security services and nothing is coming out of it. I\u2019m a party man and I\u2019m supporting APC but it has gotten to a point that as supporters we cannot keep quiet.\"\n\nIn 2015, Tinubu also raised a storm at the Senate when she sat on the chair meant for Ike Ekweremadu, the then Deputy Senate President.\n\nThe former Lagos State First Lady, who wanted to second a motion on the approval of the Lagos state development policy operation loan, earned the rebuke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) senators, when she stood up to speak while standing in the Deputy Senate President\u2019s corner.\n\nIn July 2016, there was an altercation between Tinubu and Senator Dino Melaye from Kogi state which saw both lawmakers calling each other names and charging at each other.\n\nAccording to reports, those who witnessed the incident, which occurred during a closed-door meeting held by the senators, said trouble started when Melaye urged the Senate to descend heavily on members who had offered to serve as prosecution witnesses in the ongoing forgery case against the then Senate President Bukola Saraki and his deputy, Ekweremadu.\n\n\u201cYou should go and tell those who sent you that nobody, I said nobody, no matter who he is, can ever control this Senate,\u201d Melaye was quoted as saying as he pointed at the affected senators, his face contorted in rage.\n\nBut when Tinubu was recognised to speak, she rose, and said, \u201cI\u2019m just wondering why whenever Senator Dino speaks in this chamber, he is always threatening people and behaving childishly and at times like a thug.\n\n\u201cI think he needs to know that every senator here represents their constituencies. And that there is no need to threaten anyone.\n\n\u201cWe are seeking and working towards reconciliation, yet you are busy issuing threats.\u201d\n\nIn July 2019, Tinubu also had an open confrontation with another colleague of hers, Elisha Ishaku Abbo from Adamawa state.\n\nAbbo, who was caught on camera assaulting a woman in an Abuja sex toy shop, had appeared before a Senate committee set up to investigate the incident.\n\nThe Adamawa senator said he had refused to allow journalists to interview him over the matter, and did not understand why he came in for the hearing to be \u201cambushed\u201d by journalists.\n\nInsisting that the hearing be done privately, Abbo had said, \u201cI am not addressing the camera, I am not addressing the press.\u201d\n\nBefore being allowed to explain this, Tinubu told Abbo he was new in the Senate and could not tell the committee how to handle the hearing.\n\n\u201cYou are just joining us. We have a procedure and we are also under law. What we are doing, we are doing as a legislature. You don\u2019t come in here when we invite you, despite you being our colleague, you are on the other side now,\u201d she had said.\n\n\u201cEverybody requires a fair hearing, what is going on with you affects us as a body. You don\u2019t come in here and dictate to us the procedure we are supposed to adopt. You don\u2019t dictate to us, because you undermine us by even trying to do that.\n\nYou haven\u2019t even listened to us, even if we are going beyond what you expect, you can stop us.\n\n\u201cDo you want us to protect you, or do you want us to defend you, or you want to be on your own? Do you realise that the Senate when we constitute this, whatever the law gives, we can also suspend you?\u201d\n\nInterrupting Tinubu with a protest, Abbo said the senator should not threaten him with suspension.\n\n\u201cAre you threatening me with suspension?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI am a senator like you, I won\u2019t sit here and you threaten me with suspension.

          "text": "Ahmed Idris, accountant-general of the federation (AGF), has backtracked on his earlier claim that the recovered \u00a34.2 million Ibori loot has been returned to Delta state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUmar Gwandu, special assistant on media and public relations to Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation, had on May 18, said the amount was credited into the designated federal government account with naira equivalent value as of May 10.\n\nSpeaking before the house of representatives ad hoc committee on \u201cassessment and status of all recovered loots movable and immovable assets from 2002-2020 by agencies of the federal government of Nigeria for effective efficient management and utilisation\u201d on Tuesday, the accountant-general said the funds have been returned to Delta state to avoid litigation against the federal government.\n\nHowever, in a statement on Wednesday issued by Henshaw Ogubike, spokesperson to the accountant-general, Idris said the issue surrounding the loot had \u201cnot been properly resolved\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe money is still being awaited, after which the issues around it will be resolved before further action is taken,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor now, no money has been returned to Delta state. This is the true position as regards the \u00a34.2m Ibori loot. The issue of the \u00a34.2m Ibori loot has not been properly resolved.\n\n\u201cThe office of the accountant-general of the federation (OAGF) wishes to put the records straight regarding the widely circulated media report on the \u00a34.2m Ibori loot.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Lauretta Onochie, media aide to President Muhammadu Buhari, via her Facebook page, had said returning the funds to the Delta state government would be breaching the terms and conditions on which the funds were repatriated.\n\n\u201cNow, let me remind us. The attorney-general of the federation, Abubakar Mallami, the British high commissioner, Catriona Laing, and other relevant agencies held a press conference openly telling the world when the money would be returned, and the specific projects the money was approved for openly,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cWhen it was delayed, the attorney-general informed Nigerians of the reason for the delay. When the loot arrived, Nigerians were informed too. The conditions under which the funds were repatriated, still stand. Again, no penny was paid to the Delta state government. If we break the conditions for getting this chicken amount, how do we get the elephant amount that is still coming?\n\n\u201cThe British high commissioner is also keeping an open eye on those projects. I know what we all heard. But we also know the facts. Pres. Muhammadu Buhari runs an open government. The attorney-general is part of the open policy. Nothing hidden. Nigerians would be the first to know if he decides to break an agreement made with Britain. I very much doubt it. He\u2019s an Honourable man.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Olisa Ifeajika, chief press secretary to Ifeanyi Okowa, governor of Delta, confirmed that the state is yet to receive the funds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDelta government is in contact with the federal government, especially the office of the attorney-general of the federation, on the issue,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "OPay is reportedly in talks to raise $400 million from investors at a valuation of $1.5 billion, according to an exclusive report from The Information.\n\nOPay is looking to raise funding to finance its expansion plan, having launched in Egypt this year. The payments giant says it processed $1.4 billion in payments in October 2020 alone, and that number also reportedly increased to $2 billion by December 2020.\n\nHaving done impressively in Nigeria since its launch in 2018, the new push for funding means that the company has bigger plans.\n\nAn Africa-focused company with Chinese backers\n\nWhile OPay is based in Nigeria, its backers are mostly Chinese companies like Meituan, a multi-billion-dollar Chinese shopping platform.\n\nIn July 2019, OPay raised $50 million from Sequoia Capital, IDG Capital, Source Code, GSR Ventures and Meituan-Dianping. Opera itself also invested in the round. Four months later, it raised a massive $120 million in a Series B round.\n\nThe company\u2019s initial play seemed to be focused on building a super-app, and it led with its popular bike-hailing service, ORide. But the ban on bike hailing in Nigeria stopped that, and the company focused on what had always been at its core: payments.\n\nThe pandemic is one factor that spurred growth for OPay, and as social distancing and Covid-19 regulations made banking halls challenging to access, more people are leaning on mobile money services. The company also has plans to roll out debit and credit cards.\n\nCompetition in the mobile payments space is stiff; while at one time OPay seemed to be the only company growing its agent network, other rivals have now tapped into the same network. Telcos like MTN and Airtel are spinning their mobile money arm into standalone businesses as they are betting on it for the future.\n\nIt means that at home, where OPay may claim dominance, challengers are arising, and outside Nigeria, grabbing market share from more established players will be no easy feat. Yet, should they successfully raise $400 million, it will be the kind of war chest that makes anything possible.",

          "title": "Dominic Joshua\u2019s \u2018hedge fund\u2019 paid out 30% monthly returns. Then the scam unravelled",
          "text": "He claimed to be investing in real estate, forex and Chanel. There was no proof.\n\nIn December 2020, Michelle Adigun* transferred \u20a6300,000 ($750) to Brisk Capital, an investment firm she discovered on Instagram. The firm promised to pay her 30% of that capital for three consecutive months.\n\nThe promise was fulfilled. The last 30% was paid alongside her initial capital. Thrilled by this, Adigun more than doubled her commitment to \u20a6700,000 on March 2, 2021. Same monthly promise as above. No questions asked.\n\nBut on the 2nd of April when she was to receive the first payment, Adigun did not. \u201cThis is when trouble suddenly started,\u201d she says to TechCabal.\n\nThat payment arrived two weeks later after Adigun repeatedly pressured Dominic Ngene Joshua, the founder and head of Brisk Capital, on Instagram. But that was as good as it got. No return has been paid for May.\n\nAdigun says her sister also invested in Brisk Capital but never received any returns. They and two other people, who spoke to TechCabal anonymously, are among the latest victims of a familiar scam couched as an investment opportunity in Nigeria.\n\nJoshua, the 21-year-old self-styled \u2018Investment Maestro\u2019 behind the Brisk wheel, is now in the custody of the Nigeria Police Force on a number of charges including investment fraud and stealing. A picture of him holding a board with those charges is dated May 1st 2021.\n\nSource: Nnamdi Chife/Twitter\n\nThe police say that Joshua has diverted \u20a62 billion from over 500 investors. He has spent some of that money on \u201cparties, exotic cars, luxury watches, real estate in Abuja, Lagos and Port-Harcourt,\u201d according to a statement from the special fraud unit on Monday.\n\nHow the heck did a 21-year-old do all that in barely six months?\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk business\u201d\n\nBrisk Capital joined Twitter in October 2020. On the 19th of the same month, Joshua\u2019s caption on his first Instagram photo read \u201cLet\u2019s Talk Business. I am back\u2026\u201d\n\nHe had apparently been off social media for one year and had spent time \u201clearning and building a legacy focused on helping people gain financial security.\u201d\n\nIn the weeks and months that followed, his Instagram became a well-curated gallery of professionally taken pictures with apt captions. When EndSARS protesters were shot in Lekki, he said the right things \u2013 calling for calm and mourning the dead.\n\nAfter that week, he moved on to themes more in sync with the brand he was building: wealth, success and investments.\n\n\u201cFor the remaining part of the year, I would be committed towards empowering 5 business owners with $100 each every Friday,\u201d he said on October 26, 2020. Winners would be picked from the comments section. \u201c#fundsfriday.\u201d\n\nPerhaps that should have raised questions but Joshua did not invent giveaways on social media. Influencers with verifiable jobs do it all the time but anyone with enough followers and an image of wealth can also find a thirsty audience. Joshua did not have to prove anything about his job and income even if he was just twenty years old.\n\nPosh Josh sells Chanel\n\nEmpowered with an increasingly posh image and a slick Brisk Capital website, Joshua began taking funds from willing investors.\n\nThere is no difficulty with Brisk. We make investment a simple journey for you by taking the right investment decisions that yield the best result. We take up this responsibility and make your decision to invest a smooth, stress-free and easy one.\u201d Brisk Capital\n\nNnamdi Chife runs Chive GPS, a firm based in Abuja which does debt recovery and background checks. A client contacted him in December saying he wanted to invest with Joshua to earn the promised 30% monthly returns.\n\nAs part of a background check, Chife says he spoke with Joshua to verify Brisk Capital\u2019s business portfolio and investment methodology.\n\nJoshua explained that he invests his pool of client funds in real estate, forex trades and high-value fashion brands like Chanel \u2013 supposedly as a licensee who receives discounts on products.\n\nChife was anything but convinced, advising his client against investing.\n\nAn advisory note from ChiveGPS, a consultancy, to a client who wanted to invest with Dominic Joshua\u2019s Brisk Capital. Source: Chive GPS.\n\n\u201cThere was no record anywhere to establish that he did what he did,\u201d Chife says to TechCabal, describing Brisk Capital as a product-backed Ponzi scheme.\n\n\u201cWhat he provided was a manipulated dashboard of supposed forex trades.\u201d\n\nBut Joshua convinced people that he was legit. Adigun and one other victim say they were partly convinced to invest after a dinner party in December where some music artists performed. Rema, a Nigerian artist, made a gleeful post on Twitter celebrating returns from Brisk.\n\nScreenshot of a tweet by Rema, a Nigerian artist. It is not clear if this was a pad campaign on Brisk Capital\u2019s behalf.\n\nJoshua also had foot soldiers who drove sign-ups.\n\nOne victim who invested \u20a6500,000 and received 30% returns in February and March of this year says she was convinced by Brisk Capital\u2019s marketers in her school, Abia State University. According to Chife, one person brought in hundreds of people who invested up to \u20a6700 million with Brisk Capital.\n\nBut dark clouds began to converge around Joshua in April. After a heady start, his book was now filled with promises of payouts; too many to fulfill.\n\nVictims say Joshua and Brisk Capital stopped responding to payment enquiries on WhatsApp. The latest posts on the company\u2019s Instagram and Twitter accounts are from March.\n\nDoominic\n\nOn April 19, Chive GPS sent a demand notice to Joshua. It was on behalf of a client who had not received the second payment for a \u20a6200 million investment made in December.\n\nWhen Joshua failed to respond to the notice, Chive GPS involved the Nigeria Police\u2019s Special Fraud Unit. They tracked and arrested Joshua who was already making plans to leave Nigeria according to Chife whose tweet this week brought Joshua\u2019s escapades to light.\n\nThe Police said some of the properties Joshua bought with his victims\u2019 deposits have been recovered. He will be charged to a Federal High Court when an ongoing strike by the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria ends.\n\nVictims hope the process will help recover their deposits. \u201cI invested \u20a6200,000 in December, which was due by March. I have not been paid till now,\u201d one said.\n\nShe had invested because she knew people who worked with Joshua. Her friends had cashed out too. But all she has now is the hope of at least getting her capital back.\n\nChife expects the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to take over the matter. But based on other similar Ponzi schemes that have crashed, he is not sure how many people will get back their money from Joshua.\n\nLike victims of other scams, Joshua\u2019s victims admit the 21-year-old\u2019s promise of 30% monthly returns at zero-commission or fund management fees was always too good to be true.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do enough due diligence. I should have gone through appropriate authorities and done my background check,\u201d one said.\n\nShe thought the percentage was outrageous but trusted her friend who was a Brisk Capital agent to help her invest.\n\n\u201cIf I had also known my friend didn\u2019t know Joshua that well, I wouldn\u2019t have invested.\u201d\n\nBack in January, Adigun had been impressed when Joshua temporarily stopped taking deposits. \u201cBrisk gave the impression they were deliberately managing their hedge fund to keep it sizable. I am just surprised that the guy\u2019s intent was to defraud after all.\u201d\n\nApparently, Joshua has admitted his crimes to the Police, pleading for time to return what he owes. That\u2019s good news for Adigun. \u201cTo get my refund. That\u2019s all I want.\u201d\n\n* Name of victims were changed or withheld to protect identity",

          "title": "Dr Vuyane Mhlomi is helping patients receive treatment from the comfort of their own homes",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is telling the stories of Africans making a difference in the world of tech.\n\nBefore he turned ten, a typical Friday would find Vuyane Mhlomi on one of many trains making his way back home from school.\n\nHis journey typically did not end at home. He would only stop there to pick up a change of clothes for his father who was very often hospitalised due to his poorly controlled diabetes.\n\nCoupled with his mother\u2019s cardiac condition, Vuyane spent a lot of his time in hospital queues waiting for any one of his parents to be attended to.\n\nHe tells me that the doctors worked hard. There were just too many people who needed help and not many doctors wanted to move to Khayelitsha, his hometown, due to the high crime rate.\n\nToday, Vuyane is a medical doctor, Rhodes scholar, and the co-founder of Quro Medical \u2013 a startup making it possible for patients to receive the best care from the comfort of their homes.\n\nWhile the company was founded in 2018, the pandemic made a case for what they had always wanted to achieve \u2013 a way for doctors to care for their patients outside of the hospital.\n\n\u201cThere is overwhelming scientific evidence that demonstrates that patients do better at home, but we have very hospi-centric healthcare systems that incentivise treatment in dedicated facilities,\u201d he said during our Google Meet call.\n\nFrom Khayelitsha to Oxford and back to Cape Town, his journey has been one of resilience and a desire to make healthcare accessible for everyone.\n\nHe is Dr Vuyane Mhlomi and this is his life in tech.\n\n\u201cCall my son, my son\u2019s a doctor\u201d\n\nOn the day he graduated from the University of Cape Town, Vuyane was all smiles. He had just finished in the top three of his class and he was standing on the steps outside UCT\u2019s Jameson Hall granting an interview to the Cape Times.\n\nIn this interview he spoke of his mother, Nomsa.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy mom has been my mother and my father. This belongs to her,\u201d he said.\n\nVuyane with his mother Nomsa at his graduation from UCT\n\nVuyane lost his father when he was eleven years old. His mother was left to care for him, his three siblings, and a few cousins, on her own.\n\n\u201cI remember at one point, there were about ten of us in the household,\u201d he told me.\n\nThe family relied on his mother\u2019s disability checks and social grants to get by and of course to go to school.\n\n\u201cI mean, we didn\u2019t grow up in squalor, my mum really did try to provide. But we were definitely poor.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in Khayelitsha was tough and from a young age, Vuyane knew that education was the one way he could possibly move upward socially. This was how he fell in love with studying; it was the way to change things \u2013 his ticket out.\n\nWhen the time came to choose a course to study, medicine was the winning choice.\n\nWhile his decision was due, in part, to the many hours spent sitting and waiting for a doctor to attend to his parents, Vuyane remembers one event that solidified his decision.\n\nIt was in his last year of high school. On the night before his matric exams, his mother had a stroke that they were lucky enough to catch early. She had developed a clot in her heart from an undiagnosed cardiac complication from when she was a kid and that clot had dislodged and gone to her brain.\n\nThankfully, she was able to get access to therapy and this helped to dissolve the clot and limited further neurological damage.\n\n\u201cAnd that inspired me. It told me that when medicine works in the way that it\u2019s supposed to work, there\u2019s a real potential to save lives.\u201d\n\nThere is something to be said about what happens when your loved ones buy into your dreams. In the middle of her stroke, with her speech slurred, Vuyane\u2019s mother said to the doctors attending to her, \u201cCall my son, my son\u2019s a doctor. Call my son.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was in grade 12, he had only just applied to study medicine and was yet to even write his entrance examinations. But there she was, in a time when she did not need to think of anything else, speaking of his dreams as if they had already come to fruition.\n\nOn the day he walked across the stage to accept his medical degree, in her excitement she would tell the Cape Times, \u201cI was sweating. I was sick. I was happy.\u201d\n\nThe road to Rhodes and the birth of a businessman\n\nAfter graduating from UCT, Vuyane could finally begin practicing as a doctor. He began his internship at Soweto\u2019s Chrishani Baragwanath Academic Hospital.\n\nIn his second year there, he applied for the prestigious Rhodes scholarship to Oxford University.\n\n\u201cI was determined to do a PhD, so I reached out to a prospective supervisor \u2013 who did not return my calls.\u201d\n\nNot one to back down easily, Vuyane made calls to Oxford to ask why he was being ignored. His call would eventually get picked up by a professor who was intrigued by his tenacity. He got an interview and the rest they say is history.\n\nIn his Rhodes profile, Vuyane speaks of the opportunity and acknowledges what his being there meant.\n\n\u201cYou can be a Rhodes Scholar even if you are from Khayelitsha.\u201d\n\nVuyane would pursue a PhD in cardiology with his thesis centering around the interesting concept of how the hearts of pregnant women rapidly increase in size to accommodate the foetus but they increase in a way that should normally cause a heart to go into shock.\n\nIn many ways this reminds me of the work Quro Medical is doing today in the field of Remote Fetal Monitoring \u2013 allowing doctors to keep a close watch of a pregnant mother and her foetus while she remains in the comfort of her home.\n\nFollowing his PhD, Vuyane began to figure out next steps.\n\n\u201cThe PhD is an incredibly lonely journey which kind of forces you to reflect a lot about your life and what it is you want to do.\u201d\n\nBy this time he knew he wanted to return home and improve the healthcare system in South Africa. He was a doctor now and could help patients but he knew he didn\u2019t want to just see one patient at a time. He could do more.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d always been entrepreneurial. However, the nature of our academic programmes was not to support anyone who had an interest in business. I recognised that I lacked the commercial attitude that would help me realise and bring the kind of projects that I had in mind to life such as Quro.\u201d\n\nVuyane enrolled in the Sa\u00efd Business School MBA at Oxford shortly after completing his doctoral studies. He would meet one of his co-founders and Quro\u2019s Chief Scientific Officer, Rob Cornish during this MBA.\n\nVuyane returned to South Africa ready to start a business that would change the healthcare landscape forever.\n\nStarting Quro and entrepreneuring while black in South Africa\n\nBefore starting Quro, Vuyane had tried setting up another tele-medicine startup with his friend, business partner and Quro\u2019s co-founder and COO, Zikho Pali. The venture didn\u2019t go far but it did provide a good springboard for the work they would eventually do.\n\nIn April, Quro announced they raised $1.1 million in a seed round. This was huge for many reasons.\n\nOn one hand, Quro finally had capital to begin expanding their services across South Africa and beyond. On the other hand it marked the beginning of a relationship with investors who were truly interested in their wellbeing.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that Zikho and I reflect on quite a bit is the manner in which the investors that we\u2019ve got engaged with us. It was a clear reflection that they didn\u2019t subscribe to the kind of belief systems and whatnot; that we see with white South Africans, given the history and culture of apartheid.\u201d\n\nWith a brilliant idea to bring healthcare directly to patients at home and the numerous use cases the pandemic helped explore, I tried to find out from Vuyane what were some issues he\u2019d faced in pushing a solution that I believe should have guaranteed support on all fronts.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realise how being black would count against me,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHere I was, having done all that people usually say you need to do; get yourself a solid degree, be on a prestigious scholarship, get yourself an MBA, if possible.\n\nI checked all of those things that people say contribute towards your success as an entrepreneur and people wanting to back you.\u201d\n\nBut the reality for black entrepreneurs like Vuyane in South Africa is that they need to go through even more hurdles to get a chance to be listened to.\n\nHe highlights a culture where black entrepreneurs are not getting \u2018backed\u2019 in the real sense. Many people are offered \u2018mentorships\u2019 but this is rarely followed up with actual capital.\n\n\u201cJeff Bezos, Steve Jobs and all of these guys, none of them were backed because they had a single idea and they made zero mistakes, backing someone recognises that you\u2019re going to make mistakes and you\u2019ll pivot as part of the business.\n\nHowever, when we look at the opportunities that have been given to black entrepreneurs in this country, across Africa, you\u2019re not being backed. You\u2019ve been given one miracle, and you\u2019re asked to make a wish. And your role is to try and make sure that you don\u2019t make those mistakes. And I do think that that\u2019s the culture that needs to change, that when we talk about backing black entrepreneurs and African entrepreneurs in particular, we need to make sure that we do just that, that we provide an ecosystem for them to learn.\u201d\n\nAn African solution to a global problem\n\nVuyane loves to cook. He also loves to travel. These are things he does often and, as soon as it is possible, he hopes to do soon. He would like to visit countries in West Africa.\n\nWhen I ask what plans he has for Quro\u2019s expansion across Africa, he gives what I consider a poignant answer.\n\n\u201cI always push back when people say this is an African solution to African problems. This is a global problem. We\u2019re seeing this everywhere. So in our context, it may be an African solution to a global problem.\u201d\n\nFor Vuyane, the goal is simple \u2013 to take over the world.",

          "text": "Lagos, Nigeria. 26th of May, 2021. \u2013 In the recently released Africa\u2019s Best Brands 2021, TECNO ranked for five consecutive years among the TOP 6 brands on the African continent, marking another prestigious recognition of the brand\u2019s leadership in Africa.\n\nEstablished in 2011, the Brand Africa 100: Africa\u2019s Best Brands rankings is the most authoritative survey and analysis on brands and underlying businesses in Africa, based on a study by Geopoll across 28 countries spanning all the five economic regions and analysis and ranking by Kantar and Brand Leadership. Collectively they account for over 80% of the population and over 80% of the GDP of Africa. The 2021 survey was conducted between March and April 2021 and yielded over 80,000 brand mentions and over 3,500 unique brands.\n\nSince its entry into the African market, TECNO\u2019s operations have been customer focused. Year in year out, they have ensured that their offerings are tailored to meet the needs of Africans.\n\nSpeaking to this at a virtual event organised by Brand Africa, Vincent Uzoegbu, Public Communications Manager, TECNO said; \u201cFrom the first day of our business, TECNO made a strategic decision to focus exclusively on Africa, and when we first entered Africa, our core strategy was to focus on sub-Saharan Africa, where mobile phone penetration was still very low and largely ignored by global mobile phone manufacturers. The aim was to bring a mobile phone that would suit African consumers and improve the lives of as many people in Africa as possible by bridging the digital gap through technology and innovation.\u201d\n\nTECNO has worked tirelessly all these years to do just that. With the brand\u2019s Phantom, Camon, Spark and Pova smartphone series, TECNO has been able to set numerous records that define its success and popularity on the continent, evident of its dogged resolve to present Africa with the best of technology and innovation. When TECNO launched dual SIM cards in Africa, there had been nothing of the kind before then. TECNO was also the first to develop long-lasting batteries that lasted 3 days to combat the epileptic power supply in places like Nigeria. The brand was also the first to bring camera solutions on their smartphones that suited the predominant African dark skin.\n\nAfter more than a decade of commitment and consistency, the rewards are finally falling in. Earlier in the year, Counterpoint Research ranked TECNO as Africa\u2019s number one smartphone brand in 2020, stating that TECNO made its breakthroughs in mobile photography technology and continued investment in the market throughout the pandemic despite a challenging year. And now, with Brand Africa\u2019s new rankings, TECNO has once again come out tops, becoming a leading player in mid to high-end mobile brand segments in Africa.\n\nAttai Oguche, Marketing Manager TECNO Nigeria said; \u201cWe\u2019re very honoured to be listed again amongst Africa\u2019s Best Brands ranking this year and to be part of the key contributors to the development of African business. Shouldering African consumers\u2019 trust and great support, we will keep the momentum to continuously unlock our best of contemporary products and technologies for consumers across Africa and inspire them to pursue a better life via mobile technology innovations.\u201d\n\nAbout TECNOTECNO Mobile is a smartphone brand from TRANSSION Holdings.

          "title": "How OctaFX became the first financial company in Nigeria to organise a cooking session for Ramadan",
          "text": "OctaFX brought two popular bloggers together in a cooking studio: the comedian Apaokagi Maryam and the music video director Abdulazeez Greene. They prepared a special evening meal for Ramadan called Iftar and compared the subtleties of cooking with those ingrained in trading.\n\n\u2018Ramadan Special\u2019 is the first cooking show in Nigeria produced by a financial company. However, OctaFX had two great reasons for this accomplishment.\n\nFirst, the company honoured the Holy Month along with its clients. Ramadan is about being with your family, and what better way to bring the relatives together than cooking a tasty meal?\n\nSecond, trading and cooking surprisingly have a lot in common. The two hosts of the show explored this correlation while putting together ingredients for their very own blend of Iftar\u2014a popular evening meal for Ramadan.\n\nThe duo prepared this particular version of iftar quite close to Nigerian tradition, including a fruit salad, grilled chicken, grapes, dates, jollof rice, and a vegetable salad. Influencers Abdulazeez Greene and Apaokagi Maryam rose up to the challenge to deliver this delicious meal.\n\nApaokagi Maryam is a frequent collaborator of the global Forex broker and took part in the last OctaFX Goal Booster promotion. According to Rosbena, she ranked first among the \u2018Top Ten Nigerian Instagram Comedians\u2019. Neither influencers are professional traders but have already had their fair share of exciting Forex encounters.\n\nThe show went live on YouTube on 8 May and is available for viewing. This is not OctaFX\u2019s first take on producing a show. The company enjoys experimenting with formats to bring its clients the most engaging and useful content. In March 2021, OctaFX stepped into an exciting collaboration with the popular rapper Peruzzi, taking part in his music video \u2018Somebody Baby\u2019.\n\nOctaFX is committed to educating its clients about trading in accessible and appealing ways. The company is aspiring to create more shows like \u2018Ramadan Special\u2019 in the future.\n\nOctaFX is a global broker that provides online trading services worldwide since 2011. It offers a state-of-the-art trading experience to over 7 million trading accounts globally. OctaFX has won more than 40 awards since its foundation, including the \u2018Best ECN Broker 2020\u2019 award from World Finance and more recently the 2020 \u2018Best Forex Broker Nigeria\u2019 award and the 2020\u2032\n\nMost Transparent Broker\u2019 award from Global Banking & Finance Review and Forex Awards, respectively. The company is well-known for its social and charity activities.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nNCC to take subscribers\u2019 IMEI | Newsbites\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

Yusuf Buba (APC-Adamawa) made the call in a statement on Wednesday after the committee interfaced with the Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Mr Gabriel Aduda in Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, the entire petition which held itself as a \u201cNon- Paper\u201d, with no authors and signatures was a mere calculated attempt by a faceless group hiding under the banner of a pressure group to halt the ongoing reforms.\n\nBuba said that the reform is dealing with the many years of suspected systemic corruption and official malfeasance in the ministry.\n\nHe described the petition as an attempt to thwart every move to sanitise the operations of the ministry\u2019s headquarters and the foreign missions abroad in order to continue to maintain their vicious grip on the ministry.\n\nThe lawmaker said that no group should be allowed to make such weighty allegations in public without putting their names to the document.\n\nThe lawmaker said that the writers of the faceless petition had sought nothing positive to achieve other than to maliciously malign the characters of the leadership of the ministry and the nation at large.\n\n\u201cPart of the allegations contained in the so- called petition dealt extensively with the fiscal years of 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively.\n\n\u201cMembers, therefore, wondered why Aduda, who assumed duties in January 2021 at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after his redeployment from the Ministry of Sports and Youth Development, was particularly singled out for castigation and indictment.\n\n\u201cThe committee calls on the security agencies to fish out the authors of the petition, which members observed, sought to place the image of the ministry and by extension, that of the entire Nigerian nation, in bad light globally.\n\n\u201cWe laud the current efforts, amidst great challenges, that have been made to promote the mandate of the ministry and drive President Buhari\u2019s reforms agenda by Aduda.\n\n\u201cHe has indeed, pointed out the way he intends to go in actualising the dreams of the National Assembly for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\n\u201cAs a result, the committee, unanimously commends the permanent secretary for his dogged commitment to upholding the reforms of President Buhari at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBuba said that the committee condemned in very strong terms the mischief and malicious damage contained in the said \u201cNon \u2013 Paper\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, some of these suspected corrupt acts and alleged official malfeasance, as is well-known, have been the infamous subjects of recent investigations by the National Assembly.\n\nBuba said that information available to the committee by independent sources, showed a long retinue of accomplices and benefactors inside and outside the Ministry.\n\nHe, however, called for a forensic audit on the finances of the Ministry in those fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020 with a view to ascertaining the true position of things in relation to the finances of the Ministry in those years.\n\nThe statement quoted Aduda to have described the petition as unfortunate saying that it came at a time efforts were being made to put things in their proper places in the ministry.\n\nAduda thanked committee for its commitment to ensuring that things were done right in the ministry, promising to do everything necessary to put the ministry in the right order.\n\nHe pledged to continue to reposition the ministry towards achieving its mandate and role of promoting the image of the nation through their representational mission of the country in the global community.\n\n...",

          "text": "Veteran lawyer, Afe Babalola, has described as a waste of time and energy, the planned review of the 1999 Constitution by the National Assembly.\n\nHe said instead, the National Assembly should move for a national conference where issues bedeviling the nation could be identified, discussed and resolved through a roundtable talk.\n\nAccording to him, there is no way the National Assembly can amend the 1999 Constitution to cure the inherent defects, if the fraud in the system is not first got rid of.\n\nMr Babalola, who is also the founder of Afe Babalola University, Ado Ekiti, spoke in Ado Ekiti, on Wednesday.\n\nHis submission is coming a day after the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, told members of the Senate Committee of the Review of the Constitution that a national dialogue was the way forward.\n\nMr Akeredolu, who was not necessarily opposed to the exercise, said the clamour of the majority of the people for a national dialogue should be given a chance.\n\nThe National Assembly had started its zonal public hearings where inputs are gleaned from the various constituencies to form the basis for legislative action on the document.\n\nMr Babalola said the Constitution in practice is defective and needed to be reworked, having been bequeathed to the people by the military.\n\n\u201cAgainst the background of the massive demand by Nigerians, home and abroad, for a true federal constitution made by the people and for the people, the National Assembly is calling for Public Hearing in the country\u2019s six Geo-political Zones for people\u2019s inputs on any issue of interest to enable the National Assembly to amend the 1999 constitution,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is common knowledge that the 1999 Constitution was made by the Military which in its wisdom claimed that it was made by the people.\n\n\u201cSecondly, it is impossible, by way of amendment, to take away the military system of government under the 1999 Constitution or the power and control of public funds by the President.\n\n\u201cOr can we, by way of amendment, change the Judicial powers of the President under the 1999 Constitution?\n\n\u201cThe root cause of our problems, which has brought Nigeria to the brink of extinction, is the 1999 Constitution foisted on it by the Military when it was exiting the reign of governance in 1999.\n\n\u201cThe fact remains that you cannot amend a Coconut tree which has no branches to become and Iroko tree which has branches. It is a well-known fact that everything about the 1999 constitution is wound round the Presidential system of government.\n\n\u201cWhy then is the National Assembly afraid of calling a National Constitutional Conference to fashion out a new true federal constitution and come up with a Parliamentary system of government like we had in 1963.\n\n\u201cAlternatively, since amendment in law includes substitution for an existing document, why is it that the National Assembly cannot call for a Public Hearing on the substitution of the 1999 Constitution for the 1963 Constitution which was made with the consent of the people?.\n\n\u201cThe proposed amendment to the 1999 Constitution, whichever way you look at it, is a futile exercise. We all know that previous sessions of National Assembly had made laws to convene National Conference.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, advise that the current National Assembly should call for a National Conference to discuss and make a new true federal constitution which will provide for a Parliamentary system of government.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe lawyer had earlier volunteered to host and bankroll a national dialogue that would aggregate the views if well meaning Nigerians on how to resolve the myriad of problems facing the country.\n\nThe lawmakers conducting the zonal public hearing in the zone arrived in Akure on Tuesday for the exercise.",

          "title": "Children must be brought up to be most innovative \u2013 Modupe Adeyinka-Oni",
          "text": "Mrs. Modupe Adeyinka-Oni has been involved with teaching youngsters for 38 years. She was a teacher at the Corona Schools before establishing Standard Bearers School, Lekki some 24 years ago. She is very passionate about matters that have to do with the application of technology in the school system,bridging the gap between different categories of schools in the country, education for all and the continued development of the teacher. Here are excerpts from an interview with her:\n\nStandard Bearers School is 24 years old and you have raised children across this span of time. Now you see your products out there, children you have raised, and who have gone on to play roles in society. How do you connect with this as an educationist?\n\nIt is very simple. I was working with Corona School and I had a very fantastic career, I enjoyed my job but my first child was slightly introverted and I came to realize that the big school didn\u2019t really work for him. Corona school delivered their service in that the children did very well. But sometimes it goes beyond doing well in school. It is also about having the freedom to choose and having been taught in a different way myself, I could connect with the need for a bit more engagement. And I felt that my son would probably benefit from a smaller school.\n\nAs an educationist also, I could reflect on the positive and the negative sides of his school vis-\u00e0-vis his personality. I say this because before my son started with Corona, he had been in a very small nursery school. Now at Corona, for literally one and a half term, my son would go out at break time, stand on one spot, watch the other children play, and not play with anyone.\n\nAs a young mother, I was anxious. And because I was also a popular teacher in the school, everybody wanted to also play with him. I kept on talking about it at home, and then one day he decided to play with them, but he still didn\u2019t go out there to make a lot of friends.\n\nDifferent schools work for different children. And so, I needed a school where my children would not just go but will thrive. I did not go on and pull him out of Corona school at this time though because I didn\u2019t even understand it the way I understand it now. He however left to come to my school much later and that was because I discovered a learning gap and that gap was in reading. My son is extremely brilliant and he has the ability to memorize anything.\n\nBut then I discovered that though he was coming up in unit position in class, he couldn\u2019t read. We went through a series of questions and answers with him, and finally he revealed to us that his teacher had called him ode because when he came to the school, he was using phonics to pronounce words. And she said: \u2018why are you reading like an ode, read properly.\u2019 He didn\u2019t know what ode was, but other children laughed. And he made up his mind that he was never going to read in class again because he didn\u2019t want to be called ode.\n\nWhen they call him to read, he would just stand there. \u2018Okay you don\u2019t want to read, go and sit down.\u2019 And I didn\u2019t get to know about this until the summer of his fourth year, and when he was going to Grade 5.\n\nAnd so he came over to our school and in six months he was reading. And he tells the story with pride anytime; \u2018I learnt to read in primary 5, I learnt it and imbibed it, and not only did I then want to read but I also wanted to write.\u2019 He is indeed very good when it comes to reading and writing skills.\n\nSo, in talking about my children here in the school, and what I think is most notable about them, I will say it is their confidence. We don\u2019t tell them what they cannot do, rather we tell them that if you can dream it, you can do it. We are a small school, a family school, and we believe that children should be able to express themselves in their natural environment. Because if there is anything to correct, it is through their expression that we can see it. We make it a way of life for them, so, they are forever performing.\n\nWe dance. It is a skill that I came to understand, like speaking and listening, is also a language of communication and the children actually ascribe high value to it.\n\nDance for us is mandatory. I tell them when you get to secondary school and they call on you to dance, please step out and dance. Because that is one singular thing that will define where people place you. You don\u2019t know it but I know it as an educator.\n\nWhere the children will place you in terms of the seniors and where the staff will place you. They will say you are forward, but indeed if they see you as forward, they will continue to engage you in that way. So, it is mandatory for us. We got them a very good dance teacher who takes them through what we call creative development. Creative development is about dance, spoken word, drama, and music. And in this way, we have improvised a curriculum that is still fashioned along the line of the Nigerian and British curriculum but it is uniquely different in the sense that we have put the creative side of learning into everything. So, with every opportunity, we can turn any lesson into a movie production. If you came in here earlier today (International Cultural Diversity Day), every class had picked a country to focus on. The children in that class dressed themselves in the attire of, and learned about the country, and had to talk about what they learned. And every child has to say something; that is another thing that we do here.\n\nAnd so what happens when they leave? With the amount of confidence we have instilled in them and that ability to do, to innovate and think outside the box, we have had children who have gone into the entertainment world, some of them have gone to the banking sector, etc.\n\nRecently I bumped into a parent who I had not seen since the children left the school and he was so excited because he said his three children have done fantastically well because of the foundation we gave them.\n\nConfidence is a most important thing for children. For a lot of children, their voices are being drowned out under that old philosophy of children only being permitted to listen and not be heard.\n\nI believe so much in this soro soke generation; let them have their say and help them to shine the right values behind what they are saying. We are a school that has imbibed the very notable \u20187 habits of highly effective people\u2019 which we communicate through a programme called \u2018the leader in me.\u2019 So, our children understand the same thing. Right down to nursery, they know it.\n\nWhen we start putting those kinds of values in them, we believe that our children are born to be leaders, they have already learned the foundation. So, we have five pillars that we focus on: creativity, innovation, leadership, entrepreneurship, and technology. Outside of the core academics, they must absolutely embrace these five. We believe it is a combination of that and the academics that go on to set them apart. A lot of them have gone on to Ivy League universities, are working in Wall Street, Silicon Valley, etc. I have children that started in finance, and because of the knowledge of the fact that they can evolve, have also gone on to demonstrate interest in technology, Bitcoin, and stuff like that.\n\nHow do your children with such high competencies, high expectations eventually connect with the many other Nigerians who do not have the skill set we are talking about? Is there enough being done to ensure that this does not become a problem going forward?\n\nFirst of all, I want to go back to the question of those children you say we are raising. Yes, some of them are going abroad and some of them are attending universities here. Now I have mentioned the \u2018soro-soke\u2019 generation. Do you know what I think about them? Because of their education, their ability to conduct research, inquire to know more, and seek knowledge for knowledge sake, they have come to understand that the way Nigeria is being governed today is absolutely wrong. Our children are not tribal, they are not religious, indeed they respect everybody\u2019s religion. Even on issues of sexual orientation, they are not as shocked as we are.\n\nWhat I find that is unique about these children is that they are ready to work hard, and they understand that Nigeria will change when everybody is given a fair chance. And that is why those of my generation \u2013 people who went to school between 1955 and 1985 \u2013 must concede that we haven\u2019t done a good job. It is our fault.\n\nAnd I connect this to several factors, including the fact that we did not want to be in government ourselves and we thought that we were making a good decision for ourselves and our families, but the reality today is that though there are families that have benefited but Nigeria overall has suffered.\n\nSomeone said to me yesterday that when we call ourselves the giants of Africa, it is a lie. We are in truth, one of the poorest nations in Africa. In which other country do they treat their human resource the way Nigerian leaders do? When China began to educate their people, they amassed so much wealth and power that even America now feels threatened.\n\nBut what have we done? We have crippled our nation by our own selfishness and our own greed. I count myself as part of the problem because I am asking myself why do we have the private and public schools? Why is it that the private school is thriving and the public school is seemingly deteriorating? For someone who went to a public unity school, it does not make sense. I went to school with children from all types of backgrounds. I don\u2019t have an elitist mindset but somehow when we graduated and insisted on staying in our own personal spaces, we have now woken up to find out that 35% of our youth are illiterates.\n\nThen you also ask yourself; we have had 20 years of an elected government, and in these twenty years of democracy, the politicians, the leaders, the whole system, has practically failed the people.\n\nNow back to the children, the millennials, Generation Y, Generation Z; no matter how bad or corrupt they are, they will never be like our generation. This is because many of the children who came out for the #EndSARS protests are children of the elite who are questioning the decisions of their parents.\n\nIndeed, I think the first thing elite Nigerians need to do is to tell ourselves the truth because it is only through this that we can find solutions.\n\nLook at the kidnapping, I was asking the other day why is it so bad? Somebody said because people are hungry. And yes, they are hungry.\n\nSome people came to Nigeria to do a documentary of Nigeria and as they were getting ready to go back, we had a chat. From it, I found out that so many African countries no longer see us as the continental giant.\n\nI was told that it is not as if there is no corruption elsewhere in Africa, but nobody in Kenya will take a contract and not do the contract. They are so concerned about their image, especially in their communities. They want to be able to point to a project and say I did that for my community. But in Nigeria, the politicians think they can get away with it, so they just rob the nation.\n\nYou made some point about the use of technology in the educational space. That brings me to the Technovation Challenge. Thinking about it, I am asking myself how much technology can children grasp at this stage? How is it designed and how important is technology at this time?\n\nPrior to 2019, I had started to look more critically at the role of technology beyond the subject as ICT but I couldn\u2019t feel it in the mind because I am not very skilled in technology myself. In January of 2019, the coding instructor in school approached me and said there is a competition, and the period of time they had to take part in this competition was the period where they had finished their exams and I was myself trying to get my mind around how to engage the children as they had finished their exams. Exams that used to start after Easter in the country with common entrance, individual schools now set their date and time, and we start those exams now as early as October of the preceding year. So I called the children, about 5 of them, and told them that there is this competition, would they like to do it. They said yes, Mrs Oni. I said look this competition is going to require that you put in a lot of work. They said it was okay. I said it is going to require five to six hours a day, meaning you will come in and learn this thing. They said yes. Again, not everybody can get to that level of discipline at the age they were which is between 10 and 11. The whole techno-vation challenge is teaching not just the tech side of things but the business side also. So, they came in as project managers and they all had departments, learned the marketing side of things, and everybody found their own niche and together they built this app which got them into the finals. And when I got to hear that they were in the finals, the first thing that struck me was that we were in a competition with children from around the world, and most of the time without speaking their languages, the organisers were able to use technology to communicate with everybody, such that they will actually get them to collaborate on projects yet they could not speak each other\u2019s languages. I saw here there that there was something that had taken place that we had missed.\n\nThe second thing that caught my attention was that we visited Uber and we were talking to their top management and most of these people were under 30. There was only one Indian lady that was maybe like 33. And then I said to myself that something has happened here that Nigeria has refused to also allow to happen back at home. These are the people driving Uber in their jeans, khakis, and shorts. This is the environment where we are, the workforce of the future, and back in Nigeria we are still at the bottom. I had just encountered a shift and I came back with a stronger determination to ensure that we bridge the gap in our own teaching and learning.\n\nNow this is a very difficult thing to do because I had to come back and try to transmit that to my teaching staff and for a lot of us, when we look at the philosophies of education that inform our different practice in the classroom, the reality is that most teachers in Nigeria are oriented towards pouring both the wealth and limits of their knowledge into their children. So, the children are the receptors and they call it banking education.\n\nFrom my days in school, to what I saw in America, and coming back, I understood that there was a challenge. It is not easy to get people to change their teaching style, especially people who have become established. Because that pyramid shift is the toughest part of the change process. This requires having a different mindset to say the way I teach is wrong, I need to let go. It has therefore been a lot of push and pull. I model it, I talk about it, I wield the big stick if it is necessary, but at the end of the day the staff understand that my desire is to get them to be better in their teaching and to make the teaching and learning in the school more interesting.\n\nIt is the same process we have to go through nationally but our leaders don\u2019t understand it. These youths are trying to do things, trying to make a difference out there, giving online solutions to the back office of the school, to help with the collection of data, there are so many offerings, they need to be understood.\n\nI belong to a group where we have actually taken on board the assignment to actually help schools whose pupils are paying between N20-25, 000 and below as fees to help to train their teachers. And it is just a voluntary thing that we are doing.\n\nJust recently we had our first online version of the project and we were able to reach more people than we could have at a physical event. We had people from Port Harcourt and other places participating. It showed us that the teachers are actually looking for the help it is just that nobody really remembers them. We are committed to working with them. Next month, we are having another. What we do is that we partner with a few NGOs who bring us schools and they use their centres, and have representatives from various schools attending. But we also share the Zoom link for those that can go online from their private homes to join in as well. The feedback has been tremendous and we are all encouraged to keep at it.\n\nThere are so many other things. I am involved in projects working with IDP camps, we are trying to find educational and even online solutions to solving the problem of the lack of education among the IDPs. One of the pledges I made to God when I celebrated my 60th birthday was that I will dedicate time to the teaching of his children to ensure that they get better instruction. Because we are all creations of God and there is nobody that God created that he didn\u2019t give a talent to. It is the same with everybody, we are all on this line, everyone\u2019s talent is there, everyone has their place and their usefulness. For my team and for all those that have partnered with us, it is important that we correct the mistake and everybody makes a little bit of effort to support. And it is not a handout. You cannot continue to give money because it is said that it is better to teach a person to fish than to give them fish. And that is where I am.\n\nCovid happened and affected the world. You are talking about online interactions; I am not too sure a lot of that was going on before Covid?\n\nNo, it wasn\u2019t. For the education sector, Covid disrupted us into a much better place. It helped us see ourselves not just as Nigerians. One thing about Nigerians is that we compare ourselves and status by what is going on in Nigeria. But Covid pushed us to compare ourselves on a global stage, and so having exposed us to the world and exposed the world to us, there is no going back.\n\nIn education, we were teaching classes online on account of the COVID restrictions. Now, though we are back in physical school, every child is with their laptop. Assignments are done on the laptop. I tell parents when they complain about their children staying on the computer, that the key thing they have to learn from that computer is their typing speed because tomorrow that is how they are going to take their notes. Nobody writes long notes anymore and this is a good reality check for Nigerians.\n\nNow having said that, there is the expense of pivoting into digital learning and there is even a greater expense that has to be made and that is in upskilling.\n\nOn The Platform, they asked me at the end of my speech, \u2018we don\u2019t have computers, projectors, how will we do this online learning.\u2019 I said to them even my school has not yet attained to where it is supposed to be in digital learning. But the first thing beyond learning how to use the computer or projector is to identify what courses you are going to teach online. Because the teachers who are going to teach these subjects have to be taught. And many of them don\u2019t know how to put on the computer. So, it is an investment.\n\nNow during the World Economic Forum in 2019, there was this session on the future of work. And I recall a speaker saying that in sub-Saharan Africa there is going to be a loss of 55,000 jobs, but that the good news is that there will be replaced by 104,000 new jobs.\n\nThe question is how are we going to upskill the people to enter into these new jobs, because they are technology-related. We have the population, but the people that have the technology do not have the numbers. Africa has the population and does not have the knowledge. So, the world understands that they have to focus on Africa.\n\nIn fact, it is being said that in the next decade, Africa will be home to the headquarters of many global organizations. Now if that is going to happen, we have to have the local skills to take those jobs. So that got me thinking about this upscaling and upskilling. The cost of doing that is the problem. Africa/Nigeria does not have the resources for it now. The cost of building and equipping a school and training the teachers for just one school is massive. If we look at the budget of education in our country, basically what it does right now is that it pays salaries; there is no money for resources, maintenance, even sending teachers for programmes to improve themselves. And because of that, many teachers don\u2019t even know that they have inadequacies in their learning.\n\nWhen we are talking of the digital era, if we don\u2019t solve the human resource part of it then the other problem will not even go away. One of the things we are focusing on is the redevelopment of teachers, and it is only after we have gotten the trainers to our own side that we can now say let us start training the children. It is a somewhat long process but the truth is that it cannot be denied anymore; the Nigerian educational system is broken.\n\nOn the issue of the gulf in the sector and how we are to bridge it, our first note is that it wasn\u2019t always this wide. That said, we have to fix the trainers and fix the gap between the private and the public. One of the things we see now is that for beneficiaries of high-end private school education, many of them go away for more schooling and then stay abroad. Back at home, you have those who endure a lot of our broken systems which give very little value and it is these same children that some people are now calling hoodlums. I don\u2019t call them hoodlums, because at the end of the day if we failed to do something and we see the result of our own work, we should not now say that because we failed, they failed too. No, we must try educating them properly.\n\nWhy do we have so many hackers in Nigeria? Because they have gone to the dark side of the internet. Why not give them amnesty and say that this your skill, let us put you in a programme, take a job. They are brilliant, the fact that they can do the things they do shows that they are intelligent. But though many of them can do these things but they are not really able to read and write to pass and go on to the university because they were never really properly taught. But because they are smart, they are watching someone do it, and modelling the things they need to do and they do trial and error and they get it. So, they learnt on the job.\n\nIt is the same problem somewhat with Boko Haram. Half of those who are doing these things don\u2019t know that Saudi Arabia is like the city of gold where everything is so clean and fine, and Western education is thriving there. But here they are being conditioned to believe that western education is bad because they do not want their eyes opened. At the end of the day it is a lack of knowledge.\n\nIf you have to design something like an adjustment in our educational sector, take the Ministry of Education and tell us three to five things we have to turn around. What should we do, because if we don\u2019t fix education, we can\u2019t fix the country?\n\nIf I was in government and looking at what is going on, I think anybody will know that illiteracy is the problem. Whichever way we can do it, let us go back to the basics. When the white man came to Nigeria and brought education, how did they teach us their language that became our lingua franca. They taught it, they encouraged us to speak it. We saw it as something that was new, novel, and there were incentives for coming to school.\n\nWe need to look at some of the things that they did. Yes, some of the things that they did got to influence us but the truth of the matter is that Nigeria is influencing the whole world now because they are dancing to Burna Boy now, they are giving him a Grammy award. We have things that we are exporting that are good.\n\nLook at Nigerians abroad, how many of them are in Biden\u2019s administration. We are doing good things, but must our children have that mindset that except they escape from Nigeria, they cannot be better? Many of these people who are now in the oppressive state of mind went abroad and got western education themselves. Literacy is what is going to set the minds of each person free. Nigeria is in this state because we have too many illiterates who cannot think for themselves and all they do is listen to that mob voice, \u2018they say we should do this and we will do it.\u2019 They cannot stop to reason if that is good or not.\n\nMaslow\u2019s hierarchy of need places food and shelter at the base of the pyramid. Most of Nigeria is still wallowing in that place. If we don\u2019t do things about food and shelter by giving them the opportunity to earn, give incentives to people to learn to read and speak properly, and then empower them, we would still have issues.\n\nDid you see a recent video of ewedu being sold in Walmart? If we don\u2019t start farming it for exports, the Chinese and Malaysians will overtake us. Just like the way Malaysia took our oil palm. We need to go into mechanized farming, we need to upscale everything. So, farmers own everything, but we should have arrangements where farmers harvest their crops, you do quality control, and everybody knows that from your farm, whatever you harvest this company is buying it. It is a fixed price.\n\nWhat does this do for them? They can look after their children, they can improve their lives, they can send their children to school and at the same time they are working to ensure that the products get better and better, and they have a market and that market begins to export. We have to make them equitable people of society by giving them a better life.\n\nCan you see how many people are homeless in Lagos? We have to make them understand that people need to stop coming to Lagos, there is nothing in Lagos. Let them stay in their villages. There was a time when the community will find one smart child, put money together, and send that child to school. We need to go back to that. Communities need to get involved in the process of education. Leaders of the community are encouraging all the children to go to school, and in going to school they are putting incentives in front of them to keep going.\n\nHow much is our politics the problem?\n\nIt is a problem because we elected the wrong leader and we keep getting them there because they come every election year with their garri and their 500 naira and hungry people think this is our time to take from the purse. Immediately they get that mandate, they are gone for four years, and in that period, they don\u2019t see a need to do anything.\n\nParties are too expensive on the front end, and it is too expensive on the back end when they get into office because they feel that they have come to recoup the money that they spent in the process. So, it is winner takes all kind of mentality. That is not politics.\n\nWhat will be the shape of the school of the future. What are you seeing?\n\nI believe that because we now have digital meetings and can look at what the trends in the world are pointing to, schools will no longer exist as we have them today. I believe that children will have a greater choice and parents will allow them to make that choice. We have seen it with the Covid where some children have stayed home for a whole year and have not missed out on any activity. When they grow up, what is it that someone will say to them about keeping their children in online schools that will sound strange? They have experienced it even if it is for a month.\n\nI think that the evolution of schools is for us to think beyond the indoor. Recently, we had an event, an election, and the head boy candidate had to present his manifesto, and in his manifesto, he said I promise that I will work with the management to ensure that all of our classes are filled with engagements. What the children want is that they don\u2019t want you to talk to or at them, they want you to engage them.\n\nLearning in the future is going to be about doing. It is what we should have been doing, because in doing so many things happen. If you are having an engaging class, as a teacher you can direct the dialogue, you can listen and really understand if the children have learned what you are teaching because it would be demonstrated in the kind of conversations they have. You can also take advantage of that that kind of conversation to find out more about what they want.\n\nWe are all lifelong learners. The greatest lifelong learner is the teacher not the child. Your job is to bring together the collaboration of everyone, their efforts, their research into a position paper on that topic. So when before now, you will write notes and come and tell them that these are your notes, now that is becoming the wrong course to follow. The world is changing so fast and if you are not connected to the internet, you will miss out on a lot of information. What we do here is that we have partnered with a lot of organizations, and we are using their tools, we are opening up our schools to a more robust teaching and learning engagement environment.\n\nOur teachers have to go outside to teach. There is just so much that is new, existing, that is happening in the classroom. We all know that there are videos online that we can use to teach and also we are now getting our children to make videos. So instead of submitting plagiarised works, they understand research and copyright, they cannot just copy and paste. Summarize it in your own words. So, we now tell them instead of submitting a PowerPoint presentation, do a video.\n\nWhat this whole process is teaching us is that education is constantly changing. Children in primary school today we are teaching them for jobs that don\u2019t exist. If the jobs don\u2019t exist, why are we teaching them? Only the skills and competences of the 21st century are what we are focused on.\n\nWe seem to be caught between the old and the new. Your school has done a lot in managing the tension by being dynamic, but what about the bigger picture?\n\nChange happens in one community at a time. It takes one person to start it. That is not to say I am calling myself a change maker but who knows. I feel that a lot more people are aware, I feel that the soro soke generation are more demanding, especially of what they want for their children. I feel like this whole process cannot be stopped, and the fact that the government refused to acknowledge it but history has recorded it was actually the catalyst. From that we have seen a lot of things happening in the nation.\n\nFinally, CSR. You are engaged in a number of projects, helping with the training of teachers. How long have you been doing it and going forward what next should we expect?\n\nOver 10 years. We were doing it in physical schools. We started in Ijesha, we took about 30 schools in Ijesha and we had a five-day conference and we worked with them about how to teach English, classroom management, classroom discipline, and everything that had to do with teaching. We also talked about their personal development. We had people from HR, we had educators and we had this five-day programme with them. Again, it is voluntary work so we actually contributed the money ourselves.\n\nThe next one we took it to Ogudu and we had a bigger event with about 200 plus people in attendance. Then there was a third one. And then we now started having smaller ones because donor fatigue set in. We picked it up again during Covid and I think this time we have better chances.\n\nAnother thing that we tried to do was that they had the option of if we wanted, they could come to our school and shadow my teachers. That particular school in Ijesha did that and when I called the proprietress, she said it has totally transformed her school.\n\nWhat we are planning to do now is to take the initiative online. This is how we can bridge the gap.\n\nFinally, one of the benefits of the Covid-19 era for me is that the problem with the children on the street has become my problem. I know that I have made a pact with God that if he empowers me with the resources, this is going to be my legacy project. It is about impacting the children. Because we cannot multiply the teachers that quickly and in such mass through physical outreach, that is why we need an online solution.",
          "summary": "Now you see your products out there, children you have raised, and who have gone on to play roles in society.\nAnd so, I needed a school where my children would not just go but will thrive.\nWe are a small school, a family school, and we believe that children should be able to express themselves in their natural environment.\nWhere the children will place you in terms of the seniors and where the staff will place you.\nFor a lot of children, their voices are being drowned out under that old philosophy of children only being permitted to listen and not be heard.",

All leaders should invest in one another and thinking of each other\u2019s well-being, and do whatever it takes to create a stable and sustainable African continent.\n\n\u201cThe continued emergence and spread of this crisis require resources and a mindset to pursue peace, also put in place good politics. We cannot just switch off crisis unless we invest in addressing the root causes of these problems.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, African leaders have had discussions, but there is the need to \u201cput a sense of urgency because we have other crises like poverty that we need to address.\u201d\n\nMr Kagame said to African leaders to capitalise and profit from the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCTA), adding that the continent stands to gain more by coming together.\n\n\u201cWe must utilise the youth, women, and other institutions to help us overcome the crises faced across the continent, but we cannot drop the ball right in the middle of it for smaller interests or benefits and forget about the common interest.\n\n\u201cFor example, we have put in place the AfCTA.

          "title": "NGF: Legislature, Judiciary autonomy doesn\u2019t require Executive Order 10",
          "text": "The Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) Wednesday said the Executive Order 10 issued 2020 by President Muhammadu Buhari to guarantee financial autonomy of state legislature and judiciary was needless.\n\nThe governors said there was no basis for the Order aimed at supporting implementation of financial autonomy for the judiciary and legislature, insisting the president was ill-advised.\n\nNGF Vice Chairman and Sokoto state Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal stated this in Ado-Ekiti at a colloquium organised by the Ekiti state Ministry of Justice Academy, in honour of the retiring Chief Judge of the state, Justice Ayodeji Daramola.\n\nSpeaking on \u201cThe Judicial Autonomy: Perspective of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum,\u201d Tambuwal said the Forum expected President Buhari to have consulted widely before issuing the order, describing the unilateral exercise of such powers as \u2018sheer illegality.\u2019\n\nWhile pointing out that the governors were not opposed to financial autonomy for the concerned arms of government, Tambuwa said the delay in implementation was occasioned by the process, structure and quest for legal clarity.\n\n\u201cNigeria in Section 121(3) provides that: \u201cAny amount standing to the credit of the \u2013 (a) House of Assembly of the State; and (b) Judiciary In the Consolidated revenue Fund of the State shall be paid directly to the said bodies respectively; in the case of the judiciary, such amount shall be paid directly to the heads of the courts concerned.\n\n\u201cAs Governors of the 36 States under the platform of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), let me state very clearly that we are unequivocally committed to the autonomy of the judiciary and the legislature.\n\n\u201cIn the journey to our current position as Chief Executives of our various States, we have all benefitted from the independence and professionalism of the judiciary, be it at the level of administering our Oath of Office or our electoral victory being upheld at the Tribunal or in Court in the interest of democracy, justice, and fairness.\n\n\u201cThe concept of judicial autonomy has its foundations in the time tested doctrine of Separation of Powers. The main object is to avoid autocratic government by eliminating the over concentration of powers in one person, agency or institution.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical democratic elements is the principle of checks and balances between and among the three arms of government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe recent misunderstanding on the financial autonomy of the Judiciary is predicated on the need to establish an implementation framework to the 4th Alteration of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in Section 121(3). What we have questioned, and we have made this known at every opportunity, is the process of implementing this provision of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cAs governors, we will be failing in our responsibility if we refuse to draw the attention of the President, stakeholders and the country to grave concerns about the constitutionality of Executive Order 10 of 2020. That was the basis of the position that we took on the Executive Order 10.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Order 10 ostensibly intended to support the implementation of judicial financial autonomy, was completely unnecessary and ill advised. Let me at this juncture state clearly that we never questioned the right of Mr. President to issue Executive Orders. We only stated that Section 121(3) did not require Presidential Executive Fiat to become implementable.\n\nTambuwal expressed delight that consensus has finally been reached on the autonomy conundrum and opined that the strike is expected to be suspended anytime soon.\n\n\u201cThe agreement allows a period of 45 days for implementation structures to be put in place across States including the enactment of a Fund Management Law which will grant the Judiciary the power to manage its capital and recurrent expenditures in accordance with the provisions of constitution.\n\n\u201cBudgetary releases to the judiciary will be pro-rated based on the actual revenues recorded each month by the state government. Monthly revenue reconciliation and allocation will be presided over by a State Account Allocation Committee (SAAC) to be set up under the Fund Management Law \u2013 a similar practice to what we have at the federal level.\n\n\u201cWe hope that this will put an end to the long weeks of strike action that have seen our judicial and criminal justice system grounded to a halt. We have lost so much in the past weeks. The big takeaway is the centrality of communication, sincerity, trust and dialogue.\n\n\u201cWe have requested that the President disbands the Presidential Implementation Committee on the Autonomy of State Legislature and Judiciary, to avert future rancor between the various arms of government, arising from misconceived guidance from a committee lacking the requisite understanding of constitutional matters,\u201d the NGF said.\n\nCorroborating Tambuwal\u2019s position, the NGF Chairman and Ekiti state Governor Kayode Fayemi said the presidential directive was unconstitutional and illegal as it undermined the executive power of the governors stipulated in the 1999 Constitution.\n\nFayemi said the states\u2019 governors were committed to financial autonomy for the legislature and judiciary, stressing that \u201cdemocracy can\u2019t endure if we subject the independence of these two arms to the jackboots of the governors.\n\n\u201cWho is to take capital spending for the judiciary and legislature has always been the controversy. The governors will continue to hold our judiciary with reverence because I know that this democracy will not endure, if we subject our judiciary to the jackboots of the executive.\n\n\u201cThere is no questioning the fact that we can do a lot more for our judiciary to make it truly independent.\u201d\n\nThe Sokoto state governor expressed happiness that a consensus was finally reached on the matter of judicial autonomy.\n\n\u201cThe agreement allows a period of 45 days for implementation structures to be put in place across States including the enactment of a Fund Management Law which will grant the Judiciary the power to manage its capital and recurrent expenditures in accordance with the provisions of constitution. Budgetary releases,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Justice Daramola said judicial autonomy was essential ingredients for democratic consolidation.\n\nHe further added that judicial autonomy was adequately guaranteed in the 1999 Constitution, saying Section 121 (3) was simple and should be respected by state governors.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

Our hope is that in the next one month we will ensure that the remaining states that do not have the model schools have them; the construction will start very soon,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that the whole idea about the construction of the smart schools is to ensure that children in the country compete effectively in the 21st century, adding that in many parts of the world, e-learning has become an integral part of the school system and Nigeria cannot afford to be left behind.\n\nHe said while private schools in the country are already providing e-learning facilities for their pupils, the government is pushing hard to ensure that pupils in public schools have e-learning facilities irrespective of whether they can afford to pay for them.\n\nBobboyi said UBEC was collaborating with state governments to make the model schools a paradigm that states can replicate, adding however that the carrying capacity of the schools will not be high.\n\nHe added that the commission was in discussion with the Nigerian Communication Commission, NCC, National Information Technology Development Agency, NITDA, internet service providers and other stakeholders to ensure internet connectivity in the schools.\n\n\u201cThe power systems will be provided by the Chinese company Huawei, we are making effort to ensure that we have stable power supply at the end of the day,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the commission also started vocational schools during the north east intervention, adding that when a school is built, vocational equipment are provided to help the children learn a trade.\n\nOn counterpart funding for states to access UBEC allocations, he said as at 31st of December 2020, about 120 billion was lying in the coffers of UBEC unutilised by state governments, adding that the major problem with the allocations is slow utilisation of funds.\n\nEarlier, the Director of Physical Planning, UBEC, Engr. Abubakar Sa\u2019ad, said the smart schools initiative, which was started by the leadership of Bobboyi is aimed at creating a conducive learning environment for the children.\n\nSa\u2019ad, who was recently honoured as a fellow of the Nigeria Society of Engineers, in its 17th fellowship award ceremony, said he will ensure that all the school buildings are constructed according to specifications.\n\nThe director who is currently coordinating efforts in the construction of the The director who is currently coordinating efforts in the construction of the smart schools across the country, added that some staff of the commission are currently deployed to take inventory of all UBEC-funded schools affected by rainstorm.",
