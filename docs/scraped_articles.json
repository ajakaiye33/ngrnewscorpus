          "title": "Rivers APC tackles Wike as gov threatens to prosecute Amaechi, Cole",
          "text": "The Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, on Friday swore in three new commissioners, including an Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, whom he gave the charge to probe and prosecute his predecessor, Rotimi Amaechi, for the alleged disappearance of $50m from the state\u2019s coffers during his administration.\n\nAccording to Wike, there is a need for the people of Rivers State and the rest of the world to know what actually happened to a sum of $50m from the illegal sale of some state\u2019s assets.\n\nHe said Amaechi would be probed and prosecuted alongside Mr Tonye Cole, Sahara Energy and others.\n\nBut in a swift reaction, the spokesman for the All Progressives Congress in Rivers State, Chris Finebone, said Amaechi and Cole had no fear of appearing in court because they did no wrong.\n\nA statement on Friday by his media aide, Kelvin Ebiri, had quoted Wike to have spoken during the swearing-in of the new commissioners at the Executive Chamber of the Government House in Port Harcourt.\n\nThe new commissioners are Prof. Zacchaeus Adangor, sworn in as Attorney General; Isaac Kamalu, Commissioner for Finance, Budget and Economic Planning; and Dr George-Kelly Alabo, as Commissioner for Works and Special Projects.\n\nWike said, \u201cAttorney General, you came at a critical period when people want to know what the state is going to do with the Judiciary Panel of Inquiry after the Supreme Court judgment on it. Luckily, you came at the right time when we have preferred criminal charges against the former governor (Amaechi), Sahara Energy, Tonye Cole and the rest of them.\n\n\u201cSo, you are coming at the right time to take over the matter and to make sure it is prosecuted diligently. I don\u2019t want to hear excuses. Let the people see what happened to our money.\n\n\u201cThe world will see how $50m from our account was moved to a company without anything to show whether there was a business.\u201d\n\nBut reacting, Finebone said the court wasn\u2019t a place for persecution, saying, \u201cIf you are sure of yourself in whatever you are doing, you need not be afraid. The court is not a place where they take you to, then they just order that your neck be cut off.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe court is where justice prevails. So, no right-thinking innocent person should be afraid to go to court because it is not a one-sided place.\n\n\u201cAs it is now, Amaechi and Cole are not culpable. We know that and even the state government, that is Wike and his people, know that,\u201d Finebone added.\n\nMeanwhile, Wike also directed the attorney general to write a protest letter to the Economic and Financial Crime Commission over alleged harassment of the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in Rivers State, Siminalaye Fubara.\n\nWike said the anti-graft agency needed to know that the era of impunity and flagrant disregard for the rule of law was gone, saying the state had a subsisting court judgment barring the EFCC from meddling in the state\u2019s financial transactions.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Rivers State Government has a judgment against the EFCC since 2007. The court said you (EFCC) have no business in the financial transactions of the state. The EFCC has been struggling to set aside that judgment but till now they have not even appealed it.\u201d\n\nHe alleged that the move by the anti-graft agency was political.\n\n\u201cWe are in a political period. People should not think that they will use the EFCC to intimidate or manipulate him (Fubara). Nobody will accept that. So, you (attorney general) have to attach the judgment of the candidate against EFCC and send the right signal to them that we are not people that can be cowed,\u201d Wike said.\n\nHe commended the newly sworn-in commissioners, saying they had shown capacity, loyalty and commitment in previous assignments.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI want to commend the three of you that you have shown commitment, you have shown hard work, you have shown loyalty. And for me, that is the only way to pay back the people who have shown loyalty. In spite of all odds, they are still here,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Bola Tinubu, winner and flagbearer of the APC for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nOsinbajo described the clamour for a new Nigeria as a movement.\n\n\u201cThis movement is a movement within a party also, we are not doing something that has not been heard of before.\n\n\u201cWhat is new is that we have a firm belief that a new Nigeria is possible and it is possible through us who are here.\n\n\u201cWe went to the convention, and the results showed us clearly that we lost, but it is only a battle, it is not the war.\n\n\u201d There are battles ahead, but we will win the war for a new Nigeria. I have no doubt in my mind that we will win that war for a new Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThat is why our movement for a new Nigeria must remain strong and firm; and we will do everything to keep our movement strong and solid.\u201d\n\nThe vice president said that despite the result of the APC presidential primary, the dream of a new country remained alive and well.\n\nAccording to him, the resolve for a new Nigeria remains strong.\n\n\u201cWe will have at the back of our minds, that what you have started in the various movements, coming into one, is the seed that will birth a new nation.\n\n\u201d You and I know the time has come and we will devote everything to it.\n\n\u201cI am committed and will remain committed to that dream (of a new Nigeria), for as long as you are willing and recognise that we have not yet written the story of this country, we have not yet completed the story of this country.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, the story has just begun, this movement has just started\n\n\u201d Once the genie comes out of the bottle, you cannot put it back; the word has been spoken; it cannot be taken back: it is time for a New Nigeria,\u201d he said\n\nHe pledged support for the APC presidential candidate for the 2023 elections.\n\nOsinbajo recalled the personal letter he wrote to Tinubu Thursday congratulating him on his victory at the party primary.\n\n\u201cIn that letter, I said to him that the dream of this country, the dream of a new country remains alive and well.\n\n\u201d And I want you to know in your hearts that we are democrats when we participate in a contest and the results are announced.\n\n\u201cNo matter what those results may be, we abide by them because there is only one process for democrats, whether that process is good or bad, there is only one, and we have gone through that process.\n\n\u201cAnd in that process, a winner has been adjudged, but that does not kill the dream of the great future. We will support our party; we will support the flagbearer of our party because we know that the other side is not even worth considering.\n\n\u201cSo, we will support the flagbearer of our party, we will do everything we can,\u201d he said.\n\nHe thanked Nigerians at home and abroad, including the Osinbajo supporters\u2019 groups, for the overwhelming support for his presidential bid.\n\nSome leaders of Osinbajo Support groups lauded the vice president for being a true leader and inspiration to millions of Nigerians.\n\nDr Ahmed Badanga described Osinbajo as a role model to all.\n\n\u201cYou are the Obama of Africa; you have made us proud and we will continue to remain with you.\n\n\u201cYes, we are progressives and we need to move forward. I will urge all of us to remain steadfast and be committed to this cause because we have a bright future ahead of us,\u201d he said.\n\nHajiya Rabbi Dauda, leader of the Coalition of Women for Osinbajo, , declared the vice president as a winner forever.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, we, the women of Nigeria, find it worthy to stand by you.\n\n\u201cSomehow, you are not the flagbearer today, but you will be the flagbearer tomorrow.\n\n\u201cI want to say to you that this is a continuous process, we will be waiting for you. We are here today to listen to you, to tell us where to go and what to do, and I tell you, we will all be waiting for you, tomorrow and always.\n\n\u201cAnytime you need us, all you need to do is to call on us and we shall be there for you,\u201dshe said.\n\nAnother leader of a support group, Mrs Diana Mary, said that Osinbajo had set a path that would be followed.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, you have led us to win, we are winners. We are not taking this for granted, you have led a direction that we will continue to follow and we are happy that for the sake of Nigeria you answered the call.\n\n\u201cI want to appeal that we still converge and speak about those things that we need to address so that we can pull a stronger force for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis generation of Nigerians is looking for that force that will fight for their future,\u201d she said.\n\nThe vice resident was accompanied on the visit to the Campaign Office by the senator representing Kano South in the National Assembly, Sen. Kabiru Gaya; Special Adviser to the President on Political Matters, Sen. Babafemi Ojudu; among other senior government officials.",

It was not an accident, and it is passing a massage to the rest of us. That is why I\u2019m here. I want the Governor to know that we have received the message.\n\n\u201cWe understand it and we came to sympathize with him that he was selected as a medium of that message.\n\n\u201cSo, the answer we must give to the message we all received is that we are not slaves. Here, on our own soil, having had the experience of century of disdain, contempt about us as black poeple.\n\n\u201cAgain some characters come along calling themselves whatever, ISWAP, Boko Haram. So, all those groups including those who are just opportunists \u2013 the herdsmen, they are making a mistake.\n\n\u201cI want the Governor to realize they are making a mistake.\n\n\u201cI have been on this issue for quite some times. This invasion has been on and these herdsmen are all over the forests.\n\n\u201cAt a time we thought it was Boko Haram, we didn\u2019t know that Fulani herdsmen were capitalising on the fundamentalist insurgency and brutality.\n\n\u201cAnd that is why we see a nexus of operation between ISWAP, Boko Haram and Fulani herdsmen.They work singularly, individually and they work collectively. I Know Ondo State has always been at the forefront of awareness\u201dSoyinka said.\n\nAkeredolu appreciated the Nobel laureate for the condolence visit, saying that the state would remain hugely indebted to him.\n\nAccording bro him, \u201cIt is a cause that he has dedicated his life to, and I thank God for his life. The state wants to appreciate you for finding time to come at this hours of grieve.\n\n\u201cThis is like a dagger drawn to our heart, and it is an assault on our psyche. The psyche of those of us in the South-West and Western Region.\n\n\u201cI think they think they can create some fears in us but they made a mistake because this will make us more fierce in our condemnation of their actions. And we are not hiding it.\u201d",

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), says it is set to introduce the Unstructured Supplementary (USSD) code as part of steps to improve the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).\n\nThe Deputy Governor of the CBN, Kingsley Obiora, said this at the IMF African Department Speakers Series held virtually on Friday.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the series was focused on \u201cCBDC and Private Digital Payments in Kenya and Nigeria: Challenges and Opportunities for Sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d\n\nNAN recalls that the CBN inaugurated the CBDC, also known as the eNaira, on Oct. 25, 2021, aimed at making financial transactions easier and seamless for every strata of the society.\n\nObiora said the introduction of the USSD code became necessary to improve financial inclusion in the country and to ensure people without smartphones could still transact on the eNaira platform.\n\n\u201cWe have made serious progress in the last seven to eight years because when the current governor resumed in 2014, one of the pillars of his vision was to significantly improve financial inclusion.\n\n\u201cSo at the time, we were at 48 per cent of our population within the financial system and given several policies that he conceived and implemented, we are almost at 70 per cent.\n\n\u201cThat still leaves us with about 30 per cent of our population out of the financial system and we believe the CBDC can help reduce that number even more.\n\n\u201cA lot of people might not have smartphones but that is essentially the next step of our improvement in the CBDC, to introduce the USSD code, so those that do not have smartphones can still transact,\u201d Obiora said.\n\nThe CBN deputy governor said that the barrier to entry on the CBDC platform was low, which made it possible for everyone with a Bank Verification Number (BVN) to be onboarded into the eNaira platform in a few minutes.\n\nObiora said the value of the country\u2019s digital payments grew from 324 billion dollars in 2008 to about 2.4 trillion dollars presently, adding that Nigerians were now used to digital payments.\n\n\u201dAs you know, within the continent we have one of the largest Fintech companies, Futterwave, Paystack, etc, \u201c the apex bank boss added.\n\nHe said that the CBDC had significant benefits for Nigeria, which was why the CBN decided to introduce it.\n\nObiora listed the benefits to include rapid financial inclusion, reducing the cost of processing cash, enabling direct welfare payments to citizens, and reducing the informal economy.\n\nOthers are improving tax collection, boosting cross-border trade and remittances, reducing the cost and improving the efficiency of payments and just endearing economic growth in general.\n\nHe, however, listed some of the key risks to introducing the CBDC to include banking sector disintermediation, operational risks of knowing that there is non-stop service, cyber security risks, internet disruptions and financial literacy.\n\nObiora said that Nigeria was doing well based on a PwC report, which showed that Nigeria was number one in terms of adoption, adding that the CBN would keep growing and improving on the system.\n\nSpeaking on adopting cryptocurrency in Nigeria, the deputy governor said for now it would not become part of the country\u2019s financial system because of the volatility that it could create for the system.\n\nCommenting on the high cost of food and fuel in Nigeria caused by the war in Ukraine, he said that the problem was more political than economic.\n\nAccording to him, we hope that world leaders will sort this out as quickly as possible because ordinary people who have no egos and did not cause this problem are the ones that are suffering the most.\n\n\u201cWithin Nigeria what we are seeing is that farm gate food prices have either stabilised or reduced, whereas in the market it actually has increased.\u201d\n\nObiora said a lot of the problems with rising food inflation were due to logistic problems and the issue of higher prices of fuel and transportation.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to deal with that by investing a bit in a commodity exchange so that they can stabilise prices.\n\nHe said, \u201cwithin the monetary policy committee, rates will be raised at least to signal that we will continue to keep an eye on inflation and stand ready to do whatever it takes to turn it around.\u201d\n\nAccording to the moderator, Mr Abebe Selassie, Director, African Department, IMF, the series is a platform where Africa\u2019s pressing economic policy issues are discussed and organised by the IMF\u2019s African Department.\n\nSelassie said the series provided an opportunity for policymakers, academics, and analysts to offer their perspectives on economic and policy issues relevant to the IMF\u2019S African constituency.

If the goal of \u201cnot leaving anyone behind\u201d is ever to be realised, urgent effort, support and contribution will be required by all in a renewed commitment to multilateralism and international cooperation.\u201d\n\nNgige, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, Kachollom Daju, noted that Nigeria, had over the years, upheld the four pillars of the decent work agenda.\n\nThe minister disclosed that the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (EGRP) of 2017-2020 was being rolled into a National Development Plan (2021-2025), adding that the plan took into cognisance achievements from preceding activities, programmes and projects with well-defined key performance indicators as guide.\n\nNgige said: \u201cNigeria has over the years upheld the four pillars of the Decent Work Agenda as well as the Strategic Objectives of the ILO by implementing different transformative Agenda and Visions to structurally transform and improve its economic productive capacities and outputs.

We are brilliant people. Let us wear the uniform of can-do; the mind of those people who have built other nations, particularly people from this age.\u201d\n\nTouched by the Tinubu\u2019s visit, Governor Bello donated an office to the presidential campaign of the APC flag bearer and promised to work for him and the party.\n\nTinubu\u2019s meeting with Umahi was unscheduled and took place behind closed doors, but it was gathered that the discussion focused on salient issues arising from the just concluded presidential primaries.\n\nThe former Lagos State governor described Umahi as a rallying point for Igbo integration in the mainstream national politics.\n\nHe pledged to carry all parts of the country along if elected as president.\n\nUmahi in turn assured him of his support and that of all members of APC in the entire South East zone.\n\nHe expressed confidence that the country will take a leap under the leadership of Tinubu.\n\nTinubu, during his visit to Akpabio, hailed the former minister for foregoing his presidential ambition for him (Tinubu), which he said went a long way in ensuring his victory at the primaries.\n\nOsinbajo: Together with Tinubu we\u2019ll win war for new Nigeria\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo said yesterday that he would support Asiwaju Bola Tinubu for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nOsinbajo spoke at the Abuja campaign office of The Progressive Project (TPP), a coalition of support groups that backed him for the presidency.\n\nOsinbajo said despite the outcome of the APC\u2019s presidential primary he remained committed to the dream of a new Nigeria.\n\nIn his address to the crowd of supporters, the VP described the clamour for a new Nigeria as a movement.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis movement is a movement within a party also. We are not doing something that has not been heard of before. What is new is that we have a firm belief that a new Nigeria is possible and it is possible through us who are here.\n\n\u201cWe went to the convention and the results showed us clearly that we lost, but it is only a battle, it is not the war. There are battles ahead, but we will win the war for a new Nigeria. I have no doubt in my mind that we will win that war for a new Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThat is why our movement for a new Nigeria must remain strong and firm. And we will do everything to keep our movement strong and solid.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Vice President, despite the result of the APC presidential pimary, \u201cthe dream of a new country remains alive and well\u2026 We will have at the back of our minds, that what you have started in the various movements, coming into one, is the seed that will birth a new nation. You and I know the time has come and we will devote everything to it.\n\n\u201cI am committed and will remain committed to that dream (of a new Nigeria) for as long as you are willing and recognise that we have not yet written the story of this country, we have not yet completed the story of this country. As a matter of fact, the story has just begun, this movement has just started.\u201d\n\nThe VP further said \u201ca new Nigeria has only just started, and everywhere across this land, it will be clear to all that a new Nigeria has been born. Once the genie comes out of the bottle, you cannot put it back. The word has been spoken; it cannot be taken back: it is time for a New Nigeria.\u201d\n\nPledging support for the APC presidential candidate for the 2023 elections, Prof. Osinbajo recalled the personal letter he wrote to Asiwaju yesterday congratulating him on his victory at the party primary.\n\n\u201cIn that letter, I said to him that the dream of this country, the dream of a new country remains alive and well. And I want you to know in your hearts that we are democrats.\n\n\u201cWhen we participate in a contest and the results are announced. No matter what those results may be, we abide by them because there is only one process for democrats, whether that process is good or bad, there is only one, and we have gone through that process.\n\nAPC chieftain donates building, N100m to support Tinubu\u2019s campaign\n\nA chieftain of APC in Cross River, Mr Ekpenyong Nsa, yesterday donated a 22-room building complex and the sum of N100 million to support Asiwaju Bola Tinubu\u2019s campaign.\n\nNsa, in a statement, said that the donation was crucial in supporting Tinubu to actualise his presidential bid.\n\nNsa who vied for governorship ticket on the platform of the party in Cross River, said that he was optimistic that Tinubu would revamp the economy if elected.\n\nThis, according to him, is part of the reasons he is supporting Tinubu with the building and money for campaign.\n\nAccording to him, the campaign structure situated at 78 Ndidem Usang Iso, in Calabar Municipal Council, has a conference room, a lounge, office spaces, kitchen, security post, reception halls, library and rest rooms.\n\nHe said that the building would serve as the official state campaign headquarters of Tinubu when finally acquired.\n\nWhile congratulating Tinubu for his victory at the primaries, Nsa acknowledged Tinubu\u2019s human capital and infrastructural development initiatives which he said was evident in Lagos State.\n\nNsa said that the revival of Cross River port would improve the economic potential in Cross River State.\n\nOgbe to Tinubu: Courage, determination made your victory inevitable\n\nThe Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) Chairman Audu Ogbe in a congratulatory message to Asiwaju Tinubu yesterday said it was down to his wealth of experience which will help in strengthening the APC ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\nChief Ogbeh, ascribed Tinubu\u2019s victory to his wealth of experience which will help in strengthening the APC ahead of the forthcoming general elections in 2023.\n\nHe said: \u201cCongratulations on your nomination as the flag bearer of our APC for the 2023 Presidential elections.

          "text": "From Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure\n\nThe Chairman, Southern Nigeria Governors Forum and Governor of Ondo State, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu has said that the claim by the Federal Government that the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) was responsible for last Sunday\u2019s attack on St Francis Catholic Church Owo, Ondo State was too hasty.\n\nHe, however, assured that the state would do everything possible to avoid a repeat of the terrorist attack. Governor Akeredolu noted that he took the conclusion with a pinch of salt, adding that ISWAP is known for claiming responsibility for its attacks. The governor, who condemned the attack in its entirety said there was the need to get to the root of the matter and not just conclude in haste on those responsible for the attack.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nHe said: \u201cThe statement by the Federal Government is too hasty. I take their conclusion with a pinch of salt. ISWAP doesn\u2019t hide its attack. If they have done it, they would have owned up. We are yet to know their identity and our security people are still on their trail.\u201d\n\nGovernor Akeredolu, who said the attack was a crime against humanity, stressed that the South West region has been a peaceful haven before the horrific attack. He said despite the attack on the psyche of the people, the people of the state are indomitable and ready to fight insecurity. He also reiterated the call for state police, noting that the time for state police was now. He emphasised that the present security architecture of the country could not provide adequate security of lives and property.\n\n\u201cA single police command can not guarantee safety in this country. We must have state police now. We are doing our best with Amotekun. But Amotekun is suffering a lot of limitations in getting all the equipment needed to fight these criminals,\u201d he said. The governor commended the international community for their prompt reactions on the killings in Owo, saying it was unprecedented.\n\nGovernor Akeredolu disclosed that government was determined to help the victims of the attack, particularly those who lost their loved ones and those on admission in the hospital. Also the commander of the state security network otherwise known as Operation Amotekun, Chief Adeleye assured that his men would ensure that the perpetrators of the dastardly act were brought to book in no distant time. He said Amotekun operatives were already working in all the nooks and crannies of the state to flush out criminals from the state.\n\nAdeleye who is also the chairman of Amotekun Commanders in the South West said efforts were on to secure all the states of the South West region from terrorist attack.\n\nHe said the state would henceforth be secured more, just as he called on the people to report strange movement to the agency.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "\n\n*Hosts candidate\n\nSays presidential primary most competitive, peaceful in nation\u2019s history\n\n*Buhari a dependable leader, says Tinubu\n\n*Adamu, NWC members pledge to work hard to deliver candidate\n\n*Northern APC governors visit standard-bearer, as search for running mate begins\n\n*Osinbajo, Jonathan congratulate ex-Lagos governor\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nIn his first public statement on the presidential primary of his party, All Progressives Congress (APC), President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, declared that the winner, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, had the skills and track record to lead the ruling party to victory at the polls next year. Buhari stated this in a letter to the returning officer of the APC presidential primary convention and governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, commending the success of the exercise.\n\n\n\nThe president, who later hosted Tinubu, said the APC presidential primary was one of the most competitive and peaceful in the history of Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nBuhari\u2019s comments as came the APC national chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, and members of the party\u2019s National Working Committee (APC) visited Tinubu and pledged to work together to deliver him in the 2023 presidential poll.\n\nAPC governors from the northern geopolitical zones also paid a congratulatory visit to Tinubu, in an apparent signal of the start of intense search for a running mate that would help the party win next year\u2019s election.\n\n\n\nThe forum of former Deputy Governors of Nigeria, who were members of APC, said they trusted the leadership of the party and Tinubu to decide on the best running mate that would serve the interest of Nigeria.\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and former President Goodluck Jonathan, yesterday, joined other prominent personalities from around the world to congratulate Tinubu on his victory at the just concluded presidential primary of APC.\n\n\n\nBuhari, in the letter he personally signed and addressed to Bagudu, who is also the chairman of Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), commended the role the Kebbi State governor played in the success of the primary election that produced Tinubu.\n\nHe asked members of the party to close ranks and work conscientiously for the success of the APC presidential candidate in the February 2023 poll, saying he looks forward to working closely with all the 22 APC governors to ensure Tinubu\u2019s victory.\n\n\n\nThe president stated that the party\u2019s standard-bearer had the capacity, commitment, and particularly enviable track record of leading APC to electoral victory. He said the APC project was far from over \u201cand we need all of you to come together to ensure our progressive journey to peace and prosperity is sustained.\u201d\n\nThe letter read, \u201cI was pleased to see how you were very professional and efficient in handling the sensitive political position of Chairman Progressives Governors Forum.\n\n\n\n\u201cYour commitment in pursuit of equity and fairness speaks volumes in the cooperation displayed by APC governors. This, indeed, demonstrates the camaraderie that brought us together over eight years ago.\n\n\u201cThe party primaries were peacefully conducted and the delegates have selected the candidate to carry the APC flag in the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, as a patriotic APC member and stakeholder, I trust that you will come together to work with our candidate to win the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cIn the past seven years in government, we have achieved a lot. However, we have a lot more to do. The APC project is far from over and we need all of you to come together to ensure our progressive journey to peace and prosperity is sustained.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur candidate, His Excellency, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu, is no stranger to you. He is our friend and brother. We know his commitment, his track record, and his capacity to lead our party to success. So, now is the time for all of us to come together and march forward, as we did in 2015, to a convincing APC victory.\n\n\u201cI look forward to working closely with APC governors to support Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu and all our APC candidates to success in 2023.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile I wish our great party success in the 2023 elections, please, accept the assurances of my consideration and personal regards.\u201d\n\nBuhari played host to Tinubu, Thursday night, at the State House, Abuja. He received the presidential candidate at his official residence about 8.30pm.\n\n\n\nThe former Lagos State governor, who emerged victorious at the APC presidential primary in Abuja on Wednesday, was accompanied on the appreciative visit to Buhari by the Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of Oando Oil Plc, Wale Tinubu.\n\nTinubu was at the villa to thank the president for his support and successful hosting of the APC presidential primary. He vowed to sustain Buhari\u2019s legacies if elected president.\n\n\n\nCommending Buhari for helping to ensure a level playing field for contestants at the primary election, Tinubu said, \u201cHe promised the whole country and the world that he will build a legacy of transparency and consistency. Legacy of a level playing ground for all the aspirants. He will be committed to democratic principles and values. And he did so.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t endorse anybody, he didn\u2019t impose anybody, he did not, at any time, attempt to tinker with the process of this election to favour one tribe or the other. He was steadfast, he was trustworthy, he was dependable, he was a leader.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn his selling point ahead of the 2023 election, Tinubu said he was clear-minded on his mission and possessed a wealth of experience from both the private and public sectors. He said he was \u201cready to hit the ground running same day and not mess up the legacy of progress and honesty that is left behind for me and handed over to me by President Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\nAdamu, NWC Members Pledge to Work Hard to Deliver Tinubu\n\nThe National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC), led by the national chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, visited the party\u2019s presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, to congratulate him and give assurances that the party leadership would work diligently to deliver him as president.\n\nAdamu said during the visit, \u201cWe are here visiting you to join you in thanking God for giving you to us and to all Nigerians, by making you the presidential flag bearer of our party for the 2023 election.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou have come a long way; you have seen it all. I can tell you that we have a commitment beyond description, a commitment to deliver you as president. Our party has spoken loud and clear, and delivering the will of the people, our delegates have given you the mandate to lead.\n\n\u201cWe are all now your soldiers. We will follow you to the nooks and crannies of this country. We will not rest on your oars until we have delivered you as president.\u201d\n\n\n\nThanking the chairman and members of the NWC, Tinubu said, \u201cI am honoured by this visit. We are all members of the same party, and as such, belong to the same progressive family. I appreciate your visit, I truly feel as if I am with family members.\n\n\u201cI want to thank everyone of you individually and collectively. You have formed a very dynamic team in a short period of time. You have sent jitters to other parties that our party remains united, and you must continue to live up to expectations.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, as I have done throughout my campaign, I assure you that I am ready to reciprocate and vindicate our efforts in making the ultimate sacrifice: relentless public service to our beloved nation.\n\n\u201cWe have begun a new story of greatness, prosperity in the history of our nation. You helped me to complete the introduction; we must now work together to etch the substance of the book itself. Our book will not be complete until you have delivered me as president.\u201d\n\n\n\nTinubu described the APC national chairman as a straightforward, focused, and courageous man, whom he had worked together with as a fellow-governor in 1999.\n\nThe former governor stated, \u201cI thank you and I reiterate my commitment to the greatness of our party. We must work together, we must not let our enemies, who want to divide us, succeed. We must not allow it. Almighty Allah will crown our work with success as we embark on the journey to a greater Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmong the NWC members who joined the chairman on the visit were Deputy National Chairman (North), Senator Abubakar Kyari; Deputy National Chairman (South), Chief Emma Eneukwu; National Secretary, Senator Iyiola Omisore; National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Felix Morka; National Organising Secretary, Alhaji Sulaimon Argungu; National Woman Leader, Dr. Betta Edu; and National Youth Leader, Mr. Dayo Abdullah Isreal.\n\nOthers were National Vice Chairman (South-west), Dr Isaac Kekemeke; National Vice Chairman (South-south), Chief Hon. Victor Giadom; and National Vice Chairman (North-east), Comrade Mustapha Salihu.\n\nNorthern APC Governors Visit Tinubu, as Search for Running Mate Begins\n\nSome members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Northern States Governors Forum, yesterday, paid a visit to the presidential candidate of the party, Senator Bola Tinubu, in Asokoro, Abuja.\n\nThe northern governors, who visited Tinubu, included governor of Kebbi State and Chairman of Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), Abubakar Atiku Bagudu; Governor of Kastina State, Aminu Masari; Kano State Governor, Abdulahi Ganduje; Gombe State Governor, Inuwa Yahaya; Plateau State Governor, Simon Lanlong; and Niger State Governor, Abubakar Bello.\n\n\n\nAlthough the purpose of the visit was not made public, sources said it might not be unconnected with the search for a running mate for Tinubu.\n\nAlready, there were speculations that the ruling party might settle for a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nIt was gathered that the meeting, which was held behind closed-doors, was centred on a possible running mate to Tinubu in the 2023 election.\n\n\u2018Tinubu, APC Leadership to Choose Acceptable Running Mate\u2019\n\nFormer deputy governors, who were members of APC, assured that the leadership of the ruling party, as well as the presidential candidate, Senator Bola Tinubu, would choose the vice presidential candidate that would best serve the interest of Nigeria.\n\n\n\nChairman of the Forum of former Deputy Governors of Nigeria and former Deputy Governor of Edo State, Lucky Imasuen, at a press conference yesterday in Abuja, wondered why people were already speculating whether the ruling party would settle for a Musilm-Muslim ticket.\n\n\n\nImasuen said, \u201cWhy are we crying foul, when there is no smoke? I will tell you without any hesitation that the man we have chosen is a leader. When you choose a leader, you choose him to represent the people.\n\n\u201cHimself (Tinubu) and the party leadership, you can rest assured that they will bring the best vice presidential candidate that will best serve the interest of Nigeria. So, just be patient. I can\u2019t tell you where it\u2019s going, because I\u2019m not the candidate and I\u2019m not the national chairman.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe forum stated that the emergence of Tinubu as the standard-bearer of the party had sent jitters to the camp of the opposition party, which had realised the irreversible error they committed by choosing a presidential candidate against the mood of the nation.\n\nOsinbajo: Tinubu\u2019s Sterling Contributions to Democracy Stand Him Out\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo congratulated Bola Tinubu on his emergence as presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), stressing that his contributions to Nigeria\u2019s democracy and its progress stand him out.\n\n\n\nIn a congratulatory message dated June 9, 2022 and personally signed by him, the vice president, who came a distant third in the presidential primaries, enjoined all APC members to close ranks and work towards the success of Tinubu in the February 2023 presidential poll.\n\n\n\nThe vice president stated in the letter, \u201cI congratulate Bola Ahmed Tinubu on his victory at our party primaries and his emergence as the presidential candidate and flag bearer of our great party, the APC, for the forthcoming 2023 presidential election. I also congratulate President Muhammadu Buhari and all leaders of the APC for a successful Special Convention and Presidential Primary.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor many decades, our flag bearer has shown passion, patriotism, courage and determination in the cause of nation building. His sterling contributions to our democracy and its progress stand him out. His wealth of experience will certainly be critical in our party\u2019s continued efforts to attain a more secure and prosperous Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTo all members of our great party, regardless of who you voted for at the primaries, we must now unite behind our presidential candidate and flag bearer to ensure victory for our party in the 2023 elections. As true progressives, we must remain strong and united in pursuing our collective vision as a party towards building a country that can provide a decent life and livelihoods for all our people.\u201d\n\n\n\nJonathan Congratulates Atiku, Tinubu, Obi, Other Parties\u2019 Presidential Candidates\n\nFormer President, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, congratulated the presidential candidate of PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, that of APC, Bola Tinubu, and their counterpart in the Labour Party, Mr. Peter Obi, as well as those of the other parties on their emergence as their parties\u2019 standard-bearers.\n\nJonathan also appealed to the political parties participating in the 2023 general election to base their campaigns on issues and shun violence during the electioneering.\n\n\n\nIn a statement by his media aide, Ikechukwu Eze, the former president urged the candidates to run campaigns devoid of rancour and divisiveness, and utilise the opportunity to promote peace and unity.\n\nJonathan commended the candidates for their interest in leading the country, which he described as a demonstration of their commitment and belief in the progress of the nation.\n\n\n\nNoting that Nigeria was at a critical junction in its march to nationhood, as it grapples with security and economic challenges, Jonathan said the 2023 elections presented an opportunity to renew the dreams of the founding fathers and revitalise the economy.\n\n\n\nHe charged the candidates to, in their campaigns, eschew violence and acts that could encourage any form of bloodletting or exacerbate the national fault lines. He said it was the responsibility of all political leaders to strive to de-escalate the tension in the country.\n\n\n\nJonathan also reminded the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the security agencies of their responsibilities, stressing that the significance of the 2023 election, imposes on them a historic burden to continue the process of deepening the reforms of our electoral system.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Afenifere urges Buhari to fish out perpetrators\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Fidelis David in Akure\n\nThe federal government, yesterday, gave an update on last Sunday\u2019s killing of 40 worshippers at St Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State, saying the Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP) masterminded the dastardly attack.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, gunmen, again struck in Sabo area of Ondo town, in Ondo West Local Government Area of the state and have killed six men.\n\nBut a Pan-Yoruba Socio-Cultural Group, Afenifere, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari, to fish out perpetrators of last Sunday\u2019s terror attack at St. Francis Catholic Church.\n\n\n\nBriefing newsmen on Thursday at the end of the National Security Council meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja, Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, said security agencies had been directed to go after the perpetrators of the act and bring them to justice.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the motive of the terror group was believed to be pitting Nigerians against each other and making it appear as ethno-religious war.\n\n\n\nWhile noting that the ISWAP\u2019s imprints had been determined in the attack, he said arrests were yet to be made, and that, there was no ethnic agenda, urging Nigerians to unite and defeat the terrorists.\n\n\n\nHis words: \u201cThe National Security Council, has just risen from its meeting today, which reviewed, very critically, all aspects of security situation in the country and came up with conclusions, commending the efforts of the military and other security agencies in mitigating the insurgency, particularly, in the Northeast, where the fundamentalists there have been weakened, degraded and equally in the Northwest, where the bandits are equally weakened, and the Northcentral, where we\u2019re engaged with pockets of bandits.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe council is quite concerned about the violent attack in Owo, Ondo State, and has been able to locate the perpetrators of that horrendous attack. From all indications, we are zeroing in on ISWAP, the Islamic State for West Africa.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is not an ethnoreligious thing, the animals in ISWAP wanting attention, recognition, are suspected to have launched that attack. We have directed all the agencies concerned to go after them and bring them to justice\u201d.\n\nAregbesola said the Council was also concerned about killings in the name of blasphemy and has directed the security agencies to go after perpetrators of two incidents that occurred in Sokoto State and Abuja recently.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are equally concerned about the spate of attacks in the name of blasphemy. The police have been directed to mobilise, identify and preempt all those involved in the blasphemy attacks in two areas of the country, namely Sokoto and Abuja, of recent. The assurance is that we are committed to maintaining law and order and providing adequate security for Nigerian citizens.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, THISDAY has learnt that the attack on the Sabo area of Ondo town, in Ondo West Local Government Area of the state, happened in the wee hours of Wednesday.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY also learnt that the victims had been buried since Wednesday while one of the victims, who survived the attack was still receiving treatment at an undisclosed hospital in the state.\n\nEyewitness said the gunmen stormed the area on motorbikes around 12:30am and opened fire on innocent roadside petty traders.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cThey came to our area (Sabo) on motorbikes and each was carrying three gunmen. All of a sudden, they started shooting people, who were mostly Suya and tea vendors. A J5 bus driver, who was on transit and stopped to eat was the first victim. They killed a guardsman and another shopkeeper, who was trying to lock up his shop and run away from the assailants.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey again gunned down two young men, who were eating noodles at a Mai Shayi store. That makes five victims in Sabo alone. Again, they struck another area called Iba, where they also shot dead another man,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\n\n\nPolice Public Relations Officer in the state, Funmilayo Odunlami, confirmed the development but said it was an armed robbery case, not a reprisal attack, stressing that the victims involved in the failed robbery were from Yoruba, Igbo and Northern extraction.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Command wishes to state clearly that there was no reprisal attack on the Hausa Community at Sabo area in Ondo town or any part of the state as purported by war mongers.\n\n\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday, 7th of June, 2022, there was an attempted robbery on a J5 vehicle with plate no MKA \u2013 469 YJ carrying Onions and Potatoes coming from Zaria enroute Ore, had a stop over at Ondo town and was attacked by men of the underworld around 0110hrs .\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the cause of this attempt, the robbers shot the driver, while the motorboy escaped with bullet injury, a motorcyclist alongside the pillion and a passerby were also hit by stray bullets,\u201d noting that investigation had since commenced and effort was ongoing to arrest the assailants.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police, Ondo State Command, Oyeyemi Oyediran, urged the people of the state to remain calm and disregard the fake news, as the rumour mongers are out to stir unnecessary chaos and disrupt the peace of the state. This is also to warn the peddlers of this fake news to desist as the Command will not fold its arms and let them shatter the peace being enjoyed in the state,\u201d the PPRO added.\n\n\n\nIt was against these developments that Afenifere, yesterday, paid a condolence visit to Ondo State Governor, Mr Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN), in Akure, the state capital.\n\n\n\nLed by its national leader, Ayo Adebanjo, in company with other members, Adebanjo commiserated with the governor, the Olowo of Owo, the Catholic church and the poeple of the state over the ugly incident, even as he referred to the governor as a true son of Yoruba race, saying his courage in establishing Amotekun corps was typical of a true Yoruba man.\n\n\n\nThe Afenifere leader, particularly, commended Akeredolu for doing his best to secure not only the state but the South-West region, adding that the security situation in the Southwest could have been worse, but for the establishment of the Amotekun corps.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cThe elections we are going into will be an exercise in futility if we don\u2019t change the constitution. We want state police and restructuring before the elections. So, change the constitution before moving further,\u201d Adebanjo insisted.\n\n\n\nHe saluted the courage and stance of the governor on issues of national importance, saying Akeredolu has always demonstrated that he was a politician with a second address.\n\nThe Afenifere leader insisted on the change of the constitution to give the country a people\u2019s constitution and equal opportunity to all.\n\n\n\nHe said Nigerians were currently suffering under what he called \u201cmilitary imposed fraudulent constitution\u201d.\n\nThe group, however, donated N1.5m to the church and victims of the attack.\n\nSpeaking, Akeredolu appreciated them for visiting and, noted that his administration would not back down on its Anti-open Grazing Law.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we have suffered is not just gruesome, for me it is like an annihilation, because these animals in human\u2019s skin did not come to kidnap, because they picked nobody. They did not come to steal, because they took no Kobo. But they came to maim and kill. So, that is why we have never minced words to say they are terrorists.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have been reading the news, and I think this incident is the most internationalised incident in Nigeria ever. Today, the Pope is talking and tomorrow the House of Common is debating, everybody is talking. I have got calls from many people, I have gotten letter from the US Embassy and others. Everybody is worried, I\u2019m worried myself.\n\n\u201cIf we were at war, it was not possible for us to lose 40 people in a day, because we would all be armed and face each other. If you visit the hospitals, one will feel even worse. I have been to all the hospitals over and over, there is no way the visit will not bring tears to your eyes,\u201d the governor added.\n\n\n\nOther Afenifere leaders with Adebanjo included the deputy national leader, Oba Oladapo Olaitan; former Governor of Ogun State, Chief Gbenga Daniel; former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Chief Olu Falae; Tunji Alapinni, Sola Ebiseni, and Korede Duyile, among others.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Despite court cases of alleged massive frauds hanging on his neck, former Governor of Lagos State and National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu was on Wednesday officially declared the presidential candidate of the party.\n\nTinubu polled 1,271 votes at the election which was held at Eagle Square, Abuja.\n\nFormer Rivers State Governor, Rotimi Amaechi trailed with 316 votes, while Vice President Yemi Osinbajo garnered 235 votes.\n\nSenate President Ahmed Lawan and Governor Yahaya Bello polled 152 and 47 votes respectively.\n\nChecks by SaharaReporters revealed that the fraud cases against Tinubu dated as far back as 1998, raising questions about how the former governor struggled to delay the axe of the law.\n\nOn February 18, 2009, SaharaReporters obtained original copies of a judgment in the case of United States versus Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in which Tinubu was charged (along with other defendants) in a case of massive drug trafficking and money laundering.\n\nThis judgment directly relates to (and further documents) the SaharaReporters report of September 16, 2008 \u2013 How US Federal Agents successfully Linked Tinubu to Drug Trafficking Ring in Chicago.\n\nThe United States of America, by its attorney, Michael J. Shepard, United States Attorney for Northern District of Illinois, for its verified complaint of forfeiture, stated that \u201cBeginning as early as 1998, Adegboyega Mueez Akande, with others operated an organisation which distributed white heroin, a controlled substance under Title 21 of the United States Code.\n\n\u201cThis distribution operation was conducted on a large scale and the proceeds of the operation substantial.\u201d\n\nThe judgment was that the court ordered: \u201cthat the funds in the amount of $460,000 in account in the name of Bola Tinubu represents proceeds of narcotics or were involved in financial transactions in violation of 18 U.S.C ss 1956 and 1957 and therefore these funds are forfeited to the United States.\u201d\n\nAfter protracted litigation in which Bola Tinubu claimed that the monies legitimately belonged to him, his wife, Oluremi Tinubu, and his surrogate mother, one Alhaja Mogaji, Bola Tinubu finally opted for a stipulated settlement with the US government.\n\nAccording to the settlement order dated September 15, 1993; Hon. Judge John A. Nordberg ordered that the sum of $460,000 held by Bola Tinubu in the First Heritage Bank account be forfeited to the United States Government.\n\nA bigger scandal was uncovered in 2018 when Alpa Beta, a consultancy owned by Bola Tinubu, was caught at the centre of a N100 billion fraud, tax evasion, and money laundering petition written by Mr. Dapo Apara, its Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nAccording to Apara\u2019s petition to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Alpha Beta \u201chas become an avenue for official corruption of government officials, a conduit pipe for massive money-laundering scheme, tax evasion, among other vices.\u201d\n\nIn the petition, sent on his behalf by Adetunji Adegboyega ESG, his solicitors, Apara said: \u201cOver the years the company is being protected and shielded by some powerful politicians and people in the society which made them to always boast of being untouchable, but our client, feeling the need not to keep quiet again and strengthened by his belief in the fact that the government of President Muhammadu Buhari is keen on fighting corruption, which has been the bane of our country, is of the firm belief that it\u2019s time to expose and open the can of worms called Alpha Beta Consulting.\u201d\n\nAlpha Beta first became known when it was appointed as a consultant to the Lagos State Government, arguably its first client, under the tenure of Babatunde Fowler as the Chief Executive Officer/Executive Chairman of the Lagos State Board of Internal Revenue from 2005 to 2014.\n\nThe company got the appointment when Tinubu was Governor of Lagos State. The speculation, which has yet to dissipate since then, is that Tinubu completely owns or is a major shareholder in the company.\n\nIn the same vein, the state has also never denied claims that the company takes about 10 percent of the internally generated revenue of Lagos, estimated in 2016 to be about N40 billion every month.\n\nThe court process was still ongoing when on October 27, 2020, hoodlums burnt the documents during the riotous #EndSARS violence in the state.\n\nThe court papers stating charges brought against Tinubu, his tax consultancy firm, Alpha Beta Consulting, by Apara were burnt, according to claims by Tade Ipadeola, Apara\u2019s lawyer.\n\n\u201cEverything in Igbosere High Court got burnt including the registrar\u2019s copy of our application. In fact, the whole building was burnt to ashes. So, we will have to file again. The registry has been moved to Ikeja.\n\n\u201cWe may have to file the case afresh at the Ikeja High Court but we have not yet been instructed to do so,\u201d he said on October 27, 2020.\n\nApara had claimed in the documents that Tinubu, suspiciously diverted N22,360,000,000 and $4,396,063 from the firm\u2019s account to that of Vintage Press Ltd, publisher of The Nation Newspaper.\n\nIn a writ of summons marked LD/7330GCMW/2020 deposed at a Lagos High Court, Apara, who claims to own a 30 per cent stake in the company, alleged that the former governor reneged on certain agreements reached in the past about the management and control of the consulting firm.\n\nOther fronts used by Tinubu, according to the former Alpha Beta boss, are Olumide Ogunmola and Tunde Badejo.\n\nIn his statement of claim, Apara said during a review of the company\u2019s account, he discovered that huge sums of money earned by the company over the years were not reflected in its account.\n\nHe also revealed how Tinubu used the Osun State governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, as a front for the establishment of the firm.\n\nAlpha Beta Consulting was awarded a contract by the Lagos State Government when Tinubu was governor of the state after a recommendation by a committee comprising the then Attorney-General of Lagos State, Prof Yemi Osinbajo (now the Vice President of Nigeria); Mr Wale Edun, then Commissioner for Finance; and a former Commissioner for Economic Planning and Budget, Yemi Cardoso.\n\nThe firm was subsequently given exclusive rights to collect taxes on behalf of the Lagos State Government and was believed to receive about 10 percent commission from the revenue it collected for the state.\n\nHowever, pro-transparency groups and opposition politicians had constantly alleged that Tinubu owned Alpha Beta even though his name was not on any of the company's documents.\n\nHowever, both Tinubu and Alpha Beta denied the allegations.",

Shepard, United States Attorney for Northern District of Illinois, for its verified complaint of forfeiture, stated that \u201cBeginning as early as 1998, Adegboyega Mueez Akande, with others operated an organisation which distributed white heroin, a controlled substance under Title 21 of the United States Code.\n\n\u201cThis distribution operation was conducted on a large scale and the proceeds of the operation substantial.\u201d\n\nThe judgment was that the court ordered: \u201cthat the funds in the amount of $460,000 in account in the name of Bola Tinubu represents proceeds of narcotics or were involved in financial transactions in violation of 18 U.S.C ss 1956 and 1957 and therefore these funds are forfeited to the United States.\u201d\n\nAfter protracted litigation in which Bola Tinubu claimed that the monies legitimately belonged to him, his wife, Oluremi Tinubu, and his surrogate mother, one Alhaja Mogaji, Bola Tinubu finally opted for a stipulated settlement with the US government.\n\nAccording to the settlement order dated September 15, 1993; Hon. Judge John A. Nordberg ordered that the sum of $460,000 held by Bola Tinubu in the First Heritage Bank account be forfeited to the United States Government.\n\nA bigger scandal was uncovered in 2018 when Alpa Beta, a consultancy owned by Bola Tinubu, was caught at the centre of a N100 billion fraud, tax evasion, and money laundering petition written by Mr. Dapo Apara, its Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nAccording to Apara\u2019s petition to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Alpha Beta \u201chas become an avenue for official corruption of government officials, a conduit pipe for massive money-laundering scheme, tax evasion, among other vices.\u201d\n\nIn the petition, sent on his behalf by Adetunji Adegboyega ESG, his solicitors, Apara said: \u201cOver the years the company is being protected and shielded by some powerful politicians and people in the society which made them to always boast of being untouchable, but our client, feeling the need not to keep quiet again and strengthened by his belief in the fact that the government of President Muhammadu Buhari is keen on fighting corruption, which has been the bane of our country, is of the firm belief that it\u2019s time to expose and open the can of worms called Alpha Beta Consulting.\u201d\n\nAlpha Beta first became known when it was appointed as a consultant to the Lagos State Government, arguably its first client, under the tenure of Babatunde Fowler as the Chief Executive Officer/Executive Chairman of the Lagos State Board of Internal Revenue from 2005 to 2014.\n\nThe company got the appointment when Tinubu was Governor of Lagos State. The speculation, which has yet to dissipate since then, is that Tinubu completely owns or is a major shareholder in the company.\n\nIn the same vein, the state has also never denied claims that the company takes about 10 percent of the internally generated revenue of Lagos, estimated in 2016 to be about N40 billion every month.\n\nThe court process was still ongoing when on October 27, 2020, hoodlums burnt the documents during the riotous #EndSARS violence in the state.\n\nThe court papers stating charges brought against Tinubu, his tax consultancy firm, Alpha Beta Consulting, by Apara were burnt, according to claims by Tade Ipadeola, Apara\u2019s lawyer.\n\n\u201cEverything in Igbosere High Court got burnt including the registrar\u2019s copy of our application. In fact, the whole building was burnt to ashes. So, we will have to file again. The registry has been moved to Ikeja.\n\n\u201cWe may have to file the case afresh at the Ikeja High Court but we have not yet been instructed to do so,\u201d he said on October 27, 2020.\n\nApara had claimed in the documents that Tinubu, suspiciously diverted N22,360,000,000 and $4,396,063 from the firm\u2019s account to that of Vintage Press Ltd, publisher of The Nation Newspaper.\n\nIn a writ of summons marked LD/7330GCMW/2020 deposed at a Lagos High Court, Apara, who claims to own a 30 per cent stake in the company, alleged that the former governor reneged on certain agreements reached in the past about the management and control of the consulting firm.\n\nOther fronts used by Tinubu, according to the former Alpha Beta boss, are Olumide Ogunmola and Tunde Badejo.\n\nIn his statement of claim, Apara said during a review of the company\u2019s account, he discovered that huge sums of money earned by the company over the years were not reflected in its account.\n\nHe also revealed how Tinubu used the Osun State governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, as a front for the establishment of the firm.\n\nAlpha Beta Consulting was awarded a contract by the Lagos State Government when Tinubu was governor of the state after a recommendation by a committee comprising the then Attorney-General of Lagos State, Prof Yemi Osinbajo (now the Vice President of Nigeria); Mr Wale Edun, then Commissioner for Finance; and a former Commissioner for Economic Planning and Budget, Yemi Cardoso.\n\nThe firm was subsequently given exclusive rights to collect taxes on behalf of the Lagos State Government and was believed to receive about 10 percent commission from the revenue it collected for the state.\n\nHowever, pro-transparency groups and opposition politicians had constantly alleged that Tinubu owned Alpha Beta even though his name was not on any of the company's documents.\n\nHowever, both Tinubu and Alpha Beta denied the allegations.",

          "text": "Femi Adesina, presidential spokesman, says President Muhammadu Buhari didn\u2019t impose his preferred candidate for the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential ticket because he wanted to be fair to all aspirants.\n\nAdesina spoke on the development in an article published on Thursday, titled \u2018Knock Knock, Who\u2019s There?\u2019.\n\nBuhari had, in January 2022, said he had a preferred aspirant for the party\u2019s ticket, but insisted that he would keep the name a secret.\n\nAs speculations heightened over who the candidate could be, hours before the APC presidential primary was scheduled to begin on June 6, the president maintained that there would be no imposition of candidate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president\u2019s comment followed an announcement said to have been made by Abdullahi Adamu, APC national chairman, that the consensus candidate would be Ahmad Lawan, president of the senate.\n\nHowever, Bola Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos, won the party\u2019s ticket after securing 1,271 votes and defeating 13 other presidential hopefuls.\n\nSpeaking on Buhari\u2019s position on the \u201cfavourite\u201d candidate, Adesina said the president acted as a democrat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was human to have a favorite in such situation, and the President did no wrong. But would you unduly favor the person? Would you throw your weight around, ride roughshod over the others, and impose your favored one on your political party and the nation? We have seen it before. Former President, Olusegun Obasanjo, did it with Umaru Yar\u2019Adua. He did same, though to a lesser extent with Dr Goodluck Jonathan. Can Buhari do it and remain a democrat, fair, impartial? Knock, Knock! Who\u2019s There?\u201d the presidential spokesman wrote.\n\n\u201cThat was the matter of interest in the week before the primary election. There were at least 23 aspirants. Who would the President give the nod? Could he remain neutral, non-aligned? At least, he had confessed he had someone in mind. Would he remain even-handed, detached, non-discriminatory?\n\n\u201cThere were at least four consultative meetings, towards getting an acceptable candidate for the party. One was with the APC Governors, called Progressive Governors Forum. The other was with the presidential aspirants themselves, then with the National Advisory Council (formerly called Board of Trustees), and finally with the Northern Progressive Governors Forum.\n\n\u201cThe main things on the agenda was usually who would be the preferred aspirant. What part of the country would he come from? Would the President name his favorite, or leave it to democratic principle of voting? How did the President do it? How did he remain neutral, when he had earlier confessed that he had a favorite? It\u2019s a test of fairness, being a democrat or not, and the President passed it, despite all the odds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEach time a consultative meeting ended, there were twists and contortions to whatever the President said. They imported and imputed all sorts of interpretations, mostly unfounded and incorrect. Oh, this is what he meant. He said this and that. This is what he was actually saying. He just didn\u2019t come straight. The man held his peace.\n\n\u201cPrimary Election Day came. And the President still remained neutral, despite having confessed that he had a favorite aspirant. How did he do it? Strange. Supernatural. Curious. Knock, Knock! Who\u2019s There? But President Buhari remained unobtrusive, demure, self-effacing, till a candidate finally emerged.\n\n\u201cWhile the process lasted, I had observed people who were core Buharists, but now on different sides of the divide, go for one another\u2019s jugular. Some were virulent, odious, descending to the level of indecency. But now that the race is over, can they sheathe their swords? Is there anything in life that should make us become indecent, uncouth in both language and action? Fie! Fie, I say.\n\nThe day of decision will come in February. May God spare us till then, and beyond.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari has done his level best for his party, and the country. He has been beleaguered by some forces and interests since 2015, and it had largely been about the quest for power. He is exiting decently, orderly, doing his best till the last day. The onus is now on Bola Tinubu, Atiku Abubakar, and the other candidates to answer the ring at the door. Knock, Knock! Who\u2019s There?\u201d",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

With Karny, a bookkeeping app it acquired last year in August, Chari has now made and announced 3 successful acquisitions in 10 months.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n\u201cThe secret of a successful expansion is to build a local team that masters local market dynamics,\u201d said Chari\u2019s CEO Ismail Belkhayat who co-founded the startup with his wife Sophia Alj (COO) in 2020. \u201cThe real challenge is to convince local entrepreneurs to join forces with Chari to grow faster.\u201d\n\nLast year, in an interview, Belkhayat told TechCabal that the goal is to be the market leader across francophone Africa. Today it makes its first major foray and vouches to \u201ccontinue to surround ourselves with young and ambitious entrepreneurs from francophone Africa to build together a pan-African giant of FMCG and financial services distribution.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2021 by Ali Ouattara and Amidou Diarra, two former managers at Glovo and PepsiCo, Diago operates exclusively in Abidjan, the capital city of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and one of the biggest French-speaking cities in Africa.\n\nChari said in a statement that Ouattara and Diarra, who had initially sought funding and market and tech advisory before choosing to exit to the Moroccan, will remain CEO and COO, respectively.

Just last month, a Nigerian autotech startup Autochek travelled up north to acquire Moroccan KIFAL Auto. Now, Chari is acquiring a West African startup.\n\nBelkhayat said the company is currently raising a big series A.

The warm welcome our team has received from artists, local partners and stakeholders is a strong indicator for us moving forward. Boomplay is committed to contributing to the dynamism of the Ivorian music industry\u2019.\u201d\n\nWhile there is no available data on the growth of the Ivory Coast\u2019s music streaming industry, several of its artists have risen to prominence in the past few years due to an increase in streaming services. For example, French singer-songwriter Kikimoteleba rose in Spotify\u2019s ranks when his hit single Tigini exceeded 15 million streams. Others have also been thrust into the spotlight on social media; the Nigerian remix of Aboutou Roots La Blessure, for instance, have been used in thousands of videos across the internet.\n\nThe role these streaming services play in democratising income for Ivorian artists cannot be understated especially as many artists depend of live performances for their income. Guy-Constant Neza, an Ivorian label manager at Believe Digital told Lemonde that 80% of Ivorian artists\u2019 income comes from live performances. Streaming platforms, according to Neza, provide \u201ca double awareness among our artists, of both the limits of the existing model and the opportunities that streaming offers.\u201d\n\nWith the launch of Boomplay, Ivorian artists now have access to 70 million active users on a platform where they\u2019ll be paid per stream/purchase.\n\nThe company has a freemium model similar to YouTube where users can play music for free but with ad intermissions, or pay for an ad-free version.\n\nAccording to Director of Artist and Media Relations, Tosin Sorinola, \u201cThis physical presence extends Boomplay\u2019s mission to promote local talent by providing them with a platform and resources within and outside of the service, which enables them to reach a wider audience of music lovers across the continent. We are delighted to provide a transparent service which ensures that artists get due revenue from their music streaming.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

During the quarter, \u2018Urea whether or not in aqueous solution\u2019 was exported to Brazil at a value of N63.11 billion.\n\nFBNQuest, an investment banking and asset management business of FBN Holdings plc, said the increase in urea exports can be linked to the start-up of operations at the Dangote Fertilizer facility.\n\nThis is following the commencement of export operations by the company to the US, India, Brazil amongst others.\n\nTunde Abidoye, Head of research of FBNQuest, explained Nigeria exporting more urea is good for the country in that it increases the export base and foreign exchange (FX) earnings from non-oil exports.\n\nHe further stated that \u201cDangote\u2019s fertilizer has added to the production of urea in the country and the commencement of operations in Dangote\u2019s fertilizer facility means that there are now more fertilizers being produced in Nigeria and it is available for exports.\u201d\n\nCompared to Notore fertilizer plant capacity of 500,000 metric tonnes for urea production, and Indorama Eleme fertilizer plant capacity of 1.4 million metric tonnes per annum, Dangote fertilizer plant remains the largest producing 3 million metric tonnes per annum of urea fertilizer.\n\nLast March, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari inaugurated a $2.5 billion fertilizer plant with which Africa\u2019s most populous country hopes to contribute to the global supply amid the impact of increasing prices in the aftermath of the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nRead also: Q1 2022: Nigeria exports \u20a65.6trn crude oil, highest post-Covid 19\n\nBuhari also stated that the plant is an endorsement of his administration\u2019s target of food sufficiency, adding that it will reduce dependence on imported fertilizers and create employment for Nigerians.\n\nAgriculture is a lifeline for Nigeria\u2019s economy, contributing 25.8percent of its 173 billion dollars gross domestic product in 2021. However, farmers are sometimes constrained with limited supplies such as fertilizer and improved seedlings.\n\nWith the new fertilizer plant with a capacity of 3 million metric tons annually, Nigeria expects \u201ca boom as fertilizer is now readily available in greater quantities and better quality,\u201d said Buhari.\n\nAcross the world, high fertilizer costs already threaten farmers amid sanctions on Russia, a major global supplier of fertilizer, where authorities in March urged domestic producers to temporarily halt exports.\n\n\u201cThe new plant will make Nigeria self-sufficient in fertilizer production with excess capacity to export to other African markets and the rest of the world,\u201d said Aliko Dangote, the founder and current chairman and CEO of the Dangote Group.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to make fertilizer available in sufficient quantity and quality for our teeming farmers, assuring greater agricultural output,\u201d Dangote said of operations in the fertilizer plant.",

          "title": "After humour of primaries, Nigerians focus on fragile economy, poverty and its misery",
          "text": "The leading political parties in Nigeria have all now named flagbearers for next February\u2019s crucial presidential election and the focus is shifting back to the country\u2019s fragile economy and the daily struggle of the people and businesses in Africa\u2019s most populous nation.\n\nMany Nigerians believe that economic matters, as well as rising insecurity, will shape the outcome of the election which may witness a huge jump in the number of youths voting as data from the current voter registration across the country suggest.\n\nNigeria\u2019s economy, the continent\u2019s biggest is continuing to struggle with the outgoing president and his cabinet unable or unwilling to take painful but needed decisions to reverse the economic collapse. Finance Minister recently said oil earnings were barely able to pay for petrol imports but she offered no new initiatives to improve the dire financial position of the country.\n\nNigeria has shelved plans to tap the market for a $950m Eurobond as international bond yields rise and the nation\u2019s local currency continues its puzzling downward spiral amid surging oil prices. This will mean more domestic borrowing that has traditionally crowded out the private sector.\n\nThe $950m issuances from Nigeria would have been the last international bond from the 2021 budget after the authorities issued $1.25b in March this year.\n\nThe foreign reserve position of Africa\u2019s top oil producer fell the most in near 20 months in May according to data from the Central Bank.\n\nVirtually every set of data from official sources points to Nigeria\u2019s weakening external position. The Bureau of Statistics recently released trade and capital importation data for Q1 with capital importation in the quarter falling a whooping 28% quarter on quarter to $1.5bn.\n\nThe impact of the trade balance turned positive in Q1 does pale into insignificance when compared with the consecutive negative data for the two quarters before it.\n\nNigeria\u2019s external position remains fragile despite the favourable increase in oil prices. Foreign reserves stand at $38bn, the lowest since October 2021 and the naira exchange rate as well as the growing margins show the battle for a stable exchange rate is far from being won and it would appear the monetary authorities have run out of options.\n\nRead also: Banks\u2019 net domestic credit hits all-time high of N53.7trn\n\nSpeaking at the monthly breakfast of the Lagos Business School recently, leading economist Bismarck Rewane who is a member of the president\u2019s economic advisory council said to expect inflation to spike further to 17.5% in June on the back of rising core and seasonal inflation and a 200-3\u2014basis points rise in money rates. He adds that diesel price will touch N750 a litre in June while the local currency will fall further on the parallel market while the equities market is expected to trade flat in the month before dipping.\n\nData show that it is not just on the economic front that Nigeria is losing pace. Rankings of the country by Transparency international corruption perceptions, the Mo Ibrahim Index of African governance and the Global peace index point to continuing slippage. The average indicates a marked fall since the outgoing government in Nigeria came to power in 2015.\n\nAs Nigeria prepares for the election, the dire insecurity situation is getting even worse. On Sunday, over 40 persons were mowed down in a hail of gunshots inside the church where they were worshipping in the southwestern town of Owo. The incident has caused consternation among Nigerians who now expect the insecurity to continue to spread to areas in the south hitherto thought to be safe.\n\nTellimer research note says, \u201cthere has been limited progress, if not outright backsliding, on outgoing president Buhari\u2019s promises to fix the security and corruption problems with Nigeria continuing to rank very poorly on global peace and corruption scorecards during his tenure, increasing pressure on the ruling APC ahead of the February elections.\u201d\n\nThe only ray of hope is coming from the expectation among Nigerians that the leading candidates for next year\u2019s presidential election will mount market-friendly economic policies.\n\nPositive sentiments are emerging from how Nigerians perceive the economic agenda of the main candidates for next year\u2019s election with the candidate of the ruling party indicating a shift away from the controversial policies of the incumbent including full deregulation of the downstream sector of the oil industry.\n\nOpposition candidates Atiku Abubakar, Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the ruling party, and Peter Obi of the Labour party are expected to open the economy by mounting a string of economic reforms that will rejuvenate key areas of the economy if they win the election.\n\nOutgoing president Muhammadu Buhari has maintained a strangulating hold on the economy, leading to gasps and rising poverty which may see Nigerians turning away from the ruling party in the upcoming elections.",

          "text": "The All Progressives Congress (APC) and the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are engrossed in a tricky geo-political tussle bordering on how the running mates of their presidential candidates would emerge, LEADERSHIP Friday gathered yesterday.\n\nWhile the APC and its presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed, from the South West, are mindful of securing the bulk of Northern Muslim votes, the PDP and its presidential candidate, former vice president Atiku Abubakar, from the North East, have firmed their resolve to ensure that the running mate comes from the South South zone.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSources within the APC confided in LEADERSHIP Friday yesterday that the primary factor that will influence who emerges Tinubu\u2019s running mate is the ability to get block votes from the Northern states.\n\nThis is against the backdrop that, as a Southern Muslim, he is faced with the option of contesting the election with either a strong northern Christian politician or a Muslim.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, there are fears within the party that Atiku may get massive votes from the North, irrespective of party affiliation.\n\nSo far, Tinubu\u2019s likely running mate include former Speaker of the House of Representatives Yakubu Dogara, Plateau State governor Simon Lalong, current secretary to the government of the federation (SGF) Boss Mustapha, Kaduna State governor Nasir El-Rufai and his Kebbi State counterpart, Atiku Bagudu.\n\nA source close to the Tinubu political family said the APC candidate is tinkering with picking a governor from the North East zone, noting that if that fails to fly, he might pick a Christian from the same region.\n\nHowever, a South West APC chieftain who pleaded anonymity however told LEADERSHIP Friday that \u201cthe PDP should be less concerned about where our running mate will come from and who that person is likely to be. It is clear that the PDP is already oiling its propaganda machinery to spread falsehood in the country.\n\n\u201cWhether it is Christian-Christian ticket or Muslim-Muslim ticket is none of the business of the opposition. We are where we are because of all these primordial and emotional sentiments. How does insecurity differentiate us as worshippers of both Islam and\n\nChristianity? Does hunger know the difference between Islam and Christianity? Is poverty so clear-visioned to know who is a Muslim or Christian?\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the objective of the ruling party was to win the election.\n\nHe asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t Muslims in the North vote for the MKO? Who saved the situation for us in the APC in the last 72 hours? Are they not the Northern governors most of whom are Muslims? So, what are we saying?\n\n\u201cHowever the ticket is, we will have a very formidable team because we will not be cowed by the antics and blackmail of the PDP to direct us into any politically inexpedient decision.\n\n\u201cThose blackmailing us now, did they not know that power ought to shift to the South? Why did they not see the sense in picking a Christian presidential candidate if they love Nigeria?\u201d\n\nIn the PDP, however, it was gathered that Tinubu\u2019s emergence foreclosed the prospects of Atiku picking his running mate from the South West, a situation which has caused discomfort among some party leaders who were scheming to get the position.\n\nRecall that shortly after Tinubu won the APC presidential ticket, Atiku had held an emergency meeting with PDP governors in Abuja.\n\nSources in PDP told LEADERSHIP Friday that the South West was being considered by Atiku alongside the South South region for the VP Slot because the South West had the second largest bulk votes in the country.\n\nIt was also learnt that Atiku\u2019s camp was hopeful that the APC would settle for either Senate President Ahmed Lawan or former minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, as presidential flag bearer.\n\nBut after Tinubu picked the APC ticket, the former vice president\u2019s camp settled for the South South zone with Rivers State governor Nyesom Wike as a top contender.\n\nOther contenders for the position are Delta State governor Sen Ifeanyi Okowa and his Akwa Ibom State counterpart, Udom Emmanuel.\n\nIt was, however, gathered that a former Osun State governor and a former Ondo State governor who had lobbied some former military generals for the PDP vice presidential slot kicked against the move to take the position to another zone.\n\nIt was learnt that they argued that it would be more difficult to campaign for the PDP in the South West now that the APC has a presidential candidate from the region.\n\nThe former governors had also accused the only governor from their region of supporting Wike to get the ticket.\n\n\u201cAlthough the South West PDP is likely to emerge national party chairman if Atiku wins and the incumbent party chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, resigns to recognise the North/South zoning arrangement for Presidency and party chairman, the South West leaders are insisting that the likelihood of such prospect is not as certain as the vice president position,\u201d the source added.\n\nObi\u2019s Running-mate Must Be Northern Muslim \u2013 LP Stalwart\n\nMeanwhile, indications have emerged that the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) Mr. Peter Obi and his political spin-doctors are yet to commence any serious considerations for choosing his vice-presidential candidate.\n\nA very close associate of the Labour Party\u2019s presidential candidate told LEADERSHIP Friday that Obi and members of his presidential campaign organisation and supporters have been primarily occupied with the task of resolving the issue of factionalisation within the party\u2019s national leadership which gave birth to the emergence of a parallel presidential candidate.\n\nThe LP stalwart, who spoke yesterday, however, expressed relief that with the eventual withdrawal of a factional presidential candidate of the party, Chief Jude Ezenwafor, it had become clear that the issue of factionalisation is being resolved.\n\nIn his letter of withdrawal from participating in the coming 2023 general election as Labour Party presidential candidate he addressed to Labour Party national chairman and copied to the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, a copy of which was made available to several online platforms, Chief Ezenwafor stated that he decided to withdraw from the presidential race on \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d after wide consultations with his supporters.\n\n\u201cI regret any inconveniences my withdrawal might cost our great party. I thank the leadership of our great party for giving me the opportunity to serve Nigeria\u201d, Ezenwafor\u2019s letter read.\n\nMeanwhile, the member of Obi\u2019s presidential campaign organisation told LEADERSHIP Friday that the LP presidential candidate must be chosen from the Northern part of the country and that the person must be a Muslim.\n\nThe source who spoke on condition of anonymity, however, stated that the issue of the zone where the running mate would come from would be decided when serious considerations of the person to be chosen commences.\n\nAdamu Moves To Mend Fences, Lead NWC On Visit To Tinubu\n\nAfter the failed attempt to impose a northern candidate on the party as its standard bearer for the 2023 polls, national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Abdullahi Adamu, had begun moves to mend fences with presidential candidate of the party, Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nAdamu led members of the party\u2019s national working committee (NWC) on a visit to the residence of Tinubu to congratulate him on his emergence as the party\u2019s presidential flagbearer.\n\nSince he was declared winner of the presidential primary at Eagle Square in Abuja on Wednesday, the Abuja residence of Tinubu had become a Mecca of some sorts, with party big wigs, interest groups and individuals thronging the place to confer with him.\n\nSpeaking yesterday when he visited Tinubu with NWC members, Adamu said the party was with Tinubu and he remains the party project.\n\n\u201cFor us, action speaks louder than voice, we are here to join our brother, congratulate him and assure him that we are together. This is our project and by God\u2019s grace we will succeed,\u2019\u2019 the APC national chairman stated.\n\nTinubu scored 1,271 votes to clinch the party\u2019s presidential ticket at a special convention of the party, beating 13 other aspirants.\n\nBefore the convention, Tinubu was never Adamu\u2019s favorite candidate as he was said to have announced Senate President Ahmed Lawan as consensus candidate at a meeting of NWC the in Abuja on Monday.\n\nHe told the NWC members that he arrived at the choice of Lawan after consultation with President Buhari.\n\nBut members of the NWC quickly distanced themselves from the endorsement of Lawan as the party\u2019s consensus presidential candidate by the national chairman.\n\nThe NWC members led by APC national organizing secretary, Suleiman Argungu, told journalists that the NWC stood by the position taken by northern governors that the South should be allowed to produce the next president of Nigeria.\n\nINEC Gives Parties June 17 Deadline To Submit Candidates\u2019 Names\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said the list of all presidential and governorship candidates must be accompanied by the names of their vice presidential and deputy governorship candidates without which the nomination is invalid.\n\nThe commission also stated that all nominations must be uploaded to the portal on/or before the deadlines, adding that the portal will automatically shut down at 6pm on Friday, 17th June, 2022, for national elections and 6pm on Friday 15th July, 2022, for state elections.\n\nINEC chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, who disclosed this at a meeting with the Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs), reminded political parties that only the names of candidates that emerged from democratic primaries as provided by Section 84 of the Electoral Act 2022 shall be submitted to the commission.\n\nYakubu said a nomination centre had been set up at the Commission\u2019s headquarters to receive and process all nominations by political parties, including dedicated telephone lines, to serve as Help Desk for any party that may need assistance.\n\n\u201cWith this innovation, the Commission has eliminated the physical interface between party officials and INEC staff for the purpose of submitting the list of candidates for the 2023 General Election,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Continuous Voter Registration (CVR), the Commission said it had continued nationwide.\n\nHe, however, said as the deadline for the suspension of the current exercise approaches, the Commission had received reports of a surge in the number of prospective registrants that daily throng state and local government area offices as well as designated centres in many states across the country.\n\nYakubu reassured Nigerians that the Commission remains committed to ensuring that all citizens who wish to register are given the opportunity to do so.\n\n\u201cAlready, some of the Resident Electoral Commissioners have requested for more voter registration machines to ease the congestion.\n\n\u201cThe Commission will deploy additional machines to areas of need immediately. Thereafter, the Commission will meet to review the progress of the exercise and take further decisions.\n\n\u201cWe will always respond positively to the needs of Nigerians and therefore appeal to all citizens to be patient with the Commission as we strive to serve them better.\u201d\n\nHe appreciated the desire of Nigerians to register as voters and reassured all eligible registrants that no one would be left out.\n\nOsinbajo, Umahi, Ayade, Dogara congratulate Tinubu, Pledge Support\n\nSome of the aspirants in the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential primary election have congratulated the eventual winner, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, on his victory, promising to back him in the general election.\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo, who came third in the contest, in a statement he personally signed, congratulated Tinubu, saying that for many decades, he had shown passion, patriotism, courage and determination in the cause of nation-building.\n\nHe called on aspirants and party faithful to unite behind Tinubu to ensure victory for the party in the 2023 elections.\n\nHe said, \u201cI congratulate Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu on his victory at our party primaries and his emergence as the presidential candidate and flagbearer of our great party, the APC[H1] , for the forthcoming 2023 presidential elections.\n\n\u201cFor many decades, our flagbearer has shown passion, patriotism, courage and determination in the cause of nation-building. His sterling contributions to our democracy and its progress stand him out. His wealth of experience will certainly be critical in our party\u2019s continued efforts to attain a more secure and prosperous Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nOsinbajo congratulated President Muhammadu Buhari and all leaders of the APC for a successful Special Convention and Presidential Primary, even as he urged party members, regardless of who they voted for at the primaries, to unite behind Tinubu in the 2023 elections.\n\nOn his part, Ebonyi State Governor David Umahi, in a message signed by him and made available to LEADERSHIP Friday, congratulated Tinubu on his victory and pledged to work with him and other candidates of the party to win in the 2023 general elections.\n\nUmahi, who is the chairman of South East Governor\u2019s Forum, assured Tinubu of the support of the Ebonyi State chapter of the party in the 2023 political journey.\n\nHe commended all the aspirants and the APC National Working Committee for the smooth conduct of a fair presidential primary election.\n\n\u201cI encourage the leaders and members of our party to come together to support the party for a victorious journey in the 2023 election,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, former Speaker of the House of Representatives in the 8th National Assembly, Hon Yakubu Dogara, in his congratulatory message, also appealed to those who lost the APC presidential ticket to join hands with Tinubu, especially Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and former minister of transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, for the victory of APC in general elections.\n\nIn a statement issued by his media aide, Turaki Hassan, and made available to journalists in Bauchi yesterday, Dogara described the emergence of Tinubu as the beginning of good things to happen in Nigeria.\n\nYakubu Dogara stressed the need for a forming a formidable team around the presidential candidate of the ruling APC for the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cI urge all aspirants to close ranks and form a formidable force ahead of the 2023 general elections. This is the surest way to victory for the APC,\u201d he said, describing Tinubu as a bridge builder with a very large political followership across the country.\n\nCross River State Governor Ben Ayade, in his congratulatory message, expressed an \u201cunwavering optimism that this soldier of democracy who has seen it all will lead our great party to victory.\u201d\n\nIn statement signed by his special adviser on media and publicity, Christian Ita, Professor Ayade assured the APC presidential candidate of his total support at the polls.\n\nExtolling Tinubu\u2019s sterling qualities, Ayade said: \u201cYour Excellency, from your NADECO days to the ACN era and then to your immeasurable contribution to the formation of APC and its subsequent ascension to power, there is no doubt that you have laboured and sacrificed for democracy and its enthronement in our nation.\n\n\u201cI have an unwavering belief that as a soldier of democracy who has seen it all, you will lead the APC to seamless victory next year. Rest assured that as your look back, you will find me matching with you 100 per cent to the threshold of victory.\u201d\n\nWe Didn\u2019t Declare Tinubu \u2018s Emergence National Calamity \u2013 Ohanaeze\n\nMeanwhile, the national leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo has denied reports credited to it in some media describing the emergence of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu as the APC presidential candidate in the coming 2023 general election as a national calamity.\n\nThe national publicity secretary of the apex-Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Chief Chiedozie Ogbonnia, in a statement, further made it clear that Ohanaeze did not make any remarks concerning Tinubu\u2019s health status.\n\nHe said though Ohanaeze Ndigbo has its reservations about the unfolding developments in the primaries of political parties as it relates to the country\u2019s coming presidential election, the organisation is still understudying the developments and would make its position known in due course.\n\nOhanaeze expressed sadness over the statement, describing it as most irresponsible.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe attention of Ohanaeze Ndigbo has been drawn to a statement circulating in some sections of the media, attributed to our organization, describing the recent election of Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu as a \u2018national calamity, considering the enormity of the baggage he is burdened with\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe statement did not originate from Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide. We have no hands in the content, context, comprehension and delivery of the unfounded statement.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze read the message with sadness and views its contents as unfortunate, especially the attacks in that statement on the person and health status of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\u201d\n\nHe described the statement \u201cas very unfortunate, irresponsible, diversionary and most reprehensible\u201d.\n\nIt stated that the author of the statement is not the secretary general of Ohaneze Ndigbo. It gave the identity of its scribe as Ambassador Okay Emuchay, even as it added that Ohanaeze Ndigbo had no personal animosity against Tinubu to warrant such careless comments on his person.\n\nIt, however, expressed displeasure at the current political arrangement that seems orchestrated to exclude, marginalise and frustrate Ndigbo in a country they have worked hard to build.",

          "text": "Following last Sunday\u2019s attack by terrorists at St Francis Catholic Church, Owo where scores were killed and many injured, the United States of America (USA) has expressed worry over the growing pattern of violence afflicted on communities across Nigeria.\n\nIn a letter to Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, dated June 7, 2022 and signed by the United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard, the US said it is deeply saddened by the attack in Owo, assuring however that it remains steadfast in its effort to support Nigeria in tackling insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCondemning the attack in strongest terms, the US said, \u201cThis tragedy saddens us deeply and our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families during this difficult time. We remain steadfast in our efforts to support Nigeria in enhancing civilian security throughout the country.\u201d\n\nThe letter further reads in part, \u201dOn behalf of the United States and the staff of the U.S. Mission in Nigeria, I would like to extend my deepest condolences to you, Ondo State, and the Owo community for the horrific event and lives lost at the St. Francis Catholic Church on Sunday, June 5.\n\n\u201cThis tragedy saddens us deeply and our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families during this difficult time.\n\n\u201cThe United States condemns this attack in the strongest terms, and we are concerned with the growing pattern of violence that afflicts communities across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe remain steadfast in our efforts to support Nigeria in enhancing civilian security throughout the country. Once again, please accept our deepest condolences.\u201d\n\nWe Are Determined To Redouble Our Efforts On Security- Akeredolu\n\nMeanwhile, Ondo State governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has said despite the commitment of his administration to the security of lives and property in the state, he is determined to redouble efforts geared towards enhanced security.\n\nGovernor Akeredolu disclosed that before the horrific attack on Owo, he had already directed the recruitment of 300 fresh personnel into the state security network codenamed Amotekun corps.\n\nHe said more vehicles and ammunition would also be procured for the Amotekun Corp for effective protection of the people in the state.\n\nGovernor Akeredolu hinted that his administration would soon issue an executive order for all places of worship to install Close Circuit Cameras (CCTV) at strategic places on their premises.\n\nThe governor spoke while receiving members of the Ondo State House Of Assembly on a condolence visit over the Owo terror attack.\n\nThe lawmakers who were led by the Speaker, Hon. Bamidele Oloyelogu were received by Governor Akeredolu at his residence in Owo, his home town.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the lawmakers, the Speaker commiserated with the governor and the people of the state, the Olowo of Owo, Oba Gbadegesin Ogunoye as well as families of those who lost their lives to the terror attack at St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo.\n\nThe Speaker said it was unfortunate that the house of God which used to be a heaven has turned into a scene for massacre.\n\nHe lauded Governor Akeredolu for his effort at protecting the lives and property of the citizens of Ondo State through the establishment of the Amotekun Corps.\n\n\u201cMr governor, we are always with you any time. At this trying time we are to commiserate with you and the good people of Owo.\n\n\u201cWhen we were coming, we went to the Church. We commended the security operatives so far so good but appealing to them to try as much as possible to get those people arrested and bring them to book in other to stop such a thing in our environment.\n\n\u201cMr Governor, we also ask our people, especially the people Of Owo and its environs, and other parts of the state to be vigilant. If they see any strange face, they should quickly report it to the security agencies,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernor Akeredolu described the evil act as tragic, saying Ondo State and the South West region have never witnessed such an ugly incident.\n\n\u201cThese animals who came, because no human being will carry out such evil act, they did not come to kidnap. There is no other way we can describe them than terrorists; they were there to maim and kill,\u201d the Governor said.\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has disclosed that last Sunday\u2019s attack on St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo State, by gunmen leading to the death of worshippers has been linked to the Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP).\n\nMinister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, disclosed this to State House correspondents after the national security council meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the presidential villa.\n\nThe minister who briefed alongside the Inspector-General of Police, Alkali Baba Usman, said the police have been ordered to go after the perpetrators of the act and bring them to justice.\n\nAccording to him, the imprint of ISWAP has been found on the scene of the attack, vowing that they will be brought to justice.\n\nThe mister observed that ISWAP\u2019s aim is to pit Nigerians against each other by this attack to make it appear as ethno-religious war.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe National Security Council has just risen from its meeting today, which reviewed, very critically, all aspects of security situation in the country and came up with conclusions, commending the efforts of the military and other security agencies in mitigating the insurgency, particularly in the North East where the fundamentalists there have been weakened, degraded and equally in the North West where the bandits are equally weakened, and the North Central, where we\u2019re engaged with pockets of bandits.\n\n\u201cThe council is quite concerned about the violent attack in Owo, Ondo State, and have been able to locate the perpetrators of that horrendous attack. From all indications, we are zeroing in on ISWAP, the Islamic State for West Africa.\n\n\u201cIt is not an ethnoreligious thing. The animals in ISWAP wanting attention, recognition are suspected to have launched that attack. We have directed all the agencies concerned to go after them and bring them to justice.\u201d\n\nAregbesola noted that the government was equally concerned about the spate of attacks in the name of blasphemy.\n\nAccordingly, he said the police have been directed to mobilize, identify and preempt all those involved in the blasphemy attacks in two areas of the country, namely Sokoto and Abuja, of recent.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe assurance is that we are committed to maintaining law and order and providing adequate security for Nigerian citizens.\n\n\u201cAppropriate preparation is put in place for the elections coming up in Ekiti this month and Osun next month, principally by the Nigeria Police Force and supported by other security agencies, and to some extent, the military. That\u2019s the long and short of it.\n\n\u201cThe president wants us to assure Nigerians that his administration is committed to providing adequate security and ensuring the maintenance of law and order so that Nigerians would be able to go about their businesses, particularly farmers, who will want to go to their farms without any fear of attack or molestation.\n\nResponding to the recent kidnap and release of the Methodist Church Prelate, His Eminence, Samuel Kanu-Uche, the IGP said no arrest had been made, but pointed out that the matter is still being investigated.\n\n\u201cFor the issue of the kidnapping of the Methodist Church Prelate, no arrest has been made in terms of suspects, but we are still on it. Arrest doesn\u2019t have to come immediately. The case is still under investigation. The case is open and we are still looking for the suspects.\n\n\u201cWe have leads, we have some issues that we are still following through how the ransom was collected and how the negotiations were done. We have information to that effect and we\u2019re looking at getting into the real aspect of getting the suspects arrested.\n\n\u201cAs for the issue of helicopter attack, the allegations are there, the assertions are there. We have not been able to say there is any helicopter attack on innocent citizens, like you have suggested. but most of the times these assertions are made and up till now we\u2019ve not been able to see or we\u2019ve not been able to identify any helicopter that is flying and killing people unnecessarily.\u201d",

          "text": "Federal government has declared Monday, June 13, as public holiday to mark this year\u2019s Democracy Day celebration.\n\nThe minister of interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola who made the declaration on behalf of the federal government, congratulated Nigerians and urged all citizens to support the present administration in its efforts at ensuring a secure, united and prosperous nation.\n\nThe minister admonished Nigerians to use the occasion to reflect on the country\u2019s move towards the enthronement of a civil democratic order, before independence, till date and the sacrifices of our patriots.\n\nHe reminded Nigerians of the challenges they have faced and overcome, including a civil war. He emphasised that any form of agitation that threatens the unity of the country should be shunned for the good of all.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs we mark another Democracy Day in the history of our dear country, let us reflect on the efforts of our founding fathers and ensure that Nigeria remains united, secured, peaceful and an indivisible entity, noting that no development can take place in an acrimonious environment.\n\n\u201cWith the challenges we face in Nigeria today, I see an opportunity for us not to break up or break down, but to break open; open up to ourselves in truth so that we may appreciate each other, understand each other, honour each other and live together in peace and prosperity,\u201d Aregbesola reiterated.\n\nThe minister advised Nigerians to judiciously put into use the recently unveiled Nigeria Internal Security and Public Safety Alert System (N-Alert) Mobile App designed to mitigate security challenges and other disasters.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe federal government yesterday said that President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration has done enough to honour the presumed winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential election, late Chief Moshood Abiola.\n\nLEADERSHIP Friday recalls that President Buhari had in 2018, directed that Nigeria\u2019s Democracy Day, which was hitherto marked every May 29, be shifted to June 12 in honour of late Chief Moshood Kashimawo Abiola, the presumed winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential election.\n\nPresident Buhari also honoured the presumed winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential election, Chief MKO Abiola, with a posthumous award of Grand Commander of the Order of the Federal Republic (GCFR).\n\nMinister of information and culture, Lai Mohammed, disclosed this during a briefing at Radio House yesterday in Abuja, where he detailed activities to mark this year\u2019s event.\n\nHe said President Buhari will address the nation through a live broadcast on Sunday, June 12, 2022 by 7:00 am to mark Democracy Day.\n\nThe minister listed some of the activities lined up for the Democracy Day celebration including a public lecture at the National Mosque on Friday and Jumaat prayers on the same day and venue on June 10, 2022.\n\nAccording to him, this will be followed by the President\u2019s address and a church service at the National Christian Centre at 3 pm on Sunday, June 12, 2022. There will also be a Democracy Day parade at the Eagle Square in Abuja on Monday morning.\n\nHe assured that all events will be held and there will be no security breaches.\n\nThe minister added that attendance \u201cat these events are strictly by invitation and in line with the COVID-19 protocol.\u201d\n\nMohammed further explained that the annulment of June 12 brought Nigeria to the brink. He, therefore, said whatever the federal government is doing today to celebrate that day in memory of MKO Abiola is worth it.\n\n\u201cSo, I think the federal government has done enough in addition to the fact that several state governments have followed suit. We have in our small way been courageous enough to declare this day a public holiday, I think it is the best gift to any Nigerian,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The Kaduna State governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, on Friday, said competence, capacity and capability in terms of delivering good governance to Nigerians should be placed ahead of religion, in voting office-holders in 2023 general elections.\n\nSpeaking on the possibility of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) flying a Muslim/Muslim presidential ticket in the next year\u2019s elections on Channels TV\u2019s \u2018Politics Today\u2019 on Frriday night, monitored by our correspondent, el-Rufai said he doesn\u2019t believe that the business of governance has to do with religion.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEl-Rufai advised the nation to rather look for the best person for the job instead of placing religious sentiment ahead of competence.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI think we should look for the best person for the job, the person that will get the job done, and get him to do that.\u201d\n\nHe further stressed that he doesn\u2019t look at people from the lens of being a Muslim or Christian.\n\n\u201cSome of my closest friends are Christians. Pastor Tunde Bakare is a Pentecostal pastor. He was the one that took me to CPC, not the President who is a Muslim while I\u2019m very close to Pastor Bakare. I\u2019m very close to many Christians.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that the business of governance has to do with religion. I\u2019m the wrong person to be asked such a question because in my state, I picked a very competent, qualified woman as my running mate in the 2019 elections.\n\n\u201cBut just because she happens to be a Muslim, people are calling it Muslim/Muslim ticket and they said we\u2019re going to lose, but we won overwhelmingly. This fixation of Nigerians with religion instead of competence, capacity and capability is quite sad and pathetic,\u201d he added.\n\nThe governor, however, urged the media to take religion out of governance, while the nation looks for someone competent and has the capacity and capability to deliver.\n\n\u201cWe want to develop this country,\u201d he said, adding that, \u201cWhen I get into a plane I don\u2019t ask for the religion of the pilot, when I go to the hospital, I don\u2019t ask for the religion of the doctor. When boarding a plane, I just want to get to my destination accurately.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that, \u201cthe way the media and many irresponsible people try to inject religion in politics and governance is sad and pathetic.\u201d\n\nHe queried that such disposition will not take the nation anywhere.\n\nEl-Rufai said Nigeria was at a crossroads and faces very serious dangers in terms of security and economic meltdown.\n\n\u201cNigeria is at the crossroads. We face very, very serious dangers in security and economic meltdown.\n\n\u201cThe global issues are affecting us and all that people are concerned with as far as who will be president and vice president is religion. It is so sad.\n\n\u201cIt is not a religion that will solve our problem. It is the people who are competent, that will address Nigeria\u2019s problems, unite this country, and put it on a progressive path,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe added that the nation should look for the best person for the job, the person that will get the job done.",

          "text": "By Okeoghene Akubuike\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is set to introduce the Unstructured Supplementary (USSD) code as part of steps to improve the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).\n\nKingsley Obiora, the CBN Deputy Governor said this at the IMF African Department Speakers Series held virtually on Friday.\n\nObiora said the introduction of the USSD code became necessary to improve financial inclusion in the country and to ensure people without smartphones could still transact on the eNaira platform.\n\n\u201cWe have made serious progress in the last seven to eight years because when the current governor resumed in 2014, one of the pillars of his vision was to significantly improve financial inclusion.\n\n\u201cSo at the time, we were at 48 per cent of our population within the financial system and given several policies that he conceived and implemented, we are almost at 70 per cent.\n\n\u201cThat still leaves us with about 30 per cent of our population out of the financial system and we believe the CBDC can help reduce that number even more.\n\n\u201cA lot of people might not have smartphones but that is essentially the next step of our improvement in the CBDC, to introduce the USSD code, so those that do not have smartphones can still transact,\u201d Obiora said.\n\nThe CBN deputy governor said that the barrier to entry on the CBDC platform was low, which made it possible for everyone with a Bank Verification Number (BVN) to be onboarded into the eNaira platform in a few minutes.\n\nObiora said the value of the country\u2019s digital payments grew from 324 billion dollars in 2008 to about 2.4 trillion dollars presently, adding that Nigerians were now used to digital payments.\n\n\u201dAs you know, within the content we have one of the largest Fintech companies, Futterwave, Paystack, etc, \u201c the apex bank boss added.\n\nHe said that the CBDC had significant benefits for Nigeria, which was why the CBN decided to introduce it.\n\nObiora listed the benefits to include rapid financial inclusion, reducing the cost of processing cash, enabling direct welfare payments to citizens, and reducing the informal economy.\n\nOthers are improving tax collection, boosting cross-border trade and remittances, reducing the cost and improving the efficiency of payments and just endearing economic growth in general.\n\nHe, however, listed some of the key risks to introducing the CBDC including banking sector disintermediation, operational risks of knowing that there is non-stop service, cyber security risks, internet disruptions and financial literacy.\n\nObiora said that Nigeria was doing well based on a PwC report, which showed that Nigeria was number one in terms of adoption, adding that the CBN would keep growing and improving on the system.\n\nSpeaking on adopting cryptocurrency in Nigeria, the deputy governor said for now it would not become part of the country\u2019s financial system because of the volatility that it could create for the system.\n\nCommenting on the high cost of food and fuel in Nigeria caused by the war in Ukraine, he said that the problem was more political than economic.\n\nAccording to him, we hope that world leaders will sort this out as quickly as possible because ordinary people who have no egos and did not cause this problem are the ones that are suffering the most.\n\n\u201cWithin Nigeria what we are seeing is that farm gate food prices have either stabilised or reduced, whereas in the market it actually has increased.\u201d\n\nObiora said a lot of the problems with rising food inflation were due to logistic problems and the issue of higher prices of fuel and transportation.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to deal with that by investing a bit in a commodity exchange so that they can stabilise prices.\n\nHe said, \u201cwithin the monetary policy committee, rates will be raised at least to signal that we will continue to keep an eye on inflation and stand ready to do whatever it takes to turn it around.\u201d\n\nAccording to the moderator, Mr Abebe Selassie, Director, African Department, IMF, the series is a platform where Africa\u2019s pressing economic policy issues are discussed and organised by the IMF\u2019s African Department.\n\nSelassie said the series provided an opportunity for policymakers, academics, and analysts to offer their perspectives on economic and policy issues relevant to the IMF\u2019S African constituency.\n\nNAN",

          "text": "The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) chose Bola Tinubu, a former Lagos State governor, as its presidential candidate after weeks of intrigue and uncertainty.\n\nThe 70-year-old politician was able to rally northern governors to his cause, handing crushing defeats to other younger and more nimble contenders, including Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nTinubu, Osinbajo, and Rotimi Amaechi, the former Minister of Transportation, were neck and neck a few weeks before the national convention, despite the odds favoring Tinubu.\n\nGovernors Simon Lalong of Plateau State, Nasir El-rufai of Kaduna, and Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa State were among those who publicly backed Amaechi.\n\nThe governors, however, had closed ranks and allied with the former Lagos State governor three days before the poll.\n\nAccording to the findings of the DAILY POST, the governors assessed Amaechi\u2019s candidacy against former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and concluded that the chances were poor.\n\nThe governor of Jigawa State, who had openly expressed support for Amaechi, subsequently resigned and called his people to rally behind Tinubu.\n\nAccording to an insider, after President Muhammadu Buhari declared that governors should support him in choosing a candidate, the governors met multiple times, but it became evident that more governors preferred Tinubu.\n\nThe insider also said Amaechi\u2019s campaign also slowed down after his resignation as Minister, therefore, creating doubt in the minds of those willing to back him.\n\n\u201cDuring those meetings, Governor Umar Ganduje, Gboyega Oyetola, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Babagana Zulum were clear on their position as far as their favourite candidate is concerned. Also, the declaration by Abdulahi Adamu on Ahmad Lawan as consensus candidate united the governors to pick the strongest of the candidates,\u201d the source said.\n\nIt would be recalled that the National Chairman had announced the Senate president as the choice of the president as the consensus candidate.\n\nThat same day, some governors, including Nasir El-Rufai, Umar Ganduje, Babajide Sanwo-Olu came to the National Secretariat and had a meeting with some members of the NWC; however, Adamu shunned the meeting.\n\nUndeterred, the governors went to Adamu\u2019s house in the Villa around 1 a.m., to make it clear they will not accept Lawan.\n\nAnother insider told DAILY POST that the governors wanted to make it clear to Adamu that they are the owners of the party.\n\n\u201cSince (Adams) Oshiomhole left, the governors have been in control of the party. They know the antecedent of Adamu. What played out at the convention was to make it clear that they are the one to pick the successor of President Buhari.\n\n\u201cOn the choice of Asiwaju, they looked at who has the capacity to go head to head with Atiku Abubakar in the general election. The governors have a huge stake in the election. If the APC should lose the presidential election, it will affect their senatorial elections as most of them want to move to the Senate and also elect a successor,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cFor the governors, it was more of a logical reasoning, nothing more, and Amaechi fell short of the expectation,\u201d the source further explained.\n\nTinubu, in his acceptance speech, also corroborated this, when he said he did not know what he told the governors, but they gave him their total support.",

          "text": "\u2026Says I\u2019ll support Tinubu \u2026You\u2019ll be the flag-bearer tomorrow \u2013 Nigerian women\n\nThe vice-president, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, has reiterated his commitment to the dream of a new Nigeria despite the outcome of the just-concluded All Progressives Congress (APC) Special Convention.\n\nOsinbajo\u2019s spokesman, Laolu Akande, in a statement on Friday in Abuja, said the vice-president stated this during his visit to the campaign office of The Progressive Project (TPP), a coalition of support groups that backed him for the presidency.\n\nThe vice-president, according to the statement, also said he would support Sen. Bola Tinubu, winner and flag-bearer of the party for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nOsinbajo described the clamour for a new Nigeria as \u201ca movement.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThis movement is a movement within a party also, we are not doing something that has not been heard of before.\n\n\u201cWhat is new is that we have a firm belief that a new Nigeria is possible and it is possible through us who are here. We went to the convention, and the results showed us clearly that we lost, but it is only a battle, it is not a war.\n\n\u201cThere are battles ahead, but we will win the war for a new Nigeria. I have no doubt in my mind that we will win that war for a new Nigeria. That is why our movement for a new Nigeria must remain strong and firm; and we will do everything to keep our movement strong and solid.\u201d\n\nThe vice-president said further that despite the result of the APC presidential primary, the dream of a new country remained alive and well.\n\nAccording to him, the resolve for a new Nigeria remains strong.\n\n\u201cWe will have at the back of our minds, that what you have started in the various movements, coming into one, is the seed that will birth a new nation. You and I know the time has come and we will devote everything to it.\n\n\u201cI am committed and will remain committed to that dream (of a new Nigeria), for as long as you are willing and recognise that we have not yet written the story of this country, we have not yet completed the story of this country.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, the story has just begun, this movement has just started\n\n\u201cOnce the genie comes out of the bottle, you cannot put it back; the word has been spoken; it cannot be taken back: it is time for a New Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe pledged support for the APC presidential candidate for the 2023 elections.\n\nOsinbajo recalled the personal letter he wrote to Tinubu on Thursday congratulating him on his victory at the party primary.\n\n\u201cIn that letter, I said to him that the dream of this country, the dream of a new country, remains alive and well. And I want you to know in your hearts that we are democrats when we participate in a contest and the results are announced.\n\n\u201cNo matter what those results may be, we abide by them because there is only one process for democrats, whether that process is good or bad, there is only one, and we have gone through that process.\n\n\u201cAnd in that process, a winner has been judged, but that does not kill the dream of the great future. We will support our party; we will support the flag-bearer of our party because we know that the other side is not even worth considering. So, we will support the flag-bearer of our party, we will do everything we can.\u201d\n\nHe thanked Nigerians at home and abroad, including the Osinbajo supporters\u2019 groups, for the overwhelming support for his presidential bid.\n\nSome leaders of Osinbajo Support groups lauded the vice-president for being a true leader and inspiration to millions of Nigerians.\n\nReactions\n\nDr. Ahmed Badanga described Osinbajo as \u201ca role model to all.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are the Obama of Africa; you have made us proud and we will continue to remain with you. Yes, we are progressives and we need to move forward. I will urge all of us to remain steadfast and be committed to this cause because we have a bright future ahead of us,\u201d Badanga said.\n\nHajiya Rabbi Dauda, leader of the Coalition of Women for Osinbajo, said the vice-president was a winner forever.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, we, the women of Nigeria, find it worthy to stand by you.\n\n\u201cSomehow, you are not the flag-bearer today, but you will be the flag-bearer tomorrow.\n\n\u201cI want to say to you that this is a continuous process, we will be waiting for you. We are here today to listen to you, to tell us where to go and what to do, and I tell you, we will all be waiting for you, tomorrow and always.\n\n\u201cAnytime you need us, all you need to do is to call on us and we shall be there for you,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother leader of a support group, Mrs. Diana Mary, said Osinbajo had set a path that would be followed.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, you have led us to win, we are winners. We are not taking this for granted; you have led a direction that we will continue to follow and we are happy that for the sake of Nigeria you answered the call.\n\n\u201cI want to appeal that we still converge and speak about those things that we need to address so that we can pull a stronger force for Nigeria. This generation of Nigerians is looking for that force that will fight for their future,\u201d she said.\n\nThe vice-president was accompanied on the visit to the Campaign Office by the senator representing Kano South in the National Assembly, Sen.

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo on Friday said he remains committed to the dream of a new Nigeria, despite losing the All Progressives Congress\u2019 presidential ticket to Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nHe made the remark while speaking in Abuja at the campaign office of the Progressive Project (TPP), a coalition of support groups that backed the Vice President for the presidency.\n\nThe Vice President also stated that he will support the winner and flagbearer of the APC for the 2023 presidential elections, Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nOsinbajo was received by a large crowd at the TPP Office in Abuja, a statement signed by presidential spokesperson Laolu Akande said.\n\nIn his address to the crowd of supporters, the Vice President described the clamour for a new Nigeria as a movement.\n\nREAD ALSO: APC Must Unite Behind Tinubu \u2013 Buhari\n\n\u201cThis movement is a movement within a party also, we are not doing something that has not been heard of before,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is new is that we have a firm belief that a new Nigeria is possible and it is possible through us who are here.\n\n\u201cWe went to the convention, and the results showed us clearly that we lost, but it is only a battle, it is not the war. There are battles ahead, but we will win the war for a new Nigeria. I have no doubt in my mind that we will win that war for a new Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThat is why our movement for a new Nigeria must remain strong and firm. And we will do everything to keep our movement strong and solid.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Vice President, despite the result of the APC Presidential Primary, \u201cthe dream of a new country remains alive and well\u2026 We will have at the back of our minds, that what you have started in the various movements, coming into one, is the seed that will birth a new nation. You and I know the time has come and we will devote everything to it.\n\n\u201cI am committed and will remain committed to that dream (of a new Nigeria), for as long as you are willing and recognize that we have not yet written the story of this country, we have not yet completed the story of this country. As a matter of fact, the story has just begun, this movement has just started.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President further said, \u201ca new Nigeria has only just started, and everywhere across this land, it will be clear to all that a new Nigeria has been born. Once the genie comes out of the bottle, you cannot put it back. The word has been spoken; it cannot be taken back: it is time for a New Nigeria.\u201d\n\nPledging support for the APC presidential candidate for the 2023 elections, Prof. Osinbajo recalled the personal letter he wrote to Asiwaju yesterday congratulating him on his victory at the party primary.\n\n\u201cIn that letter, I said to him that the dream of this country, the dream of a new country remains alive and well. And I want you to know in your hearts that we are democrats when we participate in a contest and the results are announced.\n\n\u201cNo matter what those results may be, we abide by them because there is only one process for democrats, whether that process is good or bad, there is only one, and we have gone through that process.\n\n\u201cAnd in that process, a winner has been adjudged, but that does not kill the dream of the great future. We will support our party; we will support the flagbearer of our party because we know that the other side is not even worth considering. So, we will support the flagbearer of our party, we will do everything we can.\u201d\n\nThanking Nigerians at home and abroad, including the Osinbajo supporters\u2019 groups, for the overwhelming support for his presidential bid, Prof. Osinbajo noted that \u201cwhen we started this race, I never believed that we would have so many young men and women who would believe so passionately in the cause of a new Nigeria.\u201d\n\nExpressing his gratitude to them, he said, \u201ceverybody said, oh, everyone has lost hope, there is no future, we are all tired, we are in despair. But when you came out in your numbers across the country \u2013 the volunteers\u2019 movement, the progressive union, the women\u2019s movement, all across the country, saying the same thing, I knew that it was time. And you made it clear to everyone that indeed it is time for a new Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAnd we went everywhere to the 36 States of this country and Abuja and we spoke to the elected delegates of our great party the APC, they shared their fears with us, they told us about their dreams of the future, everyone wants a new Nigeria where young people have jobs, we all want a Nigeria that is safe and secure, a Nigeria where there is a future, where people can dream of a real future.\n\n\u201cAs I said at the convention, I went to school here, I was born here, my parents were born here. Every opportunity I have had was given to me by this country. \u201cAnd it is possible for this country to provide the same opportunity for you and all the future generations. But we must fight for it. In every fight, you lose some battles.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, some leaders of Osinbajo Support groups lauded the Vice President for being a true leader and inspiration to millions of Nigerians.\n\nDr Ahmed Badanga described the Vice President as \u201ca role model to all of us.

          "text": "The Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room (Situation Room), a coalition of Civil Society Organisations, has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to extend the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise.\n\nThe current CVR exercise is scheduled to end on June 30.\n\nBut the CSOs believe \u201ccitizens have now intensified their efforts in registering for their Permanent Voter\u2019s Card (PVC).\n\n\u201cThere have also been several appeals by Nigerians to INEC to extend the registration exercise to enable them register to obtain a PVC. Situation Room has received reports of large crowds at the INEC offices across the country.\n\nREAD ALSO: INEC Records \u2018Unprecedented Surge\u2019 In PVC Registration, To Deploy More Machines\n\n\u201cThere were lots of complaints while the pre-registrations were open on the online voters\u2019 portal, that confirmed scheduling was not observed by officers at many INEC offices leading to people being treated as walk-in registrants and asked to queue to supply the same details already provided online.\n\n\u201cWhile we note some registrants wait for last minute to meet deadlines for registration, it is also worthy to note that there have been several complaints of inadequate manpower and equipment in INEC offices, thus making it difficult to have a seamless registration process. This has led to delays and restiveness of citizens waiting to register in long queues.\n\n\u201cSituation Room is further concerned that many Nigerians will be discouraged and disenfranchised if the exercise proceeds in this manner. In addition, INEC is yet to cover many of the rural communities in this process thereby excluding citizens who may be far away from the INEC LGA offices.\n\n\u201cThe attention of Situation Room has been called on several posts by citizens on Twitter reporting the conduct of INEC officials across the country. In Amawbia, Awka-South LGA \u2013 Anambra State, prospective voters were asked to sweep the INEC office before being attended to or leave if they refused. In Nnewi North Local Government, another report states that the sum of 1,000 Naira is being collected for voter registration. In Aba North LGA, workers have not been to work for four months.\n\n\u201cSituation Room calls on INEC to check conduct of their staff nationwide, properly coordinate the ongoing voter registration exercise and restrain the chaotic situation in many registration centres nationwide. If the process is managed properly and seamlessly, every eligible citizen will be captured. S 9(6) of the Electoral Act 2022 which allows for voter registration to go on till ninety days to the general elections means that INEC still has room to extend the CVR exercise.\n\n\u201cSituation Room commends the traders in Alaba International Market, Ojo in Lagos State who shut down the market to register for their PVCs and dispelled the thugs who came to disrupt the process. Citizens should not be subject to this kind of attack in the process of carrying out a constitutional right. We call on the Nigeria Police to investigate the incident and make arrest of perpetrators to prevent this incident from repeating itself in other locations where registrants are gathered.\n\n\u201cSituation Room therefore urges eligible citizens who are yet to register not to be deterred and to take advantage of the ongoing CVR exercise to do so. For those who registered between July 2021 and December 2021, Situation Room calls on them to go to INEC\u2019s Office at the Local Government Area where their polling unit is located to collect their PVCs.\n\n\u201cRemember, it is your right to vote!\u201d",

          "title": "US Inflation Hit 40-Year High of 8.6% in May",
          "text": "The costs of gas, food and other necessities jumped in May, raising inflation to a new four-decade high and giving American households no respite from rising costs.\n\nConsumer prices surged 8.6% last month from 12 months earlier, faster than April\u2019s year-over-year surge of 8.3%, the Labor Department said Friday.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nOn a month-to-month basis, prices jumped 1% from April to May, a steep rise from the 0.3% increase from March to April. Much higher gas prices were to blame for most of that increase.\n\nAmerica\u2019s rampant inflation is imposing severe pressures on families, forcing them to pay much more for food, gas and rent and reducing their ability to afford discretionary items, from haircuts to electronics. Lower-income and Black and Latino Americans, in particular, are struggling because, on average, a larger proportion of their income is consumed by necessities.\n\nAt the same time, inflation has shown some signs of moderating, and economists expect it to decline this year, though not by very much. Some analysts have forecast that the inflation gauge the government reported Friday \u2014 the consumer price index \u2014 may drop below 7% by year\u2019s end. In March, the year-over-year CPI reached 8.5%, the highest such rate since 1982.\n\nHigh inflation has also forced the Federal Reserve into what will likely be the fastest series of interest rate hikes in three decades. By raising borrowing costs aggressively, the Fed hopes to cool spending and growth enough to curb inflation without tipping the economy into a recession. For the central bank, it will be a difficult balancing act.\n\nSurveys show that Americans see high inflation as the nation\u2019s top problem, and most disapprove of President Biden\u2019s handling of the economy. Congressional Republicans are hammering Democrats on the issue in the run-up to midterm elections this fall.\n\nInflation has remained high even as the sources of rising prices have shifted. Initially, robust demand for goods from Americans who were stuck at home for months after COVID-19 hit caused shortages and supply-chain snarls and drove up prices for cars, furniture and appliances.\n\nNow, as Americans resume spending on services, including travel, entertainment and dining out, the costs of airline tickets, hotel rooms and restaurant meals have soared. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has further accelerated the prices of oil and natural gas. And with China easing strict COVID lockdowns in Shanghai and elsewhere, more of its citizens are driving, thereby sending oil prices up even further.\n\nGoods prices are expected to fall in the coming months. Many large retailers, including Target, Walmart and Macy\u2019s, have reported that they\u2019re now stuck with too much of the patio furniture, electronics and other goods that they ordered when those items were in heavier demand and will have to discount them.\n\nEven so, rising gas prices are eroding the finances of millions of Americans. Prices at the pump are averaging nearly $5 a gallon nationally and edging closer to the inflation-adjusted record of about $5.40 reached in 2008.\n\nResearch by the Bank of America Institute, which uses anonymous data from millions of their customers\u2019 credit and debit card accounts, shows spending on gas eating up a larger share of consumers\u2019 budgets and crowding out their ability to buy other items.\n\nFor lower-income households \u2014 defined as those with incomes below $50,000 \u2014 spending on gas reached nearly 10% of all spending on credit and debit cards in the last week of May, the institute said in a report this week. That\u2019s up from about 7.5% in February, a steep increase in such a short period.\n\nSpending by all the bank\u2019s customers on long-lasting goods, like furniture, electronics and home improvement, has plunged from a year ago, the institute found. But their spending on plane tickets, hotels and entertainment has continued to rise.\n\nEconomists have pointed to that shift in spending from goods to services as a trend that should help lower inflation by year\u2019s end. But with wages rising steadily for many workers, prices are rising in services as well.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

They were bleeding. They were throwing up. I saw friends with blood all over their faces, I was slipping in people\u2019s blood.\u201d\n\nThe committee also screened part of Trump\u2019s incendiary speech immediately before the attack, in which he redirected his supporters\u2019 anger at Vice President Mike Pence, who was at the Capitol that day overseeing the congressional certification of Joe Biden\u2019s election win.\n\nThe committee further showed how even some of the people closest to the former president did not believe or support his voter fraud claims, including former Attorney General William Barr, and Trump\u2019s daughter and adviser Ivanka.\n\nWILLIAM BARR: \u201cAnd in that context, I made it clear I did not agree with the idea of saying the election was stolen and putting out this stuff, which I told the president was bullshit.\u201d\n\nIVANKA TRUMP: \u201cI respect Attorney General Barr so I accepted what he was saying.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Liz Cheney, one of two Republicans on the committee, also noted that multiple Republican congressmen later sought pardons from the White House for what she said was their role in trying to overturn the election.\n\nMeanwhile Trump, who is considering another White House run in 2024, lashed out at the committee of quote \u201cpolitical hacks\u201d after Thursday\u2019s hearing and stood by his voter fraud claims.\n\nFour people were killed during the January 6 riots, which also caused millions of dollars in damage to the Capitol. More than 100 police officers were injured, while one officer died the following day.",
