          "text": "Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, who ordered the faithful administration of justice and urged mankind to dispense and be witnesses to justice on all. Allah says: \u201cO you who believe! Be steadfast witnesses for justice, as witnesses to God, even against yourselves, the rich or poor.\n\n\u201cO believers! Stand firm for justice as witnesses for Allah even if it is against yourselves, your parents, or close relatives. Be they rich or poor, Allah is best to ensure their interests. So do not let your desires cause you to deviate \u00f9from justice\u00fa.\n\nIf you distort the testimony or refuse to give it, then \u00f9know that\u00fa Allah is certainly All-Aware of what you do.\u201d [An-Nisa:4/135]\n\n\n\nWhoever Allah guides remains guided and whoever Allah misguided, remains so. I bear witness that there is no god but Allah alone with no partner, the Almighty, Who has no associates and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger May Allah\u2019s peace and blessings be upon the Prophet, his family and companions, who judged the truth and by it were just and delivered a great deal of peace.\n\n\n\nO Servants of Allah, I urge you and myself to fear God Almighty, for His blessings upon you continue to flow. The pious one is the best of people in all situation and the happiest in wealth, God Almighty says: -3], \u201cAnd whoever fears Allah, He will make for him ease in his affair.\u201d [Al-Talaq: 65/4]\n\n\n\nBrothers in Islam, this is the second lunar month of the Islamic Hijra and we are still on the issue of security and as a theme, we shall discussing: Justice as the key to security in Islam:\n\nBrothers in Islam, there is no doubt that security and safety of people are among the most important pillars of societies and means of societal stability, and if you wish, you can say it is the most important of them.\n\n\n\nFor this reason, Islam established the value of security in the hearts of all so that the society achieves stability, which is a real prelude to any renaissance. Our master Prophet Ibraheem, peace be upon him, prayed for the peace and tranquility of the society first. He said, Make this a safe country and provide its people with fruits, whoever among them believes in God and the Last Day and the Last Day and the Last Day for food.\n\n\n\nAnd our Prophet Muhammad, (Peace be upon him), says: \u201cWhoever among you has become safe in his flock, healthy in his body, and has his daily sustenance, it is as if the whole world has been given to him.\u201d\n\n\n\nDear Muslims, Islam considers as very important role to provide security for others and his fulfillment of that as a condition of faith according to the different jurists and commentators of hadith.\n\nOur Noble Messenger, (Peace be upon him), said: \u201cThe believer is the one from whom people secure their money\u201d and he said: \u201cAnd he does not believe.\u201d And he does not believe, and he does not believe.\u201d\n\nThey said, \u201cWho, O Messenger of God?\u201d The Prophet, (Peace and blessings be upon him), said: \u201cHe whose neighbour is not safe from his misdeeds.\u201d He also, said: \u201cA Muslim is one from whose tongue and hands the Muslims are safe.\u201d\n\n\n\nJustice and fairness are required to be carried out on all the citizens of the nation in order that the nation will achieve peace, security and stability. Justice in speech, action, and in distribution of the nation\u2019s wealth. There should be justice in giving employment opportunities, justice in healthcare, education and social care.\n\n\n\nAlso, the law must be applied decisively to the young and the old without any hesitation or favoritism, and here our Prophet, (Peace be upon him), warned us, saying: \u201cYou only perish those who were before you that if the honorable stole from them, he becomes free, but if the humble stole among them, they cut off his hands.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of the means of achieving security in the Islamic and human society, in general, is laying the foundations for feeling the pulse of the people and showing compassion on all members of the society.\n\n\n\nDear Muslims, know that Islam, with its tight legislation, enacts rulings and legislation on freedom and security. The taxpayer knows his duties, and indicates his rights, whether that is between the shepherd and the subjects, the husband and his wife, the father and his children, or the neighbour and his neighbors, or the teacher and his students, then he deals with others on the basis of piety and fairness.\n\nThe believer is the one who is safe from people, and the Muslim is the one who delivers Muslims from his tongue and hands, so the Muslim community lives in social and moral security that is unparalleled, indicating that Islam has achieved security and stability for non-Muslims.\n\n\n\nThose who lived under the control and guardianship of Abu Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah withdrew from Homs after he imposed a tax on them.\n\n\n\nThe Christians cried and said: O Muslims, you are dearer to us than the Romans, and if they are upon our religion, you are more loyal to us, be kind to us, desist from oppressing us, and have the best authority over us.\n\nThe laws of Islam prescribes safety to plants and animals, forbidding the destruction of plants without justifiable reason, and forbidding the harm and killing of animals without apparent need, and from that, the over-hunting of birds and other animals, which negatively affects the environment, then this has great impact on the human society.\n\nThe Sharia, in its general rule, forbids all harm, whether on humans, plants or animals. On the authority of Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them both, he said: The Messenger of God said:\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no harm or harm\u201d and nothing is excluded from that except for a justifiable reason and a true intention. On the authority of Abdullah bin Amr, may God be pleased with him, on the authority of the Prophet, he said: \u201cThere is no human being who kills a bird or anything above it without its right but God Almighty will ask him about it on the Day of Resurrection.\u201d It was said: \u201cO Messenger of God, what is her right?\n\nHe said: \u201cHis right is that he slaughter it and eat it, and not cut off its head and throw it with it.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe noted that there is no life for this Ummah, and there is no salvation for it in its later ages, except by adhering to the causes of justice and mercy.\n\nPart two\n\nPraise be to God, Lord of the worlds, who says in His Glorious book: \u201cRead in the name of your Lord who createth. He created man from a clot of blood. \u201cRecite, and your Lord is the most Generous. He who taught the knowledge of the word.\n\nFaithful servants of God, in the past two weeks, we have talked about literacy as the United Nations celebrates International Literacy Day today and we want to shed light on this important matter, as pointed out by some scholars.\n\nLiteracy is the first step to advancement:\n\nEradication of illiteracy among humanity is the first step towards progressing towards civilization and advancement; A people whose members are completely illiterate is a people without a mission in existence!\n\n\n\nA people that cannot reach what other people reached, especially if this people is affiliated with Islam. As the Almighty said: \u201cThus We have made you a middle nation that you may be witnesses over people and that the Messenger may be a witness over you.\u201d [Al-Baqarah: 3]\n\n\n\nAnd God Almighty has given us this task, and we cannot be witnesses to people who have mastered arts and teach manners, yet we fold our arms in utter bewilderment without doing anything to redeem the situation. May God Almighty guide us to do what He loves and be pleased with us.\n\n\n\n\u201cOh Allah!, save us from every calamity, secure our lives and properties; show mercy on Nigeria and adorn us with your bounty of blessings, sustenance and prosperity as well as other Muslim countries. Oh Allah, guide our leaders right, our President Muhammad Bukhari, his deputy and all his ministers, and let them lead us in accordance with what you love and are satisfied with. Make us to attain righteousness and prepare for us good ending in life. Amin.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Yakubu Pam, have solicited the prayers and support of heads of denominations to ensure a peaceful and violent free exercise.\n\nHe urged the religious leaders to talk to youths, women, and other citizens to conduct themselves in a \u201ccivil and peaceful manner\u201d before, during, and after the elections.\n\nPam made the appeal during a peace advocacy visit to the Anglican Bishop of Jos, Rev. Benjamin Kwashi; President of Church of Christ in Nations (COCIN), Rev. Dachollom Datiri; ECWA President, Rev. Stephen Baba Panya; Catholic Bishop of Jos Archdiocese, Archbishop Mathew Ishaya Audu; and PFN Chairman, Rev. Stephen Dangana, all in Jos, the state capital.\n\nHe acknowledged the critical role of religious leaders in calming nerves during the recent violent attacks that claimed several lives in the state, saying \u201cPlateau do not need to go into another round of crisis again\u201d.\n\nThe NCPC Executive Secretary decried that a lot of blood has been shed across Plateau communities and called on the church leaders to pray and work assiduously towards a peaceful and violent free local government election.\n\nHe reminded Plateau citizens to know that elections will certainly come and go but the state will remain home to all.\n\nHe urged residents to come out and vote peacefully for candidates of their choice devoid of violence.\n\nPam maintained that \u201cThe security of Plateau is very crucial to Nigeria and what we need at this time is peace. Some people are already afraid of violence ahead of the election but we should talk to our youths to conduct themselves in a peaceful and orderly manner.\n\n\u201cWe want religious leaders to also be mindful of the messages they preach at this moment, we should preach peace, unity before, during and after the Local Government election so that Jos can regain its peaceful nature fully.\u201d\n\nPam noted the contribution of the church in terms of spiritual, economic, health, political and educational development of Plateau State and Nigeria and encouraged them to continue in that direction for the prosperity of the people.\n\nIn his remarks, the President of COCIN, Rev. Datiri said Nigeria has not yet diagnosed the problem confronting the nation and noted that the challenges are beyond, banditry, Fulani herdsmen, kidnapping.\n\n\u201cThis is a challenging time, people are being challenged spiritually and physically, that was why we came up with a prayer unit because we are concerned about peace and security.\n\n\u201cPeace is paramount and we will continue to work for peace. For me, the problem is beyond what we described, because we described it as unknown gunmen, Fulani herdsmen, bandits, kidnappers and I believe that the sooner that Nigeria addresses this, the better for us.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, President Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA), Rev. Stephen Baba Panya assured that they will continue to work with the government and all peace-seeking organizations to pursue peace in line with Biblical teaching.\n\nHe said that the church will continue to give the state full backing and support to ensure peace and unity in the state.\n\nAlso, the Catholic Bishop of Jos Archdiocese, Mathew Ishaya Audu said there is a need for government to be serious on addressing issues of violence in the state and said the Chuch will never fight but it is the politicians.\n\nAudu said, Plateau has suffered a lot of bloodbath to a point that any little issue causes division among the people which make them look as if they sitting on a time bomb.\n\nHe maintained that without politics, things will not work well but bad politics is bad and should be rejected.\n\n\u201cPolitical parties should always present people who are credible but when candidates with shortcoming before men are presented, people will not be happy, but I assure you that there is nothing that God cannot do, God can turn people to be good\u201d, he admonished.",

Abubakar Haruna, Garkuwan Kabi (MD/CEO Kaduna Electric).\n\nA Lecture will also be delivered from 10.30am to 12.00noon at Emir\u2019s Palace, to be followed by the Special Prayer & Wedding Nikkah after Jummu\u2018ah Prayer at the Muhammad Mera Central Mosque.\n\nA book detailing the rich cultural heritage and history of one of the oldest Emirate in Nigeria Argungu was also presented to Senator Orji Uzo Kalu.\n\nIt was also announced at the gathering which had the presence of journalists at the National Assembly that President of the Senate, Senator Ahmed Lawan will also be Honoured alongside Orji Kalu with a traditional title.\n\nIn his remarks, Senator Kalu appreciated the Argungu emirate in considering him worthy of receiving the traditional title.\n\nKalu described the gesture as a laudable testament that Nigeria will continue to exist as one indivisible entity. He thanked His Royal Highness, Alhaji Samaila Muhammadu Mera for the honour conferred on him and congratulated the emir on the upcoming wedding fathiha of his daughter, Habiba.\n\nHe further informed that the traditional conferment will be second traditional title in Kebbi saying that the first one was bestowed on him by the Gwandu emirate council in 2004 in Gwandu area of the state.\n\nKalu stressed that the unity of Nigeria was being strengthened and hence politicians must focus on sustaining it.\n\n\u201cI would like to use this opportunity to call on politicians to focus on the unity of the country, focus on the problem of banditry, focus on the problem of the people rather than focusing on the election coming on in the two year\u2019s time.\n\n\u201cPeople of Nigeria should focus on the unity of Nigeria today because the unity of the country is more important to us today than any other thing we are going to do.\n\n\u201cIf we are overrun by bandits, we will not be able to run for election.\n\n\u201cThose who are sabotaging the government should stop henceforth, so that we will live in a very conducive environment.\u201d\n\nHe urged Nigerians to support the governments at all levels and the security agencies in the fight against insecurity.\n\n\u201cThe government alone can not do this fight,it is for everybody to fight and win, and so we must report back to our security agencies, where we find any challenge,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former Governor also used the opportunity to engage journalists to address national issues most especially the spate of violence and attacks in the Southeast region.\n\nAs a means of addressing the challenges Senator Kalu advised President Buhari to conciliate \u2018Ndigbo\u2019\n\nThe Senate Chief Whip,described the resurgence of attacks and insecurity in the Southeast as unfortunate, saying the impasse was not beyond a discussion that could restore peace and tranquility in the region.\n\nHe said, the situation cannot be solved politically, but through pacification of the people of the Southeast, adding that a committee should be set up to interact with the aggrieved.\n\nKalu asserted that President Buhari as a father of the nation should look into the grievances of the people of the Southeast with passion.\n\nHe said : \u201cMy position has always been that Buhari is the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and he is a father. As a father, the President should look passionately towards that Southeast.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing special about people not being listened to. Buhari is the president of Nigeria. The problem can be solved not by political means and the South East governors should do more than they require. I was a governor and not just a senator. Governors should interact more with the people, as it\u2019s not just the work of the President.\n\nKalu said governors should not abdicate from doing all they could to ensure peace, but should show commitment, instead leaving security issues to President Buhari.\n\nAccording to him, it was normal that good and bad children exist anywhere, but depending on how they were handled, the nation needed unity more than anything else now.\n\n\u201cOur governors should do more, the President being the father of the nation. They might have some good children, some bad children. In the kingdom of a.King, you may have all kinds of people, so I want the President to look passionately into that area.\n\n\u201cLet him look back as a father of the nation and see how he can set up a small Committee and pacify the area, because this country needs unity more than anything that we needed.\n\n\u201cWithout unity, those who are planning to run for House of Assembly election, Senatorial election and Presidential election are going nowhere. So it\u2019s a thing that the president as a father and the people of the Southeast should sort themselves out.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

The party\u2019s spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, disclosed this while addressing newsmen on the outcome of the NEC held in Abuja.\n\nOlogbondiyan said the NEC considered and adopted Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi-led Zoning Committee\u2019s report, ahead of the party\u2019s national convention, scheduled for October 30. The committee had recommended that the current elective National Working Committee (NWC) positions in the party should be swapped between the north and the south. Ologbondiyan, however, clarified that what was approved was not about the executive and legislative positions in the 2023 general elections, but the elective NWC positions for the forthcoming convention.\n\nAsked if the date for the national convention was still sacrosanct, Ologbondiyan said there was no contrary decision regarding the date of the convention during the meeting.\n\n\u201cSo far, nothing has been said to alter the date of the convention, which is Oct. 30, \u201d Ologbondiyan said.\n\nOn when the aspirants would start obtaining forms, Ologbondiyan said what was adopted was the recommendation of zoning between the north and the south.

It was based on such ridiculous lies that they approached the court to get the purported interim order. After the interim order based on such frivolous story, the said governor and his errand boys went ahead to get the court ruling against Prince Secondus.\n\n\u201cFor being so treated and victimized without any justification whatsoever after almost four years of selfless service to the party, Prince Secondus is left with no option but to fight for his fundamental rights by approaching the court to seek redress and correct the blackmail and concoctions.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "Buhari considers fresh tax laws, presents N16.39trn 2022 budget",
          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, revealed plans to review existing tax laws in the country.\n\nHe stated this when he presented a N16.39 trillion budget proposal for the 2022 fiscal year to a joint session of the National Assembly.\n\nDuring the presentation of the Appropriations Bill 2022 at a joint session attended by members of both chambers of the National Assembly, Buhari said the country\u2019s debt profile was rising because the Federal Government had to spend its way out of recession.\n\nThe president disclosed that efforts were being made by his administration to partly support the realisation of fiscal projections by reviewing the current tax and fiscal laws to produce a draft Finance Bill 2022.\n\n\u201cIt is our intention that once ongoing consultations are completed, the Finance Bill would be submitted to the National Assembly to be considered alongside the 2022 Appropriation Bill,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari, who tagged the Appropriations Bill 2022 \u201cBudget of economic growth and sustainability,\u201d said allocations to MDAs were guided by the strategic objectives of the National Development Plan of 2021-2025.\n\nHe said the plan included diversifying the economy with robust MSME growth, investing in critical infrastructure, strengthening security and ensuring good governance, enabling a vibrant, educated and healthy populace, reducing poverty and minimising regional, economic and social disparities.\n\nHe said defence and internal security would continue to be top priority for his administration.\n\n\u201cWe remain firmly committed to the security of life, property and investment nationwide. We will continue to ensure that our gallant men and women in the armed forces, police and paramilitary units are properly equipped, remunerated and well-motivated,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nHe explained that the parameters and fiscal assumptions of the 2022 Appropriations Bill were based on the 2022-2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper.\n\nHe said oil price benchmark was pegged at $57 per barrel, oil production estimate at 1.88 million barrels (inclusive of Condensates of 300,000 to 400,000 barrels per day), exchange rate at N410.15 per US Dollar and projected GDP growth rate at 4.2 per cent and 13 per cent inflation rate.\n\nBased on these fiscal assumptions and parameters, total federally-collectible revenue was estimated at N17.70 trillion in 2022, he said.\n\nThe president said while total federally distributable revenue was estimated at N12.72 trillion, total revenue available to fund the 2022 federal budget was estimated at N10.13 trillion, an amount which includes grants and aid of N63.38 billion, as well as the revenues of 63 government-owned enterprises.\n\nHe said oil revenue was projected at 3.16 trillion, non-oil taxes estimated at N2.13 trillion and federal government independent revenues projected at N1.82 trillion.\n\nHe said out of the total expenditure of N16.39 trillion proposed for the Federal Government in 2022, N768.28 is for statutory transfers of N768.28 billion; N6.83 trillion is for non-debt recurrent costs and N4.11 trillion for personnel costs.\n\nOthers are N577.0 billion for pensions, gratuities and retirees\u2019 benefits; N792.39 for overheads; N5.35 trillion for capital expenditure, including capital component of statutory transfers; N3.61 trillion for debt service, and N292.71 billion for sinking fund to retire certain maturing bonds.\n\nHe, however, emphasised that the expected total fiscal operations of the Federal Government would result in a deficit of N6.26 trillion, an amount representing 3.39 per cent of estimated GDP, which, according to him, was slightly above the three per cent threshold set by the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007.\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, we have witnessed two economic recessions within the period of this administration. In both cases, we had to spend our way out of recession, which necessitated a resort to growing the public debt. It is unlikely that our recovery from each of the two recessions would have grown as fast without the sustained government expenditure funded by debt.\u201d\n\nBuhari said Nigeria does not have a debt sustainability problem, but that of generating revenue.\n\nSince Buhari assumed power in 2015, Nigeria\u2019s economy has slipped into recession twice.\n\nThe Debt Management Office (DMO) said Nigeria\u2019s total public debt (federal and state governments) climbed to N35.46 trillion at the end of the second quarter of 2021.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Tony John, Port Harcourt\n\nRivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has urged the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) to reduce revenue accruable to the Federal Government from the federation account to 40 percent and increase those of states and local government councils to 40 and 20 percent respectively.\n\nHe spoke through his deputy, Mrs. Ipalibo Banigo, at the public hearing on review of revenue allocation formula for South-South zone, organised by RMAFC, held in Port Harcourt, yesterday.\n\nWike said the current revenue sharing formula that allows the Federal Government to take 52.68 percent, while states and local government councils take 26.72 percent and 20.60 percent respectively was unacceptable.\n\nThe governor had earlier made the assertion when members of the commission led by its chairman, Elisa N. Mbam, visited him at the Government House.\n\nHe observed that despite the changes that the country had been through in the past 29 years, it was regrettable that it has continued to use the 1992 revenue formular prescribed by the military.\n\nGovernor Wike faulted the use of 1992 population figure, public school enrolment and public hospital bed spaces and land mass as formular for allocation of revenue.\n\nHe argued that a more equitable formula should also take into cognisance current population figure as well as enrolment in private schools and number of bed spaces in private hospitals.\n\n\u201cUsing the same formular of 1992 as a basis for revenue allocation in this country is so unfortunate. And to worsen the situation under a democratic dispensation, since 1999 till now, our country has not reviewed the revenue allocation formula.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike urged the commission to reduce the revenue accruable to the federal government to 40 percent because the it has abdicated its responsibility of providing security and basic infrastructure to the federating states.\n\n\u201cYou people should reduce the percentage of the federal government. Give them 40 percent. Give the states 40 percent, give Local Government 20 percent. In that way, most of the responsibilities that belong to the federal government will now be taken away and given to the States.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the current centralised federal system in operation in Nigeria has made it impossible for most states to look inwards and harness their potentials.\n\nAccording to him, the country\u2019s vast resources, will continue to amount to nothing if the states are not allowed to use their resources to drive and determine their development.\n\n\u201cWe cannot talk about operating a federal system without having a fiscal federalism. It is practically impossible. Let\u2019s cancel that word federalism; we are operating a unitary system. But, you cannot be saying we are operating a federal system, at the same time operating a centralised system.\u201d\n\nThe governor expressed reservation about the willingness of the present federal government to implement the recommendations of the revenue mobilisation and fiscal commission, which is currently holding public hearing on new revenue sharing formular across the six geopolitical zones.\n\nEarlier, RMAFC chairman, Mbam, explained that one of the major mandates of the commission is to review from time to time the revenue allocation formula to conform with changing realities.\n\nMbam explained that it had become necessary to review the current formula because the last review was done in 1992.\n\nHe observed that there has been a lot of changes in the political and socio-economic situation of the country.\n\nAccording to him, the data that would be collated from the states will help the commission to arrive at a fair revenue formula.\n\n\u201cWe believe that what we will get from states will help us to come up with a revenue formula that will be fair, just and equitable.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "*Presents N16.39trn appropriation bill to N\u2019Assembly\n\n*Says defence remains priority\n\n*To finance deficit with fresh N5.01trn borrowings\n\n*Lawan flays high level of budget shortfall\n\n*Gbajabiamila assures of quick consideration of appropriation bill\n\n*APC: Proposed spending will accelerate economic diversification\n\n*PDP: More pain, suffering for Nigerians\n\n*Fiscal plan has high-sounding figures clothed with borrowings, says CUPP\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nFor the first time since the inception of his government in 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday acknowledged how much petroleum subsidy had eroded national revenues, making it impossible for the country to adequately fund its annual budget, despite significant appreciation in crude oil prices.\n\nBuhari made the revelations in Abuja while presenting a N16.39 trillion Appropriation Bill for the 2022 fiscal year to a joint session of the National Assembly.\n\nBut Chairman of the National Assembly and President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, flayed the rising level of budget deficit.\n\nNevertheless, there was hope of an early passage of the 2022 budget proposal, as Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, assured the president of quick consideration of the estimates by the National Assembly.\n\nSimilarly, the ruling party All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday said the proposed 2022 budget was designed to accelerate government\u2019s on-going efforts to diversify the economy.\n\nBut the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) described the proposed budget as another budget of sorrow and pain to Nigerians.\n\nCoalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) slammed the budget presented by the president, saying though his last full year budget, it does not have items that can at least see him leave office with some element of pride.\n\nThe 2022 Appropriation Bill was tagged \u201cBudget of Economic Growth and Sustainability.\u201d\n\nBuhari recalled that in March 2020, the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) had announced that market forces would henceforth determine the price of petrol.\n\nHe stated, \u201cHowever, as the combination of rising crude oil prices and exchange rate combined to push the price above the hitherto regulated price of N145 per litre, opposition against the policy of price deregulation hardened on the part of labour unions in particular.\n\n\u201cGovernment had to suspend further upward price adjustments while engaging labour on the subject. This petrol subsidy significantly eroded revenues that should have been available to fund the budget.\u201d\n\nBuhari said allocations to Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) in the budget were guided by the strategic objectives of the National Development Plan of 2021-2025. He said the plan prioritised diversification of the economy with robust Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) growth; investing in critical infrastructure; strengthening security and ensuring good governance; enabling a vibrant, educated and healthy populace; reducing poverty; and minimising regional, economic and social disparities.\n\nThe president stressed that the security sector would still take a chunk of the 2022 budget, saying, \u201cDefence and internal security will continue to be our top priority.\n\n\u201cWe remain firmly committed to the security of life, property and investment nationwide. We will continue to ensure that our gallant men and women in the armed forces, police and paramilitary units are properly equipped, remunerated and well-motivated.\u201d\n\nThe president commended the National Assembly for the expeditious consideration and passage of the supplementary appropriation bill 2021. He said that underscored the federal legislature\u2019s commitment to collective efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and address the various security challenges facing the country.\n\nHe also commended the National Assembly for the quick consideration and approval of the 2022-2024 Medium-term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper.\n\nThe president said, \u201cOur hope is that the National Assembly will continue to partner with the executive by ensuring that deliberations on the 2022 Budget are completed before the end of this year so that the Appropriation Act can come into effect by the first of January 2022.\u201d\n\nBuhari said over the past few days, consultation was made with the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 and the leadership of the National Assembly on how best to present the 2022 budget proposal, keeping in mind the deep-rooted tradition in place and the guidelines for safe mass gatherings.\n\nHe said it was decided that the most responsible and respectful approach was to hold a shorter than gathering while allowing the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning to provide fuller details of the proposals at a smaller event.\n\nAccording to him, the 2022 to 2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper (MTEF/FSP) set the parameters for the 2022 Budget.\n\nHe noted that oil price benchmark was pegged at $57 per barrel; with daily oil production estimate of 1.88 million barrels (inclusive of Condensates of 300,000 to 400,000 barrels\u201d per day projected.\n\nBuhari said the exchange rate was pegged at N410.15 per dollar; and projected Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate of 4.2 per cent and 13 per cent inflation rate. He added that based on these fiscal assumptions and parameters, total federally collectible revenue was estimated at N17.70 trillion in 2022.\n\nThe president pointed out that total federally distributable revenue was estimated at N12.72 trillion in 2022, while total revenue available to fund the 2022 budget was estimated at N10.13 trillion. This includes grants and aid of N63.38 billion, as well as the revenues of 63 government-owned enterprises.\n\nBuhari noted that oil revenue was projected at N3.16 trillion; non-oil taxes estimated at N2.13 trillion and FGN independent revenues were projected to be N1.82 trillion.\n\nThe president explained that a total expenditure of N16.39 trillion was proposed for the federal government for 2022.\n\nHe said the proposed expenditure comprised: Statutory Transfers of N768.28 billion, Non-debt Recurrent Costs of N6.83 trillion; Personnel Costs of N4.11 trillion; Pensions, Gratuities and Retirees\u2019 Benefits N577.0 billion; Overheads of N792.39 billion; Capital Expenditure of N5.35 trillion, including the capital component of Statutory Transfers; Debt Service of N3.61 trillion and Sinking Fund of N292.71 billion to retire certain maturing bonds.\n\nBuhari stated, \u201cWe expect the total fiscal operations of the federal government to result in a deficit of N6.26 trillion. This represents 3.39 per cent of estimated GDP, slightly above the three per cent threshold set by the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007. Countries around the world have to of necessity over-shoot their fiscal thresholds for the economies to survive and thrive\n\n\u201cWe need to exceed this threshold considering our collective desire to continue tackling the existential security challenges facing our country.\u201d\n\nBuhari said the federal government planned to finance the deficit mainly by new borrowings totalling N5.01 trillion, N90.73 billion from privatisation proceeds and N1.16 trillion drawdowns on loans secured for specific development projects.\n\nThe president stated, \u201cSome have expressed concern over our resort to borrowing to finance our fiscal gaps. They are right to be concerned. However, we believe that the debt level of the federal government is still within sustainable limits. Borrowings are to specific strategic projects and can be verified publicly.\u201d\n\nBuhari explained that the country had witnessed two economic recessions within the period of his administration, stressing that in both cases, the country had to spend its way out of recession, which necessitated a resort to growing the public debt.\n\n\u201cIt is unlikely that our recovery from each of the two recessions would have grown as fast without the sustained government expenditure funded by debt,\u201d he said.\n\nOn parameters and fiscal assumptions, the president said the target over the medium term was to grow the country\u2019s revenue-to-GDP ratio from about eight per cent currently to 15 per cent by 2025. He said at that level of revenue, the debt service-to-revenue ratio would cease to be worrying.\n\n\u201cPut simply, we do not have a debt sustainability problem, but a revenue challenge which we are determined to tackle to ensure our debts remain sustainable,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nThe president noted that his government had used loans to finance critical development projects and programmes aimed at improving the economic environment and ensuring effective delivery of public services to the people.\n\nHe said his government focused on: the completion of major road and rail projects; the effective implementation of power sector projects; the provision of potable water; construction of irrigation infrastructure and dams across the country; and critical health projects such as the strengthening of national emergency medical services and ambulance system, procurement of vaccines, polio eradication and upgrading Primary Health Care Centres across the six geopolitical zones.\n\nBuhari said his government in 2022 would further strengthen the frameworks for concessions and public private partnerships (PPPs), adding that capital projects that are good for PPP by their nature would be developed for private sector participation.\n\nOn the performance of the 2021 budget, Buhari said in the 2021 Fiscal Framework, a total revenue of N8.12 trillion was projected to fund aggregate federal expenditure of N14.57 trillion (inclusive of the supplementary budget), while actual revenues were 34 per cent below target as of July 2021, mainly due to the underperformance of oil and gas revenue sources.\n\nBuhari pointed out that the federal government\u2019s retained revenues (excluding Government Owned Enterprises) amounted to N2.61 trillion against the proportional target of N3.95 trillion for the period.\n\nEarlier in his welcome address, Lawan said the 2020 and 2021 budget provided for significant infrastructure development across the country. He added that it was imperative that the government prioritises the completion of on-going projects on the development of infrastructure, adding that the 2022 budget should be targeted at completion and consolidation of the projects embarked upon.\n\nLawan lamented that generating and collecting revenues had remained major challenges in the country\u2019s quest for development. He said for the deficit in the country\u2019s budget to be drastically reduced, concerted effort must be made by the executive and legislature to explore alternative sources of funding to reduce borrowing.\n\nThe senate president explained that such sources of funding could come by way of Public-Private Partnerships on infrastructure projects, as well as compulsory remittances of generated revenues by MDAs.\n\nLawan stressed that equally important was the recent position taken by the legislature and the executive to insist on zero allocation for MDAs that failed to remit/upload their revenues for the 2022 Appropriation.\n\nHe said he saw an increase in the contribution of the MDAs by over N400 billion, saying he believed that MDAs could contribute to the federation account much more than that.\n\nLawan added, \u201cMr President, the need to enhance revenue generation and collection cannot be overemphasised. The level of budget deficit is high, and both the legislature and the executive should work to reduce this deficit through the availability of more revenues.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the security of life and property of Nigerians was still a challenge. She assured that the National Assembly was ever willing to work with the executive arm for better security for the citizens.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe recent changes in the leadership of the armed forces is a clear testimony of the collaboration between the legislature and the executive to overhaul the security architecture for better outcomes in our fight against the myriads of security challenges.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila assured that the National Assembly would give the 2022 Appropriation Bill prompt consideration. He warned heads of ministries, departments and agencies that the determination of the National Assembly to deliver a timely budget would not derogate from its responsibility to ensure exhaustive consideration of the bill.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe will demand a thorough accounting for the funds previously appropriated, disbursed and expended. And we will take steps to hold to account those who fail to provide the records we need to make informed decisions on the Appropriation Bill. This is the responsibility of the National Assembly, and we will live up to it.\u201d\n\nAPC: 2022 Budget Proposal Will Accelerate Economic Diversification\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday said the proposed 2022 budget was designed to accelerate government\u2019s on-going efforts to diversify the economy.\n\nNational Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the party, Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe, in a statement, expressed confidence that the ninth National Assembly would sustain the patriotic disposition by speedily considering and passing the 2022 Appropriation Bill into law to meet the January-December budget cycle achieved by the Buhari-led administration.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe proposed budget is designed to accelerate government\u2019s on-going efforts to diversify the economy through more support for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs); continued investment in vital infrastructure; strengthening security; enabling a vibrant, educated and healthy populace; reducing poverty through targeted social investments and ultimately ensuring good governance.\u201d\n\nThe ruling party called on Nigerians to keep track of the progress being made by this administration in delivering services and countless dividends of democracy all over the country.\n\nPDP: Another Budget of Pain, Suffering for Nigerians\n\nIn its assessment of the 2022 Appropriation Bill, PDP described its contents as another budget of sorrow and pain to Nigerians.\n\nIn a brief reaction on the budget presentation, the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the budget would cause more pains to Nigerians because it would be financed from loans, thereby inflicting the people with more loans.\n\nThe PDP urged the National Assembly to refocus the budget by making it a people-oriented fiscal plan.\n\nCUPP Says Proposed Budget Empty\n\nCUPP criticised the content of the budget presented by the president. In a statement, the spokesperson of CUPP, Ikenga Ugochinyere, said the only highlight of the budget was that the government has allegedly admitted that it was overwhelmed by its failures and has no solution at hand.\n\nAccording to the CUPP spokesman, \u201cThe only thing the budget is clothed with is new loans and borrowings and nothing more. It does not inspire any hope in Nigerians rather it sinks the country further into economic woes.\n\n\u201cRecurrent expenditure and capital expenses, like purchase of cars, computers and accessories, and other unnecessary and white elephant projects, are all the budget contains because the ruling party will use the budget to fund their 2023 election campaigns.\n\n\u201cAt N16.39 trillion, the budget contains debt service of N3.61 trillion, non-debt recurrent costs of N6.83 trillion while there is only capital expenditure of N5.35 trillion. New borrowing in the budget is totalling N5.01 trillion with an extra N1.16 trillion drawdowns on loans secured for specific projects. This is the highlight of the uninspiring speech of the president as it cannot add any productive value to the economy.\u201d\n\nCUPP said a close look at the budget speech would show Nigerians that Buhari had been perpetually funding the same set of projects without ever completing them. \u201cAfter borrowing over N33 trillion, Buhari is still declaring to Nigerians that he is borrowing to fund Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Abuja-Kano Expressway, East-West Road, 2nd Niger Bridge etc. Nigerians should, please, ask President Buhari when will these projects which have been in the budgets since 2016 ever be completed?\n\n\u201cNigerians are hereby called upon to bear yet again another year of suffering but have hope that when the opposition takes over, Nigeria will get back on its feet.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Signalling a southern presidency\n\n*Defers attempt to present Bala report\n\n*Let the people decide, says Atiku\n\n*Northern members disagree over micro-zoning\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe 94th National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, rose in support of the governors of the party, and unanimously adopted the report of the National Convention Zoning Committee (NCZC), chaired by the Enugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, which last week, zoned the national chairmanship of the party to the north.\n\nBy implications and standard practice in the PDP, the development might have further brightened the possibility of a southern presidential candidate, being the fallout of other zoning options that could be open to the party as it journeys to the 2023 elections.\n\nThe meeting also pulled a smart one, when it declined to consider a report by the Governor Bala Mohammed committee, which recommended throwing the presidential ticket open, but deferred the decision to yet another NEC meeting at a later date.\n\nThese, nonetheless, former Vice President and presidential candidate of the PDP in the 2019 general election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has lent support to the idea of open presidential ticket, insisting that the people should be allowed to decide who their presidential choice would be.\n\nThis is as the meeting of the Northern PDP stakeholders and their elected governors, last night, failed to reach an agreement on the micro-zoning of the office of the national chairman, because everyone wanted to take their chances at the opportunity.\n\nIn a related development, the suspended national chairman of PDP, Uche Secondus, said he was in court to stop an alleged blackmail, planned hijack, and plot to destroy PDP. His case is currently at the Court of Appeal.\n\nBriefing newsmen after the NEC meeting, National Publicity Secretary of the party, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the report of the Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi committee was unanimously adopted.\n\nOlogbondiyan maintained that the zoning committee was given the mandate to zone national offices to be contested by all PDP members at the party\u2019s National Convention scheduled for October 30 and 31.\n\nThough the decision was unanimous, it was gathered that Senator Abdul Ningi from Bauchi State and Shuiabu Oyedokun from Osun State spoke briefly against the zoning of the party\u2019s leadership offices.\n\nBut Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde was said to have quickly countered Oyedokun, stating that anyone from the South-west, who spoke against the zoning arrangement was speaking for himself.\n\nAnother NEC member told THISDAY that most of the party\u2019s stakeholders from the North could not present any strong opposition to the zoning, because some of them had started seeing themselves as national chairmanship candidates.\n\nThe NEC meeting mandated the stakeholders to meet at the zonal level and share the offices allocated to them and thereafter inform the party of the decisions reached.\n\nBut on the zoning of the presidential ticket, Ologbondiyan said the report was referred to another NEC meeting, where it would be decided.\n\nAnother source at the meeting said although the northern PDP members wanted to initiate a discussion around the Bala Mohammed committee report, knowing full well it would lead to discussing the presidential ticket, the meeting immediately shut it down and insisted it should be moved to the next NEC.\n\nThe NEC meeting had a large attendance.\n\nMeanwhile, Secondus, in a statement by his media aide, Ike Abonye, claimed his legal effort was to stop the hijack of the party. He alleged that he had been the subject of blackmail since the onset of the plan to hijack the soul of PDP by one of the governors.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cFirst was the baseless lies that Prince Secondus as National Chairman was not meeting up with his obligations at his ward level in Rivers State. It was based on such ridiculous lies that they approached the court to get the purported interim order. After the interim order based on such frivolous story, the said governor and his errand boys went ahead to get the court ruling against Prince Secondus.\n\n\u201cFor being so treated and victimised without any justification whatsoever after almost four years of selfless service to the party, Prince Secondus is left with no option but to fight for his fundamental rights by approaching the court to seek redress and correct the blackmail and concoctions.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the frivolous nature of the allegations, Secondus on his own as a strong believer in the rule of law decided to respect the court by staying away while seeking the necessary right that should correct the judicial ambush against him and the party.\n\n\u201cWhile awaiting the outcome of the case presently at the Court of Appeal, the blackmail has continued unabated with fabrications and all kinds of laughable lies to the fact that Prince Secondus is romancing with the opposition.\u201d\n\nThe statement said Secondus had maintained a clean record in the party from his days as State Chairman, National Organising Secretary, Deputy National Chairman, to National Chairman in December 2017.\n\nSpeaking earlier at the 94th NEC meeting, Atiku said fairness should decide the party\u2019s presidential candidate. He stated, \u201cThe Peoples Democratic Party has the right to determine its rules on how the party should be governed. The people of Nigeria also have the right to determine who governs them. Where the president comes from has never been the problem of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe spoke on how PDP had managed the question of zoning, saying, \u201cI can cite examples, neither will it be the solution. There is no such thing: he is a president from southern Nigeria, or a president from northern Nigeria. There is only one, a president from Nigeria, for Nigeria and by Nigerians.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Atiku said, \u201cTalking about inclusions, I would like to see a new National Working Committee of our great party that has sizable numbers of our youths and woman. The decision of NEC today will either see PDP into the villa in 2023 or not. Since inception, this party has faced serious challenges, and has risen above sentiments to solve those challenges and move forward.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president narrated, \u201cNow, let me come to historical events, which I said I was going to cite. Those of us who served in the constitutional conference, which drafted the current constitution of Nigeria, should remember that after we finished drafting the constitution, we all met as members of the constitutional conference and resolved to correct the injustice that was done to a particular part of this country.\n\n\u201cAnd we said, in whichever party you found yourself, your presidential candidate must come from the South-west, because Abiola had won election, it was annulled. Not only was he annulled he was killed.\n\n\u201cSo, we all agreed as members, and we went out of the constitutional conference and we formed our parties: those of us who formed PDP from PDP; those who formed AD from AD\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, two parties emerged. PDP picked General Obasanjo and AD picked Olu Falae. All of these showed you that Nigerians have a sense of fairness. Professor Jerry Gana, is that not what happened? More or less?\n\n\u201cDistinguished members of NEC, in 2003, all the PDP governors met at the villa and said they were not going to support President Obasanjo for a second term, that I should run. I now referred them to the resolution of NEC, where NEC decided that power should remain in the South-west for eight years. How do you now want me to go against the resolution of NEC? And I turned it down. And we moved on.\n\n\u201cSo, this country has a sense of fairness. This country has a sense of justice. This country has a sense of equity. Therefore, this thing that is inbuilt in our party, we should be able to use it, to imbibe it to make sure today\u2019s deliberations are in the best interest of our party, in the best interest of Nigeria, which will ultimately give us the victory that we asked for, to go back to the villa.\u201d\n\nMinority Leader of the House of Representatives, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, said the recent political reports and speculations on the PDP had generated widespread public debate regarding the direction of the party ahead of the national convention and the 2023 general election. He explained that such public interest in activities of the PDP strongly pointed to the huge confidence Nigerians reposed in the party.\n\nElumelu lamented the current security and economic challenges faced by the country under the All Progressives Party (APC).\n\nInterestingly, a meeting of the Northern PDP stakeholders, held last night, has thrown up another challenge over its national chairmanship, with many of their major players already showing interest in the office.\n\nThe meeting held at the Bauchi State governor\u2019s lodge, Abuja, saw the northern stakeholders reject the proposals by the governors of Bauchi State, Bala Mohammed; Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom and the Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, that the North Central zone should swap offices with those in the South-south zone.\n\nAfter the stakeholders had rejected the swapping of the offices between the North Central and South-south, the meeting decided that what position to micro-zone to which state should be among the 19 northern states.\n\n\u201cThere was a disagreement. They tried to zone it to the North Central, which was rejected by the committee. So, what they did was that the 19 states and the FCT nominated one person each into a committee.\n\n\u201cThe committee is to sit down with the governors to review individuals, who would show interest in positions zoned to the north so as to decide, who among them is the most suitable for the positions, so as to back the person,\u201d a source, who attended the meeting said.\n\nAs a result, the meeting gave all persons from the north till this morning (Friday) to decide and indicate to the group what post he or she sought to vie for.\n\nAlready, four persons have indicated interest in the job. While two were from the North East, the other two were from the North West.\n\nFrom North West were a former Governor of Kaduna State, who also served as PDP Caretaker National Chairman, Senator Ahmed Makarfi, and the former Governor of Katsina State, Ibrahim Shema, who was deputy national chairman of party.\n\nHowever, from the North East were the incumbent PDP Deputy National Chairman (North), Senator Suleiman Nazif and former Governor of Gombe State, Dr. Ibrahim Dankwambo. There is also talk of a a former President of the Senate, David Mark indicating interest in the top job of the party. But this is unconfirmed. Mark hails from North Central.\n\nIn another breath, a statement by the Chairman, Electoral Sub-Committee and Governor of Adamawa State, Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, has scheduled a meeting of all sub-committee members for this weekend.\n\n\u201cIn preparation for the 2021 National Convention of our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), all members of the Electoral Sub-Committee are invited to a meeting scheduled to hold as follows: Saturday the 9th of October, 2021. The venue is NEC Hall of the PDP National Secretariat, Wadata Plaza and the time is 11.AM prompt.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Proposed estimates uninspiring, says House Minority Caucus\n\n*Others endorse spending plan\n\nDeji Elumoye, Adedayo Akinwale and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThere were mixed reactions yesterday to the N16.39 trillion 2022 Appropriation Bill presented to the National Assembly by President Muhammadu Buhari. While some federal lawmakers, especially the House of Representatives Minority Caucus, described the budget estimates as drab and uninspiring, others, including senators and House of Representatives members, said the appropriation bill signified hope for the teeming populace.\n\nThe House Minority caucus, in a speech by its leader, Hon Ndudi Elumelu, at the 94th National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of PDP in Abuja, said the budget had no solution to the challenges facing the nation.\n\nElumelu said the president \u201cridiculously\u201d asked for debt forgiveness, on the one hand, and on the other, he was busy seeking more loans, thereby making a mockery of the country as an, \u201cunserious country led by a clueless government.\u201d\n\nHe assured that the caucus would do all in its powers to lobby for the redirection of the budget for the benefit of Nigerians.\n\nElumelu said, \u201cAs representatives of the people, our caucus took the president to task on his speech, in which he failed to present the ugly reality of the failures of his administration to the world body.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, innocent and defenseless Nigerians are being killed on daily basis by terrorists and bandits. Our citizens can no longer move freely across their country. Today, our economy is in shambles; there is anger, frustration and hopelessness everywhere.\n\n\u201cMost Nigerian families can no longer afford their daily meals and other basic necessities of life; they go to bed on empty stomach and wake up with no hope of breakfast or even lunch. Our productive sectors have been wrecked by the APC. Their only hope of survival is to have the PDP back in power.\u201d\n\nIn his reaction, Hon. Babatunde Ayeni said the main expectation was on security, saying the country is going nowhere without adequate funding of the security sector.\n\nAyeni stated, \u201cOn the budget of N16.39 trillion, our expectation is especially on security. This time around, everybody in Nigeria is talking of security and if you do not fund that aspect of the budget well, we are not going anywhere.\n\n\u201cThe police need more funds that even last year. I am the Deputy Chairman of Police Affairs (committee. If you say police must perform, automatically they must be funded.\u201d\n\nIn his reaction, Senator Ayo Akinyelure said he believed that the budget was aimed at fixing the country, saying the lawmakers have done their best to meet the January \u2013 December budget cycle.\n\nSenator Olamilekan Adeola described the fiscal plan as a budget of hope.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe hope it will take us out of misery, given critical attention to education and security. He (Buhari) has given assurance that the deficit will be financed by borrowing. He has said we have nothing to fear, the borrowed tied to specific verifiable projects. We are convinced it will take care of our needs.\u201d\n\nAdeola said he was not bothered about the debt profile, because the president had given an outline of how to finance the loans, adding that with time the direction of the budget will take would be unveiled.\n\nOn his part, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele said the budget estimate as laid yesterday showed consciousness on the part of the leadership that it was not yet Uhuru.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWe must spend our ways out of recession. Recurrent is taking more money, and giving the government a human face. But capital spending will help to develop our infrastructure.\n\n\u201cBy and large, what is important is implementation by ensuring that MDAs are able to implement diligently and we don\u2019t fail in our oversight to monitor the spending and for Nigerians at large, to monitor in their various constituencies.\n\n\u201cWe must all ensure that every naira borrowed is spent on capital projects that will percolate to the ordinary Nigerians and take us out of recession.\u201d\n\nAdding his voice, Senator Uba Sani said infrastructure development and education were key to the country\u2019s growth and development.\n\nAccording to him, the National Assembly needs to increase the level of oversight to ensure that key revenue generating agencies add value to the federation account\n\nSenator Ishaku Abbo said, \u201cThe 2022 budget is to stimulate economic recovery. By the passage of the PIB, we are confidence that Nigeria will now have more money.\n\n\u201cI believe the budget should be more. I know you will ask about the issue of borrowing. Nigeria is not the only country that borrows money.\u201d\n\nAbbo said he had no problem with borrowing to fund the budget in as much as money borrowed would not be used for payment of salaries, but for infrastructure development.\n\nIn his contribution, Senator Abdullahi Adamu said since the budget was the last budget the present administration would implement fully, the government would ensure that projects started were completed.\n\nAdamu said, \u201cEvery country is borrowing. England is owing over \u20ac3 trillion. So, we must borrow about N6 trillion to fund the budget. Every country is borrowing.\u201d\n\nOn her part, House Deputy Chief Whip, Hon. Nkiruka Onyejeocha, expressed excitement that the 2020 budget had gender issues incorporated in it.\n\nAccording to Onyejeocha, \u201cThe president said this is the first time that gender issues are being included in the budget. I\u2019m excited because what it simply means is that this president has decided to work the talk. We are going to look at the details and key in from there.\u201d\n\nOnyejeocha said the budget gave her hope that the president had been listening to women, saying all Nigerian women are excited about this budget.\n\nShe added, \u201cThis is about the second time that the budget is being released 100 per cent. I don\u2019t know if you know what that means. What it simply means is that we are not going to have abandoned projects because when you release 40 per cent, it means the work will be done 40 per cent, but when you release 100 per cent, it means a lot of projects will be concluded.\u201d\n\nOnyejeocha also highlighted the president\u2019s political will to fund the projects.\n\nShe added, \u201cPeople are saying it is loan, everybody takes loan. The most important thing is that when you take the loan, then you use it judiciously and as parliament, we are going to make sure that we track our money.\u201d\n\nHon. Ben Igbakpa said there was need for the lawmakers to assist the president through their oversight function in ensuring that the MDAs were monitored to ensure that there was no revenue leakage.\n\nIgbakpa said, \u201cA budget is a statement of intention, so we hope to get 100 per cent. We are going to ensure in our oversight function that every MDA does what they are ought to do and stay on the executive to ensure, especially those revenue generating agencies to ensure that they bring the funding because if there is no money, there is nothing anybody can do. We must ensure that the revenue comes in to ensure the implementation of the budget as envisaged by Nigerians. We are looking at 100 per cent.\u201d\n\nAdding his voice to the debate, Hon. Babajimi Benson stressed that no country could develop without infrastructure.\n\nBenson said, \u201cThey say that a nation that has infrastructure is a rich nation. Nigeria should do whatever it can to ensure that borrowed funds are used to fund infrastructure. I\u2019m happy today that Mr. President also said that the 2021 budget will be funded 100 per cent and that before the end of his administration all on-going infrastructure will be completed, that is good news for Nigerians. It is good news if we complete all the road projects, it is good news when we complete all the rail projects.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, it is for the betterment of our citizenry. We should all pray that Mr. President completes these projects as said. So once that is done it will be a new dawn of prosperity for us in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "James Emejo in Abuja\n\nAnalysts yesterday commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the timely transmission of the 2022 Appropriation Bill to the National Assembly.\n\nThey also expressed satisfaction over the benchmarks in the appropriation, describing them as realistic.\n\nIn separate interview with THISDAY, the analysts, however expressed hope that the legislature would reciprocate the president\u2019s gesture by concluding work on the budget before the end of the year to enable implementation to commence in January following the president\u2019s assent.\n\nBuhari, yesterday presented the N16.3 trillion 2022 Appropriation Bill to the Joint Session of the National Assembly.\n\nReacting to the development in a chat with THISDAY, Chairman, Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), Abuja Branch, Prof. Uche Uwaleke, said the mending of the hitherto broken budget cycle remained a major achievement by the current administration.\n\nHe said, \u201cI think the budget benchmarks are largely realistic with respect to crude oil price of $57, exchange rate of circa N410 and real GDP growth rate of 4.2 per cent.\n\n\u201cFirst, let me commend the President for presenting the 2022 appropriation bill in relatively good time.\n\nHe also called on the National Assembly to expedite action on the bill.\n\nHe said, \u201cIndeed, the mending of the hitherto broken budget year is a major achievement by this administration.\u201d\n\nUwaleke, however, pointed out that inflation projection of 13 per cent appeared unrealistic considering the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) requiring the complete removal of fuel subsidy.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs the president admitted, the concern about increasing deficit financing through borrowing is justified. \u201cThe consolation however is that all new borrowings are tied to critical projects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s equally noteworthy that the government has made provision for use of Green bonds as well as PPP arrangements in financing infrastructure.\u201d\n\nAlso reacting to the budget proposal, Managing Director/Chief Executive, Dignity Finance and Investment Limited, Dr. Chijioke Ekechukwu, said with enough fiscal discipline, the anticipated gains from the oil price differential could fund part of the budget deficit, thereby reducing the amount of money to be borrowed.\n\nHe said, \u201cFirst, I commend the president for sending the budget on time to the National Assembly so that the fiscal calendar could still be maintained.\n\n\u201cI am satisfied with the benchmarks of oil price of $57 per barrel and the output level of 1.88million barrel per day, exchange rate at $410.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately we will continue to operate at the whims and caprices of oil price volatility.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Managing Director/Chief Executive, SD&D Capital Management Limited, Mr. Idakolo Gbolade, pointed out that the, \u201cN16.3 trillion is going to throw Nigeria into more debt trap as a substantial part of it will be financed by additional borrowing.\u201d\n\nHe noted that this comes at a time when almost 100 per cent of the country\u2019s revenue was being used for debt servicing, adding that the price of crude oil though high at the moment, could still be affected, leading to lower returns from oil revenue.\n\nHe said,\u201dThe present agitations by some states for VAT revenue to be collected by states presently in the supreme court could lead to further dip in federal government revenue if the states win the case.\n\n\u201cThe government is also spending more on recurrent expenditure in 2022 and most of the capital expenditure might not yield returns in the 2022 fiscal year.\n\n\u201cI foresee a challenging year for the government\u2019s fiscal policies in 2022 and the government mostly likely might not implement more than 50 per cent of the budget due to various constraints ahead.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Seplat unveils new brand identity, incorporates renewables into operations\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday insisted that it would be unfair for richer nations to stampede developing countries like Nigeria into abandoning their resources for the current energy transition, urging its advocates to consider the peculiar circumstances of every nation.\n\nSpeaking at the Seplat Energy Summit 2021 with the theme \u201cGlobal Trends in Energy Transition and the Africa Perspective,\u201d the Minister of State, Petroleum, Chief Timipre Sylva, maintained that the continuous exploitation of the country\u2019s oil resources would be crucial in supplying world markets with a broad portfolio of energy options.\n\nDuring the hybrid event, Sylva noted that Nigeria requires fossil fuel as its base-load energy source.\n\nHe explained that while this was a major concern for climate activists in developed nations, the clamour to emphasise only renewable energy as the sole pathway to energy transition was a source of concern for African countries.\n\nSylva explained that Nigeria was still working to achieve industrialisation, address energy poverty and ensure reliable power supply, emphasising that the call to jettison fossil fuels all together may not be feasible for now.\n\n\u201cThis is why in Nigeria, we reject the concept of a single pathway to the energy transition. Indeed, we prefer the concept of \u2018just\u2019 energy transition which takes into cognisance the specific circumstances of each nation in developing the energy transition pathway that best achieves the environmental, social, political and economic objectives of the transition in that specific nation.\n\n\u201cMultiple pathways to the energy transition should and must exist in order to ensure that no country is left behind in the process of achieving net-zero by 2050.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, the position above recognises the possibility of a structural decline in the price of oil and consequential fiscal vulnerabilities that may arise, as well as the increased risk exposure therefrom, and is responding to it in several ways,\u201d the minister explained.\n\nThe former Bayelsa governor pointed out that Nigeria would continue to focus on gas, which he said is at the heart of the energy transition and represents the first step in the journey to renewables away from oil.\n\nSylva averred that gas was not just a transition fuel for Nigeria, but also represents a destination fuel, as the country envisages that it will be part of its energy mix by 2050, given the vast resources that can be commercialised and utilised.\n\nFurthermore, he stressed that generous incentives have been proposed in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021 to enable development, distribution, penetration and utilisation of gas.\n\n\u201cOur proven gas reserves are sufficient to cover current demand levels and support plans for the construction of nine new gas-fired power plants with a combined name-plate capacity of nearly 6,000 MW by 2037,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile congratulating the leadership and staff of Seplat on the formal unveiling of the new brand identity, he noted that it bears testament to the company\u2019s movement with the times, evidenced by its full transition to an energy company.\n\nHe stated that the PIA would assist in harnessing Nigeria\u2019s potential to achieve its plan of increasing oil production to four million bpd and oil reserves from 37 billion barrels to 40 barrels while also drawing on the country\u2019s estimated 600TCF of natural gas reserves to provide clean and efficient energy.\n\nSylva noted that the provisions relating to voluntary conversion, production allowances, lower royalties and taxes, cost optimisation focus in the PIA have been enshrined to address the envisaged fiscal vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, who was represented at the event by the Minister of State, Environment, Sharon Ikeazor, said over the next decade, every aspect of national energy system was expected to be affected by changes in climate and energy policy, financing, continuous technological advancement, and shifts in energy supply and demand.\n\nHe argued that energy transition could no longer be limited to incremental steps, but must become a transformational effort based on rapid upscaling and implementation of all available technologies to innovate for the future.\n\nOsinbajo said Nigeria has now developed its energy transition plan, through the Cop 26 plan which has the three core objectives of achieving universal access to energy by 2030, net zero emissions by 2050 and industrialisation to alleviate poverty and drive economic growth.\n\nHe added that the transformation of the energy sector offers ample opportunities for sustained economic development, social inclusion, energy security, improved health, job creation, and other societal benefits if achieved in a just and inclusive manner.\n\n\u201cHowever, this would require careful management and broad engagement in order to balance delicate and diverse interests. This brings to the fore the vulnerability of workers, communities, government sectors, and enterprises.\n\n\u201cIt also underscores the necessity for comprehensive and coherent policies and measures to address the multifaceted challenges involved and to pursue environmentally sustainable growth, while at the same time ensuring a just transition for those affected,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe Group Managing Director, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, in his comments, argued that the mistake being made all over the world was that people see net zero as zero fossil fuel in the future.\n\nHe noted that there must be fair and practical steps to close the energy gap in Africa, explaining that there must also be a transition fuel in form of gas to close the huge energy poverty in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, even in the next 50 years, oil and gas would still be relevant, noting that what should be done was to make them much more climate friendly with efficient mechanisms in place, assuring that the NNPC would continue to lead the conversation in that direction.\n\nIn an executive dialogue session anchored by the Chairman, THISDAY Newspapers and Founder Arise News Channel, Prince Nduka Obaigbena and the Chief Executive Officer of Seplat, Mr. Roger Brown, noted that the company would continue to evolve as it embraces renewables.\n\nHe said that Seplat has a strategy as summarised in its upstream oil and gas, in which it is continuing to cut costs, the midstream which is mainly gas processing business and the third which is its renewable energy side.\n\nBrown noted that the focus on renewables remains real, describing it as the energy of the future, but maintained that one fuel source was not the solution to the transition, but a combination of many sources.\n\nHe stated that solar power has bright prospects in the country, noting that Seplat was looking at both on-grid and off-grid sides of the business which has gone beyond paper work.\n\nAlso on the panel, a non-Executive Director of Seplat Energy, Mr. Bello Rabiu, noted that 80 per cent of emissions were being carried out by the industrialised nations, while the rest of the world does a paltry 20 per cent, saying that African countries cannot suffer for the irresponsibility of some developed nations.\n\nAccording to him, Africa has to continue to deploy its resources efficiently, arguing that net zero in 2050 does not mean oil and gas will no longer exist.\n\nRabiu said that monies from fossil fuels when spent on importation is not sustainable, explaining that Nigeria needs technology, investment and the cooperation of the international community.\n\nObaigbena who got intermittent applauses for his handling of the session, however argued that none of the factors mentioned was within Nigeria\u2019s control, which again raises the issue of over-reliance on foreign aid.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "How Buhari Visited Ailing Ex-Lagos Governor, Tinubu In Corruption-tainted London Villa Acquired By Osun Governor, Oyetola",
          "text": "Investigation has revealed that the London mansion where the National Leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu welcomed President Muhammadu Buhari on August 12, 2021 is the subject of a multi-billion fraud scandal.\n\nThe investigation is part of the global International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)-led Pandora Papers project, which Nigeria\u2019s PREMIUM TIMES is a part of.\n\nThe project involved 600 journalists from 150 news organisations around the world sorting and analysing a trove of almost 12 million confidential files, tracking down and interviewing sources, and adding context using public records and documents.\n\nThe leaked files were retrieved from some offshore services firms around the world that set up shell companies and other offshore entities for clients, many of them influential politicians, businesspersons, and criminals seeking to conceal their financial dealings.\n\nThe investigation added that the Buhari government had also secured a freezing order on the property from a Federal High Court before the previous owner, who is now an international fugitive, sold it at a huge discount to an offshore company owned by the governor of Osun State, Gboyega Oyetola, a known proxy and a relative of Tinubu.\n\nThe property, which is situated at 32 Grove End Road, in the wealthy Westminster neighbourhood of London, has become a sort of mecca to associates of Tinubu, and politicians of the ruling APC, after the former Lagos Governor started staying there to recuperate.\n\nApart from Buhari, other politicians who have visited Tinubu at the expanse 6,975 sq ft property are the governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; a former governor of Ogun State, Ibikunle Amosun; Amosun\u2019s successor, Dapo Abiodun; the governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi; the governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu; members of the Lagos State House of Assembly; the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; a contingent from Kano State led by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje; top Fuji musician; Wasiu Ayinde, among other dignitaries.\n\nDocuments obtained from the UK property register revealed that in July 2013, the property with title number 340992, was bought for \u00a311.95 million by Zavlil Holdings Ltd, a shell company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, a notorious tax haven.\n\nFurther documents obtained by PREMIUM TIMES revealed that Zavlil Holdings Limited is owned by Kolawole Aluko, an international fugitive wanted by law enforcement agencies in Nigeria and the United States for money laundering.\n\nKola Aluko and his associate, Jide Omokore, were indicted in the U.S. and Nigeria for multi-million-dollar fraud and money laundering violations allegedly in collusion with a former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Diezani Alison-Madueke.\n\nIn 2016, the Nigerian Government filed a Mareva injunction at a Federal High Court in Lagos seeking to confiscate a list of properties belonging to Messrs Aluko and Omokore valued at $1.8 billion.\n\nA Mareva injunction is a Court order which freezes the assets of a defendant pending the outcome of a litigation.\n\nIn the suit against Messrs Omokore and Aluko, alongside their companies, Atlantic Energy Drilling Concepts Nigeria Limited and Atlantic Energy Brass Development Limited, the Nigerian Government asked the court to grant it seven orders to prevent the accused from disposing the assets. The government alleged they were acquired through fraudulent means.\n\nThe third prayer the government made to the court was to grant it an order restraining the accused \u201cfrom giving any instruction, demanding, accepting, receiving payments and/or transacting, transferring, mortgaging or howsoever dealing in any manner with assets of the Defendants in both houses and land in Abuja and Lagos and others located outside Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe government then listed 17 properties in Abuja, Lagos, the U.S., Canada, Dubai, Switzerland, and the UK. Among the listed properties was \u201cGrove End Road, London\u201d.\n\nThe court granted the government all its prayers. In October 2017, an attempt by the defendants to dismiss the Mareva injunction granted on the properties was subsequently dismissed by Oluremi Oguntoyinbo, the trial judge.\n\nBut just around the time (on October 18, 2017) the court dismissed the defendant\u2019s attempt to dismiss the injunction, documents obtained from the U.K. property register revealed that Mr Aluko sold the house for \u00a39 million to Aranda Overseas Corporation, an offshore company incorporated in the British Virgins Island by two of Tinubu\u2019s most trusted surrogates \u2013 Adegboyega Oyetola, formerly chair of Paragon Group of Companies and incumbent governor of Osun State and Elusanmi Eludoyin, Mr Oyetola\u2019s successor at Paragon.\n\nIn November 1999, 18 years before it was used as a vehicle to purchase the London property, Oyetola and his billionaire partner, Eludoyin, sought the service of a Bristol, UK-based international company registration agent, Jordans Limited, to help them set up a company.\n\nThey wanted a kind of setup that would guarantee some secrecy and on November 11 of that year, the company was registered.\n\nLeaked confidential records revealed that Messrs Eludoyin and Oyetola became the shareholders and directors of Aranda and we did not see any record that the latter resigned from the management of the company even as he served as chief of staff to his predecessor, Rauf Aregbesola, thereby breaking Nigeria\u2019s law.\n\nIn Nigeria, a person is statutorily obligated to withdraw from engaging in or directing a private business, except if it is farming, upon becoming a public officer, Section Six (6) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act stipulates.\n\nApart from Aranda, Oyetola has another footprint in the offshore shadow economy. He and Eludoyin, in 2003, incorporated another shelf company in the British Virgin Islands, Global Investments Offshore Limited.\n\nHe ran the company as a director almost throughout his term as Mr Aregbesola\u2019s Chief of Staff. However in June 2018, months before he became governor, he withdrew from the company and made his children \u2013 Rukayat Oyetola, Hafiz Oyetola, and Rasheedat Oyetola directors.\n\nHe also transferred his shares in Global Investments Offshore Limited to Mr Eludoyin and his son Haifz in June 2018. A register of directors we saw shows that all the formalities for the transfers were concluded and signed on June 1, 2018.\n\nBy remaining a director of Global Offshore for the entire period he was Chief of Staff to Aregbesola, Oyetola violated Nigeria\u2019s code of conduct law and could be arraigned before the Code of Conduct Tribunal if authorities decide to prosecute him for the infraction.\n\nIt however remains unclear why Oyetola would rush to buy a property his country was pushing to confiscate due to well-known corruption allegations against its then owner.\n\nAlso unclear is why Tinubu, who apparently wants to become Nigeria`s president, would agree to stay at the controversial property.\n\nAs for Buhari, it is yet unknown why he would visit Tinubu at a property suspected to have been originally bought by Mr Aluko from the proceeds of alleged theft of Nigeria\u2019s oil money.\n\nOyetola ignored multiple requests for him to comment on this story. His spokespersons declined to revert days after they promised to do so.",

          "text": "Investigation has revealed that the London mansion where the National Leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu welcomed President Muhammadu Buhari on August 12, 2021 is the subject of a multi-billion fraud scandal.\n\nThe investigation is part of the global International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)-led Pandora Papers project, which Nigeria\u2019s PREMIUM TIMES is a part of.\n\nThe project involved 600 journalists from 150 news organisations around the world sorting and analysing a trove of almost 12 million confidential files, tracking down and interviewing sources, and adding context using public records and documents.\n\nThe leaked files were retrieved from some offshore services firms around the world that set up shell companies and other offshore entities for clients, many of them influential politicians, businesspersons, and criminals seeking to conceal their financial dealings.\n\nThe investigation added that the Buhari government had also secured a freezing order on the property from a Federal High Court before the previous owner, who is now an international fugitive, sold it at a huge discount to an offshore company owned by the governor of Osun State, Gboyega Oyetola, a known proxy and a relative of Tinubu.\n\nThe property, which is situated at 32 Grove End Road, in the wealthy Westminster neighbourhood of London, has become a sort of mecca to associates of Tinubu, and politicians of the ruling APC, after the former Lagos Governor started staying there to recuperate.\n\nApart from Buhari, other politicians who have visited Tinubu at the expanse 6,975 sq ft property are the governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; a former governor of Ogun State, Ibikunle Amosun; Amosun\u2019s successor, Dapo Abiodun; the governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi; the governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu; members of the Lagos State House of Assembly; the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; a contingent from Kano State led by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje; top Fuji musician; Wasiu Ayinde, among other dignitaries.\n\nDocuments obtained from the UK property register revealed that in July 2013, the property with title number 340992, was bought for \u00a311.95 million by Zavlil Holdings Ltd, a shell company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, a notorious tax haven.\n\nFurther documents obtained by PREMIUM TIMES revealed that Zavlil Holdings Limited is owned by Kolawole Aluko, an international fugitive wanted by law enforcement agencies in Nigeria and the United States for money laundering.\n\nKola Aluko and his associate, Jide Omokore, were indicted in the U.S. and Nigeria for multi-million-dollar fraud and money laundering violations allegedly in collusion with a former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Diezani Alison-Madueke.\n\nIn 2016, the Nigerian Government filed a Mareva injunction at a Federal High Court in Lagos seeking to confiscate a list of properties belonging to Messrs Aluko and Omokore valued at $1.8 billion.\n\nA Mareva injunction is a Court order which freezes the assets of a defendant pending the outcome of a litigation.\n\nIn the suit against Messrs Omokore and Aluko, alongside their companies, Atlantic Energy Drilling Concepts Nigeria Limited and Atlantic Energy Brass Development Limited, the Nigerian Government asked the court to grant it seven orders to prevent the accused from disposing the assets. The government alleged they were acquired through fraudulent means.\n\nThe third prayer the government made to the court was to grant it an order restraining the accused \u201cfrom giving any instruction, demanding, accepting, receiving payments and/or transacting, transferring, mortgaging or howsoever dealing in any manner with assets of the Defendants in both houses and land in Abuja and Lagos and others located outside Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe government then listed 17 properties in Abuja, Lagos, the U.S., Canada, Dubai, Switzerland, and the UK. Among the listed properties was \u201cGrove End Road, London\u201d.\n\nThe court granted the government all its prayers. In October 2017, an attempt by the defendants to dismiss the Mareva injunction granted on the properties was subsequently dismissed by Oluremi Oguntoyinbo, the trial judge.\n\nBut just around the time (on October 18, 2017) the court dismissed the defendant\u2019s attempt to dismiss the injunction, documents obtained from the U.K. property register revealed that Mr Aluko sold the house for \u00a39 million to Aranda Overseas Corporation, an offshore company incorporated in the British Virgins Island by two of Tinubu\u2019s most trusted surrogates \u2013 Adegboyega Oyetola, formerly chair of Paragon Group of Companies and incumbent governor of Osun State and Elusanmi Eludoyin, Mr Oyetola\u2019s successor at Paragon.\n\nIn November 1999, 18 years before it was used as a vehicle to purchase the London property, Oyetola and his billionaire partner, Eludoyin, sought the service of a Bristol, UK-based international company registration agent, Jordans Limited, to help them set up a company.\n\nThey wanted a kind of setup that would guarantee some secrecy and on November 11 of that year, the company was registered.\n\nLeaked confidential records revealed that Messrs Eludoyin and Oyetola became the shareholders and directors of Aranda and we did not see any record that the latter resigned from the management of the company even as he served as chief of staff to his predecessor, Rauf Aregbesola, thereby breaking Nigeria\u2019s law.\n\nIn Nigeria, a person is statutorily obligated to withdraw from engaging in or directing a private business, except if it is farming, upon becoming a public officer, Section Six (6) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act stipulates.\n\nApart from Aranda, Oyetola has another footprint in the offshore shadow economy. He and Eludoyin, in 2003, incorporated another shelf company in the British Virgin Islands, Global Investments Offshore Limited.\n\nHe ran the company as a director almost throughout his term as Mr Aregbesola\u2019s Chief of Staff. However in June 2018, months before he became governor, he withdrew from the company and made his children \u2013 Rukayat Oyetola, Hafiz Oyetola, and Rasheedat Oyetola directors.\n\nHe also transferred his shares in Global Investments Offshore Limited to Mr Eludoyin and his son Haifz in June 2018. A register of directors we saw shows that all the formalities for the transfers were concluded and signed on June 1, 2018.\n\nBy remaining a director of Global Offshore for the entire period he was Chief of Staff to Aregbesola, Oyetola violated Nigeria\u2019s code of conduct law and could be arraigned before the Code of Conduct Tribunal if authorities decide to prosecute him for the infraction.\n\nIt however remains unclear why Oyetola would rush to buy a property his country was pushing to confiscate due to well-known corruption allegations against its then owner.\n\nAlso unclear is why Tinubu, who apparently wants to become Nigeria`s president, would agree to stay at the controversial property.\n\nAs for Buhari, it is yet unknown why he would visit Tinubu at a property suspected to have been originally bought by Mr Aluko from the proceeds of alleged theft of Nigeria\u2019s oil money.\n\nOyetola ignored multiple requests for him to comment on this story. His spokespersons declined to revert days after they promised to do so.",
          "summary": "A Mareva injunction is a Court order which freezes the assets of a defendant pending the outcome of a litigation.\nHe and Eludoyin, in 2003, incorporated another shelf company in the British Virgin Islands, Global Investments Offshore Limited.\nHowever in June 2018, months before he became governor, he withdrew from the company and made his children \u2013 Rukayat Oyetola, Hafiz Oyetola, and Rasheedat Oyetola directors.\nHe also transferred his shares in Global Investments Offshore Limited to Mr Eludoyin and his son Haifz in June 2018.\nAlso unclear is why Tinubu, who apparently wants to become Nigeria`s president, would agree to stay at the controversial property.",

I am compelled to believe that the faculty for primitive accumulation is a pre-historic flaw of the African species. From Mobutu Sese Seko, former president of the Democratic Republic of Congo; General Sani Abacha of Nigeria, to Teodorin Obiang, vice-president of Equatorial Guinea; Jacob Zuma of South Africa, and many others in the corruption phylum, African leaders and public officers appear to be the most afflicted by the midge of acquisitiveness.\n\nWhy would any normal human entrusted with public funds, stash away millions of dollars in tax havens and buy sprawling estates in foreign countries?

I think there is a design flaw with the African public officer; I mean, with the Nigerian public officer.\n\nDiezani Alison-Madueke, former minister of petroleum resources, is reported to have pilfered over $153 million, bought N14 billion worth of jewellery and acquired over 90 properties in Nigeria \u2013 according to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). This clearly shows a psychological kink. It is mindboggling.

When we colligate over 100 million Nigerians stratified as poorest of the poor, decayed health infrastructure and parlous roads with the ghastly and ravenous pursuits of Nigerian public officers, it is even more exasperating.

          "title": "An ex-Google EMEA lead expands his address verification service to Nigeria",
          "text": "Globally, more than 75% of countries have poor or no street-addressing systems, according to the United Nations. This lack of addressing systems affects 4 billion people, more than 400 million of them in Africa, and costs businesses billions of dollars annually.\n\nAddress infrastructure is an essential public good and its lack is a major drawback, both for the unaddressed and service providers. Without an address, it\u2019s almost impossible to be reached or receive delivery of goods or financial services.\n\nOkHi founder and CEO, Timbo Drayson, encountered this problem for the first time while on a sabbatical travelling across East and West Africa in 2014. Having led the launch of Google Maps in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa during a seven-year spell at Google, the Oxford-trained engineer realised the product didn\u2019t exactly work as expected in African markets.\n\nTimbo Drayson.\n\n\u201cI saw firsthand how the lack of formal physical addressing had a detrimental impact on businesses like Jumia delivering an item, the Red Cross finding a casualty, or Standard Bank verifying a customer\u2019s address,\u201d Drayson told TechCabal. That experience inspired the founding of OkHi, a digital address verification startup that commenced operations in Kenya in 2014.\n\nThrough its products \u2013 OKCollect, OKVerify, and OkGo \u2013 the company enabled businesses, from e-commerce to ride-hailing startups, to collect accurate addresses with a GPS and photo from their customers, verify the information using smartphone data and help agents navigate to the locations without getting lost.\n\nPivoting from Kenya\n\nIn Kenya, OkHi claims to have verified over 300,000 addresses as well as reduced cost of delivery by 20% for KFC, pick up time by 40% for Uber and increased Jumia\u2019s net promoter score (NPS) by 35%.\n\nLast December, it launched in Nigeria on the back of a $1.5 million fundraise led by Interswitch, Founders Factory Africa, and Betatron venture capitalists. The startup has secured $2.5 million in funding till date, according to Crunchbase data.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nRather than an expansion, however, the entry into Nigeria is a pivot. In 2020, OkHi changed its model from collecting addresses for mobility businesses in Kenya to verifying addresses for financial services companies in Nigeria.\n\nDrayson describes the move as a tough decision. \u201cWe had 300,000 addresses in Kenya and were generating revenue. However, our hypothesis was that we can build our address database faster by providing digital address verification for financial services.\u201d\n\nWhy was Nigeria the target? He explains that both the problem space and opportunity were bigger in Africa\u2019s most populous economy than in Kenya. \u201cNigeria has the most sophisticated financial services sector in Africa; it is strictly regulated, including the need for proof of address; and the country has 200 million people.\u201d\n\nA smart address system\n\nMost banks require utility bills and send human agents to verify prospective customer addresses in person, as part of a mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) procedure. The process is not only time-consuming and costly but also limits access to financial services.\n\nWith OkHi, Nigerians can share their locations with one tap on any OkHi-enabled service. This replaces the need for physical address verification, which is unappealing to many who see it as invasive.\n\n\u201cBy making it easy for people and businesses to verify their address, OkHi will enable more and more people to prove who they are and get access to finance,\u201d Drayson says.\n\nA screenshot of OkHi website. Image credit: TechCabal.\n\nOkHi is going live with its first set of customers in Nigeria, and recently completed a successful pilot with Stanbic IBTC. In addition to providing capital, Interswitch is a strategic partner to the startup. The Lagos-based payment processing firm has a relationship with all the major banks and is OkHi\u2019s route to the Nigerian market.\n\n\u201cThe premise of the relationship [with Interswitch] is based on the fact that they serve our entire target customer base [banks and fintechs]. We are go-to-market partners.\u201d\n\nAlthough OkHi\u2019s primary target clients are financial services providers, the company has plans to serve other businesses that need address verification, including last-mile delivery companies and emergency services like ambulances.\n\n\u201cConsumers can think of OkHi like Paypal. They create their OkHi address with one business and then they can use their address with other services. With one tap of a button, a person can prove their address for a bank, get a delivery to their door, and share their address with a friend \u2013 that\u2019s a world with OkHi,\u201d Drayson says.\n\nOkHi is currently hiring across multiple departments and the CEO is confident about the company generating revenue from the fourth quarter of this year. It makes money by charging clients for each address verification.\n\n\u201cFrom Kenya to Nigeria to the world! We would like to see the impact of OkHi spread far and wide, with people in hundreds of countries using it in their everyday life,\u201d Drayson says.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Aggregators are enabling independent voices in Kenya\u2019s controlled news circuit",
          "text": "Kenya is all about the news. No, literally, \u201cHabari\u201d, a common greeting in Swahili, means \u201cAny news?\u201d in English.\n\nEveryone has their favourite publication. And every publication has a different story.\n\nData-driven digital media is taking the place of print in Kenya. As the world becomes busier and more digital, the consumption of media has changed. Emerging to take the place of rifling through the morning newspaper are scrollable, swipeable news aggregators that have the potential to change Kenya\u2019s media landscape.\n\nWho owns the headlines? The origins of Kenyan media\n\nIn a country of 52 million people, only a few formal media houses run print news. At an average cost of $0.54 per paper, reading the news can become expensive.\n\nNation Media Group publishes Daily Nation. With a daily circulation of 200,000, it stands as Kenya\u2019s most popular news publication.\n\nThe Standard Group comes in second, with three spin-offs: The Standard, The Standard on Saturday, and The Standard on Sunday. At its inception, more than 100 years ago, it was a colonial newspaper focused on British news. In 1970, African editors took over the running of the paper and shifted its focus to local reporting.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe news circuit\n\nIn an increasingly digital society, news aggregators are offering a new avenue for readers to access diversified content and human stories.\n\nNews aggregators use AI to collate news from different sources, placing them in one, central, scrollable feed. The rise of the news aggregator has, without a doubt, changed the global news industry.\n\nIn 2005, the Agence France-Presse (AFP), sued Google and sought an order barring Google from placing their content on Google News, claiming that the reproduction of the site\u2019s pictures and articles was copyright infringement. AFP and Google settled the suit and the two parties entered a licensed content deal after two years of litigation.\n\nOpera News is another digital news aggregator focused on capturing newsreaders in Africa. It sits under the Opera technology umbrella. If the name sounds familiar it\u2019s because Opera is also the creator of Opay, who raised $400 million from Softbank Vision Fund 2 in late August. The aggregator models itself after a popular app in China, Jinri Toutiao (in English, \u201cToday\u2019s Headlines\u201d). Opera News hit 10 million users in Africa in 2018 and expanded into Kenya in 2020.\n\nMuch like other aggregators, like Google News and Flipboard, Opera News\u2019 AI crawls the internet for content. But unlike other news aggregation giants, Opera News focuses on the curation of original, local, news-pulling stories from local media and fostering a band of content creators that are paid based on a set of parameters that include article clicks.\n\nPositive feedback loops\n\nAggregating digital news in an environment that tends towards the latest and greatest political stories calls for a shift in focus. In the world of news aggregation, moving the needle is as easy as a tweak in the algorithm.\n\n\u201cSome of the parameters that we had before [were] pretty much based on\u2026a lot of people are clicking this [and] our AI picks this up. So what happens is that people who are not doing that cannot get traffic\u2026\u201d said Anthory Ilari, Team Lead of Opera News East Africa.\n\nIlari found that this directly demotivated Opera News\u2019 content creators from reporting stories on broader topics in Kenya.\n\nTo deal with this, Ilari\u2019s team adjusted the algorithm to give original, non-political pieces a boost in the ranking system and feed.\n\nAlbert Bittok, a trained journalist that contributed to Opera News in his spare time, said that, from his experience, articles that received the most views and highest payout were focused on human interest and other topics like politics, sports, and agriculture.\n\nAfter a quick scroll through the headlines page on the Opera News app, TechCabal found that 35% of the headlines were non-political, focused on Kenyan celebrity gossip. On the For You page, on the other hand, 70% of the recommended posts were political in nature.\n\nAgitating aggregation\n\nBut news aggregators are not the be-all and end-all for news diversification in Kenya. Aggregators, like most technology, have their pitfalls. According to Dr. Dinesh Balliah, Acting Director of the Wits Centre for Journalism at Wits University, aggregators point to the growing need for \u201cconvenience in the global economy\u201d, but much like print media, reliance on a single aggregator can be counterproductive.\n\n\u201cNews consumers are not reading intertextually and are therefore getting a single narrative if they are reliant on a single aggregator,\u201d she wrote to TechCabal over email. \u201cAggregators, like social media platforms, must assist the news media to sustain itself,\u201d she added.\n\nNews aggregation requires constant tweaking, learning, and development in a world where millions of clicks come within a few hours. In 2020, Kenya\u2019s internet penetration rate was 85%, with 76% of the internet being accessed by cell phones. As Kenya\u2019s 2022 elections draw near, content moderation will become harder than ever and the nation\u2019s news aggregators will have to rise to the challenge.\n\nShare this article\n\nAlexandria Williams | Author",

          "text": "When Kemi*, 26, received a rejection email from Twitter about a software engineering role she\u2019d applied to, she was devastated, and she cried. She\u2019d previously aced Palantir\u2019s recruitment process for the same role and was going to travel for the final interview, on-site, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and thwarted that plan.\n\nBefore all of these, Kemi had applied to Google, Amazon and Apple but didn\u2019t scale through their recruitment processes. These initial rejections didn\u2019t faze her like Twitter\u2019s, though, because, by the time she applied to the social media giant, she felt she\u2019d already acquired enough skills to land the job.\n\nYet she didn\u2019t. The common response she got across these companies was that she\u2019d submitted her coding assessments later than required; they thought she was slow in coming up with solutions. But she had a demanding, full-time job, and that took up most of her time.\n\nShe decided, then, to take a break from applying for international jobs and focus on her current job at the time. The job paid her enough to sort out personal and family bills, after all.\n\nAnd yet, her ambitions wouldn\u2019t take a break. So it was only a matter of weeks before she was back to applying again to these international jobs.\n\nSo, how did a girl like her \u2013 who came from a poor background \u2013 go from selling fufu and dried fish on a university campus to almost working with Google, Amazon, Twitter and Palantir, and finally landing a software engineering role at the world\u2019s biggest financial data and news company, Bloomberg?\n\nIt all began in Lagos, Nigeria, 26 years ago.\n\nKemi was the first child of her family, born in 1995, in the Akowonjo area of Lagos, Nigeria. Her mother, Mrs Adeoye*, was a schoolteacher and fabric trader. But not the kind that owned shops. Mrs Adeoye sold fabric to her colleagues at school and neighbours. On weekends, she and Kemi hawked them on the street.\n\nDue to their inadequate salary, it\u2019s common in Nigeria for teachers, especially female ones, to double as traders. But it\u2019s not common to see a schoolteacher hawking on the street.\n\nMrs Adeoye collected the fabrics on credit from wholesalers and could only restock after paying for the previous wares. She embodied steadfastness and diligence \u2013 values she has passed down to her daughters.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKemi watched her mother juggle two jobs to provide for her and her sister and that influenced her decision to work hard and smart. \u201cMy mum raised us alone, and I just got the memo, from a young age, that if I didn\u2019t want to suffer, I\u2019d have to hustle.\u201d\n\nIt was a lonely journey for a single mother raising two daughters alone in Lagos with the little money she made from her teaching job and side hustle.\n\nBut where was her father?\n\n\u201cBold of you to think my dad is dead,\u201d Kemi said, when I asked when her father had died.\n\nHer father had left her mother when her younger sister, Ayo,* was a year old. There was no reason for his disappearance \u2013 at least not any Kemi or her mother knew of. Kemi was five when he left and never looked back.\n\nThe next time Kemi saw him again, she was 12.\n\nHer father\u2019s return was bad luck\n\nIn 2007, Kemi\u2019s sister Ayo fell seriously sick and Mrs Adeoye had to send for her daughters\u2019 father. He showed up, surprisingly, like a hero who\u2019d come to save the day. He spent some months with his earlier-abandoned family and ended up turning everything upside down before he left them yet again. Kemi, her mother and sister had gone out one day, and when they returned, found that he had disappeared with Mrs Adeoye\u2019s goods and put her in debt.\n\nThis event marked the beginning of a negative turn for the family, throwing them into a state of penury that would last over three years. Those goods had been collected on credit and now the wholesalers were upset and wanted their money.\n\nMrs Adeoye had to repay her debts in bits, from her meagre salary, leaving her with almost nothing for feeding and housekeeping. Sometimes, her creditors stormed the school where she taught to embarrass her about their money. By now, things had gotten so bad that Kemi and Ayo used polythene bags to carry their books to school.\n\nSchool fees were the least of the Adeoye sisters\u2019 problems, however, because they both attended schools where their mother taught. There was a staff discount for teachers\u2019 kids at these schools, and sometimes, a complete fee waiver.\n\nExcelling in school\n\nAmid all this chaos, Kemi remained one of the most brilliant students in her class. Being a teacher\u2019s kid may not have come with life\u2019s best comforts, but it gave her something: strict supervision that drove her to excellence.\n\nTwo years after secondary school, Kemi was admitted into the Faculty of Engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife.\n\nThings had gotten better for her family while she was in SS 3, her final year of secondary school. Her mother got a new job in another school. The job came with accommodation, free lunch and better pay. Mrs Adeoye bought Kemi her first laptop and was able to pay her university bills.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut their problems were far from over.\n\nA few months into Kemi\u2019s freshman year, terror hit again. Her mother lost the new job, and the family was back to square one. Her mother never found her feet again after that.\n\nFor five years, Kemi struggled through university. In her second year, her friend\u2019s father paid her school fees, and in her third year, her fees would come from money she made hawking food on campus. In her third year, she took fufu, eggs and dry fish from one hostel room to another, calling on her fellow students to come buy.\n\nShe stopped selling food after her internship at a tech firm in Lagos. And she used part of the money she made during the internship to sort out her fees for her fifth year of school.\n\nWriting code changed Kemi\u2019s story\n\nKemi started writing code in her freshman year. Some guys at her school had organised a coding bootcamp, which she passively attended. At OAU, it was easy to get into coding as there were always coding camps going on, on the campus.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to continue coding. After the bootcamp, Kemi wasn\u2019t really excited about the skill and discontinued further development in that area \u2013 until her third year when she started working as a software development trainee in a tech company in Yaba, Nigeria\u2019s biggest tech hub. The company picked up students, trained and paid them a stipend for learning.\n\nWhile that was going on, one of her lecturers organised a coding training and, at the end of it, a hackathon, which marked the beginning of it all.\n\nIf Nigerian universities were to be graded based on the number of top tech talents produced, OAU would be in the top three. The school is popular for this, and the Nigerian tech ecosystem testifies to this.\n\n\u201cI like to say I officially became a software engineer during my internship at Konga,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cThat was the turning point for me.\u201d\n\nSince her internship at Konga, all the jobs she\u2019d gotten had been based on recommendations.\n\nDuring her time at her first job out of school, she got an offer from a company based in Germany, but her Nigerian company made a counter-offer and she remained with them. However, when Bloomberg called, it was a case of not every offer can be countered.\n\n\u201cGetting into tech wasn\u2019t really about passion. It was more about getting stability in life,\u201d Kemi told me. \u201cA career as a software engineer has allowed me to do things I could only dream of [before].\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s reality is the same for most Africans, especially young people going into tech; many available jobs can barely cater for their own immediate needs, not to talk of catering for other family members.\n\nKemi wants to continue supporting her mother and sister, not only by clearing their bills but also helping them to be independent of her. \u201cI want to help my family build generational wealth, and you know that can\u2019t happen if I\u2019m the only one giving.\u201d\n\nKemi graduated from OAU with a first-class. This revelation was enough to start an entirely new conversation. There were so many more questions I wanted to ask her, but the answer to them all, she told me, was grit, ambition and a staunch fear of poverty.\n\n*Names have been changed to protect subjects\u2019 identities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

          "text": "At the first virtual Google for Africa event today, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, announced a plan to invest $1billion over 5 years to support digital transformation in Africa.\n\nThe investment focuses on enabling fast, affordable internet access for more Africans; building helpful products; supporting entrepreneurship and small business; and helping nonprofits to improve lives across Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made huge strides together over the past decade \u2014 but there\u2019s more work to do to make the internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African.\u201d Sundar Pichai said.\n\nTo provide affordable internet access in Africa, Google is building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs. Its subsea cable Equiano will run through South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria and St Helena and connect the continent with Europe.\n\nAs part of Google\u2019s commitment to supporting Black-led startups in Africa, the company announced the launch of an Africa Investment Fund. Through this fund, it will invest $50M in startups and provide them with access to Google\u2019s employees, network, and technologies to help them build meaningful products for their communities. This is in addition to Google\u2019s existing support through the Google for Startups Accelerator Africa, which has helped more than 80 African startups with equity-free finance, working space and access to expert advisors over the last three years.\n\n\u201cI am so inspired by the innovative African tech startup scene. In the last year we have seen more investment rounds into tech startups than ever before,\u201d Nitin Gajria, Managing Director for Google in Africa said.\n\n\u201cI am of the firm belief that no one is better placed to solve Africa\u2019s biggest problems than Africa\u2019s young developers and startup founders. We look forward to deepening our partnership with, and support for, Africa\u2019s innovators and entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nTo cater for small businesses and entrepreneurs, Google is collaborating with non-profit organisation Kiva to provide $10M in low-interest loans to help small businesses and entrepreneurs in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa get through the economic hardship created by COVID-19.\n\nNonprofits haven\u2019t been left out of this, Google.org is expanding its commitment to support nonprofits working to improve lives across Africa, with an additional $40M to help more partners organisations. In the case of the Airqo team at Makerere University, who use AI and sensors to monitor poor air quality, a leading cause of premature death. Google is providing $3M in new grant funding to expand this pioneering work from Kampala across 10 cities in 5 countries on the continent.\n\nThe announcement of the $1bn investment is commendable and a testament to Google\u2019s commitment to supporting digital transformation in Africa. Since 2017, Google has trained 6 million young Africans and businesses in digital skills. Google has also supported more than 50 nonprofits across Africa with over $16 million of grants and enabled 100 million more Africans to access internet services for the first time through Android.\n\nShare this article\n\nAdegoke Oyeniyi | Author @seunadegoke01",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest , a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nNabsolute\u2019s SpinHeard\n\nUber\u2019s expansion\n\nKlasha\u2019s $2.4m seed\n\nNabsolute\u2019s SpinHeard aims to help independent artists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Okpala, Founder of Nabsolute. Source: Supplied\n\nA peculiar situation. It\u2019s interesting how a career path as a recording artist can be full of uncertainty. You start with a passion for your craft, but to stay afloat, you need to find known agents and big record labels and hope to land that dream record deal.\n\nYour biggest woe is either unheard songs or a flash in the pan success. Luck aside, how can a budding artist navigate the crowded world of music business and get exposure?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is what Nabsolute Media, a media communications and marketing agency based in Nigeria, is looking to do for independent artists with its recently launched platform, SpinHeard.\n\nVictor Okpala, a former music journalist and the founder of Nabsolute Media, understands the massive cost of getting one\u2019s music in front of the right crowd, especially with big name agencies.\n\nWith SpinHeard, independent artists can connect directly with listeners, learn the art of the music business with the starter kit provided when they sign up and get free social media publicity at a subsidised rate. But what\u2019s the economics of this? How does it work?\n\nOur senior reporter, Oluwanifemi, wrote a detailed feature on the SpinHeard launch. Read more here.\n\nUber is now present in five Nigerian cities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the news? US-based technology company, Uber, known primarily for its ride-hailing service, has announced an expansion into Ibadan and Port Harcourt. With this move, the company is now present in five Nigerian cities, including Lagos, Benin City, and Abuja.\n\nAs much as these expansions mean more transportation options and employment opportunities for prospective drivers, I wonder if we would see a repeat of several events.\n\nRecall that in April, Uber and Bolt drivers in Lagos went on a warning strike to protest the high commission fees they had to pay, which led to Uber increasing the prices for riders in Lagos.\n\nTwo-edged competition? On the one hand, competition between autonomous vehicles offering ride-hailing services and Uber is expected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, because traditional cabs are much cheaper in these cities, they might retain their hold regardless of Uber\u2019s presence. And with Bolt available in 24 Nigerian cities, including Ibadan and Port Harcourt, it won\u2019t be surprising if there is stiff competition between these parties.\n\nUber\u2019s giveaway: To mark this latest foray, the platform is giving a 50% discount off eight trips with the codes MOVEIBCITY and MOVEPHCITY for riders in Ibadan and Port Harcourt, respectively.\n\nKlasha\u2019s $2.4m seed round will be used to bolster cross-border payments infrastructure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJessica Anuna, Klasha\u2019s Founder\n\nFirst, the news: Klasha, a US-based, Africa-focused cross-border payments startup, has announced raising $2.4m in seed investment.\n\nLed by American VC firm Greycroft, the round saw participation from 2.12 Angels, AVG Basecamp Fund, Berrywood Capital, Seedcamp, Plug and Play, Practical VC, MiLA Capital, First Fund, and Expert Dojo. Some Angel Investors also partook, including former TechCrunch\u2018s Head of Product, Santosh Ankola.\n\nWhat does Klasha do? Jessica Anuna founded the company in 2018 as a platform for Africans to shop for fashion items on online stores globally.\n\nAt present, however, it allows Africans to make online and offline purchases in their local currencies using cards, bank accounts, and mobile money providers like M-Pesa, while the merchants receive payment in their currencies in two business days.\n\nThe startup also partners with third-party logistics companies to help merchants in Europe and the US ship to Africa in five to nine working days.\n\nNotable eCommerce platforms like WooCommerce and OpenCart have integrated Klasha\u2019s plugins, with the startup also having an official partnership with BigCommerce.\n\nWith this seed financing, the startup wants to build plugin libraries that will be integrated into platforms like Zara, ASOS, and H&M to enable payments across Africa. Also, plans to foray beyond Nigeria into three African countries are underway.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nThe Attention Diet. Read.\n\nCrazy New Ideas.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s it like to be an average independent artiste, trying to work your way into the limelight or get proper attention? It could involve gate-crashing events looking to get noticed by a record label or putting in the effort to gain financial or mentorship opportunities \u2014 basically, trying to get the right contacts.\n\nFor most artistes, balancing creativity and business could be an uphill task. While the former could be what someone likes to do, the latter is not always within the control of an artiste. When it becomes challenging to get the right contacts to showcase one\u2019s talents, those that can afford it use the services of public relations agencies \u2014 whose rates can be pretty expensive \u2014 to get the exposure.\n\nNabsolute Media, a Nigerian media communications and marketing agency, is one of these companies. However, after running for a little above two years and handling rollout for famous clientele, the business has decided to make communications options open to independent artistes at an affordable rate with the launch of its platform, SpinHeard.\n\nWhy SpinHeard?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSpinHeard is the next frontier for us. We\u2019re trying to automate what we do for a lot of artists,\u201d former music journalist and founder of Nabsolute, Victor Okpala, tells Techpoint Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a person who had to stick his neck out in the early days to get someone to bet on his capabilities, Okpala understands the importance of having a viable platform and the right contacts.\n\nStill, he believes that the times have become nicer such that the deal-breaker could just be time and chance. And the likelihood that exposure could come in easier ways has repeated itself as music becomes mainstream with the Internet.\n\nThis Harvard Business Review (HBR) piece makes a bold statement about the power of luck in any business. And Okpala strongly agrees with this, especially in music.\n\nA more recent case is how 17-year-old Salle\u2019s music broke the Internet and attracted huge attention, even from CNN, in less than a month. The young Nigerian\u2019s short performance was captured and posted by someone who\u2019d heard of her talents, and for her, that was all she needed.\n\nBut what are the odds if artistes leave it all to luck?\n\nWhile Nabsolute leverages storytelling, tech tools, and a network of influencers to amplify and market content within the creative industry, Okpala admits that these services might not be affordable for the average independent artist.\n\n\u201cWe know that an agency like Nabsolute is elite, which means there\u2019s a cost that comes with it if you want us to do a job for you.\u201d\n\nFor instance, running an entire campaign for four weeks could cost up to $1,500.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd that is a fee that a lot of independent artistes cannot afford,\u201d Okpala explains, \u201cThis group makes up a large percentage of the industry. This means we have a big market that we can\u2019t help. We needed to extend our solution to more people.\u201d\n\nGiven what this process entails, the burden would be massive on the agency and might not be economical for someone with a lean budget. Hence, a need to automate all these processes on a platform.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a platform that will help independent artistes to break the barrier to music curators \u2014 journalists, OAPs, influencers, DJs \u2014 across all levels.\u201d After all, for him, \u201cevery song deserves a fair chance of being heard.\u201d\n\nHow SpinHeard works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeeking coverage across different platforms can be a monumental task. Even though the two-year-old business has built a name for itself and has a ready network of \u2018doers\u2019 that can be onboarded, I expressed my worries about the risk of these employees getting a heavier workload for less pay.\n\nAccording to Okpala, SpinHeard comes with incentives for these curators, especially to simplify their jobs. The web app will include tools that will organise and automatically prioritise requests based on release dates, deadlines, genre, regions, and other sorting attributes.\n\nA SpinHeard account can be owned by an artist, a manager, or a curator.\n\nThink of Upwork but for music creators and curators. A platform where artistes can pitch directly to people to get their content across to listeners. What is more significant than an assurance that people will hear them?\n\nThe platform also contains some starter kits that could help artists present their pitches in acceptable formats. This includes press release guides, pitch templates, and press kit templates.\n\nGiven SpinHeard\u2019s value offering, Okpala says the attached costs will be hugely subsidised compared to the standard PR cost. However, since the product is still in its beta phase, the charge is yet to be defined.\n\nBut Okpala makes an interesting case for getting your craft under the radar of an influencer or an OAP with $1, without having to worry about rejection, as long as the quality of the work is good. If the pitch is ignored, there is also a chance to get a refund.\n\nAsides from that, there is an option to pitch for free, with the decision to feature left to the curator\u2019s discretion.\n\nFor starters, SpinHeard will help independent artistes upload their content to the popular video-sharing app, Triller and get promoted for free, of course, after content vetting.\n\nOkpala talks about how this leverages an existing partnership between the social networking platform and Nabsolute. This would expose these independent artistes to the perks the company already offers clients it runs comms for \u2014 in terms of push notifications, banner support, and other home page features.\n\nOkpala confirms that curators will be onboarded later this month; this will arrive along with payment features.\n\nWhat\u2019s the economics of this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m curious about what\u2019s in it for Nabsolute.\n\nLike every new venture, profit isn\u2019t the main goal for now. Okpala believes that starting Nabsolute is risk enough, so the initial focus is on onboarding. Sometimes, the reward might have to come from testimonials telling of the impact on the independent artiste who might have gone unheard without a platform like SpinHeard.\n\nStill, as a business, there\u2019s a plan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to pad the agency service charge into what users pay to the curators through a percentage share. The model is going to be the typical split-share percentage.\u201d\n\nHowever, this is yet to be decided. The company is still in talks with the curator community, and Okpala can\u2019t confirm if these rates and percentage commission would vary from one curator to another.\n\nWhile his expectations aren\u2019t lofty, Okpala speaks of this product as a risk worth taking since it is the first in the industry, and the company would be willing to experience both the first-mover advantage alongside its disadvantages.\n\nWith an initial focus on Nigeria, the platform would ultimately be open to artists across the globe.\n\nOkpala and his love for music and storytelling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Okpala, Founder of Nabsolute. Source: Supplied\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a music head,\u201d Okpala recalls.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t the whole story, so I probe further. After all, loving music doesn\u2019t always translate to being passionate about telling the story behind a song.\n\n\u201cI had an issue with the way music was being released. I felt like there was no storytelling interwoven in the rollout processes, and people could do better. Rollout felt like an afterthought compared to what happens in the US and other countries,\u201d he explains.\n\nBut he could not act on this until he founded Nabsolute, a story to be told later. In the meantime, let\u2019s talk about what he did before then.\n\nOkpala opens up about a phenomenal change that a Kanye West song gave him in 2016 during a challenging time.\n\n\u201cThere was a part in the song, titled \u2018Waves\u2019, that felt like somebody was gasping for air,\u201d he pauses to imitate a beat, \u201cand that particular part of the song felt like it was me trying to find expression for something inside me that there were no words for.\u201d\n\nAnd the song helped him break out of what he would later get to know was depression.\n\nBefore officially becoming a journalist with Lagos-based online news and entertainment company, thenet.ng in September 2017, Okpala reviewed songs on his YouTube channel. He often criticised people\u2019s works, holding strong opinions, which he says have become more objective.\n\n\u201cI have always done my thing on YouTube. Documenting music, doing album breakdowns and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nBut his issue with the lack of storytelling in music rollout lingered in his mind.\n\nWhile working as a reporter, he felt something was missing, and the void needed to be filled. Okpala decided he had to be more active than just writing about music. So, he took a bold step; at that point, he had made quite a name for himself on the entertainment reporting scene.\n\nFor his first shot, he handled a project by Seyi Shay called Electric Package. He happened to be at the album listening event, where he approached her former manager, Kamal Ajiboye, offering to help them do better. He weaved a story around the EP\u2019s release and rolled it out with a mini-documentary that formed the backstory.\n\nThe success of the project gave him the clarity he had always looked for.\n\n\u201cThat was how I knew that what I was going to do next was to run a communications agency.\u201d\n\nIn May 2019, he resigned and founded Nabsolute in July. Nabsolute is coined from the phrase, \u2018Not a Basic Solution\u2019, which he lived by while conceptualising what else to do. So far, the company has acquired notable clients like Runtown, Ycee, Reekado Banks, Skales, Darey Art Alade, K1 De Ultimate, among others.\n\nDespite the success recorded with Nabsolute, Okpala doesn\u2019t expect SpinHeard to be a walk in the park. And, in figuring out how to get things done, he and his team will make peace with the outcome.\n\nSo, fingers crossed. What do you think about this product?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest , a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\neNaira and private blockchains\n\nGoogle\u2019s $1b plan for Africa\n\nChari\u2019s $5m seed raise\n\nThe eNaira dilemma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Central Bank of Nigeria revealed its plans to launch eNaira on October 1, 2021, it also said it would be using a private blockchain \u2014 The Hyperledger Fabric.\n\nBut, here\u2019s the thing, a private blockchain means there\u2019s no room for transparency. And although blockchain is known for its security and decentralisation, when it\u2019s private, whoever is in control of it can manipulate records.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy not use a public blockchain? That could work, of course, but that would mean sacrificing speed, amongst other things.\n\nWhat would a private blockchain entail for the eNaira? Are there alternatives?\n\nThese questions and more have been answered. Click here: eNaira: How much control does a private blockchain give the CBN?\n\nGoogle plans to invest $1b towards a digital Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, October 6, 2021, Google announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Africa to support digital transformation in the next five years.\n\nThe announcement was made by Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s CEO, at the company\u2019s first-ever Google for Africa event.\n\nHow will it happen? Well, the money will be distributed across different sectors \u2014 including eCommerce and telecommunications \u2014 with Google partnering with other African companies as well.\n\nFor example, a subsea cable dubbed Equiano would be built to enable affordable Internet access. It would run through South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria, and St Helena to connect the continent with Europe. A Device Financing plan would also be implemented.\n\nDevice Financing? Yes. Google says affordable Internet is good, but in the grand scheme of things, being able to buy cheap data would mean nothing if you can\u2019t afford a phone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, free iPhones? Well, it\u2019s definitely going to be Androids, but I wouldn\u2019t bank on something fancy. However, the Device Financing plan will be in partnership with Safaricom and will start in Kenya.\n\nIt will be expanded across other parts of Africa through partners including Airtel, M-KOPA, MTN, and Orange. According to Google, \u201cThese partnerships will help millions of first-time smartphone users gain access to quality, affordable Android smartphones.\u201d\n\nAnything else? Google plans to launch the Africa Investment Fund to invest $50 million in African startups. It will also be providing $10 million in low-interest loans to help small businesses and entrepreneurs.\n\nNon- profits solving different challenges in African communities will also receive $40 million to keep up the good work.\n\nSo, why the generosity? \ud83e\udd14 According to Pichai, the company wants to make \u201cthe Internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African.\u201d\n\nHowever, we\u2019ve seen companies like Facebook investing in providing Africa with better Internet with its 2Africa subsea Internet cable, but with Africa\u2019s projected population of 2.2 billion by 2045, are these acts of kindness just investment in potential customers?\n\nOur Senior Reporter, Emmanuel Paul, gives a detailed analysis on the subsea Internet cable here: With its massive subsea Internet cable, Google says it\u2019s playing the long game in Africa\n\nChari closes $5m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChari Co-Founder. (L-R) Sophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat. Source: Supplied\n\nMoroccan B2B eCommerce startup, Chari, has announced the close of a $5 million seed at a $70 million valuation to expand into more African countries.\n\nThe seed funding saw investments from Rocket Internet, Plug and Play, Y Combinator, and Orange Ventures, among others.\n\nWhat does Chari do? The startup is digitising the distribution of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) from local manufacturers to local mom and pop stores.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Sophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat, the duo got the idea for Chari during a trip to understand how FMCG worked in sub-Saharan Africa. They discovered how hard it was for mom and pop stores to get their products and decided to make things easier.\n\nPer TechCrunch, small shops order products via the startup\u2019s mobile app and receive them in less than 24 hours.\n\nIt also partners with FMCG Multinationals like American Consumer Goods company, Procter & Gamble (P&G), giving exclusive access to some products.\n\nAccording to Belkhayat, \u201cP&G works with Chari exclusively. So in case any other player wants to sell P&G products, either they have to go through Chari, or they have to buy the goods from the supermarket,\u201d\n\neCommerce in North Africa: eCommerce startups in the region have been on the radar of investors for some time now. We\u2019ve seen massive funding and acquisitions like MaxAB\u2019s $40 million funding and its purchase of WaystoCap\n\nChari plans to expand into Francophone Africa and offer more financial services.

          "text": "Africa\u2019s film industry could contribute $20 billion to the continent\u2019s revenue and also employ 20 million Africans but its potentials remain untapped, according to a report by UNESCO.\n\nAfrican countries have some of the highest unemployment rates in the world with South Africa and Namibia rank the highest with 34.4 percent and 33.4 respectively while Nigeria ranks third-highest with the unemployment rate at 33.3 percent.\n\nDespite its huge potentials, piracy, limitations on freedom of expression, and poor internet connectivity continue to hinder growth.\n\nAccording to the report, Africa is the most underserved continent in terms of movie theatres. Currently, there is only one cinema screen per 787,402 people.\n\nMost creative industries in Africa are grossly underserved, in part due to the failure of policymakers and local authorities to protect and invest in audio-visual industries, the report stated.\n\nThe UNESCO report estimates that 50 percent to over 75 percent of revenue is lost to piracy, though precise data does not exist. Additionally, just 19 out of 54 African countries offer financial support to filmmakers.\n\n\u201cAfrica\u2019s potential as a film powerhouse remains largely untapped, despite significant growth in production across the continent, the report argues. Nigeria alone produces around 2,500 films a year,\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s Nollywood is the second largest film producer globally in terms of value, number of annual films, revenue, and popularity, second only to India\u2019s Bollywood.\n\nThe industry\u2019s radical growth in movie production occurred in 2020 when the pandemic hit and cinemas were shut.\n\nRead also: Nigerian film industry can produce content of global quality- Ihidero\n\nNollywood produced 635 movies in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 626 movies produced in the same period last year. Its growth in Q2 is the highest compared to the same period in previous years.\n\nThe sector has been identified as one of the priority sectors in the 2017 2020 Economic Recovery and Growth plan because it represents a potential growth driver for the economy. However, its growth has been limited by piracy\n\n\u201cPiracy tops the list of film industry\u2019s many challenges fuelled by weak enforcement of Nigeria\u2019s copyright law. In the digital era of today, piracy has morphed into illegal download and distribution of movies without paying for them. Other challenges include lack of financing, poor infrastructure, and inadequate capacity,\u201d analysts at FBNQuest said.\n\nErnesto Ottone, Unesco\u2019s assistant director-general for culture also explained that a significant concern was that much of the money generated by African film industries do not go back into local economies, the report said. Two-thirds of African countries acknowledged that more than half of the proceeds were lost to illegal avenues such as piracy. \u201cCreatives do not receive copyright payment in return for their work. There needs to be much stronger legislation,\u201d he said.\n\n30 of Africa\u2019s 54 countries lacked national film commissions or recognized audio-visual institutions that can champion creatives and fair usage rules, the report said, making reforms hard to achieve.\n\nThe report outlines further challenges in the African film industry, including limitations on freedom of expression, as well as education, training, and internet connectivity.\n\nUnesco\u2019s director-general Audrey Azoulay said in the report, \u201cWe need to strengthen international cooperation to enable film-makers of all countries to express themselves and develop viable and competitive cultural and creative industries.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must raise our voice to reaffirm that films are indeed \u2018public goods\u2019 that require public support and investment to ensure equal access to creation, production, distribution, dissemination, and consumption,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "Nigeria is faced with the risk of recording the biggest budget deficit in its history next year if actual revenues continue at the run rate of the past five years, BusinessDay\u2019s analysis of budget implementation data shows.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari in his budget proposal to lawmakers on Thursday said the Federal Government was targeting revenues of N10.13 trillion and a deficit of N6.258 trillion in 2022.\n\nHowever, if actual revenues look anything like what they have consistently done in the past five years, which is 55 percent of the budget on average, then Nigeria could be left with only N5.57 trillion in revenues. That then leaves Abuja with a deficit of N10.82 trillion, the highest ever and equivalent to a full year\u2019s entire budget. The budget for 2020 for instance was N10.8 trillion.\n\n\u201cNigeria is treading on a dangerous path with the continued rise in deficit which will eclipse the target in the budget given the unrealistic target set for 2022,\u201d Ayodeji Ebo, an economist and head of retail investment at Lagos-based Chapel Hill Denham said.\n\n\u201cWe need to cut down on non-debt recurrent expenditure and find more creative ways to increase revenues to suppress the deficit, otherwise Nigeria\u2019s economic situation will get worse and there will be little or nothing left for critical capital expenditure,\u201d Ebo said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s non-debt recurrent expenditure is however not slowing down, at least not next year.\n\nBuhari revealed plans on Thursday to spend as much as N6.83 trillion on non-debt recurrent expenditure, which includes personnel costs and overhead, in 2022, 41.7 percent of the total budget.\n\nThat\u2019s the single largest expenditure item in the budget and equates to double of Nigeria\u2019s total revenue in 2020.\n\nThe figure is also higher than the N5.35 trillion budgeted for capital expenditure and debt service of N3.61 trillion.\n\nRead Also: Buhari\u2019s 2022 budget proposal in 5 insightful numbers\n\n\u201cThe budget for non-debt recurrent expenditure throws up concerns over the high cost of governance in Nigeria,\u201d a consultant for one of the big four consulting firms told BusinessDay on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak on the matter.\n\n\u201cA developing country with the limited resources Nigeria has should never spend the bulk of its budget on salaries and overhead costs when there are huge infrastructural gaps waiting to be addressed,\u201d the person said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s poor revenue performance has made analysts criticise the government for raising the bar each year despite obvious challenges in attaining revenue targets. Unrealistic revenue targets have often left the country with a much bigger deficit than planned.\n\nThe Federal Government of Nigeria spent N6.17 trillion more than it earned in 2020, leaving its fiscal deficit at 4 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) \u2013 the highest in 21 years, according to Central Bank data analysed by BusinessDay.\n\nThe fiscal deficit, which is the difference between expenditure and revenue, widened to 6.1 percent of GDP in the first quarter of 2021, with analysts projecting 5 percent by year-end.\n\nNigeria\u2019s ever rising fiscal deficit is yet another sign of the government\u2019s ailing finances and makes a mockery of Abuja\u2019s insistence to continue with a wasteful petrol subsidy regime that gulps north of a trillion naira per annum among other overly expensive ventures of a supposedly cash-strapped government.\n\nThe government has often resorted to borrowing to plug its fiscal deficit and the trend seems set to continue in 2022 even though the impact of the borrowings which have increased by over N20 trillion since 2015 has been negligible on an economy that has failed to grow in per capita terms since the same 2015.\n\nIn the N16.39 trillion budget proposal made by Buhari to lawmakers on Thursday, oil revenue is projected at N3.16 trillion, making it the single largest source of expected revenue for 2022, a 57.7 percent increase from the N2.01 trillion that was budgeted for this year (2021).\n\nNon-oil revenues are estimated to rake in N2.13 trillion, up from N1.49 trillion in 2021 while independent revenues are projected to contribute N1.82 trillion.\n\nOil revenues took a beating in 2020 amid low oil prices and Buhari said in his presentation that lower than planned oil revenues were mainly responsible for actual revenues trailing the budget by 34 percent in the first six months of 2021.\n\nOil revenues may struggle yet again next year if Nigeria\u2019s production challenges linger and the expensive petrol subsidy continues to erase the gains of higher oil prices.\n\nThe budget proposal is predicated on an oil price of $57 per barrel and daily oil production of 1.88 million barrels a day. This includes condensates of 300,000 to 400,000 daily.\n\nNon-oil revenues, which are dominated by taxes, will also suffer if economic activity does not improve substantially, according to Muda Yusuf, the former director-general of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), one of Nigeria\u2019s oldest private sector advocacy group.\n\n\u201cTaxes are a reflection of company profits and that in itself is a reflection of sales and revenues which is determined by economic activity, so the government must find ways to support the private sector to thrive if it is serious about recouping that much from taxes,\u201d Yusuf said.\n\nThe government\u2019s projected GDP growth rate for 2022 is 4.2 percent, a growth that if achieved will be Nigeria\u2019s highest GDP growth in eight years.\n\nThe projection is more optimistic than that of the International Monetary Fund which expects the economy to post 2.6 percent growth in 2022.\n\nNigeria is also yet again expecting money (N63.38 billion) to come from Grants and Aid despite receiving nothing from this source since 2018, according to budget implementation reports available on the website of the finance ministry.\n\nIt is, however, a significant markdown from the N354.82 billion budgeted in 2021, which as at July had fetched nothing.\n\nThe total revenue available to fund the 2022 federal budget is estimated at N10.13 trillion and it includes the revenues of 63 government-owned enterprises as well as Grants and Aid.",

          "title": "Lagos airport users lament unfair car towing",
          "text": "What the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) intended to be an enforcement of its regulation against illegal parking of vehicles within the Lagos airport precincts is progressively becoming a money-making enterprise, according to some airport users who spoke to BusinessDay.\n\n\u201cRather than the pursuit of the goal to ensure safety and sanity around the airport, the enforcement is now being carried out with the sole aim to extort vehicles owners.\n\n\u201cNo day passes by without unsuspecting motorists falling prey to vehicle towing operators who lurk around the airport to milk their victims,\u201d said Joy Oge, who recently fell a victim.\n\nFindings by BusinessDay show that the vehicle towing agents hide at strategic places for their target, many who have no idea where to park or drop off travellers, as there are no clear signs showing restricted areas for parking or waiting.\n\nThe target is immediately surrounded by people who look more like \u2018thugs\u2019 and his or her car towed to a secluded area where they are forced to pay between N10,000 and N40,000 for what is termed \u2018wrong parking.\u2019 The same treatment is meted out on drivers whose vehicles breakdown within the airport.\n\nRead Also: System outages delay passengers\u2019 check-in at Lagos airport\n\nAviation stakeholders told BusinessDay that the modus operandi of the towing vehicle operators contravenes airport regulations, as they are not properly kitted.\n\nChecks by BusinessDay show that the agents operate with dilapidated vehicles not befitting of an airport environment.\n\nSome of the vehicles used to carry out these operations do not have tracking numbers or owner contact details. They also do not have logos that distinguish one towing vehicle from another.\n\nAccording to Oge, on Friday, October 1, 2021, she drove to MMA2, Lagos local terminal to pick her husband. As she approached the terminal, there was traffic as a result of those picking up and dropping off passengers.\n\nShe said her husband sighted her vehicle which was already close to him and he entered the vehicle while in traffic.\n\nOge said she was shocked to see people who looked like \u2018thugs\u2019 forcefully entering her car, while the others locked the tyres of the car to stop her from moving.\n\nWhen asked what her offence was, the tow operators said she was not supposed to pick a passenger at the spot, despite the obvious gridlock.\n\n\u201cThey towed my car and told us to pay N40,000 to have it released to us. We eventually asked for a point-of-sale (POS) machine to make payment but they insisted on cash.\n\n\u201cAfter much contention, they reluctantly brought out the POS machine and we made payment. We later asked other people who had their vehicles towed the same day and they told us they paid lower. Some people paid N10,000, some N15,000 and some N25,000. They insisted they would collect cash from almost everyone, which means the money won\u2019t be remitted to the airport authority,\u201d Oge said.\n\nSeyi Adewale, another frequent airport user, also narrated his ordeal:\n\n\u201cOn a specific day, I had an urgent telephone call and I needed time, so I parked in front of ASL Catering. They swooped on me, jumped around my vehicle tyre and if I had moved the car, I would have crushed the intruder.\n\n\u201cHowever, the other team members around six of them asked why I parked. I explained that I needed to pick an urgent call and besides I\u2019m not on the road but parked within the entrance access area of ASL Catering.\n\n\u201cThey insisted I must pay since I had no plans to drive into the ASL compound. I was too upset to argue or protest and I agreed to pay especially when I suspected that some of them were high on a \u2018substance\u2019 or liquor,\u201d Adewale explained.\n\nTayo Ojuri, an aviation consultant and managing partner, Aglow Aviation Support Services Limited told BusinessDay that every day, he gets calls from people complaining that their vehicles were towed.\n\n\u201cThe airport authority has given tow operators target to remit a certain amount of money monthly. It has become a money-making venture for them as everyone is trying to take advantage of the system,\u201d Ojuri said.\n\nAlso, Olumide Ohunayo, an aviation analyst said there has been an issue of high-handedness on the part of towing vehicle operators both at the local and international airport and the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, (FAAN) ought to have acted concerning these tow operators.\n\nOhunayo, who described the operators as \u2018motor park thugs\u2019 said their activities needed to be reviewed. \u201cAlso the quality of vehicles being used and paraded by these concessionaires for the airport vicinity is not up to standard,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said that there was a law that allows people to park if you need to make a phone call.\n\n\u201cRather than operate according to the ethos of road safety, airport tow operators are only interested in squeezing money from passengers. Hence, any little breakdown or stop, they just jump at the vehicle. It is not professional. They need to read out the dos and don\u2019ts for airport users and tow operators. There should be appropriate rules and regulations,\u201d he added.\n\nHenrietta Yakubu, the general manager, corporate communications FAAN, said the authority has had various complaints concerning these people and recently invited the owners of the towing companies for a discussion.\n\n\u201cThe MD of FAAN spoke to them on the need to deploy a different approach in carrying out their duties. Customer service has also brought them in for training, yet we still get complaints,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nShe assured that FAAN will look into the various complaints received and address the issue once and for all.",

But the first thing I did was to call my manager because this person is asking for money.\n\n\u201c I\u2019m not gonna have somebody blackmail for doing something that is natural.\u201d\n\nThe sex tape, which raises concerns for Tiwa, is coming at a time when she\u2019s at the peak of her career and willing to own the narrative.\n\n\u2018\u2018For me, it\u2019s like why now, when the music is so good, I\u2019ve grown. Nobody wants that of them, it\u2019s so embarrassing, like for my fans, family, and friends,\u201d she said.\n\nThe singer, who would be releasing the video of her smash hit, \u201cSomebody\u2019s Son\u201d featuring American singer Brandy, on Tuesday also encouraged her fans who would like to protect her and defend her to \u2018let it go\u201d.\n\nTiwa also disclosed that she has over 13 million followers with whom she is very open with and she shares an impeccable relationship with her fans.\n\nCareer\n\nAs Tems and Wizkid\u2019s \u2018Essence\u2019 continue to dominate the American Billboard charts, Tiwa hinted that the Billboard should look out for more Nigerian artistes, whose music is paving ways for Afro-beat music.\n\nShe mentioned the likes of \u2018Omale,\u2019 \u2018Fireboy\u2019, \u2018Tems\u2019 and \u2018Ayra Starr\u2019, as young Nigerian artistes the would evolve and set the pace for Afrobeat in America.\n\nSpeaking about her collaboration with American Artiste, Brandy Norwood, on her hit song Somebody\u2019s son\u2019, which Angie described as an \u201cunexpected interesting collaboration\u201d, Tiwa described her love for the legendary American music star, Brandy, as her inspiration.\n\nTiwa said, \u201cThe love is an understatement, every interview I\u2019ve ever been to, the name keeps coming up. She is the only one I have always wanted to do this with. She is the reason why I really started singing. I\u2019m obsessed with Brandy.\u201d\n\nEarly music career\n\nWhen quizzed about how long she had been singing, Tiwa noted that she began her career as a background vocalist.\n\nShe said, \u201cI started doing background vocals for George Micheals and Mary Blige. That was my introduction to the game. I was like 16, I was a baby, with a beautiful voice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was confident because I didn\u2019t have pressure from the industry, I was just doing me, basically having fun and getting paid to do it\u201d.\n\nShe also said her African parents didn\u2019t want her to sing. They insisted that she must go to school.\n\n\u2018\u2018My African parents were like, you have to study. I was lucky, I studied music. It was a scholarship at Berklee College of music,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, the mother-of-one, said she would not let her son, Jamil Balogun, become an artiste. In her words, \u201cThere is a dark side for being in the limelight and I don\u2019t want him to go through it.\u201d\n\nUpon graduating, she said she began writing songs for American musician Monica and other singers, but in 2010, she decided to return to Nigeria.\n\nOn her future plans, Tiwa said she hopes to be in the American Grammy Superbowl in the next decade.",

General Onyema Nwachukwu, on Thursday, denied assaulting him.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cTroops of Nigerian Army(NA) have arrested one Chiwetalu Agu while inciting members of the public and soliciting for support for the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Dressed in a very well known attire of the proscribed group, Chiwetalu Agu was picked up for questioning while inciting members of the public to join the proscribed group. Though he attempted puting up some resistance when troops made effort to take him into custody, he was not assaulted or subjected to brutalization.\n\n\u201cWhile the NA recognizes the inalienable rights of the citizenry to freedom of movement and expression as enshrined in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, it is apparently a violation for any individual or group to incite the public to cause mayhem or break down of law and order. It is therefore pertinent to state that while exercising such freedoms, it must be done within the confines of the law, bearing in mind the imperative for peace, and national security.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt and emphasis, the Indigenous People of Biafra(IPOB) remains proscribed . Therefore, any individual or group seen to be projecting and advancing the cause or activities of the group is viewed as brazenly challenging the constitutionality of Federal Republic of Nigeria. More worrisome, was the fact that considering the prevailing security situation of the region, coupled with the ongoing Exercise GOLDEN DAWN , his action could be a tacit endorsement and support for the proscribed group. We have all witnessed the activities of the group take a violent dimension in recent times.\n\n\u201cChinwetalu Agu has clearly demonstrated uncharitable disposition to negate peace and security in the region, hence, he is taken into custody for preliminary investigation. It is important to once again place on record that the allegation that he was brutalized is false and should be disregarded accordingly.\n\n\u201cWhile the NA would not allow IPOB and its sponsors to hold the region captive and allow the security situation to degenerate, it is instructive to restate that national interest supercedes any parochial consideration. Individuals or groups who fan the embers of violence are warned to desist or face the consequences of their actions. The ongoing Exercises are on course and will rid the region of all forms of criminality.\n\n\u201cThe peace loving and law abiding people of the South East are enjoined to please go about their normal activities, as efforts are ongoing to bring perpetrators of violence to book. They are equally urged to continue to support the security agencies to restore normalcy to the region in furtherance of peace.\u201d",

          "text": "PETER OKORE, Umuahia\n\nThe Abia State chapter of Nigerian Institute of Architects (NIA), has affirmed that the greatest hindrance to building well in Nigeria is the neglect of professionals in handling building development schemes.\n\nThis is even as the stakeholders, comprising Surveyors, Architects, Town Planners, Engineers, among others, suggested that to achieve better Urban future, all the professions in the Built Environment must be allowed to play their roles optimally.\n\nThese are contained in an address presented at the 2021 Architects Forum held in Umuahia, Abia capital with the theme: \u201cTowards A Better Urban Future: How To Build Well.\u201d\n\nArc. Anagha Ndukwo Anagha, Chairman Abia State chapter of Nigerian Institute of Architects, in his presentation, decried the alarming rate of quack -practices in the industry, both in the private and public sector, which has resulted in incessant building collapses and an avalanche of failed buildings.\n\nArc. Anagha maintained that building well remains the fulcrum for achieving a better urban future.\n\nSaid he: \u201cOwing to the peculiar circumstances of our Urban Environment, we carefully chose this theme to continue the discourse commenced last year. Last year\u2019s Forum highlighted the peculiar problems facing the built environment in our urban cities, and zeroed on necessary measures to solve the problem of incessant building collapse.\n\n\u201cThere is an alarming rate of quack practices in the industry both in the private and public sector, thus resulting into the incessant building collapses noticed everywhere, and an avalanche of failed buildings, which is even more dangerous. This is however, a silent killer that very often remains unnoticed by its prospective victims.\u201d\n\nAnagha expressed optimism that the forum would lay the foundations for a better understanding of how to build well within Abia State in particular and in the Nation at large, adding, \u201cIt is also our expectation that potential developers and building occupants would have been taught the need to involve the relevant Built Environment Professionals at every stage of the building development process, from conceptualization to implementation as well as post construction stages.\u201d\n\nIn his keynote address titled, \u201cTowards A Better Urban Future: How To Build Well\u201d, the Medical Director, Federal Medical Center (FMC) Umuahia, Prof. Azubuike Onyebuchi, pointed out that the present day urban centre is bedeviled with urban sprawl; individual control/small parcels of land; housing affordability; climate change; water and sanitation; consumption/ misuse of public spaces; air quality and housing; poor planning of our present urban; abuse/neglect to standard practices and poor regulatory framework.\n\nHe described the theme of the forum as a wake up call to all and sundry, especially the Policy Makers and the indolent in building industry, advising that planning and design creation should consider sustainable and affordable housing; green roofs; sustainable transportation: balloon technology; energy efficiency among others, which according to him are the engine room of securing better urban future.\n\nThe former National President, Nigerian Institute of Town Planners (NITP), Mr. Lekwa Ezutah in his speech, called for a convocation of the seven professions in the Built Environment to interact and ensure that each body is allowed to play its role to give the society the best; and ensure that all the problems in the Built Environment is minimized.\n\nIn a brief speech, the Chairman of the occasion and NIA Abia State chapter Chairman, Education Committee, Dr. Eneogwe Innocent encouraged student- architects to always identify with the Institute to get exposed and be better equipped for the task ahead and to make Nigeria great by embracing the high sense of professionalism.\n\nMeanwhile, the NIA President, Mr.Sonny Echono whose address was read by the NIA Chairman Disciplinary Committee, Mba Aja, advised that the natural green areas in \u201cour cities must be protected and properly maintained to enable the cities regenerate more efficiently and sustainably.\u201d\n\nHis words, \u201cAs we continue to see the adverse consequences of climate change worsen by the years, it is becoming quite obvious that as Architects responses to them must take centre- stage. Renewable energy must be incorporated into mainstream Architecture, while ensuring that our buildings are designed to be more environmentally friendly and energy efficient. On its part, Government must support the push to a zero-emission world as a matter of urgent priority; while we of the Nigerian Institute of Architects will through our Climate Action and Sustainable Development Initiatives, support Government by proposing practical solutions in infrastructure and housing for immediate implementation in the battle against Climate change.\u201d",

It stems from our avowed and determined quest to transform sports and youth development in our State.\n\n\u201cFrom time immemorial, sports have been used to establish ties and build camaraderie among people all over the world. In line with this time-tested objective, we are employing sports to preach and spread the messages of love, unity, hope and development so that we can continue to sustain our status as the most peaceful State in the country and achieve our goal of transforming our socioeconomic development.\n\n\u201cSport stands as the cornerstone of our proud heritage and shares unmistakable attributes with our way of life. It has accorded us an avenue to display our creativity and stimulate perseverance, diligence and strong sense of commitment among our people. It has also underscored our belief that sport is a potent instrument for building character.\n\n\u201cAs you already know, sports development is one of the major ways to harness and empower our teeming youths. This festival has therefore provided the opportunity not only to engage our youths productively, but to also harness their latent potential for productive engagement.\n\n\u201cI wish to emphasise here that the aim of this project is to institute the State Policy on Sports as enshrined in the State Youth Policy.\n\n\u201cTo achieve the above objective, we have put this together to discover hidden talents in various sports in our Local Government Areas, harness and groom them to stardom. This will eventually boost the performance of the State athletes at various national and international competitions.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Commissioner for Youth and Sport, Yemi Lawal had lauded the avowed commitment of Governor Oyetola to youth development in the State.\n\nLawal who described youths as the most energetic and productive segment of the population, praised the Administration for investing tremendously in the sector, saying, \u201cIt has been the focus of the present Administration under the leadership of our able and dynamic Governor to develop sports at the grassroots.\n\n\u201cWe recognise the support of our dear Governor, who feels nothing is impossible to accomplish. Naturally no one believed that this was possible, but it is his belief in us that led us to where we are today.\n\n\u201cSome of the efforts and prompt interventions of the Governor Oyetola-led Administration to turn around the sector are: appointment of 42 Local Government Sports Coordinators, including the Zonal and State Coordinators for a robust coordination of sports at the grassroot; approval and funding of state participation at various sports competitions, including the just-concluded 20th National Sports Festival held in Edo State, \u201cEDO 2020\u2033, despite all the postponements; approval of the compositions and appointments into various Sports Associations in the state; financing the two state teams of Osun United and Osun Babes Football Clubs in their different league; and fencing and renovation of Osogbo City stadium; amongst others.\u201d\n\nAt the finals of the football competition, Ejigbo Local Government Area Football Club won the tournament and secured the trophy by 4-1 against Ife-East Local Government Area Football Club.\n\nOther winners in the other sporting activities were also honoured and rewarded.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has budgeted over N5.1 trillion to service stolen funds that have plunged the country into debts, according to Hon. Mohammed Gudaji Kazaure, who represents the Kazaure/Roni/Gwiwa/Yankwashi Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives.\n\nHe bemoaned the fact that the bar in the fight against corruption has been reduced, with those who stole cash fleeing only for the country to pay off debts at the expense of ordinary people.\n\nThe lawmaker from Jigawa, who is a member of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), believes that the country\u2019s \u201cdebts\u201d are actually stolen cash, and that the Buhari administration should chase stolen funds and assets stored overseas and reclaim them for the country.\n\nOn the fringes of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s presentation of the N16.4 trillion budget for 2022 to the joint sessions of the National Assembly lawmakers on Thursday, he spoke with journalists.\n\n\u201cNigerian money was looted and buried like dead bodies in the grave, some people have stashed the money abroad. Why can\u2019t government constitute a strong investigative and interrogative Committee to call back these people?\n\n\u201cWe have to stop borrowing because we don\u2019t know tomorrow and that is my concern. For example, the former female Petroleum Minister in the administration of President Goodluck Jonathan went away with the sum of $60 billion. This is about five years Nigerian budget.\n\n\u201cIf there is real investigation by this government, there are thousands of them and when we investigate, we can spend the next 20 years without borrowing. We will implement budget with our recovered money.\n\n\u201cSeriously, this government said, they are fighting corruption, but as a lawmaker, I never see the corruption fight because we say we are fighting corruption and we are slow and not acting. If there is strong investigation and interrogation in this country, I am sure we will not borrow money to service debts.\n\n\u201cSadly, the issue of revenue which they said has gone down; the oil which has gone down in many countries of the world and if we remember in this country before oil was discovered, Nigeria was generating revenue from agriculture. Money generated through cotton and groundnut was used to discover and develop oil and later, agriculture was abandoned.\n\n\u201cLook at our teeming youths roaming about, jobless. Look at our forests currently inhabited by criminals which should have been cleared and used for farming by our teeming youths. If we can do this across the six geopolitical zones, I am sure the nation will have money better than oil. We could fund the budget without borrowing.\n\n\u201cBut, most embarrassing is debt servicing which was reflected in the 2022 budget. We are servicing debt of monies stolen. Nigeria citizens never enjoyed the money which we are paying as debts.\n\n\u201cThe money that was supposed to be invested in education, railways, health, security and other critical infrastructure would be used to service debts in 2022. The debt that are in individual\u2019s pockets.\n\n\u201cGo round the country, and see the type of buildings some privileged persons and government officials are living and they said, they\u2019re fighting corruption. Go to Maitama in Abuja, Lagos, Port harcourt, you will see people living in mansion and they are government officials.\n\n\u201cDid they acquire mansions with their salaries and we said we are fighting corruption? If we are really fighting corruption, we will not borrow money. It\u2019s embarrassing\u201d, he concluded.",

SARS is gone for good and will not resurrect under any guise whatsoever.\n\n\u201cThe IGP notes that the Force has since reorganized its operational structure to fill the vacuum created by the disbandment of SARS.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the leadership of the Force is focused on efforts at deepening reforms within the Police and bequeathing Nigerians a Police Force that will be more effective, efficient, technology-driven, humane and Rule of Law-compliant.\u201d\n\nLast October, there were massive protests in some states tagged #EndSARS, largely organised by youths, to call for an end to police brutality.\n\nThey also demanded that SARS, a police unit, notorious for human rights abuses, extrajudicial killings, and other atrocities should be disbanded.\n\nBut during the protests against police brutality, the Nigeria police unleashed more terror on peaceful protesters in many parts of the country, including at the Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos, the epicentre of the struggle.\n\nThe repressive regime of Muhammadu Buhari was thereafter forced to disband SARS.\n\nIt thereafter introduced the Special Weapons and Tactics Team, which many Nigerians described as not different from the disbanded SARS.",

This critical and practical initiative will also tackle the challenges of inconsistent and inadequate food supply to persons of concern. It will address their fundamental needs in terms of sustainable and timely provision of food and non-food items, whilst eliminating waste observed in previous distribution processes to persons of concern.\n\n\u201cI also commend the Honourable Federal Commissioner and her team for their efforts in developing this Project. I see that much has been done through partnerships with critical stakeholders for appropriate support to mobilize and deploy resources to provide a pedestal of success for the Project Zero Hunger Initiative.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of our persons of concern, I hereby launch Project Zero Hunger and pray that it positively impacts on the lives of the intended beneficiaries.\u201d",

It is therefore important to make clarifications regarding the air interdiction mission conducted in the general area. For the records, it is pertinent to state that the Air Component of Operation HADIN KAI on 26 September 2021, acting on credible actionable intelligence on the activities of terrorists in an identified ISWAP Camp at the said location, conducted air strikes on the target.\n\n\u201cThis was after careful Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance missions revealed the activities of ISWAP elements in the location. Consequently, the intelligence gathered was processed and carefully analyzed between the period of 19 August and 23 September 2021. Persons wearing combat vests and uniforms identified as ISWAP-styled uniforms were seen within the camp. Furthermore, neither women nor children were noticed in or around the camp, just as no fishing activities were seen. Instead, canoes loaded with unidentified items were seen parked but not engaged in any fishing activity, an indication that they were to be ferried to another location. Having carefully ascertained that nearby civilian settlements were not in the line of fire and a precision strike would disrupt ISWAP logistics movement and neutralize them; a decision was made to conduct a strike on the ISWAP camp. Although casualty figures could not be ascertained, the strike was verified to be successful in disrupting ISWAP logistics movement and foot soldiers\u201d.\n\nThe statement added that, \u201cIt is important to state that the location is a well-known ISWAP enclave and there is an existing ban on fishing activities within the area. Additionally, the general area is known as a gateway for movement of logistics by ISWAP elements especially from Kirta and Wulgo locations. Therefore, the Nigerian Military wishes to state categorically that necessary steps were taken to ensure that the presence of the terrorists was ascertained and the strike was precise and professionally executed\u201d.\n\nThe Military High Command said it will continue to ensure that its troops safe guard lives and properties of innocent citizens.\n\nWhile appreciating the general public for their continuous support, the High Command further encouraged all to avail the military with credible and timely information that will facilitate its proactive engagements in the fight against terrorism.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday proposed a total budget of N16.39 trillion for the year 2022 to the National Assembly.\n\nSpeaking at the assembly chambers, the President tagged the appropriation bill \u201ca Budget of Economic Growth and Sustainability\u201d.\n\nHe said the budget will focus on diversifying the economy, with robust MSME growth; investing in critical infrastructure; strengthening security and ensuring good governance; enabling a vibrant, educated and healthy populace; reducing poverty; and minimizing regional, economic and social disparities.\n\n\u201cDefence and internal security will continue to be our top priority,\u201d the President said. \u201cWe remain firmly committed to the security of life, property and investment nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to ensure that our gallant men and women in the armed forces, police and paramilitary units are properly equipped, remunerated and well-motivated.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that the 2022 budget is the first time in Nigerian history, \u201cwhere MDAs were clearly advised on gender-responsive budgeting.\n\n\u201cThese are part of critical steps in our efforts to distribute resources fairly and reach vulnerable groups of our society,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, said the National Assembly is committed to passing the budget before the end of the year.\n\nRead President Buhari\u2019s full budget speech here:\n\n2022 BUDGET SPEECH\n\nBudget of Economic Growth and Sustainability\n\nDelivered By:\n\nHis Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari\n\nPresident, Federal Republic of Nigeria\n\nAt the Joint Session of the National Assembly, Abuja\n\nThursday, October 7, 2021\n\nPROTOCOLS\n\n1. It is my great pleasure to be here once again to present the 2022 Federal Budget Proposals to this distinguished Joint Session of the National Assembly.\n\n2. Distinguished and Honourable leaders, and members of the National Assembly, let me start by commending you for the expeditious consideration and passage of the Supplementary Appropriation Bill 2021. This further underscores your commitment to our collective efforts to contain the COVID-19 Pandemic and address the various security challenges facing our country.\n\n3. I will also take this opportunity to thank you for the quick consideration and approval of the 2022-2024 Medium-term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper. Our hope is that National Assembly will continue to partner with the Executive by ensuring that deliberations on the 2022 Budget are completed before the end of this year so that the Appropriation Act can come into effect by the first of January 2022.\n\n4. The 2022 Budget will be the last full year budget to be implemented by this administration. We designed it to build on the achievements of previous budgets and to deliver on our goals and aspirations as will be reflected in our soon-to-be launched National Development Plan of 2021 to 2025.\n\n5. Distinguished Senators and Honourable Members, in normal times, I make use of this opportunity to provide an overview of global and domestic developments in the current year, a summary of our achievements, and our plans for the next fiscal year.\n\n6. However, these are exceptional times. The grim realities of COVID-19 and its lethal variants are still upon us. From President to Pauper, the virus does not discriminate.\n\n7. This is why our country still maintains its COVID -19 guidelines and protocols in place to protect its citizens and stop the spread of this disease.\n\n8. Over the past few days, we have consulted with the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 and the leadership of the National Assembly on how best to present the 2022 budget proposal keeping in mind the deep-rooted traditions in place and the guidelines for safe mass gatherings.\n\n9. We ultimately decided that the most responsible and respectful approach was to hold a shorter than usual gathering while allowing the Honourable Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning to provide fuller details of our proposals in a smaller event.\n\n10. I am sure many of you will be relieved as my last budget speech in October 2020 lasted over fifty minutes.\n\n11. Still, over the next few minutes, I will provide key highlights of our 2021 performance as well as our proposals for 2022.\n\nPERFORMANCE OF THE 2021 BUDGET\n\n12. The 2021 \u2018Budget of Economic Recovery and Resilience\u2019 is based on a benchmark oil price of 40 US Dollars per barrel, oil production of 1.6m b/d, and exchange rate of 379 Naira to US Dollar. Furthermore, a Supplementary budget of 982.73 billion Naira was recently enacted to address exigent issues in the Security and Health sectors.\n\n13. Based on the 2021 Fiscal Framework, total revenue of 8.12 trillion Naira was projected to fund aggregate federal expenditure of 14.57 trillion Naira (inclusive of the supplementary budget). The projected fiscal deficit of 6.45 trillion Naira, or 4.52 percent of GDP, is expected to be financed mainly by domestic and external borrowings.\n\n14. By July 2021, Nigeria\u2019s daily oil production averaged one 1.70million barrels (inclusive of condensates) and the market price of Bonny Light crude averaged 68.53 US Dollars per barrel.\n\n15. Accordingly, actual revenues were 34 percent below target as of July 2021, mainly due to the underperformance of oil and gas revenue sources. Federal Government\u2019s retained revenues (excluding Government Owned Enterprises) amounted to 2.61 trillion Naira against the proportionate target of 3.95 trillion Naira for the period.\n\n16. The Federal Government\u2019s share of Oil revenue totalled 570.23 billion Naira as of July 2021, which was 51 percent below target, while non-oil tax revenues totalled 964.13 billion Naira. The poor performance of oil revenue relative to the budget was largely due to the shortfall in production as well as significant cost recovery by NNPC to cover the shortfall between its cost of importing petrol and the pump price.\n\n17. The National Assembly will recall that in March 2020 the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency announced that the price of petrol would henceforth be determined by market forces.\n\n18. However, as the combination of rising crude oil prices and exchange rate combined to push the price above the hitherto regulated price of 145 Naira per litre, opposition against the policy of price deregulation hardened on the part of Labour Unions in particular.\n\n19. Government had to suspend further upward price adjustments while engaging Labour on the subject. This petrol subsidy significantly eroded revenues that should have been available to fund the budget.\n\n20. On a positive note, we surpassed the non-oil taxes target by eleven (11) percent in aggregate. The sustained improvement in non-oil taxes indicates that some of our revenue reforms are yielding positive results. We expect further improvement in revenue collections later in the year as more corporate entities file their tax returns and we accelerate the implementation of our revenue reforms.\n\nImproving Revenue Generation and Administration\n\n21. We have stepped up implementation of the strengthened framework for performance management of government owned enterprises (GOEs), with a view to improve their operational efficiencies, revenue generation and accountability. The 50% cost-to-income ratio imposed on the GOEs in the Finance Act 2020 has contributed significantly to rationalizing wasteful expenditures by several GOEs and enhanced the level of operating surpluses to be transferred to the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF). I solicit the cooperation of the National Assembly in enforcing the cost-to-income ratio and other prudential guidelines during your consideration of the budget proposals of the GOEs, which I am also laying before you today.\n\n22. On the expenditure side, as at end of July 2021, a total of six point seven-nine (6.79) trillion Naira had been spent as against the pro-rated expenditure of seven point nine-one (7.91) trillion Naira. Accordingly, a deficit of four point one-seven (4.17) trillion Naira was recorded as at end of July 2021. The deficit was financed through domestic borrowing.\n\n23. Despite our revenue challenges, we have consistently met our debt service commitments. We are also up to date on the payment of staff salaries, statutory transfers, and overhead costs. As at (4th of October 2021, a total of 1.732 trillion Naira had been released for capital expenditure.\n\n24. I am pleased to inform you that we expect to fund MDAs\u2019 capital budget fully by the end of the fiscal year 2021.\n\n25. Capital releases thus far have been prioritised in favour of critical ongoing infrastructural projects in the power, roads, rail, agriculture, health and education sectors.\n\n26. We have made progress on the railway projects connecting different parts of the country. I am glad to report that the Lagos-Ibadan Line is now completed and operational. The Abuja-Kaduna Line is running efficiently. The Itakpe-Ajaokuta rail Line was finally completed and commissioned over thirty (30) years after its initiation.\n\n27. Arrangements are underway to complete the Ibadan-Kano Line. Also, work will soon commence on the Port Harcourt-Maiduguri Line and Calabar-Lagos Coastal Line, which will connect the Southern and Eastern States to themselves and to the North.\n\n28. Progress is also being made on several power generation, transmission, and distribution projects, as well as off-grid solutions, all aimed towards achieving the national goal of optimizing power supply by 2025.\n\n29. I am again happy to report that we continue to make visible progress in our strategic road construction projects like the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan expressway, Apapa \u2013 Oworonsoki expressway, Abuja \u2013 Kano expressway, East-West Road and the second Niger bridge. We hope to commission most of these projects before the end of our tenure in 2023.\n\n30. The Pandemic revealed the urgent need to strengthen our health system. Towards this end, we constructed 52 Molecular labs, 520 bed intensive care units, 52 Isolation centres and provision of Personal Protective equipment across 52 Federal Medical Centres and Teaching Hospitals.\n\n31. We continue to push our expenditure rationalization initiatives which we commenced in 2016. For example, on personnel costs, the number of MDAs captured on the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System increased from 459 in 2017 to 711 to date.\n\n32. The recent passage of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021, and consequent incorporation of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation should also result in rationalisation of expenditure, as well as increased investments and improved output in the oil and gas industry.\n\n33. Distinguished Senators and Honourable Members, you will agree with me that a lot has been accomplished over the last year but there is still much to be done. I will now proceed with a review of the 2022 Budget proposal.\n\nTHEME AND PRIORITIES OF THE 2022 BUDGET\n\n34. The allocations to MDAs were guided by the strategic objectives of the National Development Plan of 2021 to 2025, which are:\n\na. Diversifying the economy, with robust MSME growth;\n\nb. Investing in critical infrastructure;\n\nc. Strengthening security and ensuring good governance;\n\nd. Enabling a vibrant, educated and healthy populace;\n\ne. Reducing poverty; and\n\nf. Minimizing regional, economic and social disparities.\n\n35. The 2022 Appropriation therefore is a Budget of Economic Growth and Sustainability.\n\n36. Defence and internal security will continue to be our top priority. We remain firmly committed to the security of life, property and investment nationwide. We will continue to ensure that our gallant men and women in the armed forces, police and paramilitary units are properly equipped, remunerated and well-motivated.\n\n37. The 2022 budget is also the first in our history, where MDAs were clearly advised on gender responsive budgeting. These are part of critical steps in our efforts to distribute resources fairly and reach vulnerable groups of our society.\n\nPARAMETERS AND FISCAL ASSUMPTIONS\n\n38. Distinguished Members of the National Assembly, the 2022 to 2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper sets out the parameters for the 2022 Budget as follows:\n\na. Conservative oil price benchmark of 57 US Dollars per barrel;\n\nb. Daily oil production estimate of 1.88 million barrels (inclusive of Condensates of 300,000 to 400,000 barrels per day);\n\nc. Exchange rate of four 410.15 per US Dollar; and\n\nd. Projected GDP growth rate of 4.2 percent and 13 percent inflation rate.\n\n2022 REVENUE ESTIMATES\n\n39. Based on these fiscal assumptions and parameters, total federally-collectible revenue is estimated at 17.70 trillion Naira in 2022.\n\n40. Total federally distributable revenue is estimated at 12.72 trillion Naira in 2022 while total revenue available to fund the 2022 Federal Budget is estimated at 10.13 trillion Naira. This includes Grants and Aid of 63.38 billion Naira, as well as the revenues of 63 Government-Owned Enterprises.\n\n41. Oil revenue is projected at 3.16 trillion, Non-oil taxes are estimated at 2.13 trillion Naira and FGN Independent revenues are projected to be 1.82 trillion Naira.\n\nPLANNED 2022 EXPENDITURE\n\n42. A total expenditure of sixteen point three-nine (16.39) trillion Naira is proposed for the Federal Government in 2022. The proposed expenditure comprises:\n\na. Statutory Transfers of 768.28 billion Naira;\n\nb. Non-debt Recurrent Costs of 6.83 trillion;\n\nc. Personnel Costs of 4.11 trillion Naira;\n\nd. Pensions, Gratuities and Retirees\u2019 Benefits 577.0 billion Naira;\n\ne. Overheads of 792.39 billion Naira;\n\nf. Capital Expenditure of 5.35 trillion Naira, including the capital component of Statutory Transfers;\n\ng. Debt Service of 3.61 trillion Naira; and\n\nh. Sinking Fund of 292.71 billion Naira to retire certain maturing bonds.\n\nFiscal Balance\n\n43. We expect the total fiscal operations of the Federal Government to result in a deficit of 6.26 trillion Naira. This represents 3.39 percent of estimated GDP, slightly above the 3 percent threshold set by the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007. Countries around the world have to of necessity over-shoot their fiscal thresholds for the economies to survive and thrive\n\n44. We need to exceed this threshold considering our collective desire to continue tackling the existential security challenges facing our country.\n\n45. We plan to finance the deficit mainly by new borrowings totalling 5.01 trillion Naira, 90.73 billion Naira from Privatization Proceeds and 1.16 trillion Naira drawdowns on loans secured for specific development projects.\n\n46. Some have expressed concern over our resort to borrowing to finance our fiscal gaps. They are right to be concerned. However, we believe that the debt level of the Federal Government is still within sustainable limits. Borrowings are to specific strategic projects and can be verified publicly.\n\n47. As you are aware, we have witnessed two economic recessions within the period of this Administration. In both cases, we had to spend our way out of recession, which necessitated a resort to growing the public debt. It is unlikely that our recovery from each of the two recessions would have grown as fast without the sustained government expenditure funded by debt.\n\n48. Our target over the medium term is to grow our Revenue-to-GDP ratio from about 8 percent currently to 15 percent by 2025. At that level of revenues, the Debt-Service-to-Revenue ratio will cease to be worrying. Put simply, we do not have a debt sustainability problem, but a revenue challenge which we are determined to tackle to ensure our debts remain sustainable.\n\n49. Very importantly, we have endeavoured to use the loans to finance critical development projects and programmes aimed at improving our economic environment and ensuring effective delivery of public services to our people. We focused on;\n\na. the completion of major road and rail projects;\n\nb. the effective implementation of Power sector projects;\n\nc. the provision of potable water;\n\nd. construction of irrigation infrastructure and dams across the country; and\n\ne. critical health projects such as the strengthening of national emergency medical services and ambulance system, procurement of vaccines, polio eradication and upgrading Primary Health Care Centres across the six geopolitical zones.\n\nInnovations in Infrastructure Financing\n\n50. In 2022, Government will further strengthen the frameworks for concessions and public private partnerships (PPPs). Capital projects that are good candidates for PPP by their nature will be developed for private sector participation.\n\n51. We will also explore available opportunities in the existing ecosystem of green finance including the implementation of our Sovereign Green Bond Programme and leveraging debt-for-climate swap mechanisms.\n\nEnhancing Revenue Mobilisation\n\n52. Our strategies to improve revenue mobilisation will be sustained in 2022 with the goal of achieving the following objectives:\n\na. Enhance tax and excise revenues through policy reforms and tax administration measures;\n\nb. Review the policy effectiveness of tax waivers and concessions;\n\nc. Boost customs revenue through the e-Customs and Single Window initiatives; and\n\nd. Safeguard revenues from the oil and gas sector.\n\n53. Distinguished Senators and Honourable Members, I commend you for the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021. It is my hope that the implementation of the law will boost confidence in our economy and attract substantial investments in the sector.\n\nFinance Bill 2022\n\n54. In line with our plan to accompany annual budgets with Finance Bills, partly to support the realization of fiscal projections, current tax and fiscal laws are being reviewed to produce a draft Finance Bill 2022.\n\n55. It is our intention that once ongoing consultations are completed, the Finance Bill would be submitted to the National Assembly to be considered alongside the 2022 Appropriation Bill.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n56. Mr. Senate President, Mr. Speaker, Distinguished and Honourable Members of the National Assembly, this speech would be incomplete without commending the immense, patriotic, and collaborative support of the National Assembly in the effort to deliver socio-economic development and democracy dividends for our people.\n\n57. I wish to assure you of the strong commitment of the Executive to strengthen the relationship with the National Assembly.\n\n58.

We must continue to cooperate and ensure that our actions are aimed at accelerating the pace of economic recovery so that we can achieve economic prosperity and deliver on our promises to the Nigerian people.\n\n59. The fiscal year 2022 is very crucial in our efforts to ensure that critical projects are completed, put to use and improve the general living conditions of our people.\n\n60. It is with great pleasure therefore, that I lay before this distinguished Joint Session of the National Assembly, the 2022 Budget Proposals of the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\n61.

          "text": "British megastar Adele has spoken of her \u201cyear of anxiety\u201d that led her to live like a \u201crecluse\u201d, in a rare interview published in Vogue ahead of the release of her new album \u201c30\u201d.\n\n\u201cI thought, I\u2019m just going to lock myself in a house,\u201d she said of her anxiety-fueled retreat from the public glare, which began with two cancelled shows at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium in 2017 due to problems with her voice.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I did. I was very reclusive. It paid off. People are used to me being a recluse,\u201d she said in comments published on the fashion magazine\u2019s website late Thursday, her first major interview since 2016.\n\nThe 33-year-old singer graces the cover of its US and UK editions this month.\n\nIt was during what she called her subsequent \u201cyear of anxiety\u201d that her marriage to Simon Konecki, with whom she had a son Angelo in 2011, fell apart.\n\n\u201cNeither of us did anything wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cNeither of us hurt each other or anything like that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on my journey to find my true happiness ever since,\u201d added Adele, who currently lived in Los Angeles.\n\nFinding root of anxiety\n\nAdele revealed that a new song on the album was inspired by a comment her son made to her as the marriage collapsed.\n\nShe took solace in \u201ca lot of sound baths\u201d \u2014 a meditative experience in which participants are \u201cbathed\u201d in sound waves \u2014 alongside more traditional meditation, exercise, and \u201ca lot of therapy\u201d.\n\n\u201cI realised that when I was working out, I didn\u2019t have any anxiety.\u201d\n\nAdele added that therapy had made her realise that much of her anxiety stemmed from her childhood and relationship with father Marc Evans, who left home when she was aged 2.\n\n\u201cMy relationship with men in general, my entire life, has always been: \u2018You\u2019re going to hurt me, so I\u2019ll hurt you first\u2019. It\u2019s just toxic and prevents me from actually finding any happiness,\u201d she told Vogue.\n\nHowever, the pair \u201cgot our peace\u201d before Evans died of cancer earlier this year.\n\nThe stresses of the business and the death of compatriot Amy Winehouse almost led her to quitting the industry altogether, she revealed, at one point writing to her manager: \u201cThis isn\u2019t really for me. It\u2019s not why I love music\u201d.\n\n\u201cI got really famous right as Amy Winehouse died,\u201d she told Vogue. \u201cAnd we watched her die right in front of our eyes.\u201d\n\nThe Oscar and 15-time Grammy Award winning soul star told fans to expect a slight change in sound with the new album, noting there \u201cisn\u2019t a bombastic \u2018Hello\u2019,\u201d referring to her 2015 smash single.\n\nHer lyrics have also taken a change of course, she said.\n\n\u201cI realised that I was the problem,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cAll the other albums are like, you did this! You did that!.. Then I was like\u2026 I\u2019m the running theme, actually. Maybe it\u2019s me!\u201d\n\nAFP",

          "text": "The U.S. Senate approved legislation on Thursday to temporarily raise the federal government\u2019s $28.4 trillion debt limit and avoid the risk of a historic default this month, but put off until early December a decision on a longer-lasting remedy.\n\nThe Senate voted 50-48 to pass the bill following weeks of partisan fighting. Earlier, 11 Republicans voted in favor of a procedural vote allowing the bill to proceed.\n\nThe Senate-passed bill now goes to the House of Representatives, which needs to approve it before President Joe Biden can sign it into law. The House will hold a vote on the bill on Tuesday, according to the office of the No. 2 House Democrat, Steny Hoyer.\n\n\u201cPresident Biden looks forward to signing this bill as soon as it passes the House and reaches his desk,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in statement on Thursday.\n\n\u201cAs we approach the coming months, we hope that even more Republicans will join Democrats in responsibly addressing the debt limit instead of choosing default or obstruction.\u201d\n\nThe $480 billion increase, which would lift the debt limit to $28.9 trillion, is expected to be exhausted by Dec. 3, the same day that funding for most federal programs expires under a stop-gap measure passed earlier this month following another partisan standoff.\n\nThat means that over the next eight weeks, the bitterly divided Congress will have the twin challenges of finding a middle ground on agency spending through September 2022 \u2014 ranging from education and foreign aid programs to immigration enforcement and airport security \u2014 and avoiding yet another debt limit meltdown.\n\nThe vote followed a months-long standoff that brought the nation close to the Oct. 18 date that the Treasury Department forecast as when it would no longer be able to meet its obligations.\n\n\u201cRepublicans played a dangerous and risky partisan game and I am glad that their brinksmanship did not work,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said after the vote.\n\nThe plan emerged on Wednesday after top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell said Republicans were open to a temporary hike after twice blocking Democrats\u2019 attempts to raise the cap. That offer came after Biden raised the possibility of bypassing the Senate\u2019s filibuster rule requiring 60 of the 100 members to agree on most legislation.\n\nNot all Republicans were happy with McConnell\u2019s move, and it took long negotiations behind closed doors to secure enough Republican votes to advance the measure.\n\n\u201cThis is a complete capitulation,\u201d said Republican Lindsey Graham.\n\nEarlier in the day, news of the negotiations drove Wall Street\u2019s main stock indexes to end sharply higher in a broad-based rally. In a sign of bond market relief, the yield on one-month Treasury bills fell to the lowest point since Sept. 8 as investors deemed that the risk of default had eased. read more\n\nRECONCILIATION\n\nWashington\u2019s debt limit troubles are unlikely to be resolved with passage of the short-term increase.\n\nMcConnell is still expected to insist that the next increase in December be achieved through the time-consuming \u201cbudget reconciliation\u201d process, which would allow for passage without any votes from his party.\n\nDoing so could bolster Republican candidates in the 2022 congressional elections as they try to burnish their credentials as fiscal conservatives \u2013 even though most of them previously supported an array of measures passed during Republican Donald Trump\u2019s administration that jacked up U.S. budget deficits.\n\nDemocrats have adamantly rejected using the reconciliation process, although they have used it to pass some of Biden\u2019s other priorities, saying that in this case it is too unwieldy and would establish a bad precedent.\n\nReferring to the deal providing a debt limit reprieve until December, McConnell said in a Senate speech: \u201cNow there will be no question. They\u2019ll (Democrats) have plenty of time\u201d to pass the next increase using reconciliation.\n\nDemocrats had been trying to pass legislation that would have raised the debt limit through the end of 2022, which Republicans blocked.\n\nWhile the deal relieves debt ceiling pressures for now, it adds to the high-stakes, partisan battles Congress will wage through the end of the year.\n\nDemocrats want to pass two massive spending bills that make up much of Biden\u2019s domestic agenda in the coming weeks, including a multi-trillion-dollar social policy package to be passed by reconciliation and a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill.\n\nBut by late November, their attention will have to return to funding the government and again avoiding the debt ceiling.",

          "text": "Samsung Electronics Co Ltd on Friday flagged a 28% jump in its third-quarter operating profit to the highest in three years, driven by rising memory chip prices and display sales for new flagship smartphone launches.\n\nThe preliminary result was up 26% from the second quarter, although just below forecasts, while the market reaction was further muted as analysts pencilled in a flat or slightly lower result this quarter on an expected fall in memory chip prices.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest memory chip and smartphone maker estimated its July-September profit at 15.8 trillion won ($13.3 billion), below a Refinitiv SmartEstimate of 16.1 trillion won. It is the highest quarterly profit since the third quarter of 2018.\n\n\u201cThe mobile business\u2019 operating margin might have been lower than the market expected,\u201d said Park Sung-soon, analyst at Cape Investment & Securities. \u201cWe will have to see marketing costs and what the mix of products Samsung sold was like.\u201d\n\nRising memory chip prices and shipments, plus a jump in profitability at Samsung\u2019s chip contract manufacturing business, likely raised the chip division\u2019s operating profit by about 79% from a year earlier, analysts said.\n\nSemiconductors accounted for about half of Samsung\u2019s operating profit in the first half of the year.\n\nSamsung shares pared early gains to be up 0.4% in afternoon trade.

          "text": "Tesla Inc (Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Thursday the electric carmaker plans to move its headquarters from Silicon Valley\u2019s Palo Alto, California to Austin, Texas, where it is building a massive car and battery manufacturing complex.\n\nTesla joins Oracle, HP and Toyota Motor in moving U.S. headquarters to Texas from California, which has relatively high taxes and living costs. While Silicon Valley also is a hive of development of new ideas and companies, Texas is known for cheaper labor and less stringent regulation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to announce that we\u2019re moving our headquarters to Austin, Texas,\u201d Musk told the company\u2019s annual meeting, held in the Texas car factory.\n\n\u201cThis is not a matter of, sort of, Tesla leaving California,\u201d he said, saying it plans to increase output from its main California factory and Nevada factory by 50%.\n\nThe Fremont, California factory nonetheless is \u201cjammed\u201d and it is tough for people to afford houses in California, he said.\n\nBillionaire Musk himself moved to the Lone Star State from California in December to focus on the electric-car maker\u2019s new plant in the state and his SpaceX rocket company, which has a launch site in the southern tip of Texas.\n\nMusk had a rocky relationship at times with California, threatening to move Tesla headquarters and future programs to Texas during a row over the closure of Tesla\u2019s factory in Fremont, California due to COVID-19, for instance.\n\nAt the meeting he showed off a design of what looked like a cowboy-style belt buckle emblazoned with \u201cDon\u2019t Mess With T\u201d \u2014 the T in the style of the Tesla logo. The phrase is based on a venerable and popular Texas anti-littering campaign \u2013 Don\u2019t Mess with Texas.\n\nDIRECTOR TERM CUT\n\nDespite some criticism from activist shareholders and a proxy advisory service, shareholders followed board guidance on several key proposals, including reelection of Kimball Musk, Elon\u2019s brother, and James Murdoch as board directors.\n\nBut they voted in favour of a stockholder proposal to reduce director terms from three years to one year and a proposal regarding additional reporting on diversity and inclusion efforts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that the shareholders did not agree to remove Murdoch and Musk\u2019s brother. But I think they know the pressure is on them,\u201d Stephen Diamond, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law, said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot more work to do on governance. Just changing the term is just an artifact of a larger governance issue,\u201d William Klepper, a professor at Columbia Business School, said.\n\nAdvisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) had recommended that Tesla investors not re-elect the two directors because of concerns about excessive compensation packages to non-executive board members.\n\nShareholders also voted against a stockholder proposal asking for a study into the impact of Tesla\u2019s use of arbitration on workplace harassment and discrimination.\n\nThe proposal, opposed by the board, was thrown into the spotlight after a Black former contract worker on Monday won a $137 million jury award against Tesla over workplace racism.",
