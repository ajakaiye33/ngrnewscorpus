          "title": "Kate Henshaw: Fighting for Women\u2019s Rights",
          "text": "During the Easter holidays, lovers of stage plays had an exciting experience with Doyenne Circle\u2019s musical, Ada The Country which had Kate Henshaw as the lead character.\n\nAda The Country tells the story of Ada, who loses her 9-month-old daughter and property in a fire incident in which she barely survives herself. The traumatic experience sends her into depression but with the support of women across different generations, who have been through such harrowing experiences, she is able to walk through a process of restoration.\n\nKate Henshaw, a Microbiology graduate who gave the stage play her 100 percent best, in this interview, says she also enjoys using her influence to positively impact lives, advocate for a better Nigeria, and as well to raise her voice on issues that concern the girl child, women and everyone in general.\n\nStage plays don\u2019t hold regularly like it used to be in the 80s. For practitioners like you, what was is like returning to the stage with Ada The Country?\n\nI\u2019m an advocate for the girl child and for women. I truly do love the stage, very much. So, when I was first approached to star in Ada the Country, I found the title quite intriguing; Ada is the first female child in the Igbo culture and Ada the Country means there is a lot of expectation on her to become the best expectations from society, family, and all.\n\nSo, I was totally and truly delighted to be a part of it the first time. And of course, this is the second installment in 2022. We had a fantastic time. The first time in 2020 and 2022, it was like home to me and I felt really fantastic rehashing, the straight the lines and then added a few more layers to the character to make her believable. I love the title, I love the musical, and it was such a huge honour and pleasure to be a part of it.\n\nHow challenging was it communicating the central theme of the play?\n\nThe only challenge was the rehearsal time. You know that for stage, you need to put in a lot of work rehearsing. You have to go over and over and over again, moving around the state and of course, with the added layer of it being a musical, that, also, added a bit of a challenge to the theme of the play. So, putting that all together and also making time for my other commitments was a bit of a challenge to me, but I took it in my stride. I made sure I gave it 100% each time I had to be at rehearsal to ensure that the character came alive, and it was communicated clearly to the audience.\n\nFrom the whole experience, how best can women going through trauma be helped?\n\nI believe that asking for help does not show a sign of weakness, asking for help is actually saying that you need support. People should not be shy to ask for help or talk to professionals, in order to be counselled. I believe that when you open up your heart and you tell your story, you get some sort of healing. But from that, you also inspire all the people who are going through the same stuff, to come forward and share their own story. It helps others know that they are not alone in whatever situation that they are going through in a society where women are seen and not heard. Women need to raise their voices and ask for help, and of course, having a good support system in terms of family, good friends, does not hurt. Support is very good. No matter what you\u2019re going through, you need good people around you to be able to lift you up out of any situation that you\u2019re going through.\n\nGender based domestic Violence is gradually becoming the order of the day. What do you think can be done to stem this menace?\n\nI think more stringent consequences in terms of punishments should be meted out to perpetrators. No shaming of the victim. No victimization of the person who has gone through domestic violence. Our culture of silence perpetuates this evil. And so, a lot of voices need to be raised.\n\nGender-based violence is something that has been with us for a while, but with the advent of social media, it is now coming to the fore in a huge wave. A lot more needs to be done especially by women to be able to stem this Menace. And of course, we need the relevant authorities to be alive to their responsibilities; name and shame the perpetrators so that people know that these kinds of people are being punished.\n\nSo, I\u2019m an advocate for stringent strong punishment to deter others.\n\nCelebrities are always in the forefront when a gender-based violence occurs. However, most times, they never follow through to ensure the culprit is properly charged. Why is that so?\n\nCelebrities are human beings. They use their platform for those who choose to use their platform, to bring to light, issues that affect the society. This they do in terms of advocacy, film, documentaries, music, in advocating for a better Society. They are human beings like everyone else, so, they cannot do it on their own. They need the support of society, male and female to be able to stop this menace. On them being able to follow through to the end, another thing is the length of time that it takes for prosecution and for judgment to be served to the perpetrator. You know, after a while, the victim gets tired and feels like, oh, they don\u2019t want to go through it. I have worked with a couple of NGOs, putting out their information, Miracle Center projects a lot of violence against women and children, Chechen Yara, WORRY which is women at risk Foundation. I\u2019ve always supported them in the advocacy, naming and shaming, telling people where they can go to seek help.\n\nFor those in marriage, what would you counsel, especially in a society where single and divorced women are less respected?\n\nWell, like I said, society blames the woman who leaves her marriage even when it is life-threatening. The society is not very kind to single and divorced women because they see them as failures. This needs to stop because they are human beings. They also want a better life for themselves. They need to be alive, to actualize all of their potentials. We need to continue to advocate for kinder words being spoken to survivors of those who have come out of a violent relationship or marriage. Sometimes, these abuses are not only physical, but also, mental and even financial. That\u2019s why in terms of accommodation, you hear some landlords say, they don\u2019t want a single woman. Even when you\u2019re trying to get your passports, as a woman, unless you are already married, they frown at that. You need to have a man\u2019s permission to be able to get this legal document, all of that needs to change.\n\nFrom the play Ada the Country, we see women supporting women but in real world, women have been accused of enforcing obnoxious and archaic traditional practices against their fellow women. How can women make the right changes?\n\nAbsolutely, I always say that women are the gatekeepers to some of this archaic and obnoxious traditional practices like, female genital mutilation, widowhood rights etc. Women are in the forefront and they are the ones who perpetrate this. So, when the men turn around and do the same, they are like, look at your fellow woman, it should not be.\n\nFemale genital mutilation for one has no benefits whatsoever. Cutting part of the vagina of the woman just to make her less promiscuous has no medical benefit to it other than to scar her psychologically and physically.\n\nSo we need good women, we need intelligent women, we need women in the community, we need women leaders, we need market women, we need women in religious societies who will continue to preach and advocate for a saner society and to banish all these traditional practices that are indeed harmful to their fellow women.\n\nThese days celebrities bring to the internet all their private affairs, some really scandalous and damning. What is your view on how your colleagues use the social media?\n\nWell, to each, his own; I will say that we all have choices and whatever we do, there are consequences. I, for one, I\u2019m, okay. I\u2019m just minding my lane, content in focusing on my job and issues. I am passionate about advocating for them and generally sending out a positive vibes. So, to each, his own, everyone is an adult and responsible for how they use the tool of social media, because when the purpose of a tool is not known, abuse is definitely inevitable.\n\nIs that why you kept your daughter away from public eyes?\n\nShe is my business. It\u2019s private. I choose to have a line dividing privacy and public show-off of whatever. I\u2019m a very private person, but it so happens that my life is my work and that makes some part of my life public. But, I choose to protect her, but well, she\u2019s an adult now. She can make the choice to go into the social media space knowing fully well that it\u2019s a mixed world out there. So, one has to work circumspectly, treading carefully and know that the kind of information you put out, may be used against you in the future.\n\nSo I choose to keep her away from the public eye as a personal choice.\n\nDo you think social media has done more harm than good?\n\nSocial media, I don\u2019t know if I can say it has done more harm than good. There\u2019s a lot of good that has come from social media. Issues are brought to light that would otherwise not be heard of like gender-based violence, like murder, like laws against women that have not been passed by the National Assembly, laws that favour women, that are not being looked into by the National Assembly. So, social media if it\u2019s not used correctly can turn out to be harmful like, fake information, impersonation of people\u2019s character, using of their images without permission.\n\nSo, we need to be more careful in the usage of social media in terms of disseminating information.\n\nHow did you manage to keep a clean slate in the movie industry, no scandals?\n\nI stayed on my lane. I focused on me and on putting out good stuffs. I focused on trying to make the world a better place, better than how I met it. I am content with what I have. I try not to involve myself in things that are not beneficial to me. I have learnt a lot in my almost 30 years in the film industry that the public stoplight is on you 24/7. So, I am extremely careful about what I put out. I try to put my life private not put out information that I don\u2019t want people to know about. It is important to me that the focus should be on my work and the other good works that I am trying to do.\n\nYou\u2019re still young and beautiful, any second thoughts on remarriage?\n\n(Laughs). Well, never say never at the right time, God will do what He has to do. And if He says \u2018No\u2019 fine and if He says, yes, that is also fine. I am not ruling it out, but I am not actively searching to remarry.\n\nYou have made exercising a way of life for some years now and the result is being commended. Would you have opted to go under the knife?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t go under the knife, I am already apprehensive about surgical procedures. I think all my life, I have already had one and that is on my hand when I had an injury. I am happy with my body. I am happy with where I am now, in terms of my fitness and my lifestyle. I\u2019ll continue to advocate for people to make exercising a way of life, because apart from the immense good hormones flooding your system, your organs, your mind, your brain will all benefit from it. And of course, if it is weight loss that you are after, you will also get that. I advocate for people not to take a short cut, but to stay and trust the process because the results are too much to count.\n\nWhen you are not working, how do you relax?\n\nWhen I am not working, I love massage because my work is quite stressful. So, I have a nice massage, listen to cool music and dance. Dance is very important to me. I like reading books; Thriller, crime novels. Then, I travel if I can. Sometimes I just rest at home. Switch off phones and have some me time. It is very important.\n\nWhere is your favourite holiday destination?\n\nI have been to a lot of places, as long as it\u2019s not cold. Me and the cold we are not friends. I prefer places that are warm, sunny and breezy with lots of site to see, good food, drinks and chops. Anywhere that is relaxing and take some time off for myself will be destination for me.\n\nWhat gives you the most joy in life?\n\nWhat gives me the most joy in life is being able to use my influence for good, to affect my immediate society and the world at large, to raise my voice on issues that concern the girl child, women and everyone in general.\n\nAlso, to highlight bad practices against individuals, advocating for better governance for the citizens of Nigeria and just lending a voice to help support a better society that we all can benefit from. I am happy that I am able to contribute my own quota joined with others who want the same thing.",

          "title": "King Hakbal: Styling Royalties",
          "text": "\n\nHakeem Adeyinka Balogun, the Creative Director and CEO of King Hakbal International; an established fashion brand is leaving no stone unturned in making a huge impact with his designs, home and abroad.\n\n\n\nKing Hakbal\u2019s bespoke wears speak volume of sartorial elegance, royalty, confidence and culture.\n\n\n\nIn this interview, the Mathematics graduate of The University of Lagos (UNILAG), says he hopes to, one day, style Former President Barack Obama and international music star Sean Combs (P. Diddy).\n\nHe also sheds more light on the problems of the Nigerian fashion industry and the way forward.\n\n\n\nWhat inspired the King Hakbal brand?\n\nI would say royalty, passion, and the eventual joy of wanting to make every man look Royal. I would also say that, my fashion sense is a natural God-given talent that I absolutely had to share with the world. Not sharing it would have been a sin against humanity in my opinion. I have always loved fashion, even, as a kid, but I would say my very fashionable parents were a great influence, especially my mother. She had always dressed my siblings and me with a very high sense of style, and so, I grew up with that standard. What particularly prompted my interest into making others look good was my sincere desire to see everyone looking classy and special. I, sometime, wished I had special powers, because I would have made every single human look lovely every single day. For me, fashion is life and fashion brings out the true beauty in all. These are the major reasons that inspired the King Hakbal Royal Bespoke brand.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you were starting out, what gave you the confidence that fashion designing is a profitable venture that could put bread on the table?\n\nTo be honest, when I started, I never thought of the financial side of fashion. My main focus was just to make my clients truly happy and basically to deliver a very satisfying value for money service. I will say truly that, all that I have achieved so far is from sheer dint of hard work, perseverance and God\u2019s divine grace. We all never know in the beginning that whatever we set out to do will be a profitable one, or will guarantee bread on the table. But if you are one that never likes to fail, that fear of failure will always keep you driven that, you will always want to do more. So, in a nutshell, I will say that it\u2019s the fear of failure and pure passion that gave me and is still giving me, the confidence that with God by side, He will always provide the next bread on my blessed table.\n\nTo God be all the Glory and praise.\n\nWhat were the initial challenges you encountered and how did you scale the hurdles?\n\nI used to have power problems (Electricity) when I started in 2003. We all know how bad our power situation is but by the grace of God, I saved up for a very good diesel generator; one that can conveniently power all the machines in my factory. That was a very huge achievement for me that year. I look back now and all I can say is \u2018Alhamdulilah Robeel Alameen\u2019. It is really not easy for a young Nigerian entrepreneur that has a very big dream ahead of him or her. I also didn\u2019t get the type of support that I expected to get from family and friends, but God put total strangers in my path and my story changed. These blessed people saw how hard working and passionate I was and kept referring me to other clients until the world knew my name. Social media has also been an amazing platform to show my pieces to the world; I am so thankful for that.\n\n\n\nHaving come this far what lessons have you learnt about fashion designing that can benefit those coming into the profession?\n\nAlways deliver a good job. Listen to your client\u2019s instructions to the letter z. Even if you forget, don\u2019t be too shy to put a call through to ask further questions because at the end of the day, that smile on your client\u2019s face when he or she receives or fits into the outfit is what will guarantee a smooth transaction, and eventually bring more clients to you. I have also learnt that a very good customer service is important. Right from the way you speak to your clients over the phone, to the way you welcome them whenever they are around you will say a lot and help a whole lot in pushing you and your fashion brand forward. Always note that one client is like a million because you never know who is who.\n\nAnother interesting thing that I have learnt is that as a fashion designer, you must always look the part because there is this wise saying that goes \u2013 \u201cWhoever says that he wants to style us, we will be wise enough to see what this so called person has on their own back first.\u201d This will tell us if he truly knows his onions or not. Furthermore, I have also learnt that humility is key. Choose your words very carefully whenever you are around your clients. Being in your presence is an experience for them and it\u2019s up to you to make sure that it\u2019s a fun one that they won\u2019t forget in a rush. This will ensure that you are always in their minds and on their lips whenever they speak about a fashion designer brand.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat has been your best and worst moment so far as a fashion designer?\n\nI have only had best moments because I love what I do. To name one of the many best moments will be taking a bow after the release of my collections on the runway on major platforms. Fashion is life so that makes everyday a chance to make another stunning fashion statement. I always say that the world is my runway and everyone around are my audience. I simply love what I do. I truly can\u2019t see myself doing anything else. God bless the Nigerian fashion industry (Amen).\n\n\n\nWhat motivated you to go to UK and New York?\n\nWhat motivated me to travel abroad was because of my clients in those parts of the world and also to broaden my horizon. I wanted to know and learn more about fashion. I also needed a refreshing inspiration that could bring out an outstanding creative side to my mind. The world is like a book. If we don\u2019t travel the world and stay in just one country, it\u2019s almost like reading just one page in an amazing and adventurous book. I also wanted to see the things that I used to watch on television as a kid in reality. Growing up and till date, I am only drawn to American movies. They actually make me feel like I am partly American deep down. So, travelling to these parts of the world was just out of curiosity and adventure.\n\n\n\nYou are trying to broaden your market to UK, what is unique about the Nigerian fashion industry?\n\nWhat is unique about the Nigerian fashion industry is the Nigerian sense of style and confidence that we Nigerians carry so effortlessly. I, also, particularly love how we Nigerians tend to stand taller and adjust our carriage whenever we are in any of our ethnic or traditional attires. One can immediately see a boost in our self-confidence; watching that transformation is simply priceless to me. This makes me want to share this truly regal Nigerian attires and regalia with the whole world.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow affordable are your designs and who are your target clients?\n\nMy pieces are very affordable for what I deliver. My target clients are men that see themselves as Kings at heart; men that do not see themselves as ordinary, men with a very simple yet outspoken sense of style. Men with class!\n\n\n\nKindly share with us some of the fashion shows you have participated in and which was your best and why?\n\nThe African Fashion Week and the ECOWAS Fashion Week; I particularly loved the African Fashion Week more because it carried so much power and the coordination. The turn-out was huge. I had the sound track from the classic movie \u2013 Coming to America \u2013 And my models dressed in stunning tuxedo, very sharp 3- piece business suits and some Dansiki and Agbada made out of Aso Oke. The screams and applause were extremely overwhelming for me. There is nothing like reaping the fruits of one\u2019s labour.\n\nWho is the perfect King Hakbal Lion Man?\n\nThe perfect King Hakbal Lion Man is one that is fearless in the pursuit of what sets his soul on fire. A King Hakbal Lion Man is also one that sees himself as a King at heart; a driven- man who puts his money where his mouth is. He is also a stand-up man that exudes so much confidence. A King!\n\nWho do you dream to style as a fashion designer and why?\n\nBarack Obama, Sean Diddy Combs. I mentioned these two great men because Barack Obama is my role model. In fact, he is a girl\u2019s dad just like me. He is also very stylish and he has so much swag. Secondly, I mentioned Sean Diddy Combs because he was my fashion idol growing up. He always loved to look sharp at every single chance given to him. He also inspires a whole generation.\n\n\n\nHow friendly is the Nigerian economy to fashion entrepreneurs?\n\nIt is extremely friendly because we Nigerians are so fashion forward. It\u2019s very inspiring. We also have lots of fashion-loving Nigerians in the Diaspora who see the good works that we fashion designers are doing on social media. They have been so supportive financially. Thank God for social media, especially Instagram. Instagram has helped every entrepreneur show their creativity to the world in a very easy, yet professional platform.\n\n\n\nWhat projection do you have for your brand in the next 5 years?\n\nTo be the Royal and Premium Men\u2019s wear brand all over Africa and the world at large. To have stores in major cities all around the world, and to continue to have the high and mighty in the society wear King Hakbal.\n\n\n\nHow do you relax and have time for family?I pray, drink lots of water and go to a private beach house with my family. I also love having conversations with my wife and daughters about almost everything. That really relaxes me as they are the love of my life.",

Diddy).\n\nHe also sheds more light on the problems of the Nigerian fashion industry and the way forward.\n\n\n\nWhat inspired the King Hakbal brand?\n\nI would say royalty, passion, and the eventual joy of wanting to make every man look Royal. I would also say that, my fashion sense is a natural God-given talent that I absolutely had to share with the world. Not sharing it would have been a sin against humanity in my opinion. I have always loved fashion, even, as a kid, but I would say my very fashionable parents were a great influence, especially my mother. She had always dressed my siblings and me with a very high sense of style, and so, I grew up with that standard. What particularly prompted my interest into making others look good was my sincere desire to see everyone looking classy and special.

          "text": "Words By -Yemisi Suleiman\n\nWife of Nigeria\u2019s Chief of Naval Staff and current president of the Naval Officers Wives Association, NOWA, Nana Aisha Gambo is poised to create an absolutely better life for members of her association.\n\nSince assuming office in 2021, Mrs. Gambo has embarked on major projects, aimed at bettering and enhancing the organization by supporting military wives whose husbands are often absent on missions or stationed far away from their homes. Apart from her duties at NOWA, Aisha Gambo is also a philanthropist, who prides herself on a lot of philanthropic activities such as providing access to clean water in disadvantaged communities, empowering young and upcoming women in the business world, and offering scholarship opportunities to indigent students; a feat which, recently, earned her a spot as an inductee into the United Nations Humanitarian Hall of Fame.\n\nMrs. Gambo who holds a degree in Geography and Regional Planning from Ahmadu Bello University is also CEO of Framazaz Resources Limited, with several subsidiaries. The businesswoman also has her hand in properties and interior decoration.\n\nAs president of Nowa, what major initiative have you embarked upon to improve the lives of members of your organisation?\n\nSince assuming office, we have done several projects geared towards improving the lives of our people. We have done seminars and training to expose and enhance their livelihoods such as entrepreneurship training to enhance their business skills in topics like negotiating, marketing, profitable pricing, etc. We have held cybersecurity seminars to expose members to the effects, impacts, and detection of cyber fraud. Our members have been engaged with an African study tour that exposed NOWA executives and members to empowerment and welfare programmes, employed by other countries to improve the lives of women and children.\n\nAre you having the impact you hoped your initiative would have at the outset?\n\nI feel very good and blessed about the initiatives I put forth because the impact is felt across the board. There have been an increasing number of participants joining the skills acquisition training center for example, and we have a lot more clamouring for new centers to be built in more states.\n\nOften, we hear and see on TV wives of late military men lamenting that they and their children have been neglected after the death of their husbands.\n\nWhat does Nowa do in such circumstances?\n\nThere is always room for NOWA members in the NOWA organization. We understand that the circumstances are extremely painful, but in our own organizational capacity, we continue to provide opportunities and support for those whose husbands are late and died fighting for our country. NOWA in conjunction with the Nigerian Navy organizes sensitization workshops to sensitize the officers on the benefits of appointing their spouses as next of kin to enable the receipt of benefits and entitlements.\n\nIn what ways do you cater to both the developmental and moral growth of women and children left behind by late officers?\n\nOne of my core beliefs is that we don\u2019t leave anyone behind. We make sure that support is available for widows and their children. We also give work opportunities when the chance arises. In addition, we also offer opportunities for women and youths to learn vocational and entrepreneurship skills, at our skills acquisition centres in Oghara and Lagos. NOWA sponsors the children of late parents through primary and secondary education\n\nYou were inducted into the United Nations Humanitarian Hall of Fame some time ago, what does this mean to you?\n\nThe induction into the Humanitarian Hall of Fame about six months ago means a lot not because of the award itself, but because it means the work I have been doing behind the scenes has been impactful on so many lives, and my efforts have been recognized by the United Nations Economic and Social Council. With or without any awards, it\u2019s in my heart to impact lives and I will continue to do so in any way I see possible.\n\nThis year\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day theme is: \u201cGender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow.\u201d How do you factor this in achieving your goals with regards to Nowa?\n\nNOWA is a strong women association made up of many strong and smart women and that is a vehicle for any initiative regarding the growth of women globally. We align with the International Women\u2019s Day theme \u201cGender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow\u201d because the celebration of women who have done what we aspire to do, encourages more women to push the boundaries for gender equality and a more sustainable future.\n\nHow do you balance being at the head of a property development and interior decorating company at the same time?\n\nBy the Grace of Almighty Allah, I am at the helm of a few different businesses and it can be challenging balancing different businesses in such an environment. I make sure I work with trustworthy people. I also train them and employ those who are willing to work hard and be rewarded accordingly.\n\nHave you always been entrepreneurial? What led you to take that first step in setting up your own business?\n\nYes, by the Grace of God, I have always been entrepreneurial from my childhood days. I got interested in my father\u2019s business ventures; he was also a builder and I noticed how he went about his work. Again, I always assisted my mother in getting things done, whether it was following her to the market, or just handling things around the house. I believe this upbringing grounded me to understand that success in life is a process and a journey.\n\nOver the years, have you encountered any barriers to your success or growth as an entrepreneur?\n\nEveryone experiences challenges in business but, that of a woman can be very different because there are many aspects involved. I had three young kids to take care of while also starting and running my business. Balancing the time my business needed to grow and the amount of time devoted to raising good kids posed a challenge. But with the wisdom and blessings I acquired as a young lady, I was able to make both works and by the Grace of God, raised three beautiful young adults. Another challenge I faced was the thought that business is supposed to be left for men to do. Early on in my career, when some of the men did not understand my passion and capacity, they thought the opportunities I was vying for were too big for me to handle until I was awarded the job and executed well. Consistent delivery was how I was able to continue to build credibility over the years and oftentimes my old clients would refer me to the next client.\n\nWhat event in your childhood years shaped you into the woman you are today?\n\nNo particular event but as mentioned earlier, watching and being involved with my parents activities gave me the courage and confidence to work hard and reach new heights over time.\n\nAs a businesswoman, leader, and philanthropist, what is your vision?\n\nMy vision is to be an inspiration to many people, especially the young and up-and-coming businesswomen in our society. I believe my actions, my stories, and my work, will help motivate and inspire them.\n\nHow does your business experience benefit your current position as president of Nowa?\n\nWell, I can look at the problems we face from a private sector point of view. This allows me to be a bit more hands-on and less bureaucratic in providing solutions to the organization.\n\nWhat are you most passionate about?\n\nMy big focus is on the sustainable development of the less privileged. It has been a passion of mine even before I became the NOWA President. I have taken pride in doing a lot of philanthropic activities such as providing access to clean water in communities, empowering young and upcoming women in the business world, scholarship programmes to mention a few.\n\nWhat do you hope to accomplish within the next year?\n\nOne of the biggest projects I would like to accomplish in the next year is the hospital we plan to build for women and children. This would be a specialized 200-bed hospital that would be equipped to handle all the necessary care for women and children. We plan to build it in three locations (Abuja, Kano, and Port Harcourt).\n\nYou look very fashionable. What\u2019s fashion like for you?\n\nWell, fashion is also an expression for me, it can be therapeutic to wear nice clothes and feel confident in them, and so I am intentional about that. I like my clothes simple but elegant.\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing in your free time?\n\nBecause I am extremely busy with a lot of engagements with my different businesses, I enjoy resting, sleeping, and taking time for myself whenever I get the chance. I don\u2019t compromise on that and I think it\u2019s an important aspect that many busy people should focus on. I also enjoy listening to music and The Holy Quran.\n\nWhat is the one piece of advice you would give any young woman reading this?\n\nThe one piece of advice I would give any young woman reading this is, to understand that success is a process, there\u2019s a journey to it and it doesn\u2019t come as fast as social media might want to make you believe. Work hard, develop yourself because no one can ever take that away from you, be confident, and associate with the right people.",

          "text": "There was jubilation in Enugu North Senatorial District of Enugu State, on Sunday, as the Senator representing the district in the National Assembly, Senator Chukwuka Utazi formally announced his decision not to contest the senatorial seat in the forthcoming Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) primaries and the general elections, to pave way for the smooth and peaceful emergence of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State as the Senator of the Senatorial district in the 10th National Assembly.\n\nSenator Utazi who made the announcement while addressing the delegates of the PDP from Enugu North Senatorial District and other stakeholders of the party said he did not purchase the Expression of Interest and Nomination forms of the party for the Senatorial seat to give Gov. Ugwuanyi, who he described as \u201cour leader and brother\u201d, maximum support.\n\nThe federal lawmaker added amid jubilation that the decision was also to promote the existing peace in Enugu North Senatorial District in particular and Enugu State in general.\n\nSenator Utazi reassured Gov. Ugwuanyi that the PDP family in Enugu North Senatorial District and the entire people of the district are solidly behind him and his political decisions in respect of the choice of candidates during the forthcoming party primaries, saying: \u201cWe will follow our brother and leader; we are going to be behind you; and pray that God will guide to take these decisions\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are here to give you reassurance that it is ordained by God that you do the things you are supposed to do. We are here to also reassure that you have our backing. Our case is not just political. The followership and backing are also spiritual. And you have our spiritual backing too. We are going to continue this support at the voting level during the general elections\u201d, Senator Utazi said.\n\nThe pronouncement by Sen. Utazi not to contest the senatorial seat elicited jubilation among the party faithful at the meeting, prompting the State Deputy Chairman of the PDP, Hon. Innocent Ezeoha to, on behalf of the people, thank Senator Utazi for his sportsmanship and sacrifice in declaring his support for the governor\u2019s senatorial bid.\n\n\u201cSenator Utazi it will be well with you for making this sacrifice\u201d, Hon. Ezeoha added.\n\nEarlier, while addressing the PDP faithful comprising members of the National and State Assemblies from Enugu North Senatorial District, the six Council Chairmen, members of the State EXCO from the zone and all the principal officers of the PDP at the Local Government and ward levels, the Zonal Chairman (Enugu North Senatorial District), Rt. Hon. Nze Michael Onyeze, disclosed that the essence of the meeting, which was attended by Gov. Ugwuanyi, was to appreciate the governor for his remarkable achievements in Enugu North Senatorial District in particular and the state in general in spite of the nation\u2019s economic challenges and the state\u2019s limited resources.\n\nHon. Onyeze noted that the appreciation was informed by the outcome of the assessment tour of infrastructural projects executed by the governor, including completed and ongoing landmark projects, stressing that \u201cNo government has done what your (Ugwuanyi\u2019s) government has done in the rural areas\u201d.\n\nThe PDP Zonal Chairman stated that the meeting was equally for the party delegates from Enugu North Senatorial District to renew their stance and reassure Gov. Ugwuanyi of their total support for his choice of party candidates for the State House of Assembly, National Assembly, governorship and presidential seats.\n\nHe maintained that they are in support of the rotational zoning arrangement of the governorship position which favours Enugu East Senatorial District, stressing that the governor has done a lot to maintain peace in Enugu State and strict adherence to the zoning pattern would enhance peace and security in the state.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency, you have done so well and we are proud of you. Our votes will not miss, even one vote. We will give you 100 percent support in respect of your choice of successor and other elective positions\u201d.\n\nAlso speaking, the member representing Nsukka/Igbo-Eze South Federal Constituency, Rt. Hon. Dr Pat Asadu, the member representing Nsukka East Constituency, Rt. Hon. Chinedu Nwamba and the Chairman of Udenu LGA and State Chairman of Association of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON), Hon. Solomon Onah, on behalf of their colleagues from the zone, respectively, unanimously endorsed the stance of the party, reassuring the governor that they are resolute in their support and loyalty.\n\nCorroborating, the PDP LG Chairmen in the six LGAs of Enugu North Senatorial District, the Party LG Vice Chairmen, the LG Secretaries, the LG Youth Leaders, the LG Woman Leader, the PDP Ward Chairmen from the zone, the Ward Vice Chairmen, Ward Secretaries, Ward Youth Leaders and Ward Women Leaders unanimously declared their maximum support and loyalty to Gov. Ugwuanyi, reassuring him that they will follow his directions as the only leader they know in Enugu State.\n\nThe two former State Chairmen of the PDP from Enugu North Senatorial District, Engr. Vita Abba and Chief Ikeje Asogwa witnessed the event.",

The other seven were firmly within the power, control and grip of Britain and America\u201d, the author noted.\n\nThe former aide to ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo called them spies and informants that were carefully and craftily planted.\n\n\u201cOf the five Nigerian leaders that died whilst on the throne, every single one of them was murdered in cold blood by local agents of the CIA with the tacit and implicit support of M16 and Langley.\u201d\n\nFani-Kayode insists that no military coup has ever been successful in Nigeria without the tacit backing and support of M16 and/or the CIA.\n\nNoting that every nation has secrets, FFK said most are classified and are known only to experienced, circumspect and cerebral members of the intelligence community.\n\n\u201cNigeria is no different but hers are legion. There are more secrets hidden in the belly of our nation\u2019s womb and history than most.\u201d\n\nHe said secrets about Nigeria include the deaths of Shehu Musa Yar\u2019adua, M. K. O. Abiola, ex-Head of State Sani Abacha, Dele Giwa, Sulia Adedeji, Alfred Rewane, Bola Ige.\n\nOthers are Funsho Williams, Ibrahim Abacha, Tunde Idiagbon, Abubakar Audu, Abba Kyari, Brigadier Bako, Major General Shuwa, Bagudu Kaltho and Air Marshal Alex Badeh.\n\nAlso secretive, according to Fani-Kayode, are the C-130 plane crash, the Bellview plane crash, the Chibok girls abduction, the identity of foreign entities and local collaborators backing Boko Haram and ISWAP.\n\nHe further mentioned \u201cthe murderous herdsmen\u201d in the North-East and North-West and the violent secessionist agitation and brutal killings by \u201cunknown gunmen\u201d in the South-East.\n\nFFK added that the Nigerian people, though blissful in their naivety and innocence, still believe that they control their own future and destiny.\n\nHe lamented that citizens have no idea about what went on in the past and what is going on because they either do not care or are busy trying to make ends meet.\n\n\u201cThey are also unaware that our country has become something of a football that is being kicked around and silently carved up by the Americans, the British, the French and increasingly the Chinese.\n\n\u201cAll those that ruled us and gallantly attempted to stand up against western domination, neo-colonialism, and had a patriotic, zealous and enviable pan-African disposition were taken out by a coup d\u2019etat or by being murdered.\n\n\u201cYou want their names? I will not mention them. Kindly do the research yourselves and work out who they are. I will say though that each of them at least gave us something to be proud of.\n\n\u201cYet the tales of woe and sordid state secrets continue. Did you know that approximately 800,000 Nigerian civilians, including women and children, were killed by Biafran forces during the three-year Nigerian civil war.\n\n\u201cWe often talk about and rightly condemn the mass murder and slaughtered of 3 million Biafran civilians (including 1 million children) but rarely do we spare a thought for or even mention the 800,000 civilians that also perished.\u201d\n\nFani-Kayode stressed that the genocide, mass murder and crimes against humanity went both ways.\n\n\u201cThese are bitter and uncomfortable truths that many hate to hear and that others will find hard to believe. The dark history of Nigeria is not known by 95% of Nigerians\u201d, he added.",

          "text": "Former Ogun State Governor, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, has said though he is not a saint, he did everything right as the Ogun helmsman.\n\nDaniel was the Governor of Ogun from 2003 to 2011 when he was succeeded by Senator Ibikunle Amosun.\n\nA few months after he left office, Daniel was arrested by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and detained at the commission\u2019s headquarters in Abuja for days.\n\nThe EFCC later arraigned him on a 32-count charge, bordering on alleged false declaration of assets, land allocations and \u2018underpayment\u2019 of values and alleged mismanagement of N211.3 million Ogun State fund.\n\nBut, Daniel, through his counsels led by Professor Taiwo Osipitan, filed a \u201cno case submission\u201d, debunking all the allegations.\n\nIn 2019, the Ogun State High Court hearing the case since 2011, knocked out 15 out of the 32 counts, leaving Daniel to open his defence on the remaining 17 counts.\n\nBut, he approached an appellate court in Ibadan and the Court of Appeal led by Yargata Nimpar discharged him on all the counts.\n\nAt a Special Thanksgiving Service held at the Abraham Tabernacle in Sagamu on Sunday, the former governor recounted how he was tried for 11 years despite serving Ogun State for eight years.\n\nSpeaking to journalists, the Ogun East senatorial aspirant maintained that he neither stole lands nor money as governor.\n\nWhile conceding that he is not a saint, Daniel, however, said he did everything right to the best of his knowledge.\n\nWhen asked if he was not worried during his trial when some of his fellow former governors being tried were sent to jail for funds misappropriation, Daniel said he used to feel strong that God would vindicate him, but he got worried at times.\n\n\u201cWhat I was sure of is that, I am not a saint, but I did everything right to the best of my knowledge. I don\u2019t know how anyone will say I stole the land on which this (Abraham Tabernacle) church was built. I don\u2019t even know who the complainant is. The land was paid for, the church is not for profit-making. We donated the church back to the Baptist convention.\n\n\u201cAnother one is The Church of the Lord in Ogere, where we gave them a land to build a university. How do we turn things around in the nation if we don\u2019t encourage this kind of thing? What\u2019s my duty as a governor? I\u2019m supposed to look at areas where people need support and help them.\n\n\u201cThe perception was that everybody is taking money. Do you take money from the church?\n\n\u201cThose are the things I had to face; and quite honestly, I felt strong, felt God will vindicate me, but there are certain times I got worried because when you see what is happening, you wonder. I think the tragedy is, in whatever we do, we must not see every single person as a thief. Because, there must be consequence for doing bad and appreciation for doing right. But when you have a society where those that do right are being persecuted, there will be no incentive for doing right. That\u2019s my own worry,\u201d he submitted.\n\nOGD, as he is fondly addressed, commended the judiciary for standing by the truth, saying: \u201cLet me end this thanksgiving by saluting the judiciary, I have a strong belief that the judiciary being the last chance of a common man is the only succour that our country continues to have.\n\n\u201cI am praising the judiciary today that, despite the challenges they have, the difficulties they have encountered, (because it is not easy to decide who is wrong or who is right in our country), but for the judiciary to stand and decipher and come to the kind of judgment they gave, I want to dedicate this victory to them. They failed to succumb to pressure.\u201d\n\nIn his sermon, the Retired Prelate of the Methodist Church of Nigeria, Dr Sunday Makinde, congratulated Daniel for his triumph over the trial.\n\nMakinde implored Christians to imbibe the spirit of praises and thanksgiving to God at all times.",

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nHe said Saraki, Tambuwal Hayatu-Deen and him collectively approached former military president, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida (retd) to organise northern elders to chose a consensus candidate for the North in PDP.\n\nNorthern Leaders in a communiqu\u00e9 signed by Prof. Ango Abdullahi, had on Friday shortlisted Saraki and Mohammed as two leading presidential aspirants to represent the zone in the PDP presidential primary.\n\nAbdullahi said Saraki, Mohammed, Tambuwal and Hayatudeen had submitted themselves for the drive towards a consensus candidate\n\nHe said the decision on Saraki and Mohammed was arrived at, based on certain criteria adopted in the assessment of the four aspirants by the northern elders.\n\nHe urged Saraki and Bala Mohammed to work together to make allowance for further consultations \u201cto foster understanding among themselves, and the PDP community to ensure a rancour-free primary in which all eligible delegates would be free to exercise their rights.\u201d\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nThe development has, however, greeted with counter reactions as Tambuwal and Hayatu-Deen, rejected the decision, claiming it was not based on the principle of equity and transparency. Also former vice president, Atiku Abubakar also distanced himself from the arrangement.\n\nThe governor, in a statement by spokesman of his presidential campaign organisation, Udenta Udenta, yesterday, said instead of casting aspersions on Babangida and the northern elders that conducted the exercise, they should be commended for doing a great job.\n\nIt read in part: \u201cWe wish to place it on record that Gen. Babangida never approached nor lobbied anybody to superintend the process that will lead to the emergence of a consensus presidential aspirant. Rather it was the group of presidential aspirants made up of Sen. Bala Mohammed, Aminu Tambuwal. Sen. Bukola Saraki and Alhaji Mohammed Hayatu-Deen that collectively, freely and willingly approached Gen Babangida to help select from amongst themselves a consensus presidential Aspirant.\n\n\u201cThe above four named individuals not only initiated the Consensus Arrangement on their own volition but also agreed to fully and unequivocally abide by the decision that Gen Babangida will arrive at in consultation with other elders as well as accept, honour the steps and procedures he will deploy in arriving at any decision.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, reject the current insinuations in the media from some quarters that purport that Gen Babangida and the elders either did not consult very widely or imposed a decision on an unwilling band of presidential aspirants. Gen Babangida and elders deserve nothing but commendation for the conclusions they reached and the outcome of the Consensus exercise by anybody who believes in the tenets of truth, honour and integrity.\n\n\u201cPolitical ambition should not and cannot be a condition precedent to cast overboard these time honoured verities and inviolable norms and ask those are desecrating these values to have a sober rethink.\n\n\u201cThe Sen Bala Mohammed Campaign Organisation will not join issues with anybody on the question of the Consensus Arrangement because the truth needs no further protection from its traducers but will rather press on in rallying the nation around its progressive \u201cNigeria First\u201d governance vision on the heels of the successful execution of the consensus arrangement.\n\n\u201cThe campaign organisation, however advises all those who are not happy with the result of the selection process or who did not participate in it to focus on their individual political trajectories without let or hindrance and not muddy the political waters any further.\n\n\u201cLet us clarify to the millions of members and supporters of the PDP that the consensus arrangement was not designed as an end in itself but as means to an end; not as a goal with a limited regional vision or appeal but first in the series of processes and exercises aimed at building inclusiveness, harmony and unity within the ranks of the presidential aspirants in the PDP.\n\n\u201cSen Bala Mohammed is a bridge builder and the composition of his Campaign Organisation will reflect our national diversity and mission of inclusivity on the basis of equity, justice and equal access to opportunities. His vision of Nigeria is a wholesome one just as his passion for party work and duty is almost peerless in the range of assignments he executed for it, not least being the Report on the 2019 Elections and the Modalities for balanced allocation of positions to be adopted by the party.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cSen Bala Mohammed and his campaign organisation will contest for every political space and fight for every single delegate to the very end with robust energy and matchless passion but will continue to respect and honour our elders and critical party stakeholders as well as accepting and abiding by the ultimate decision this concourse of forces reach at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nAlso reacting yesterday, Saraki in a statement by his media adviser said the process of arriving at the consensus aspirants was pain-staking, thorough and transparent.\n\nHe confirmed that he and Bauchi governor have initiated a process to ensure that one of them emerged as the North Presidential aspirant.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cIt is a welcomed development. The process that eventually led to this decision cannot be faulted. It was painstaking, thorough and transparent.\n\n\u201cTheir decision was based on equity, justice, and the need for inclusion of all. Yes, one consensus candidate has not emerged, but they have initiated a process which can help the party later on.\n\n\u201cThe process is a work-in-progress. One person will still emerge from the ongoing process here in the North.\n\n\u201cThe South also has an example to emulate in deciding on the aspirants that should proceed to the primaries considering the zones that have not produced a President before like the South East. A nation like Nigeria with all the current problems, needs consensus building as a way of healing the nation and enlarging grounds of co-operation, unity and understanding.\u201d\n\nSaraki has said he was ready for the May 29 primary.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen in Minna, Niger State after meeting with PDP delegates at the party secretariat, the former Kwara governor said he accepted in good faith the decision of the northern elders.\n\nSaraki was full of praises for the elders statesmen who participated in the process for their time and sacrifice.\n\n\u201cIn the first place, we were the ones that went to them to seek their participation. They never asked for it. We decided on our own because we feel we can\u2019t do it alone which they have done. We thank them for their patriotism and the sense of unity for this country\u2026whatever is the outcome, I am ready for the primary election of the party.\u201d\n\nAddressing delegates, he said though he would not be a sectional, religious or ethnic president if elected, it should be the turn of the North Central zone to produce the next president for the country.\n\n\u201cThis will be the first time that the zone will have a democratically elected president in this country,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile expressing the urgent need to rescue the country from the current mirage of problems confronting it as a nation, Saraki reminded the delegates that \u201cthe project is not for me alone, it is not about Bukola Saraki alone, it is about the entire North Central and Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, former chairman of Northern Elders\u2019 Forum, Paul Unongo said the elders gave preference to Saraki because of his experience, having been two-term governor and senate president during the trying moments in the country.\n\nOnongo said he was going to reach out to former Ambassador of Nigeria to Switzerland, Yahaya Kwande who was not part of the meeting on the decision of the elders forum.\n\nThe former minister of steel development stated this at an interaction with journalists in Jos saying he was a proponent of zoning, but that it should be rotated among the six geo-political zones.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe Presidency, yesterday, blamed opposition as well as Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah, for the United States of America\u2019s delay 12 Super Tucano jet fighters for the Nigerian Air Force to fight insecurity across the country.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, titled \u2018Predicting Nigeria\u2019s collapse is a perennial pursuit of US think tanks and policy experts\u2019, the presidency said US perception of the Christian-Muslim relations in Nigeria as chaotic, were as a result of the narrative from Kukah and those opposing Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThe Presidency noted that the delay was compounded by constant lobbying of US Congress by the government\u2019s opponents, including Kukah.\n\nIt added that the US\u2019 policy and support to Nigeria have been so inconsistent over the years, especially as regards the provision of military equipment to fight the decade-long insecurity in the Sahel region.\n\nIt also berated the US policy experts and think tanks for their perennial attempts at predicting the country\u2019s collapse; which, it said, does not paint a true picture of a country that has enjoyed 23 years of steady democracy 29 years since its last coup, enthusing that \u201cthe dream of our founding fathers of a strong, united and prosperous Nigeria remains very much intact.\u201d\n\nThe statement reads thus: \u201cIn 2005, a US National Intelligence Council paper \u201cMapping Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s Future\u201d floated the idea there could be a military coup in Nigeria. At the time this was hardly an earth-shattering prediction: 2005 was only six years after the return of civilian democratic rule and just over a decade since the Abacha military coup of 1993 \u2013 the final of seven coups since independence.\n\n\u201cHowever, for the last 29 years \u2013 close to a generation \u2013 there have been none. Since the return of democracy in 1999 there have been six general elections, four elected presidents, four transfers of power \u2013 including one in 2015 between the winning opposition candidate and the losing incumbent president seeking re-election.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cYet despite all the evidence to the contrary, the collapse predictors keep doubling down on their bets.\n\n\u201cMost recently retired former US Ambassador to Nigeria 2004-7 John Campbell has updated his book, of which the first edition said:\n\n\u201cWhile Nigerians often claim they are masters of dancing on the brink without falling off, the disastrous administration of President Goodluck Jonathan, the radical Islamic insurrection Boko Haram, and escalating violence in the delta and the north may finally provide the impetus that pushes it into the abyss of state failure\u201d.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t of course, quite the opposite: Jonathan was defeated at the 2015 general election with power peacefully transferring to the victor, President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cCampbell is always more careful than others who openly claim their predicted collapse is just around the corner. Still, it is always there, as innuendo: \u201cI have never predicted the breakup of Nigeria because I have never thought it would happen. But, were it to do so, the likely consequence would be a humanitarian disaster\u201d \u2013 said Campbell in a blog post in 2012 for the US Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) think-tank.\n\n\u201cThat same CFR is now publishing the new edition of Campbell\u2019s book. It seems unlikely the conclusion will be that Nigeria is improving on any measure as \u2013 for international Nigeria watchers \u2013 there seems little that can ever be found to suggest it is.\n\n\u201cYet the people of Nigeria \u2013 the majority of which were born after the last coup of 1993 \u2013 and who have known nothing their whole lives except democracy and elected government are the living proof that democracy is here to stay.\n\n\u201cThough often negative, Campbell does however consistently express an important view that it is in the interests of the United States to encourage democracy and security in Nigeria. The government of Nigeria concurs. It is a pity therefore that US policy and support towards our country, including during the Buhari administration, has been so inconsistent.\n\n\u201cIn 2015 the then newly-elected Buhari government requested US military support in the form of Super Tucano jet fighters for the Nigerian Air Force. The Nigerian military, security, and intelligence services repeatedly made this request. The US administration of the time concurred: the delivery of such jets would help deliver a critical turning point in Nigeria\u2019s struggle against jihadist terrorists across the Sahel.\n\n\u201cYet two years later, that jet delivery was rescinded, the reasons given that unless Nigeria improved its religious relations between Christianity and Islam then US support would not be forthcoming in this, and many other areas.\n\n\u201cSuch views were compounded by the constant lobbying of US Congress by the opponents of the Nigerian government who had lost the previous election, and many of their southern religious supporters \u2013 including Bishop Mathew Kukah, the Catholic Bishop of Diocese of Sokoto, who, unsurprising, provides a supportive quote for the dustcover of the new edition of Campbell\u2019s book. (Kukah even took to addressing the US Congress himself, briefing his audience on the history of coups in Nigeria \u2013 without, of course, mentioning that none had occurred since 1993, some 29 years ago).\n\nFortunately, now today under a new US administration these jets have been delivered, and with it, a serious blow against the terrorists \u2013 with the supreme leader of Islamic State in West Africa and scores of other leaders of the group eliminated in airstrikes.\n\n\u201cIt is all very well to claim it is in the United States\u2019 interests to help Nigeria become an even-better democracy and stable country. It is quite another to forever avoid mentioning the last coup was 29 years ago, and that since 1999 Nigeria has enjoyed 23 unbroken years of democratically elected governments and peaceful transition between them.\u201d",

Aminu Tambuwal; former Governor of Jigawa State, Mr. Sule Lamido; and Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, have rejected the emergence of a former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, and Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Mohammed as the consensus presidential candidates for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the North.\n\nAtiku, Tambuwal, Lamido, and Hayatu-Deen, who are all PDP presidential aspirants, have also denounced the report of Prof. Ango Abdullahi, which endorsed Saraki and Mohammed as the North\u2019s consensus presidential candidates with the backing of a former military President, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida (rtd).\n\nAs the controversy over the northern PDP presidential candidate deepens, the wife of the President, Mrs. Aisha Buhari, last night held Iftar dinner with presidential aspirants across political divide at the Old Banquet Hall of the State House, Abuja.\n\nThis is coming as the PDP yesterday summoned a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting for Wednesday this week.\n\nAccording to a statement by the National Secretary of the party, Senator Samuel Anyanwu, \u201call members of the National Executive Committee of our great party are invited to the 96th NEC meeting\u201d scheduled to hold at the NEC Hall PDP National Secretariat, Wadata Plaza, Abuja, at 2p.m.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the NEC meeting, which would take a final decision on the report of the 37-man committee on the zoning of presidential ticket of the party, was shifted from Thursday last week to Wednesday this week.\n\nMeanwhile, the wife of the President, Aisha Buhari, last night held Iftar dinner with presidential aspirants across political parties divides at the Old Banquet Hall of the State House, Abuja.\n\nThe First Lady invited all presidential aspirants of all political parties, to the Ramadan Iftar, where he also hosted elected officials of the political parties.\n\nPresidential aspirants in attendance were: National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and former Governor of Lagos State, Senator Bola Tinubu, Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State (APC), and Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Mohammed of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nOther dignitaries include: Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State; Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige; Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio; one-time National Chairman of the PDP, Chief Barnabas Gemade; former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogara; and oil and gas mogul, Tein Jack-Rich.\n\nOn the issue of the northern PDP presidential candidate, Abdullahi, a former Vice-Chancellor of the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, had in a report said that Babangida had directed him to conduct a consensus exercise for four northern presidential aspirants \u2013 Saraki, Mohammed, Tambuwal, and Hayatu-Deen.\n\nThe report, which shortlisted Saraki and Governor Mohammed as the two northern presidential consensus candidates, urged Tambuwal and the investment banker and economist, Hayatu-Deen to drop their presidential ambition.\n\nThe report signed by Abdullahi said: \u201cFor this exercise, it is hereby resolved that Governor Mohammad from the North-east and former Senate President Bukola Saraki from the North-central be presented as the northern consensus candidates for the moment.\u201d\n\nThe report also recommended that: \u201cThe two would, in turn, be required to make further concessions so that in the end, one of them would be presented as the consensus candidate, out of the four that presented themselves from the North.\u201d\n\nAbdullahi noted in the report that the four northern aspirants had visited Babangida and gave him the mandate to lead the process for a consensus and also agreed to abide by the outcome of the decision.\n\n\u201cThe former president encouraged the aspirants to have a resolution within themselves and come up with one candidate, which they reported back to him after some days and asked him to go ahead and pick one out of the four, General Babangida on his part opted for inclusion, through wider consultation and assigned me to design criteria and carry out the necessary consultations with elders and leaders across the three geopolitical zones of the North.\n\n\u201cThe process was conducted in the following three stages. In the first phase, the opinions of six distinguished persons each from the three geopolitical zones were sought with regards to each of the four aspirants, Each of the zonal delegates was allocated two votes to choose the first and second choice making a total of 36 votes overall. The outcome of that consultation was as follows:\n\n\u201c7 votes for the candidate (A) Aminu Waziri; 10 votes for the candidate (B) Bala Mohammed; 10 votes for the candidate (C) A-B Saraki; and five votes for the candidate (D), M Hayatu-Deen.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, one of the elders deferred his votes on grounds of continuing consultations with traditional rulers and other major stakeholders.\n\nThe report also stated that two members did not cast their second ballots bringing the total to 32 votes cast out of 36.\n\nIn its recommendation, which was approved by Babangida, the report endorsed Saraki and the Bauchi State governor.\n\nThe report also thanked all the aspirants and \u201cformer President Ibrahim Babangida for entrusting them with the conduct of this exercise and in the hope that all parties involved would continue with mutual consultations aimed at the overall success of the party.\n\n\u201cFor this exercise, it is hereby resolved that Governor Bala Mohammad from the North-east and former Senate President Bukola Saraki from the North-central be presented as the northern consensus candidates for the moment.\n\n\u201cThe successful aspirants are hereby urged to work together to make allowance for further consultations to foster understanding among themselves, and the PDP community to ensure a rancour-free primary election in which all eligible candidates would be free to exercise their rights.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely commend the sportsmanship and statesmanship exhibited throughout the exercise by all those involved and urge continuous cooperation and teamwork to ensure victory for the party,\u201d the report explained.\n\nBut in a swift response, the Technical Committee for the Actualisation of Atiku Abubakar\u2019s Presidency in 2023, has dissociated the former vice president from the consensus arrangement. Atiku\u2019s Technical Committee, in its statement, noted that: \u201cThe report clearly stated that the aspirants who presented themselves for the exercise are: Governor Tambuwal, Governor Mohammed, Saraki, and Hayatu-Deen.\u201d\n\nThe statement insisted that Atiku was never a part of the purported consensus arrangement and did not subject himself to this process.\n\n\u201cTherefore, he is not bound by any of the recommendations and conclusions of the purported report. Waziri Atiku Abubakar as a nationalist strongly believes that Nigeria has never been so divided as it is today, and any regional, zonal, ethnoreligious gang-up or consensus-driven in this manner will further deepen and widen the wounds that urgently require to be healed,\u201d the statement added.\n\nAlso reacting in a statement issued yesterday, the Director of Organisation and Mobilisation for Tambuwal Campaign Organisation, Nicholas Msheliza has also stated that the Sokoto State governor was not part of the consensus arrangement.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cThe attention of Tambuwal Campaign Organisation (TCO) has been drawn to a news item that former Senate President, Bukola Saraki and Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State have emerged as consensus candidates from amongst the four of us announced at a meeting in Minna, Niger State.\n\n\u201cThis is, to be candid and forthright, not correct.\n\nThe correct situation is that the team met on Wednesday, April 20, 2022, at Bauchi Governor\u2019s Lodge in Abuja and had a review meeting; and unanimously agreed that the consensus arrangement was not working.\n\n\u201cThe team further agreed that Senator Saraki should come up with a draft statement on how to communicate this decision to the Nigerian public. This was the last time that members of the team sat and mutually agreed on anything. The proposed meeting to review and vet the statement scheduled for 10 pm on the same day was aborted unilaterally by Senator Saraki via a WhatsApp message.\n\n\u201cHowever, on Thursday, April 21, 2022, the same Senator Saraki circulated yet another WhatsApp message suggesting that members of the team should head to Minna for a meeting on Friday. Governor Tambuwal reached other members of the team and informed them that he stands by the decision of the team that the initiative is not working. This is the reason Governor Tambuwal was absent at the Friday meeting in Minna. As a result, therefore, the outcome of the Minna meeting has no consequence or any implication on the aspiration of Governor Tambuwal, who had earlier informed his colleagues of maintaining their agreed position that the initiative has collapsed.\n\n\u201cMembers of the public should be reminded that what was canvassed for was a consensus candidate and not consensus candidates,\u201d the statement explained.\n\nThe statement added that Tambuwal had submitted his Presidential nomination forms, adding that the quest for a consensus candidate out of the four had collapsed.\n\nAccording to the statement, the Sokoto State governor will go ahead and face screening and indeed contest the PDP presidential primary.\n\nAlso denouncing the controversial consensus report, former Jigawa State Governor, Lamido called on all members of the party in the northern states to ignore it.\n\nLamido, in a statement issued yesterday, argued that the report does not represent the opinions of members of the party in the 19 northern states.\n\n\u201cThe attention of key stakeholders of the PDP in the northern states is drawn to reports in the media that some northern elders have shortlisted two of our prominent and deserving aspirants as consensus PDP presidential candidates.\n\n\u201cHaving widely consulted party leaders across the 19 northern states and FCT, it is hereby stated to our teeming party members and the general public that what Is reported in the media is only the personal opinion of those who issued the statement and not the position of the PDP members in the North!\n\n\u201cDiscussions are ongoing with all the aspirants in our party to have a national consensus if possible or at least working towards having smooth acrimony-free National Convention. The position of the northern elders is not only injurious to the North but equally injurious to the northern aspirants,\u201d Lamido explained.\n\nIn his reaction, Hayatu-Deen, in a statement by his campaign office, also stated that the process of arriving at a consensus candidate had collapsed.\n\n\u201cThe candidates involved could not reach a compromise amongst themselves, resulting in the decision of our principal, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, and Governor Aminu Tambuwal to discontinue the process,\u201d the statement added.\n\nIt described the committee constituted by Abdullahi as completely faceless and the evaluation criteria subjective.\n\n\u201cIt seems to us that this entire charade was designed to achieve a preconceived outcome,\u201d the statement said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Femi Gbajabiamila has also mourned the death of the Oyo monarch.\n\nPresident Buhari in a statement issued yesterday by his Media Adviser, Mr. Femi Adesina, stressed that the Alaafin of Oyo\u2019s 52 years of rule was remarkable in many ways, most significant was the emphasis he placed on human development, thereby encouraging learning as a culture and formal education as a necessity while promoting values of peace and stability.\n\n\n\nAs a highly revered traditional ruler, President Buhari noted the late monarch\u2019s numerous involvements in national meetings and conferences to shape the future of the country, and the living words of wisdom he shared at every opportunity on unity and people-focused governance.\n\nIn his letter of condolence sent to Makinde, Obasanjo said Oba Adeyemi died \u201cat a crucial stage in our nation\u2019s history when his wise counsel and rich experience are greatly needed.\u201d\n\nA copy of the letter was made available to journalists yesterday in Abeokuta, Ogun State, by Obasanjo\u2019s Special Assistant on Media, Mr. Kehinde Akinyemi.\n\n\n\nThe former president described the monarch as a symbol of a nation\u2019s epic struggle for self-discovery and self-actualisation. He said the late Alaafin was a patriotic and highly respected traditional ruler who had immeasurable love for his people and great faith in a united Nigeria.\n\nObasanjo said: \u201cHe stood out as a voice of forthrightness in national affairs and he was as well a fervent promoter of mutual tolerance and understanding, not only among the diverse people who live in his domain but also across the country.\u201d\n\n\n\nObasanjo prayed that God would grant the family, the people of Oyo land, and the entire Oyo State the grace to bear the heavy loss of the monarch\u2019s death.\n\nOn his part, Jonathan has also commiserated with the government and people of Oyo State over the death of the Alaafin of Oyo, describing the late traditional ruler as a great leader who recorded considerable achievements during his long and glorious reign.\n\n\n\nIn a condolence letter to Makinde, Jonathan noted that the late Alaafin was a skilled custodian of the tradition and culture of his people who had an eventful and epoch-making reign.\n\n\u201cOba Adeyemi\u2019s voyage on earth was full of notable achievements and epoch-making reign as a highly revered royal father. He was a great leader, bridge builder, and a skilled custodian of the tradition and culture of his people,\u201d the former president said in a statement issued by his spokesman, Mr. Ikechukwu Eze.\n\nAtiku has also reacted to the news of the passing of the Alaafin of Oyo, describing it as a great loss for Nigeria and African culture at large.\n\n\n\nAPC\u2019s presidential aspirant and National Leader of the party, Tinubu, has also expressed sadness over the death of the late Alaafin Lamidi Adeyemi, describing the demise of the revered monarch as the fall of a big Iroko tree.\n\nTinubu in a personally signed statement, said the Alaafin brought prosperity and development to the ancient Oyo Kingdom having ascended the throne of his forebears at a young age.\n\n\u201cAfter ascending to the royal throne at the age of 31, Alaafin became one of the most influential, greatly respected traditional rulers in Yorubaland, Nigeria and indeed Africa and beyond.\u201d\n\nEkiti State Governor, Fayemi, has also extolled the virtues of the late Alaafin of Oyo\n\nFayemi, on his part, said the departure of the revered monarch has created a big vacuum in the traditional institution in Oyo State in particular and Yoruba land in general.\n\nThe governor, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, said the late Oba Adeyemi was a bridge builder, a patriot, and a courageous leader, who contributed to the unity of Nigeria in his lifetime.\n\nHe noted that the late Oba Adeyemi was an authority in history and blessed with a sharp memory that added value and class to his royal duties and day-to-day interaction with people from different walks of life.\n\nOsun State governor, Oyetola, also described the passing of the Alaafin of Oyo, as shocking, saying it signified the end of an era.\n\n\n\nOyetola also commiserated with his Oyo State counterpart, Makinde, and the entire Yoruba race over the demise of the late monarch.\n\nHe described Alaafin\u2019s transition as a personal loss because, according to him, the late monarch was \u201ca good friend of Osun who was always ready to identify with our government and celebrate our humble accomplishments and achievements.\u201d\n\nIn his message, Governor Akeredolu of Ondo State described the death of the Alaafin of Oyo as the fall of a great Iroko.\n\nAkeredolu who is the Chairman of the South-west Governors\u2019 Forum, said the Oba\u2019s death was a rude shock.\n\nThis is contained in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Richard Olatunde in Akure.\n\nAkeredolu described the transition of the Oba to the world beyond as a big blow to the Oyo Kingdom, Yoruba race, and the country at large.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have lost a quintessential traditional ruler and custodian of the Yoruba culture. His contributions to the development and advancement of the country and Yoruba Land, in particular, are unquantifiable,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernor of Benue State, Ortom also yesterday commiserated with the government and people of Oyo State over the transition to the great beyond of the Alaafin of Oyo.\n\nIn a condolence message to his Oyo State counterpart, Makinde, issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Nathaniel Ikyur, the governor described the late Oyo monarch as a courageous king who did everything possible to preserve the culture and tradition of his people.\n\nSimilarly, the Governor of Edo State, Obaseki, also described the late monarch as, \u201ca great ruler, who displayed kindness and compassion to his people, espousing the virtues of hard work, diligence, and love for humanity.\u201d\n\nIn a statement yesterday, Obaseki said: \u201cBrave and cheerful, Oba Adeyemi embodied the ideals of the Yoruba nation, promoting the rich culture and heritage of the Yorubas and providing wise counsel to those who sought guidance from the throne.\u201d\n\n\n\nDelta State Governor, Okowa, commiserated with Makinde, the Government, and the people of Oyo State over the passing of the Alaafin of Oyo.\n\nIn a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Olisa Ifeajika, in Asaba, the governor noted that the late octogenarian monarch was an influential leader who was committed to the development of his kingdom and beyond.\n\n\n\nThe Speaker of the House of Representatives, Gbajabiamila has described the passing away of the Alaafin of Oyo, as a sad development that touched him personally.\n\nOn his part, Governor Abiodun of Ogun State mourned the late Alaafin\n\nIn a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, the governor described the monarch\u2019s death as tragic and occurred when least expected.\n\n\u201cI commiserate with the Oyomesi, the wives and children of the late monarch, and the entire Adeyemi family over this irreplaceable loss. I pray for their comfort and peace at the trying times.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that Kabiyesi had to take his leave of us, at this period, when we need his wisdom the most, as we approach the 2023 general election, a critical period in our political landmarks,\u201d Somorin quoted the governor as saying.\n\n\n\nGbajabiamila said the death of the paramount Yoruba ruler came to him as a rude shock, describing the late Alaafin, who had been like a father to him, as a very intelligent father with a sound grasp of traditional, social, political, and international history.\n\nGbajabiamila, who was recently appointed the Aare Baasofin of Yoruba Land by the late Alaafin, said the death of the traditional ruler has created a void too difficult to fill.\n\nIn his reaction, the Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Lekan Balogun, Alli Okunmade II, described the death of Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III, as the end of a remarkable and glorious era.\n\nBalogun made the assertions in a statement he signed yesterday in Ibadan, following the announcement of the death of the great Oba.\n\nThe Olubadan, who expressed shock at the news of the death of the Oyo traditional ruler, described the late traditional ruler as \u201ca royal father per excellence, who projected Yoruba culture and civilisation with awe and dignity\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe Emir of Ilorin and Chairman Kwara State Council of Chiefs, Mai-Martaba Alhaji Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari has also described the demise of Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III as a colossal loss to traditional institutions in the country.\n\nAlhaji Sulu-Gambari noted that the 52 years reign of Oba Adeyemi III witnessed a tremendous display of royalty, excellence, peace, and harmony among inhabitants of the ancient town of Oyo and Oyo State in general.\n\nIn a statement issued by his media aide, Alhaji AbdulAzeez Arowona, the monarch stated, \u201cOba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi\u2019s death marks the end of another era, the world will surely miss the exit of a bridge-builder\u201d.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Yes, you are calling me to come and declare for the next election. I cannot tell you I\u2019m declaring, the political process is ongoing. Just watch out. The key thing you must do is to pray that Nigeria gets somebody that carries young people along, somebody that can also work very hard to see that some of the problems raised are tackled.\n\n\n\n\u201cI sincerely appreciate the youths of Nigeria. For you to come this morning in this manner shows clearly that the youth are interested in politics.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have always wanted the youth to get involved in politics. And luckily, the Not Too Young to Run Act has made it very clear that young people can contest almost every position in the country. So, we continue to encourage you to get involved in the political process.\u201d\n\n\n\nJonathan noted that the country was facing challenges, saying that some of the challenges started a long time ago, stressing that he believed in the interest of young people and that the challenges would be dealt with.\n\nThe supporters, who demanded the return of Jonathan as President in 2023, arrived in four buses and displayed placards at Jonathan\u2019s Taraba Close, Maitama office.\n\n\n\nSome of the placards read, \u201cGoodluck declare now\u201d; \u201cWe are sorry, Goodluck don\u2019t abandon us, come back\u201d; \u201cGoodluck please come\u201d; and \u201cGoodluck we love you\u201d, among others.\n\n\n\nA spokesman for the supporters, Mayor Samuel, who is also the convener of the Youth Compatriots of Nigeria, said, \u201cWe were deceived and brainwashed by those who claimed they could do it in 2015.\n\n\u201cNow, we know better, under Jonathan the minimum wage could buy one or two bags of rice. What do we have today? We are begging President Jonathan to forgive us, we have realised our mistakes, we want him back to complete what he started.\u201d\n\n\n\nSamuel admitted that they were deceived to believe that the administration of Jonathan was bad and that they were out in their numbers to seek Jonathan\u2019s forgiveness.\n\n\n\nHe noted that they had realised their mistake and that the \u201csaboteurs\u201d that came after him were empty.\n\nSamuel adds: \u201cWe are here to say sir, forgive us, come and lead us again. We are calling on you to come and take the mantle of leadership in 2023. Nigeria is in comatose. Please answer this call, the youth are here, the women are here, the children are here, pregnant women are here, please hear their cry.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are here to call on our former president. Nigeria is in a state of no return, it is in a state of comatose, which is why we are here calling on him to declare.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll we need is a leader that will not discriminate, a Nigerian that will work for the South-South, South-east, South-west, and the north.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Transformation agenda was working until the saboteurs came to deceive us, to brainwash us. Now we have realised that those that deceived us are empty and have nothing to offer.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe want Jonathan to run under the Nigeria Peoples Party. Any party that gives a ticket to Jonathan is a party of the masses, the party of the downtrodden and that\u2019s the party we will support.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of the women speakers, Ms. Angela Obi said they were tired of the administration of President Buhari and called on Jonathan to come back.\n\n\n\nShe said: \u201cWe are dying, hunger wants to kill us, we are tired, please come back, we are suffering, we have no food to eat, we have no water, we need you back.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso speaking on behalf of women, Ms. Ngozi Okafor said since the former president left office in 2015, both men and women had been suffering.\n\n\n\nShe said, \u201cChildren are dying, we are tired. We have turned to beggars, women are begging, children are begging. We don\u2019t need Baba Buhari again. Our children are no longer going to school.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Document Exposes How Wema Bank Officials Offered Policeman Bribe To Stop Investigation On N1.7billion Money Laundering, Fraud",
          "text": "A report by the Nigeria Police Force has exposed how Wema Bank Plc offered bribe to the police officer investigating the N1.7billion illegally moved to account number 0122367964 domiciled in the financial institution and operated by one Isaac Adewole, a pastor of the Redeemed Christian Church of God by top officials of the bank.\n\nThe Wema Bank staff members fingered in the fraudulent activities are the bank's Executive Director, Wole Akinleye; Head of Cooperate Banking, Emmanuel Edah, and Head of Oil and Gas, Kingsley Ananwude.\n\nThe report signed by the Commander of Area G, Lagos, ACP Ibrahim Zungura, said multiple fraudulent transactions were carried out through the account.\n\n\u201cThe culpability of WEMA Bank officers was further confirmed when the officers tried to bribe investigating officers with large envelopes that contained money.\n\n\u201cThe officers declined the bribes but the Bank persisted. The officials spent time begging and persuading the inestigating officers to drop the case. The Executive Director of the Bank, Mr Wole Akinleye, was also invited and he tried hard to derail and stop the investigation. He also wrote a letter to ask that he be exonerated from the case when it was clearly established that the bank could not explain the transactions, that the movement of funds was a form of stealing from the bank which is sometimes referred to as 'pay off source'.\n\n\u201cThis is shown by the facts that the funds deposited were not removed in that order or in the sums deposited but carefully removed in different tranches as it is shown on the account statements. For his own part, Mr Adewole refused to cooperate with he investigations but instead did everything he could to assist the bank in covering up,\u201d the report exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters read.\n\nMeanwhile, the police has charged one Ojo Oladipupo, Chief Security Officer of Wema Bank Plc, to court for attempted bribery.\n\nHe was accused of offering a policeman, ASP Jonathan Egwemi (A/P No: 143699), monetary reward in order to stop him from carrying out a detail investigation into the fraudulent and money laundering activities of the bank.\n\n\u201cThat you Ojo Oladipupo \u201cM\u201d and others now at large on the same date, time and place in the aforementioned magisterial district did intentionally attempt to offer the station officer A/P No: 143699 ASP Jonathan Egwemi monetary reward in order to reframe him from carrying out a detail investigation into the fraudulent and money laundering activities of your organization i.e WEMA Bank Nigeria Plc and thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under section 64 of the criminal laws of Lagos State of Nigeria,\u201d one of the charges read.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how N1.7billion were fraudulently moved to account number 0122367964, domiciled in the financial institution and operated by Adewole.\n\nMultiple sources familiar with the fraud said Adewole, who is also the Managing Director of Shibawells Energy Limited, approached the bank in 2018 for a loan to boost his oil trading business using his neighbour\u2019s assets as collateral.\n\nGranting the loan to the pastor, the financial institution opened an account for him where the money was paid.\n\nThe account was, however, used to illegally move N1.7billion from the bank in 2021 to multiple accounts operated by top staff members and their proxies.\n\n\u201cHe used his neighbour\u2019s house for collateral of the loan which was granted to him and promised to return it within six months. But three years after, the man approached him for his house document, that was when he told him of the fraudulent act. He said the bank paid N1.7billion into the account using different multinational companies like Dana Airlines, Caverton Helicopter and two others, one N300million, one N270million, one N600million and like that, it\u2019s only one of the transactions that they didn\u2019t put a name there,\u201d a policeman involved in the case had told SaharaReporters.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: How Wema Bank Top Officials Used Redeemed Church Pastor\u2019s Account For N1.7billion Money Laundering, Fraud\n\n\u201cGuess what they do after, they now moved that N1.7billion from Adewole\u2019s account into different bank accounts in tranches. Like the one I told you \u2014N600million, they immediately put it in another account in form of N150million, N100million, N100million, N90million. The pastor\u2019s account is known as Shibawells Energy Limited. The one for Dana that they moved N160million to, that was how they did it too, they immediately sent it to another account in smaller units as well.\n\n\u201cSo the pastor approached the bank instead of the police. The top management staff involved called him and asked him what he wanted, they now ended with an agreement that the bank would give him an extra loan of N1.5billion and he agreed. Remember I told you this man is the Managing Director of Shibawells Energy Limited, a company that does supply aviation fuel. So we realised it was well planned and the names of Dana, Caverton and others were intentionally used to cover up the fraud so people won\u2019t notice. We also realised in our investigation that this money was given to the banks by the CBN and these top officials had to use an account to move it out and use it for something else.\n\n\u201cHe has a partner, we called him and realised he wasn\u2019t aware of the transaction. He was shocked, he realised the statement presented to him was forged to hide the fraudulent transaction.\u201d\n\nAccording to Adewole\u2019s statement of account obtained by SaharaReporters, on January 28 2021 via transaction ID No: M35660, he received the sum of N424,811,000 from Caverton, N160,000,000 from Dana and N630,000,000 from Beam Energy, all with the same transaction number.\n\nOn June 18, 2021 via transaction ID No: M104031, the pastor received the sum of N300,000,000 via NIP transfer from an undisclosed account source.\n\nAlso on same June 18, 2021, via transaction ID No: M104031, Adewole received the sum of N270,000,000 from Messrs Morrifoil Oil and Gas Ltd., all totalling N1,784,811,000.\n\nWhen contacted, a source at Dana Air said the airline didn\u2019t do any transaction with Adewole nor his company, Shibawells Energy Limited.\n\n\u201cIf I tell you we aren\u2019t aware of this case, then I\u2019m lying, the police some time ago invited us and we were surprised that the company\u2019s name was used for such a fraudulent transaction. It will be wrong for me to share our bank statement with you but such a transaction wasn\u2019t authorised by us,\u201d a source at Dana Air told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t involved in such a deal, only the bank management can tell you why they use Dana\u2019s name for the transaction. Go to the bank tomorrow and send money to anyone and use Dana as the sender they won\u2019t stop you from doing that. Jokes apart, if we have that kind of amount, my brother, we don\u2019t have any problem,\u201d the source added.\n\nIn January 2022, a group, Transparency Nigeria Group, asked the Central Bank of Nigeria to dismiss the Chief Executive Officer of Wema Bank, Ademola Ademise, over alleged fraud.\n\nThe group in a statement by Dahiru Mohammed, its Communications Director, alleged that Ademise had grossly abused his office as CEO of the bank and contravened several extant regulations of the CBN.\n\nAccording to the group, Wema Bank, under Ademise's watch, covered up a massive fraudulent scheme perpetrated by companies and proxies of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu.\n\nCalling for his immediate removal, TNG said, \u201cIn doing this, Mr Ademise failed in his fiduciary duties and allowed a powerful politician to use Wema Bank as a clearing house for laundered funds.\u201d\n\nThe group referred to a story dated November 23, 2020 by Peoples Gazette where bank records showed that Ocean Trust Limited, a company linked to Tinubu, shuffled billions of naira between its accounts with Wema Bank.\n\nThe newspaper documented the transaction between January and June 2019 on how Ocean Trust summarily moved N16.4billion from its operations accounts into a fixed deposit account all domiciled in Wema Bank.\n\nThis was after the court case involving Dayo Apara, a former Managing Director of Alpha Beta, a company partially owned by Tinubu.\n\nOcean Trust was specifically mentioned in Apara\u2019s court documents as one of the firms allegedly used to siphon funds from Alpha-Beta, the controversial Lagos tax contractor.\n\nAccording to the report, Alpha Beta has received billions of naira from the Lagos treasury since Tinubu was governor.\n\nApara claimed the firm received N150billion in the past 15 years from Lagos.",

          "text": "A report by the Nigeria Police Force has exposed how Wema Bank Plc offered bribe to the police officer investigating the N1.7billion illegally moved to account number 0122367964 domiciled in the financial institution and operated by one Isaac Adewole, a pastor of the Redeemed Christian Church of God by top officials of the bank.\n\nThe Wema Bank staff members fingered in the fraudulent activities are the bank's Executive Director, Wole Akinleye; Head of Cooperate Banking, Emmanuel Edah, and Head of Oil and Gas, Kingsley Ananwude.\n\nThe report signed by the Commander of Area G, Lagos, ACP Ibrahim Zungura, said multiple fraudulent transactions were carried out through the account.\n\n\u201cThe culpability of WEMA Bank officers was further confirmed when the officers tried to bribe investigating officers with large envelopes that contained money.\n\n\u201cThe officers declined the bribes but the Bank persisted. The officials spent time begging and persuading the inestigating officers to drop the case. The Executive Director of the Bank, Mr Wole Akinleye, was also invited and he tried hard to derail and stop the investigation. He also wrote a letter to ask that he be exonerated from the case when it was clearly established that the bank could not explain the transactions, that the movement of funds was a form of stealing from the bank which is sometimes referred to as 'pay off source'.\n\n\u201cThis is shown by the facts that the funds deposited were not removed in that order or in the sums deposited but carefully removed in different tranches as it is shown on the account statements. For his own part, Mr Adewole refused to cooperate with he investigations but instead did everything he could to assist the bank in covering up,\u201d the report exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters read.\n\nMeanwhile, the police has charged one Ojo Oladipupo, Chief Security Officer of Wema Bank Plc, to court for attempted bribery.\n\nHe was accused of offering a policeman, ASP Jonathan Egwemi (A/P No: 143699), monetary reward in order to stop him from carrying out a detail investigation into the fraudulent and money laundering activities of the bank.\n\n\u201cThat you Ojo Oladipupo \u201cM\u201d and others now at large on the same date, time and place in the aforementioned magisterial district did intentionally attempt to offer the station officer A/P No: 143699 ASP Jonathan Egwemi monetary reward in order to reframe him from carrying out a detail investigation into the fraudulent and money laundering activities of your organization i.e WEMA Bank Nigeria Plc and thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under section 64 of the criminal laws of Lagos State of Nigeria,\u201d one of the charges read.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how N1.7billion were fraudulently moved to account number 0122367964, domiciled in the financial institution and operated by Adewole.\n\nMultiple sources familiar with the fraud said Adewole, who is also the Managing Director of Shibawells Energy Limited, approached the bank in 2018 for a loan to boost his oil trading business using his neighbour\u2019s assets as collateral.\n\nGranting the loan to the pastor, the financial institution opened an account for him where the money was paid.\n\nThe account was, however, used to illegally move N1.7billion from the bank in 2021 to multiple accounts operated by top staff members and their proxies.\n\n\u201cHe used his neighbour\u2019s house for collateral of the loan which was granted to him and promised to return it within six months. But three years after, the man approached him for his house document, that was when he told him of the fraudulent act. He said the bank paid N1.7billion into the account using different multinational companies like Dana Airlines, Caverton Helicopter and two others, one N300million, one N270million, one N600million and like that, it\u2019s only one of the transactions that they didn\u2019t put a name there,\u201d a policeman involved in the case had told SaharaReporters.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: How Wema Bank Top Officials Used Redeemed Church Pastor\u2019s Account For N1.7billion Money Laundering, Fraud\n\n\u201cGuess what they do after, they now moved that N1.7billion from Adewole\u2019s account into different bank accounts in tranches. Like the one I told you \u2014N600million, they immediately put it in another account in form of N150million, N100million, N100million, N90million. The pastor\u2019s account is known as Shibawells Energy Limited. The one for Dana that they moved N160million to, that was how they did it too, they immediately sent it to another account in smaller units as well.\n\n\u201cSo the pastor approached the bank instead of the police. The top management staff involved called him and asked him what he wanted, they now ended with an agreement that the bank would give him an extra loan of N1.5billion and he agreed. Remember I told you this man is the Managing Director of Shibawells Energy Limited, a company that does supply aviation fuel. So we realised it was well planned and the names of Dana, Caverton and others were intentionally used to cover up the fraud so people won\u2019t notice. We also realised in our investigation that this money was given to the banks by the CBN and these top officials had to use an account to move it out and use it for something else.\n\n\u201cHe has a partner, we called him and realised he wasn\u2019t aware of the transaction. He was shocked, he realised the statement presented to him was forged to hide the fraudulent transaction.\u201d\n\nAccording to Adewole\u2019s statement of account obtained by SaharaReporters, on January 28 2021 via transaction ID No: M35660, he received the sum of N424,811,000 from Caverton, N160,000,000 from Dana and N630,000,000 from Beam Energy, all with the same transaction number.\n\nOn June 18, 2021 via transaction ID No: M104031, the pastor received the sum of N300,000,000 via NIP transfer from an undisclosed account source.\n\nAlso on same June 18, 2021, via transaction ID No: M104031, Adewole received the sum of N270,000,000 from Messrs Morrifoil Oil and Gas Ltd., all totalling N1,784,811,000.\n\nWhen contacted, a source at Dana Air said the airline didn\u2019t do any transaction with Adewole nor his company, Shibawells Energy Limited.\n\n\u201cIf I tell you we aren\u2019t aware of this case, then I\u2019m lying, the police some time ago invited us and we were surprised that the company\u2019s name was used for such a fraudulent transaction. It will be wrong for me to share our bank statement with you but such a transaction wasn\u2019t authorised by us,\u201d a source at Dana Air told SaharaReporters.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t involved in such a deal, only the bank management can tell you why they use Dana\u2019s name for the transaction. Go to the bank tomorrow and send money to anyone and use Dana as the sender they won\u2019t stop you from doing that. Jokes apart, if we have that kind of amount, my brother, we don\u2019t have any problem,\u201d the source added.\n\nIn January 2022, a group, Transparency Nigeria Group, asked the Central Bank of Nigeria to dismiss the Chief Executive Officer of Wema Bank, Ademola Ademise, over alleged fraud.\n\nThe group in a statement by Dahiru Mohammed, its Communications Director, alleged that Ademise had grossly abused his office as CEO of the bank and contravened several extant regulations of the CBN.\n\nAccording to the group, Wema Bank, under Ademise's watch, covered up a massive fraudulent scheme perpetrated by companies and proxies of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu.\n\nCalling for his immediate removal, TNG said, \u201cIn doing this, Mr Ademise failed in his fiduciary duties and allowed a powerful politician to use Wema Bank as a clearing house for laundered funds.\u201d\n\nThe group referred to a story dated November 23, 2020 by Peoples Gazette where bank records showed that Ocean Trust Limited, a company linked to Tinubu, shuffled billions of naira between its accounts with Wema Bank.\n\nThe newspaper documented the transaction between January and June 2019 on how Ocean Trust summarily moved N16.4billion from its operations accounts into a fixed deposit account all domiciled in Wema Bank.\n\nThis was after the court case involving Dayo Apara, a former Managing Director of Alpha Beta, a company partially owned by Tinubu.\n\nOcean Trust was specifically mentioned in Apara\u2019s court documents as one of the firms allegedly used to siphon funds from Alpha-Beta, the controversial Lagos tax contractor.\n\nAccording to the report, Alpha Beta has received billions of naira from the Lagos treasury since Tinubu was governor.\n\nApara claimed the firm received N150billion in the past 15 years from Lagos.",

          "text": "Isaac Adewole, a pastor of the Redeemed Christian Church of God has faulted the police report alleging top management staff members of Wema Bank Plc fraudulently moved N1.7 billion to his account number 0122367964, domiciled in the financial institution.\n\nThe report signed by the Commander of Area G, Lagos, ACP Ibrahim Zungura had said multiple fraudulent transactions were carried out through the account.\n\n\u201cThe culpability of WEMA Bank officers was further confirmed when the officers tried to bribe investigating officers with large envelopes that contained money.\n\n\u201cThe officers declined the bribes but the Bank persisted.

The Executive Director of the Bank, Mr Wole Akinleye, was also invited and he tried hard to derail and stop the investigation. He also wrote a letter to ask that he be exonerated from the case when it was clearly established that the bank could not explain the transactions, that the movement of funds was a form of stealing from the bank which is sometimes referred to as 'pay off source'.\n\n\u201cThis is shown by the facts that the funds deposited were not removed in that order or in the sums deposited but carefully removed in different tranches as it is shown on the account statements. For his own part, Mr Adewole refused to cooperate with the investigations but instead did everything he could to assist the bank in covering up,\u201d the report exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters had read.\n\nIn a petition to the Lagos State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Adewole, who is also the Managing Director of Shibawells Energy said the N1.7 billion transfer to his loan account was made in error and was reversed immediately.\n\nHe accused one businessman, Timi Popoola, who used his property as part of the collateral to secure the loan at the bank of planning to use the error to \u201cembarrass one of its Executive Directors over some unresolved personal feud.\u201d\n\nThe pastor added that the Commander of Area G who signed the report is a resident in one of Popoola\u2019s property in Magodo GRA Phase II, Lagos and his good friend.\n\n\u201cIn order to meet its obligations under the joint venture business, Shibahwells being an existing customer approached its bankers (Wema Bank Plc) for an additional facility in the sum of N500million. Wema Bank agreed to grant the facility on the condition that Shibahwells provide additional security in addition to the security that was provided for the existing facility.\n\n\u201cIn one of such informal discussions as friend5s and neighbours, our client mentioned the above development to Timi Popoola who without hesitation, offered to release his property in Magodo G.R.A. Phase II as part of the additional security requested by Wema Bank. Our client made full disclosure to Timi Popoola on the joint venture business between Shibahwells and Star Orient, Shibahwells\u2019 banking relationship with Wema Bank and in particular, the purpose for which the additional security was required by the bank.\n\n\u201cBased on the immediate foregoing and upon our client providing him some other consideration other than cash, Timi Popoola voluntarily released the title document for his Magodo property as part of the additional security required by Wema Bank for the facility obtained by Shibahwells. He also voluntarily executed all requisite documents in favour of Wema Bank in this regard.\n\n\u201cHaving obtained the facility from Wema Bank, Shibahwells proceeded to finance the joint venture business but soon discovered that Star Orient had substantially misrepresented the facts about its financial capacity, its facilities and operational management. With this discovery, Shibahwells was left with no option but to invest heavily in the purchase of relevant equipment which Star Orient had represented was available prior to the commencement of the joint venture business.\n\n\u201cShibahwells continued to finance the operations of the joint venture business with the facility obtained from Wema Bank. However, sometime in 2020, Shibahwells observed that Dare Osamo, the then Managing Director of Star Orient was fraudulently diverting funds meant for the joint venture business to other personal accounts, which consequently affected Shibahwells\u2019 ability to finance the facility with Wema Bank. Upon further investigation, the result of the shady and fraudulent activities of Dare Osamo in the management of the funds of the joint venture business was shown to have impacted negatively on the business such that petroleum products and funds injected into the business by Shibahwells could not be easily accounted for as a result of mismanagement by Dare Osamo.\n\n\u201cAfter careful consideration of the nature of the fraud and criminal collusion that characterized the management of the joint venture business under Dare Osamo, Shibahwells as a responsible and law-abiding corporate entity notified Wema Bank and Timi Popoola. In addition, Shibahwells reported the matter at the Zone 2 Headquarters of the Nigeria Police Force, Onikan, Lagos for thorough forensic investigation and possible prosecution.\n\n\u201cThe result of the Police investigation is now subject to criminal prosecution in Charge No. ID/15422C/2021 \u2013 The State of Lagos vs. Dare Osamo & 2 Others pending before Honourable Justice O. Ogala of the Criminal Division of the High Court of Lagos State, Ikeja. Furthermore, the investigations established a case of abuse of fiduciary/statutory duties (among other cases) against Dare Osamo during his period as Managing Director of Star Orient and this is now subject of multiple civil court actions at the Federal High Court, Lagos to wit:\n\n(a) Suit No. FHC/L/CS/874/2020\u2013Star Orient Nigeria Limited v. Dare Osamo & 2 Ors.\n\n(b) Suit No. FHC/L/CS/1017/2020\u2013Dare Osamo & Another v. Isaaki Adewole & 5 Ors.\n\n(c) Suit No. FHC/L/CS/1054/2021 \u2013 Star Orient Nigeria Limited v. Dare Osamo & Fina Trust MFB Ltd.\n\n\u201cSometime in July 2021, Timi Popoola requested for the immediate release of his title documents and discharge of his Magodo property from the Shibahwells loan obligation to Wema Bank. In response, our client stated that the process of discharge/release of the title documents would not be immediate as it would take some time, especially having regard to Shibahwells\u2019 indebtedness to Wema Bank and which indebtedness is as a result of the mismanagement of funds invested in the Star Orient/Shibahwells joint venture.\n\n\u201cTo meet Timi Popoola\u2019s demand, Shibahwells approached Wema Bank with a request to withdraw Timi Popoola\u2019s title documents from the loan obligation and to replace same with other security to be provided by the Star Orient/Shibahwells joint venture. Some of the letters by Shibahwells to Wema Bank in this regard are attached as ANNEXURE 4. In response, Wema Bank called for a reconciliation of the loan account with a view to determining the extent of Shibahwells\u2019 indebtedness to the bank. A consultant nominated by the bank was engaged to carry out the reconciliation of Shibahwells\u2019 loan account and in the course of that reconciliation, the consultant discovered that the loan account had been erroneously credited and debited with some funds at different times/dates.\n\n\u201cThe consultant brought this discovery to our client\u2019s attention and also notified Wema Bank. In reaction, Wema Bank stated that the said bank transfers into the loan account were made in error and that the same was reversed immediately on each occasion the erroneous transfers occurred. On one occasion while our client was spending time with Timi Popoola and Lanre Bamgbose, a shareholder and director in Star Orient; the issue of erroneous funds transfer to Shibahwells loan account came up for discussion whereupon each person expressed different views as to the likely origin of the funds. Our client used this opportunity to clear the doubts by informing both Timi Popoola and Lanre Bamgbose that Wema Bank had already confirmed that the transfers were made into the loan account in error and that same were reversed immediately.\n\n\u201cTo our client\u2019s shock, Timi Popoola furiously stated that he was going to leverage the bank\u2019s error to embarrass one of its Executive Directors over some unresolved personal feud. Our client immediately pleaded with Timi Popoola not to toe this path of blackmail, especially since posting funds across customers\u2019 bank accounts was typically not part of the responsibility of a bank\u2019s Executive Director. The conversation ended on this note.\n\n\u201cWith a settled expectation that the doubts around the erroneous bank transfers had been resolved, our client was surprised to receive an invite from Area G Command of the Nigeria Police Force, Ogba, Lagos on 5th November 2021. Upon honouring the police invitation on 8th November 2021, our client was informed that Timi Popoola had reported a case of suspected money laundry activities perpetrated by our client and Wema Bank.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cOur client initially wondered why the matter was reported at the Area G Command of the Nigeria Police Force, Ogba. The riddle was however resolved upon a discreet investigation which revealed that apart from being a close friend and associate of Timi Popoola, ACP Ibrahim Zungura (Area Commander, \u2018Area G\u2019 Police Command, Ogba, Lagos) is also resident in one of Timi Popoola\u2019s property in Magodo GRA Phase II, Lagos.\n\n\u201cDuring the meeting with ACP Ibrahim Zungura, our client was asked questions relating to the inflows and outflows on the Shibahwells loan account with Wema Bank. In particular, ACP Ibrahim Zungura cajoled our client to cooperate with the police so that the matter would be dispensed with at the Area G Command. Our client volunteered a written statement disclosing all he knows about the erroneous inflows and outflows on the Shibahwells loan account.\n\n\u201cOn Wednesday 9th February 2022, our client was again invited by the Area G Police Command. And upon his arrival, ACP Ibrahim Zungura in his office, informed our client (with Timi Popoola in attendance), that the matter would be referred to court for prosecution since the parties were unable to resolve the matter amicably. From ACP Ibrahim Zungura\u2019s office, our client and Kingsley Ananwude (Head of Oil & Gas, Wema Bank) were on the same day led to Court and arraigned before Magistrate A.O. Olayinka (Mrs.) of Court No. 2, Magistrates Court, Ogba, Lagos on 4-Count Charge of stealing and money laundering in Charge No. MIK/B/6/2022 \u2013 Commissioner of Police vs. Adewole Isaac & Kingsley Ananwude.\n\n\u201cAt the instance of Timi Popoola, members of the Press were in attendance in numbers at the Magistrates Court, Ogba to witness and report the arraignment of our client and the 2nd Defendant in the criminal charge. This was ostensibly to damage our client\u2019s hard-earned reputation as a businessman of almost two decades and to also bring the bank to disrepute. Although Counsel for the two Defendants applied that bail be granted in the most liberal terms, the presiding Magistrate granted bail with suffocating conditions and this resulted in the two Defendants not meeting the bail conditions until after staying at the Kirikiri Correctional facility for two consecutive nights.\n\n\u201cThe relationship between Timi Popoola and ACP Ibrahim Zungura is too proximate to be ignored and our client reasonably believes that this is why the duo have continued to wrongfully use the instrumentality of the Nigeria Police Force to harass, embarrass, intimidate, and maliciously prosecute our client and Wema Bank\u2019s official all in a bid to subject our client and the bank to ridicule and disrepute.\n\n\u201cClearly, Timi Popoola has leveraged and continues to leverage his relationship with ACP Ibrahim Zungura to intimidate and maliciously prosecute our client and the bank\u2019s official for no justifiable reason. Curiously, no fund of the bank is missing, and no customer of the bank has claimed its fund is missing. Yet, the police and Timi Popoola are pressing a criminal charge.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the police have charged one Ojo Oladipupo, Chief Security Officer of Wema Bank Plc, to court for attempted bribery.\n\nHe was accused of offering a policeman, ASP Jonathan Egwemi (A/P No: 143699), a monetary reward in order to stop him from carrying out a detailed investigation into the fraudulent and money laundering activities of the bank.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how N1.7 billion was moved to account number 0122367964, domiciled in the financial institution and operated by Adewole.\n\nAccording to Adewole\u2019s statement of account obtained by SaharaReporters, on January 28 2021 via transaction ID No: M35660, he received the sum of N424,811,000 from Caverton, N160,000,000 from Dana and N630,000,000 from Beam Energy, all with the same transaction number.\n\nOn June 18, 2021, via transaction ID No: M104031, the pastor received the sum of N300,000,000 via NIP transfer from an undisclosed account source.\n\nAlso on same June 18, 2021, via transaction ID No: M104031, Adewole received the sum of N270,000,000 from Messrs Morrifoil Oil and Gas Ltd., all totalling N1,784,811,000.\n\nWhen contacted, a source at Dana Air said the airline didn\u2019t do any transaction with Adewole nor his company, Shibawells Energy Limited.\n\n\u201cIf I tell you we aren\u2019t aware of this case, then I\u2019m lying, the police some time ago invited us and we were surprised that the company\u2019s name was used for such a fraudulent transaction.

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

Second, send a shout-out to Ogheneruemu, my copy editor. She does an excellent job with the newsletter.\n\nSo, how did your week go? I hope you\u2019re not working this weekend because I\u2019ve compiled a list of activities you can enjoy alone, with family, or with friends.\n\nIf you live alone and don\u2019t want to bother anyone this weekend, you can go to the gym, start learning a language, continue that hobby, make a bucket list, try out new recipes, write a letter to yourself, or go for evening walks while meditating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn weekends, I write letters to random people and share with them. Last year was crazy; I wrote these letters and left them on people\u2019s doorposts or gates. Haha! That was fun.\n\nAside from watching movies with your friends, you can attend an event, have an at-home spa day, play board or card games, plan a weekend trip, learn a skill online together, or make your own movie together.\n\nFinally, other than having dinner or lunch outside the house \u2013 which is okay \u2013 you can do a lot with your family this weekend. You can, for example, clean the house together, take a lot of pictures and eat home-cooked food, do a puzzle together, go to the beach or picnic together, or have a family movie night.\n\nI hope this helps you have a good time this weekend. Please, let me know if it does. So, today, I\u2019ll be talking about:\n\nKenya\u2019s tech ecosystem struggle with tech talents\n\nInstagram prioritises originality\n\nKenya\u2019s tech ecosystem could struggle with tech talents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle announced in 2021 that it would invest $1 billion in Africa over the next five years to ensure access to faster and cheaper Internet. Also, it wants to create useful, local products to support the entrepreneurs and small businesses that support Africa\u2019s economies.\n\nTo accomplish that, on Wednesday, April 19, 2022, Google announced the establishment of its first product development centre in Nairobi, Kenya\u2019s capital.\n\nHow does it plan to accomplish that? Over the next two years, Google plans to hire more than 100 people in software engineering, research, and design roles, joining Visa and Microsoft in establishing a presence in Nairobi.\n\nThis is incredible, but there is a catch. According to the Africa Developer Ecosystem Report 2021, Africa has 716,000 professional developers as of 2021, up from 700,000 in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen you compare this to, say, California, United States \u2013 which has an estimated 630,000 developers \u2013 you\u2019ll see that this is a problem.\n\nWhile these figures demonstrate the scarcity of tech talent on the continent and Kenya, don\u2019t you think local startups will lose their best team to Google? Who doesn\u2019t want to work with Google? Do you see my point now?\n\nRemember that in 2019, following the opening of Microsoft\u2019s African Development Centre and the subsequent hiring push, some local startups lost their best employees to Microsoft.\n\nWhile this launch is a fantastic opportunity for Kenya, I believe it poses a threat to local startups due to the continent\u2019s scarcity of tech talent. What are your thoughts?\n\nBy the way, some Kenyan experts provided their perspectives on this, which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy reading. Want to see it? Please check it here: Kenyan entrepreneurs welcome Google\u2019s product development center but could struggle to hold on to talent\n\nPlease don\u2019t forget to leave your thoughts.\n\nTABS Web3 Hackathon 2022: $2,500 in cash prizes to be won\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit is dedicated to making sense of the Web3 buzz, but we also want to reward Web3 solutions.

This would also help to prioritise the distribution of original content over reposted content in places like the Reels tab and feed.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means the social media giant will be less likely to recommend reposts of existing Reels and content from other social media platforms like Twitter and TikTok.\n\nAlso, accounts that aggregate and reshare other users\u2019 content will be less likely to be recommended by the company.\n\nWhy? According to Mosseri, the aim is to focus on the concept of originality. \u201cIf you create something from scratch, you should get more credit than if you are resharing something that you found from someone else. We\u2019re going to do more to try and value original content more, particularly compared to reposted content,\u201d he says.\n\nBut how can Instagram determine a post\u2019s originality? The CEO said in a tweet that they \u201ccan\u2019t know for sure\u201d how they can determine the original creator of a post. He did, however, explain that the company creates classifiers to predict how likely something is to be original. Also, Instagram considers who is in the video and whether the app has seen the video before.\n\nMoreover, the company has already implemented measures to reduce resharing. In February 2021, the algorithm began devaluing reshared Reels with the TikTok logo. The platform wanted people to stop posting recycled TikToks to Reels by 2021.\n\nBesides, Instagram announced that it was releasing new best practices on its @creators account to teach Instagram users how to create content that will be seen and shared.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Mosseri mentioned two recent product launches: product tagging and enhanced tagging. Users will be able to tag products from businesses set up for Instagram Shopping with product tagging, which was launched this week. This feature is currently unavailable to African users.\n\nHowever, the company claims that the expansion will make it easier for people to discover products from people they follow and for businesses to grow their audience on the platform.\n\nAdditionally, the enhanced tags \u2013 which were introduced earlier in March 2022\u2013 will make it easier for creators to receive credit for their work. According to Instagram, the enhanced tags allow users to share and view a creator\u2019s specific contribution to a photo or video post.\n\nWhile reducing reshared content may initially harm some accounts, it is likely critical for Reels\u2019 long-term viability. Or what\u2019d you think?\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle has announced the launch of Equiano, a state of the art submarine Internet cable, which is set to land in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nGoogle, alongside one of its major partners, West Indian Ocean Cable Company (WIOCC), made this known today at a virtual launch event. Per reports from both companies, the cable is scheduled to land on Friday, April 29, 2022.\n\nThe Internet cable, named after Olaudah Equiano, a historical abolitionist, has a capacity of 144 terabits (18 Terabytes). Per the tech giant, it will be introducing 20 times more power and higher levels of durability than the last cable built to serve the West African region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering, submarine Internet cables are one of the primary reasons you can seamlessly read this article, stream content on YouTube and Netflix, and upload content to WhatsApp and Instagram. A full explanation of how this works will probably require a short course, but don\u2019t worry. This piece and some of our upcoming articles should help it make sense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThink back to 2003. Very few people had phones and computers, and accessing the Internet required buying time in cybercafes and making the most of it (coughs in overnight browsing). Even when phones became increasingly available, you would likely waste precious time loading a page with several pictures or trying to stream a video.\n\nAs more entrepreneurs increased their interest in Africa, technology began to improve. One of the landmark moments was in 2009, during the launch of the MainOne submarine cable, a private submarine cable that today spans Nigeria, Ghana, and Cote d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nSubsequently, companies like Glo and MTN launched their submarine cables in Nigeria.\n\nAs we explained in this piece, you can certainly draw parallels between these submarine cable launches and increased Internet speeds in Nigeria. With increased Internet speeds came the explosion of technology-enabled businesses, which, in turn, led to increased funding and job creation. See where we\u2019re going with this?\n\nHowever, Internet speeds in Nigeria, nay Africa, pale in comparison to other developed countries. When you look at the cost of purchasing data relative to the average income in Nigeria, you\u2019ll realise that there\u2019s still much work to be done.\n\nGoogle\u2019s submarine cable could change Nigeria\u2019s Internet experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on your location, your current mobile download speed could be a little higher or lower than 18.7 Mbps. If you don\u2019t live in an urban area, it\u2019s likely to be much slower.\n\nInterestingly, if we believe Google\u2019s claim, Equiano could bring 6x much faster Internet, leaving you above or below 112 Mbps. A considerable leap when you consider several factors.\n\nIf you currently have a download speed of 18.7 Mbps, it will take you over 7 minutes to download a 1GB file. All things being equal, Google\u2019s Internet cable could help drop that download time to 1.2 minutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother major win could lie in the speed and efficiency of your financial transactions. You\u2019d experience less time waiting for your mobile banking app to load and, hopefully, less waiting time for credit and debit alerts.\n\nAlso, two out of four Nigerian telecom companies currently offer 1GB of mobile data at \u20a6666, but all things being equal, this could drop to \u20a6140.\n\nThese numbers alone may not do justice to this cable\u2019s possible benefits. Juliet Ehimuan, Director, West Africa at Google, believes we\u2019ll see the ripple effects in other sectors of the economy.\n\nPer Ehimuan, that means a $10.1 billion increase in Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 1.6 million indirect jobs.\n\n\u201cLook at the activities going on in Nigeria right now, even with the challenges of data costs, and Internet speeds, now imagine a situation where data prices come down by a factor of 20, and you have 6x the speed you have right now. People are going to be able to do more things, Ehimuan said in an exclusive interview with Techpoint Africa.\n\nShe points to the growing number of African content creators on YouTube and how this could help them monetise their content by attracting a global audience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also been talking about diversifying the economy, and technology provides an important way to do that where we\u2019re exporting creative content and getting foreign investment. Imagine the additional income and commercial success that we could have from 1.6 million jobs,\u201d Ehimuan said.\n\nThese benefits seem impressive, but you\u2019re probably asking yourself how they can be implemented?\n\nHow can Google fulfil its mission?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmarine cables have immense potential benefits, but we\u2019ll not see them if suitable measures are not in place to leverage their capabilities. As subsea cables arrive on the coast, terrestrial cables help to get the Internet capacity to our homes and offices.\n\nThere\u2019s a vast submarine cable capacity in Africa that still doesn\u2019t reflect on your download speeds or streaming quality.\n\nAs of 2020, Africa had a submarine cable capacity of 100 Tbps, but it was only using 10%. Estimates from industry insiders we spoke to have us believe that this has increased to 30%.\n\nIn a nutshell, Google\u2019s promise of faster and cheaper Internet in three years will only happen if the right parameters are in place.\n\nEhimuan hinted that Google would need the help of several stakeholders to help get this cable capacity to the people and businesses that need it.\n\n\u201cThere are issues around right-of-way, double taxation at the federal and state level, cable cuts due to construction, power, and vandalism. That\u2019s why multiple stakeholders have to play a role in infrastructure expansion. There\u2019s a role for the government to play and a role for the private sector.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s partnership with WIOCC points to some exciting developments on the private sector level.\n\nWIOCC is building a Tier 111 data centre (Open Access Data Centre) in Lekki, Lagos \u2014 another major infrastructure that amplifies all the benefits of a submarine cable we listed earlier.\n\nThe Equiano cable will be connected to that data centre, from where the company plans to spread capacity across the nation.\n\nChris Wood, WIOCC CEO, revealed that Equiano\u2019s open-access technology makes it easier for any telecom service provider to spread this capacity across the country.\n\nThe company has partnered with Phase3 Telecom and Western Telecommunications to aid capacity expansion across Nigeria.\n\n\u201cPhase3 has an extensive cable network in Nigeria, so it would be critical to our expansion to cities outside of Lagos. Western Telecommunications would help us spread our presence across Lagos through their fibre ducts,\u201d he said.\n\nRecall that in 2020, the Lagos State Government introduced a dig-once policy and Western Telecommunications was one of the companies to win the contract.\n\nYou see, laying fibre cables around cities is quite cumbersome. If MTN digs today, Airtel might have to dig tomorrow and could accidentally cut MTN\u2019s cable. Lagos\u2019 dig-once policy creates a scenario where one company digs and other companies tap into that network.\n\nWood and Ehimuan agree that this launch helps shore up infrastructure for the future.\n\n\u201cMore data will be generated in the next three years than has been created in the last thirty years,\u201d Wood avered.\n\nPer Ehimuan, an enabling business environment would go a long way in helping Nigeria realise its obvious potential and fully leverage its growing technology space.\n\nStay tuned for our commentary on Airtel and MainOne\u2019s data centres and Lagos\u2019 rise into a technology hub If you\u2019re curious. Meanwhile, we can only hope for the best following Equiano\u2019s launch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator. Tech, business and policies fills my head. Looking to chat?

          "title": "Blockchain-powered insurance: Meet the decentralised insurance protocol, Etherisc, insuring Kenyan farms against bad climate",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of decentralised insurance became a theoretical possibility with the emergence of decentralised finance (DeFi). Etherisc is bringing this concept to life, helping African farmers insure their crops against bad weather.\n\nWhile DeFi platforms continue to offer borrowing, lending, and staking services, Etherisc, an open-source, decentralised insurance protocol, brings affordable insurance to African farmers away from the complex DeFi protocols.\n\nTechpoint Africa spoke to Michiel Berende, Chief Inclusive Officer at Etherisc, and he revealed how more than 22,000 farmers got access to an insurance plan without the many steps associated with conventional insurance.\n\nFrom traditional insurance to decentralised insurance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtherisc team with Keyan locals\n\nBerende has been in the insurance space since the early 2000s. While he was an underwriter at an insurance company in the Netherlands, he was interested in information technology and eventually made the switch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, his challenges saw him develop an interest in microfinance and emerging markets.\n\nBerende\u2019s first task was to help an Indian microfinance organisation set up its activities in the country in 2005. He was responsible for setting up the organisation\u2019s financial operations and deploying the software to run those operations, and his ample experience in finance and technology came in handy.\n\n\n\nEven though Berende\u2019s assignment was similar to what he\u2019d taken on in the Netherlands, it was difficult to replicate his success putting financial operations in place in an emerging market because of limited resources and the extra creativity required to offer financial services in rural areas.\n\n\u201cIt changed my view on how things are going in the world, and it doesn\u2019t work everywhere in the world the same way it works in the Netherlands. I enjoyed it, and it moved me to go and live in India,\u201d Berende said.\n\nAfter spending one year in India, he became a consultant in 2007, focusing on technologies for microinsurance. And this allowed him to work on projects in other emerging markets such as Africa.\n\nBut Berende soon realised that insurance was not a thing in Africa; interestingly, not much has changed in 2022, 15 years later.\n\nAfrica makes up 16.72% of the world\u2019s population, but it represents less than 1% of insured losses globally.\n\nAccording to the Africa Insurance Pulse 2022, insurance penetration in Africa stood at 2.78%, a decline from 2.98% in the previous year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEunice Kinungi, a Kenyan Insurance professional and CEO of Griffin Insurance, told New African magazine that \u201cthe continent still lacks flexible, affordable, and tailored policies that will unlock insurance for the African consumer.\u201d\n\nBesides the problem of unaffordability and inflexibility of insurance, Africans view insurance through the lens of superstition. Bode Pedro, CEO of Casava, a Nigerian insurtech company, told TechCrunch that the reason for low insurance penetration is that people prefer to invest in positive rather than adverse outcomes.\n\nKinungi also believes that insurance doesn\u2019t have a good reputation in Africa. She said, \u201cinsurance, unfortunately, does not have the best reputation, and there is a general distrust of insurance companies perpetuated by poor customer service and unpaid claims.\u201d\n\nBerende agrees with Kinungi and Pedro\u2019s take on why insurance in Africa is not yet a thing, reiterating the need to create products that fit the African market.\n\n\u201cIf you have people with limited resources, the insurance products must be very cheap.\u201d\n\nHow Etherisc is creating cheaper decentralised insurance with blockchain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the statistics on insurance in Africa showing that legacy insurance systems cannot increase insurance penetration, Berende dedicated himself to finding technologies that would make insurance affordable and exciting to Africans.\n\nOn his quest, he discovered Bitcoin in 2013 and came a step closer to his goal.\n\n\u201cWhat I find interesting about Bitcoin is that it makes it easy to transfer small amounts of money from A to B without a middle-man at a low cost. I delved a little more into it and discovered the technology behind it \u2014 blockchain.\u201d\n\nBerende\u2019s blockchain discovery led to another quest to create blockchain-based solutions, most of which revolve around the one thing that has popularised the technology \u2014 cryptocurrencies. Interestingly, blockchain, which secures crypto transactions with a network of computers that record these transactions simultaneously, has not seen many applications beyond crypto.\n\nHowever, Etherisc started to infuse blockchain solutions beyond crypto in 2016, and it wasn\u2019t long before Berende found the team behind it.\n\nCombining his insurance background with his desire to create inclusive finance with modern technology, Berende was an automatic fit for Etherisc, and he joined the team.\n\nEtherisc created a decentralised open-source insurance platform on the Ethereum blockchain, called the Generic Insurance Framework. This framework allows for the easy digitisation of parametric insurance products.\n\nWhat is parametric insurance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Etherisc\n\nParametric insurance, according to Berende, is a type of insurance that executes payment based on external parameters.\n\nUsing a flight delay example, he explained that if a person insures their flight ticket against a delay, they get a payout once there\u2019s a delay.\n\nHe gave another example using a farmer. If a farm is insured against heavy rains, the farmer gets indemnified if such rains destroy their farms.\n\nInsurance companies do not dispute or investigate parametric insurance claims because the data that determines the payout is usually publicly available and unalterable.\n\nThis makes automating insurance products easy, and that is where blockchain comes into play.\n\nSmart contracts, a mechanism for carrying out blockchain actions, are a major part of Etherisc\u2019s operations. Smart contracts are programs written on a blockchain to run when predetermined conditions are met.\n\nA simple analogy to understanding how smart contracts work is automating your bank account to make a payment once you receive a specific delivery.\n\nSay you\u2019re expecting a truckload of yams but don\u2019t want to make payment until you have taken delivery. So you install devices in your warehouse that can tell when a certain number of tubers has been delivered. After which, these devices signal the smart contract, which initiates payment.\n\nHowever, the beauty of smart contracts is that no one \u2014 neither you nor the delivery company \u2014 can alter the predetermined condition.\n\nEtherisc has harnessed the trustless nature of this technology to create an insurance system that can work without many people. The zero delivery cost also means it is cheaper to run.\n\nNote: In this context, \u201ctrustless\u201d means the parties involved do not necessarily need to trust themselves to complete transactions.\n\nInsuring 22,000 farms with decentralised insurance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtherisc partnered with Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise (ACRE) Africa, a licensed insurance intermediary that helps farmers reduce agricultural and climate risks, to provide micro-insurance at affordable terms for smallholder farmers.\n\nA blockchain solution to insurance for farmers has to be simple to get any traction; a challenge Etherisc had a simple solution to.\n\nThe product Etherisc provides for the farmers is a weather index insurance that covers farmers when the weather prevents them from having a good harvest.\n\nAccording to Berende, 22,000 farmers in Kenya have accessed this insurance product.\n\nBut how does one distribute significantly advanced tech insurance products that are automated based on climate conditions to farmers?\n\nBerende\u2019s solution is simple. The bags of seeds that farmers buy come with scratch cards. When they send the numbers on these cards via Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), Etherisc\u2019s Generic Insurance Framework captures their geolocation and receives information about the area\u2019s climatic conditions with satellite data.\n\nHow do farmers pay the premium for decentralised insurance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: ACRE Africa\n\nFarmers pay the $0.5 premium when they buy their bags of seeds from ACRE at a lower price that incorporates the insurance cost. Insurance can also be paid with mobile banking.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to send an insurance surveyor into the field to monitor if something has happened. A process that would naturally cost a lot of money,\u201d Berende said.\n\nIs satellite data accurate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSatellite\n\nWhile Etherisc\u2019s insurance products reduce dependency on humans, the reliability of the non-human parts of its operation is in question.\n\nAccording to Climate analysis with satellite versus weather station data, a paper published in 2007 by Mendelsohn et al., satellite data performs slightly better than data captured from the ground.\n\nThe paper is based on a study that examines how well satellite and weather station data explain agricultural performance. It concludes that the satellite\u2019s ability to see the entirety of a landscape makes it record more accurate data when measuring temperature.\n\nHowever, satellite data is not as precise as data obtained from the ground when measuring precipitation. While Etherisc\u2019s insurance product can accurately measure droughts, it might not measure rainfall correctly.\n\nA more recent take from the communications team at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory tilts towards ground thermometers rather than satellites when measuring the earth\u2019s temperature.\n\nBerende, however, assures us that it is getting better.\n\n\u201cIn the past two seasons, the satellite data covered 10\u00d710 km. For this year, we\u2019re in the process of increasing the resolution to 5\u00d75 km,\u201d he said.\n\nLooking beyond the limitations of satellite technology, blockchain, the Internet of things (IoT), and other technologies could be a compelling solution to Africa\u2019s low insurance penetration problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "The first lady, Aisha Buhari, has urged political parties to always consider women as running mates to candidates contesting elections into various positions across the country.\n\nBuhari was speaking on Saturday night when she hosted Presidential Aspirants from various political parties to a Ramadan (Iftar) breakfast at the State House, Abuja.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Iftar was organised by the first lady to provide opportunity for the aspirants to share love and happiness with one another in the spirit of Ramadan and in a quest for nation building.\n\nShe said, fair-play for women in politics was to ensure their greater participation in elective positions.\n\n\u201c In fact, it is high time women are adopted as running mates at all levels considering their voting strength and active involvement in political processes.\n\n\u201cAs we approach the 2023 election with greater hope, I am confident that Nigeria will continue to grow from strength to strength on the pedestal of our democratic tenets\u201d she said.\n\nThe first lady, enjoined the presidential hopefuls to remain focused on issues that strengthened the nation`s unity, brotherhood and national cohesion.\n\nBuhari, however, reminded her guests that, the 2015 election was a watershed in the history of Nigeria.\n\n\u201c It was neither contested in the court of law, nor in the court of public opinion.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the greatest end-of-tenure gift that fellow Nigerians can give to the first family is another free and globally-acknowledged fair election come 2023\u2019,\u2019 she appealed.\n\nShe urged all the aspirants to ensure tolerance, fair-play and avoid violent tendencies by building bridges where necessary, especially during electioneering campaigns.\n\nOn his part, the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, represented by a former governor of Edo, Prof. Oserheimen Osunbor, urged all aspirants to play politics without bitterness.\n\nOsinbajo said the event offered Nigerians from different faiths and background the opportunity to reunite with one another to foster unity.\n\n\u201c It is an opportunity for aspirants from various political parties to meet one another and the lesson we should learn from here is to practise politics without bitterness as we move closer to election year.\n\n\u201c We should try to imbibe the spirit of oneness because at the end of the only one person is going to emerge winner of the Presidential election next year.\n\n\u201c So, it is not going to be do-or-die affairs, we should learn to practise politics without bitterness, \u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOne of the APC aspirants and former governor of Lagos State, Sen. Bola Tinubu, expressed gratitude to the first lady for bringing the diverse groups of Nigerians to share love and unity.\n\nTinubu, however, prayed for brotherliness, peace, unity and prosperity of Nigeria.\n\nOn his part, Gov. Dave Umahi of Ebonyi and APC aspirant, expressed appreciation to the first lady for bringing the presidential aspirants together to foster unity and nation cohesion.\n\n\u201c I must also thank you because this should be about our nation, about our patriotism, we should always place our nation above our individual interests.\n\n\u201c As we have aspired to lead this nation, I think that Nigerians should be able to evaluate, is not going to be promises, is going to be ticking the box.\n\n\u201c The opportunity given to us as leaders, what did we do with it, so, this kind of gathering is highly encouraged because it is going to douse a lot of tensions,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nGov. Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State and PDP presidential aspirant , said the gathering was historic going by the calibre of people in attendance.\n\nMohammed promised to play the game with humility and mutual respect.\n\n\u201c I promise to do the politicking with the interest of Nigeria in my mind, respect for one another irrespective of our party differences,\u2019\u2019 he said.",

          "title": "APC, PDP primaries: The battle before the real war",
          "text": "With the announcement of the date for the presidential primaries in Nigeria\u2019s two major political parties, aspirants are now intensifying their strategies on how to clinch the ticket of their parties.\n\nWith the array of presidential aspirants already on parade, the real battle is expected to take place at the primaries.\n\nIt is also expected that the next weeks leading up to the primaries would witness serious political intrigues, alignment and realignment of forces.\n\nThere are high level consultations by aspirants who crisscross the length and breadth of the country seeking endorsements by some powerful elements, particularly from those touted to \u201cown the country.\u201d\n\nThe People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) are scheduled to hold delegate primaries next month ahead of the June 3, deadline for the submission of candidates by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nIn both parties the primaries are expected to be keenly contested among the leading aspirants, partly due to the winner-take-all kind of politics played in Nigeria.\n\nIn the last few months, several leading politicians have publicly signified their interest to contest their party presidential ticket in the two major parties.\n\nAlthough it is presumed that some of the aspirants are not serious about their ambition and are only in the race to negotiate their political future, no aspirant will go to bed and sleep on the assumption that other aspirants were featherweight contestants.\n\nObservers also said that part of the reason the primaries would be a battle is the high cost of the nomination forms.\n\n\u201cWhat may likely raise the tempo of the contest at the primary level is the high cost of forms. Even the PDP where the form was sold for N40million, an aspirant losing such an amount of money would feel it for some days.\n\nEven if the money did not come from their pocket, those who contributed the money for them were expecting that they would reap someday.\n\nThen, in the APC, N100million form is not a joke, especially when there is no guarantee or promise of any form of refund in the event that an aspirant fails to clinch the ticket. So, it is going to be a serious battle,\u201d Rufus Onye, a grassroots politician, told BusinessDay.\n\nThe APC last week fixed its presidential nomination and expression of interest forms at N100 million.\n\nThe expression of interest form for presidential aspirants is expected to go for N30 million while the nomination form is pegged at N70 million.\n\nThis, however, contrasts with the N40 million that the main opposition party, the PDP, is charging its presidential aspirants, comprising N35 million for nomination forms and N5 million for expression of interest forms.\n\nIn the PDP, there are seventeen top politicians jostling for the ticket at the presidential primary slated for May 29.\n\nSome of the aspirants are former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar; Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal; a United States-based medical doctor, Nwachukwu Anakwenze; Newspaper publisher, Dele Momodu; Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike; Investment Banker and Economist, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen; former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi; Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Emmanuel and a Pharmacist, Sam Ohuabunwa.\n\nAlso in the APC, several notable politicians have declared interest in clinching the presidential ticket they are, Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State; Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State; former Abia governor and serving senator, Orji Uzor Kalu, former Imo governor and senator, Rochas Okorocha, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Bola Ahmed Tinubu; Transport Minister, Rotimi Amaechi, Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, among others.\n\nVoting at the primaries is expected to be done by delegates, an affair that has often witnessed moneybags politicians deploy funds to bribe or secure the votes of the delegates.\n\nHowever, since incumbent governors are in control of the party structure in their states, they often hold the ace in party primaries in Nigerian politics in the last few decades.\n\nThis makes their support crucial for any aspirant to emerge victorious.\n\nAhead of the primaries in the two parties, observers say that the support of incumbent governors and the aspirants\u2019 ability to win the heart of Northern delegates which often are the majority would be crucial for success.\n\nThey said that the presidential aspirants would need to get substantial numbers of the governors to their side.\n\n\u201cPolitics is about negotiation and renegotiation; they have to consult and re-consult the party\u2019s delegates to seek their votes during the primaries. Mind you, the delegates\u2019 list and most often the governors control the delegates on how and who to vote for,\u201d Kunle Okunola, a political analyst, said.\n\nOkunola added that the presidential aspirants\u2019 strong relationships with the governors and some members of the National Assembly hold the ace in party primaries in Nigerian politics.\n\n\u201cI know by now, many aspirants would have promised and assured the governors and NASS members of some advantages if they emerge victorious in 2023.\n\n\u201cPolitics is about negotiation and renegotiation, so several bargaining will definitely be going on right now both in the APC and the PDP,\u201d he added.\n\nSimilarly, Public Affairs Analyst, Tinu Oke, said having the backing of North delegates would be crucial towards the victory of any aspirant at the primaries since they would form the bulk of the delegates.\n\nHe, however, stressed that the delegates and the party would want an individual with wide support nationally and strong financial strength so that they can do well in the main election.\n\nRead also: Nomination fee: PDP sees APC inflicting maximum pain on members\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is worthy of note that the North would be another factor. As it is constituted in both parties, the north controls 60 percent of the delegates while the south controls 40 percent.\n\n\u201cThe implication of this is that whoever the North supports would definitely emerge the candidate because the region is known for its unity in any presidential convention.\n\nSpeaking further, he said, the real battle would be for Northern votes, adding that in most instances the Northern leaders know who they are supporting.\n\n\u201cIn the South, the story is different because the major candidates can only get delegates from their geo-political zone.\n\n\u201cSo, it will be a battle for Northern votes and the northern leaders Know who they are supporting.\n\n\u201cMoney would be a defining factor in the primaries both in APC and PDP because both parties are setting for delegate convention,\u201d Oke stressed.\n\nBut Aloysius-Michaels Okolie, a professor of Political Science, berated the manner primaries are being conducted in the country, noting that the current practices where governors hijack delegates was not healthy for democracy and had contributed to bad governance and the emergence of irresponsive and irresponsible leaders.\n\nHe advocated for a holistic change in the manner presidential primaries are conducted in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThat is why they want indirect primaries; what we have is a system where few people, I mean cabal, would just choose who they want as delegates and these people would go on and do blind voting according to what the governors say.\n\n\u201cThat is the reason why Nigeria is like this, leaders have failed; they distorted governance and it is undemocratic and would not lead us anywhere.\u201d\n\nUnlike President Buhari\u2019s intervention before the APC\u2019s recent National Convention where he anointed Abdullahi Adamu as the consensus candidate for the party\u2019s national chairman, he has said nothing about anointing any of the Presidential aspirants before the convention. But he has recently advised the Adamu-led National Working Committee (NWC) of the party to provide a level playing field for all aspirants during the primaries.\n\nIn APC, the game is still open despite the talks about \u201canointing\u201d by President Buhari. Buhari\u2019s influence, if there will be any, would be seen after the primaries.\n\nBusinessDaySunday gathered that it is difficult for any of the APC aspirants to go to bed with the mindset that he is the preferred candidate of the President, as anything can happen within a matter of minutes.\n\nThe politician, who spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity, referred to what happened to the former governor Peter Odili, who had begun to parade himself as the would-be running mate to Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, but the arrangement changed in a twinkle of an eye right at the venue of the Convention in 2007.\n\n\u201cGovernor Peter Odili waited at the Eagle Square with the delegates from Rivers State, to hear the last word if anything could change. There was a lot of going forward and backwards; a lot of wheeling and dealing. It was a political coup as far as he was concerned. In every political gathering all over the world, there are intrigues; a lot of things happen. Nothing is sacrosanct until the primary is over. It is a game that the person that comes to smile at you now, the next moment, when he wants to vote changes his mind and drops his ballot for another person, and you are still thinking he has voted for you,\u201d the politician said.\n\nIn PDP also, observers say that unless there is consensus before the primaries, it would be a fight to the finish.\n\nKingsley Aru, a political scientist, said that with the level of desperation that some of the aspirants on the PDP platform are going about their aspiration, it could be a bitter primary, except reason prevails towards the day of the exercise.\n\n\u201cI hear that there are talks going on among some aspirants on who would step down for whom? If that succeeds and the decide and resolve to work together as a party, PDP may have a chance of winning the Presidential election in 2023 because a lot of public sentiment is leaning towards them as a result of certain considerations,\u201d Aru said.",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nWhen the story of Nigeria\u2019s most accomplished women, be it in the sphere of politics and governance or entrepreneurship, is written, Mrs. Oyibo Ekwulo Odinamadu, who walked away from mortal earth at 94, on March 30, quietly, largely unsung, will belong right at the top as one of the finest the country has ever produced.\n\nAda Awkuzu, Ichie Odinamadu, MON, Akwuba, in her day, trodded the country\u2019s political landscape like a true giant, and by the time she retired to quite life in her home state of Anambra on account of advanced age, she had accomplished great feats, as first of many things.\n\nShe was, it\u2019s been said, the first female university graduate from the former Eastern Region of Nigeria; the first Igbo woman to get a driving license and drive a car; as well as the first indigenous principal of both Womens\u2019 Training College Enugu (WTC) (1962) and Queens School Enugu (1970).\n\nShe was, too, the 1st National Vice-President of the Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN) to the late sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, in the Second Republic.\n\nOdinamadu had in 1978 called the shots in the party as Awolowo\u2019s confidant and deputy preparatory to the 1979 polls which the UPN lost to the National Party of Nigeria at the Supreme Court in the historic and controversial judgment of 12 2/3 fame argued by the late Chief Richard Akinjide.\n\nIn 1979, she became the deputy governorship candidate of the party in Anambra State.\n\nShe was elected the first national vice-president of the party, a position she held until the party, among the others, was proscribed by the General Muhammadu Buhari (rtd), now president of the country, and Brig. Tunde Idiagbon during their military administration, after their palace coup d\u2019etat of January, 1984.\n\nA statement by her son, Chief Osita Odinamadu, announcing her death, said she was also the first female university graduate from the former Eastern Region of the country, having graduated with the Bachelor of Arts in Education (History/Sociology) from Lincoln University of Missouri in 1952.\n\nShe later had Master of Arts in Education (Social and Philosophical Foundations) from Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, U.S. in 1953.\n\nGiving a brief on her history, the statement said she was born to Mr. Jacob Ekemezie Akwuba and Mrs. Dinah Mgboye Akwuba of Awkuzu town in Oyi Local Government Area of Anambra State of Nigeria, on Jan. 2, 1928.\n\nThe late Oyibo married Benedict Obidimma Odinamadu in 1957 and they were blessed with four children \u2013 two boys and two girls.\n\nA staunch Christian, she was a Knight of St. Christopher of the Church Of Nigeria, (K.S.C) Anglican Communion, and was a retired public servant.\n\nShe returned home early in 1954 was employed as the Assistant Secretary with the Eastern Development Corporation the same year up to 1957 and, thereafter, as an Education Officer with the Ministry of Education.\n\nShe was appointed to various Government Boards and Parastatals between 1955 and 1999 including: Member of the Film Censorship Board; was a founding member of the Eastern Nigeria Women\u2019s Amateur Athletic Association and served as its first Secretary.\n\nShe joined the Festival of the Arts Committee in 1955 on which she served until 1972 after the Nigeria \u2013 Biafra War.\n\nIn her career she rose to the rank of Inspector of Education and retired voluntarily in 1971.\n\nPursuing her literary interests, she published a book in 1980 entitled: \u201cThe Dilemma of The Igbo Political Elite\u2019\u2019, and was about to finalise the manuscript of a book, on her Igbo Customs Series, entitled: \u201cWomen In Igbo Land\u2019\u2019, to be published in two parts.\n\nShe was also working on another manuscript entitled: \u201cMy Journey Through Life: A Part Of History.\u201d\n\nAn Activist for Fundamental Human Rights for Women, she was inducted into the Nigerian National Women\u2019s Hall Of Fame 2004.\n\nShe instituted the Oyibo Odinamadu Foundation, which works to:\n\ni. Support programs of Head-Start Kindergarten Education for children aged two to five years in Eastern Nigeria;\n\nii. Focus attention on issues of the denial of fundamental human rights to women and children, especially to the girl-child and widows, under OMENANA practices of Igbo traditional Native Laws and Customs;\n\nThe Foundation works to help sustain the clarion call for attention to be directed to these oppressive and punitive practices, locally, nationally and internationally.\n\nThis is in sustained effort to bring pressures to bear continuously on the appropriate authorities for the reformation or abrogation of these laws and practices that oppress women and the girl-child.\n\niii. Continue with the efforts that focus attention on the societal ills of Nigeria, and towards their amelioration.\n\nThe statement said the children had promised to accomplish her No. i Project through donations of materials for instruction and would approach No. ii & iii through writing and publishing of articles and books, as well as by sometimes speaking under the Igbo Customs Series programme",

We are very excited about the Human Resource Transformation exercise as the report will assist the Commission in profound ways that will lead to optimal productivity of staff,\u201d Yuguda said.\n\n\u201cWhat you are doing is commendable, you are looking at African financial markets and trying to assist to ensure that productivity and development is enhanced. We therefore assure you that these investments are well placed and we will continue to work to earn the confidence that you have in us.\n\n\u201cWe are glad with all the assistance we have received, the Master plan review has been concluded by PWC and we hope that the implementation of the Capital Market Master Plan will deepen our market and improve the capital market\u2019s contribution to our economic growth and national development. To this end, the review of the Capital Market Master Plan better positions the SEC to deliver on these objectives in these very challenging times. The FSD Africa and SEC Nigeria\u2019s laudable partnership underscores our mutual goals to build financial markets that are robust, efficient and above all inclusive.\u201d\n\nThe SEC DG noted further that the current Management is also looking at other sources of support so that the march towards that Commission that everyone wants to see in the future is very fast and very efficient.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has also been doing a number of things to ensure that the aim of these support is not defeated. Since we came in we have prioritised the issue of human resource management, we want to leave behind a culture of excellence,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThank you for the considerable assistance on IT. What we have done too is to explore domestic sources of funding for our IT infrastructure and thankfully, we are making tremendous progress in that regard,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his remarks, Chief Executive Office FDS Africa, Mr. Mike Napier expressed excitement that the SEC decided to embark on the various initiatives in a bid to have a stronger and better capital market regulator which translates into a well regulated market.\n\nNapier said well-functioning capital markets can play a vital role in support of inclusive economic growth by channelling long term finance into infrastructure and other large-scale projects that create jobs and improve access to markets, adding that trengthening regulatory capacity in capital markets is an essential pre-condition for building investor confidence.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are very happy that you have taken these challenges to embark on these various initiatives to ensure that your processes are better which will ultimately lead to a better regulator for the capital market.\n\n\u201cIn FSD Africa we are embracing innovation and that is why we are providing support for these various projects, it is a long journey but we know we will get there at the end of it all,\u201d he stated.\n\nNapier expressed satisfaction with the SEC for embracing innovation in a bid to becoming a progressive regulator stating that across Africa there are not many organisations that are able to do this especially given the issues of paucity of funds.\n\n\u201cThe big one would be when the market players note the changes in the SEC and the transformations that have taken place. We are glad you are on that journey and we hope it will end well,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Pandemonium was let loose in Kajola community, Odigbo local government area of Ondo State on Saturday as youths in their hundreds mobilised to burn the police station in the area over alleged police recklessness, leading to the death of three persons including a traditional community head (Baale).\n\nThe angry mob thronged the Police Divisional Headquarters in Kajola over the alleged killing indigenes at the police checkpoints in the area, located along Lagos/Benin Expressway on Saturday evening.\n\nThey dumped the three corpses at the Police Divisional Headquarters, Kajola, chanting protest songs to register their grievances and declared that they do not want to see police in the community again.\n\nThe victims, namely David Olowofeyekun, Gbenga Abayomi and Kola Akinduro, who was the Head of Korede Village, were on a motorcycle and heading home from their farms when the incident happened.\n\nSources in the community narrated that the police officers in the community were fond of extorting and harassing the residents of the area at the checkpoint despite the order by the Commissioner of Police dismantling all checkpoints in the state.\n\nRecall that the Commissioner of Police, Oyeyemi Oyediran, had ordered that all police roadblocks and checkpoints be dismantled immediately he was transferred to the state few days to New Year celebration.\n\nAn eyewitness, Funmi Olowogboye, recounted that the police stopped the deceased at the checkpoint on Saturday evening and while trying to stop an oncoming hilux van, the driver maneuvered to evade the police and in the process ran into the motorcycle conveying the trio.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOlowogboye lamented that the hilux driver crushed the three victims on the motorcycle where they were parked on the instruction of the police officers, who wanted to collect money from them; and they died on the spot.\n\nHe, alongside other sources who spoke with journalists at the police station, identified a notorious police officer, popularly called Major, as the rig-leader of the extortion squad on the highway and in the community\n\nThey demanded that the police officer, Major, be transferred out of the community, revealing that he has spent over 17 years in the area without transfer due to the atrocities he committed in the area to make money.\n\nA community leader, Chief Oloruntobi Maiyegun, who spoke with journalists on phone, recounted that he had to spring into action the moment he heard that the people were mobilising to burn the police station.\n\nMaiyegun, who was presently out of town to Delta State, said he mobilised Amotekun and other security agencies to the scene immediately to forestall breakdown of law and order. He enjoined the residents not to take law into their hands.\n\nIt took the prompt intervention of the Police Commissioner, Mr. Oyediran, who had arrived the town, Amotekun Corps and other security agencies, to calm the frayed nerves and appeal to the angry youths for peace.\n\nBut the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Funmilayo Odunlami, dispelled the recklessness allegation against the police, saying that the deceased flouted traffic law and incidentally had an accident.\n\n\u201cIt was not due to the recklessness of the police officers, they took one way and they had an accident. So there was no way the police can be reckless in a situation whereby there is a route to take and they took another one.\n\n\u201cOf course it was an oncoming vehicle that they collided with and died, it was not police recklessness there,\u201d the PPRO said.",

(Kukah even took to addressing the US Congress himself, briefing his audience on the history of coups in Nigeria\u2014without, of course, mentioning that none had occurred since 1993, some 29 years ago),\u201d it said.\n\nAccording to the presidency, fortunately, under a new US administration, these jets had been delivered, and that with it, a serious blow against the terrorists\u2014with the supreme leader of Islamic State in West Africa and scores of other leaders of the group eliminated in airstrikes.\n\nThe presidency added that it was also inconsistent to preach the need for stability but needlessly delay sharing military equipment in the form of jets \u2013 not least when it is now proven they would have helped Nigeria much earlier defeat the terrorists who threaten the country.",

          "text": "WBC champion Tyson Fury produced a stunning one-punch stoppage in the sixth round to beat fellow Briton Dillian Whyte, and then suggested he may now retire from the sport.\n\nFury dominated what was a scrappy bout and then unleashed a vicious right uppercut.\n\nWhyte, admirably, got to his feet within the count before staggering into the referee as the fight was halted.\n\n\u201cThis might be the final curtain for the Gypsy King,\u201d Fury said post-fight.\n\nFury \u2013 who also retained his Ring Magazine belt \u2013 is unbeaten in 33 bouts, while Whyte \u2013 suffering his third loss in 31 bouts \u2013 falls short on his first attempt at a world title.\n\nIf Fury does decide to hang up the gloves, the 33-year-old will miss out on an opportunity to fight for the undisputed crown \u2013 a fight which could potentially be staged later this year \u2013 and a chance to cement his status as Britain\u2019s greatest ever heavyweight.\n\n\u201cI promised my wife that would be it after the [Deontay] Wilder fight,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I got offered a fight at Wembley and I owed it to the fans. What a way to go out.\u201d\n\nRecord crowd witnesses Fury\u2019s greatest punch\n\nWith 94,000 fans in attendance \u2013 a post-war British record \u2013 there was an electric atmosphere like no other for a fight dubbed by some as the greatest all-British heavyweight dust-up in history.\n\nBoos echoed around the iconic stadium as a pumped-up Whyte let out his trademark wolf-like howl before walking to the ring.\n\nFury\u2019s ring walk was extravagant. It began to the tune of Don McLean\u2019s \u2018American Pie\u2019, soon turned into \u2018Juicy\u2019 by Notorious B.I.G and ended on \u2018Sex on Fire\u2019 by Kings of Leon. Fury then sat on a throne as fireworks blasted skywards, before heading towards the ring.\n\nHe towered over Whyte as the two men touched gloves. Fury teased before the fight that he could switch to southpaw and neutralise Whyte\u2019s dangerous left hook but, surprisingly, it was Whyte who came out as a southpaw in a cagey opening round.\n\nIt was then Fury\u2019s turn to switch from orthodox in the second as the battle of mind games continued, with the champion edging the opening two rounds.\n\nHe landed with a solid two-punch combination in the third, prompting Whyte to charge at the champion. But the challenger could not get close to Fury, who used his height and reach advantage to keep Whyte at bay as the fight progressed.\n\nThe contest truly heated up in a spicy fourth round. Whyte connected when asked to break, which clearly agitated Fury.\n\nThe fighters twice received a telling off from Mark Lyson, as the referee struggled to control the two men who boast a combined weight of 37 stone.\n\nWhyte\u2019s telegraphed overhand rights were getting nowhere close to the elusive Fury, who was connecting with ease.\n\nThen came arguably Fury\u2019s greatest punch of what is proving to be an illustrious career. He teed it up with a left jab and as Whyte stepped forward, Fury whipped in the brutal uppercut.\n\nWhyte fell back on the canvas. He channelled the warrior spirit he spoke of before the fight but, as he made it to his feet, was clearly in no position to continue.\n\nShare this:\n\n\n\nTelegram\n\nPrint\n\nTweet\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "By Emmanuel Obisue\n\nPresident of the World Bank Group, David Malpass has asked the Federal Government to have a rethink on its policy on fuel subsidy, stating that the huge amount being expended on the policy could be channeled into other critical sectors.\n\nMalpass noted this on Wednesday at a media briefing at the ongoing World Bank/International Monetary Fund Spring Meetings in Washington DC, United States.\n\nIt would be recalled that the Nigerian Senate last week approved N4 trillion for petrol subsidy in 2022.\n\nThe figure represented the amount contained in two separate requests by President Muhammadu Buhari to the National Assembly for approval. The President, had in a letter to the Legislature dated February 10, 2022, sought an additional N2.557 trillion to fund subsidy payments from July to December, 2022.\n\nAccording to Malpass, generalised subsidies have significant negative effects on any system. Thus, he reiterated the need for the country to do away with the multiple exchange rate system, which he said is \u201ccomplicated and is not as effective as it would be if there was a single exchange rate.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne is that they are expensive because they go to everyone and they are often used by people with upper incomes than by people with lower incomes so they are not targeted.\n\n\u201cSo, we encourage that when there is need for subsidy, either food or for fuel, that it should be carefully targeted at those most in need of it. And so, we have encouraged Nigeria to rethink its subsidy effort.\n\n\u201cThe most useful thing for developing countries is to have a single exchange rate that is market-based, that is stable over long periods of time as that attracts investment and so that would help,\u201d he noted.\n\nMalpass further noted that Nigeria also has trade barriers that continue to distort trade and capital flows. He urged the Nigerian Government to improve to help the country and its people move forward.\n\n\u201cI take note of the complicated situation that they face where there are weapons flowing into northern Africa that find their way into non Nigerians that create violence in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is a very challenging situation that the government faces. I think all over the world, people should have an understanding of the fragility that is facing several parts of the world, but in particular, the Sahel and the Sub-Saharan Africa area where the weapons flow from outside of Africa are putting a great burden on governments around the continent.\n\n\u201cNigeria has huge opportunity because of its natural resources and because of its people, and I think I could see its growth accelerate with improvements in policy,\u201d he added while commenting on the spate of insecurity in the country.\n\nThe World Bank had in November 2021 warned Nigeria not to delay any further in removing the fuel subsidy which had been described as a major drain and waste on the economy.",

This happened last Sunday.\n\nTwo blocks of cocaine weighing 2.10kg were discovered when his luggage was searched. But the suspect, 52, and a native of Udi local council area of Enugu State, claimed he ran an unregistered Bureau De Change business before taking up the illicit drug trade.\n\n\u201cThe bid by another cartel to export 950 grams of Heroin concealed in the soles of lady\u2019s footwear through the MMIA cargo shed was equally foiled by anti-narcotic officers who have so far arrested two suspects linked to the crime,\u201d it added.\n\n\u201cThose arrested between 16th and 17th April in connection with an attempt to export the drug to Monrovia, Liberia include Idokoja Solomon Chukwurah and Patrick John Tochukwu.\u201d\n\nThis is just as a suspected fake security agent was arrested on Saturday 23rd April in Abuja while moving 23.8kg of cannabis from Lagos to Maiduguri, Borno State.\n\nIn his reaction to the feats, the Chairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa also commended the operatives of the affected commands.",

          "text": "Tyson Fury retained his WBC heavyweight crown on Saturday, stopping Dillian Whyte in round six of an all-British bout at a delirious Wembley Stadium before repeating his suggestion that he would now retire.\n\nThe win for the self-styled \u2018Gypsy King\u2019, fighting on UK soil for the first time in four years, was witnessed by 94,000 fans in London \u2014 a post-war British record crowd.\n\nUnbeaten Fury, 33, had said this would be his last fight and announced immediately afterwards: \u201cThis might be the final curtain for the Gypsy King. And what a way to go out.\u201d\n\nAfter a cagey opening, the defending champion took the initiative, controlling the fight and landing some telling blows to the head and body of his opponent.\n\nREAD ALSO: [FIRST 11] Serena Williams\u2019 Chelsea Ownership Push+Top Sports Stories This Week\n\n\ufeff\n\nWhyte could have few complaints at a halt being called with just one second remaining before the fight reached the midway point as he was clearly on unsteady legs after the first significant strike of the bout, a brutal right uppercut from Fury.\n\nThe 6 feet 9 inch (206-centimetre tall) Fury was able to use his considerable height and reach advantage to keep Whyte at bay while the challenger was made to look clumsy and cumbersome.\n\nWhyte, cut over his right eye after an accidental clash of heads, was first installed as the WBC\u2019s number one contender nearly four years ago but he was unable to impose himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed with the support,\u201d said Fury. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that my 94,000 countrymen and women have come here tonight to see me perform.\n\n\u201cI just want to say from the bottom of my heart, \u2018Thank you so much to every single person who bought a ticket here tonight or stayed up late to watch it on TV\u2019.\u201d\n\nUnification Bout\n\nIf Fury does follow through with his plan to quit, he would spurn the chance to face either Oleksandr Usyk \u2014 the current WBA, IBF, and WBO champion \u2014 or fellow British fighter Anthony Joshua for the undisputed crown.\n\nNo boxer has held all the major world heavyweight belts since Britain\u2019s Lennox Lewis, who became the undisputed champion in 1999.\n\nBut Fury, now unbeaten in 33 fights, appears to be sticking to his guns.\n\n\u201cI promised my lovely wife Paris of 14 years that after the Wilder three-fight, that would be it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd I meant it. We had a war. It was a great trilogy. And I meant that. But I got offered to fight at Wembley at home, and I believe that I deserved \u2014 that I owed it to the fans.\u201d\n\nJamaica-born Whyte, 34, was greeted with boos as he emerged into the cavernous stadium, dressed in black.\n\nExcitement levels hit fever pitch as Fury entered to the strains of Don McLean\u2019s \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d, which accompanied a video montage of his career.\n\nFury, wearing a white and red robe and gloves featuring the Cross of St George \u2014 the flag of England \u2014 sat on a gold throne as fireworks shot into the air before jogging to the ring.\n\nAfter delighting the crowd with his victory, he led them in another rendition of \u201cAmerican Pie\u201d.\n\nFury hailed Whyte as a \u201cwarrior\u201d, predicting he would be a world champion one day but said his opponent had met a \u201cgreat\u201d in the sport.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m one of the greatest heavyweights of all time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd unfortunately for Dillian Whyte, he had to face me here tonight.

          "text": "Liverpool kept the pressure on Manchester City at the top of the Premier League table and pushed local rivals Everton towards relegation with a 2-0 win in the Merseyside derby on Sunday.\n\nThe Toffees\u2019 day got off a terrible start even before a ball was kicked at Anfield as Burnley\u2019s 1-0 win over Wolves dumped Everton into the relegation zone.\n\nSecond-half goals from Andy Robertson and Divock Origi ensured they remained there despite a spirited display in a feisty encounter.\n\nA 12th consecutive home league win for Liverpool cuts City\u2019s lead at the top of the table back to one point with five games remaining.\n\n\u201cThank God a football game has two halves,\u201d said Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy because it isn\u2019t about flying every week, it is about getting results.\u201d\n\nEverton have still not won away from home in the league since August, but they dispelled criticism of being a soft touch away from Goodison Park by showing the fight they will need in the remaining six games to maintain their 68-year stay in the top-flight.\n\nIn stark contrast to Manchester United\u2019s capitulation in losing 4-0 at Anfield in midweek, Frank Lampard\u2019s men at least managed to make the Reds earn the three points.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is to stick with it. The attitude and the way the lads stuck to their task today was really, really good,\u201d said Lampard, despite his side enjoying just 17 percent possession.\n\nEverton trail Burnley by two points and could be five adrift of safety by the time they are next in action against Lampard\u2019s old club Chelsea.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got six games to Burnley\u2019s five left,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWe had to expect Burnley might win today and worry about our own job. It\u2019s important not to get sucked into that in a negative way.\u201d\n\nA Sadio Mane dipping effort from the edge of the box was the sum total of the threat to the Everton goal in a scrappy first 45 minutes littered with stoppages in play.\n\nMane was lucky just to see yellow from one melee involving almost all 22 players after Liverpool refused to put the ball out of play with Richarlison down injured.\n\n\u2018Legend\u2019 Origi to Rescue\n\nEverton\u2019s 32 completed passes in the first half was the fewest of any team in a Premier League game since 2006.\n\nHowever, they posed the greater threat early in the second half and were made to rue Anthony Gordon\u2019s chance to open the scoring when he dragged his shot across goal with just Alisson Becker to beat.\n\nGordon also had claims for a penalty appeal waved away to Lampard\u2019s dismay for a push by Joel Matip.\n\n\u201cIf that is Mo Salah down the other end, Liverpool get the penalty,\u201d argued Lampard.\n\nWith the scores still level on the hour mark, Klopp was forced to turn to his bench with Luis Diaz and Origi, a perennial scourge of Everton in derbies past, thrown on.\n\nThe all-important goal, though, came from an unlikely source as Robertson headed in just his second goal of the season from Mohamed Salah\u2019s dinked cross to the back post.\n\nOrigi looks set to depart Liverpool at the end of the season after falling further down the pecking order since the January arrival of Diaz.\n\nBut the Belgian signed off with his sixth goal in 10 Merseyside derbies when he headed in at the far post five minutes from time.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t always make the squad which is ridiculous, but he is there when we need him every time,\u201d added Klopp.\n\n\u201cHe is a world-class striker, he is a legend and will stay a legend forever.\u201d",

          "title": "Macron Beats Le Pen to Win Second Term as French President",
          "text": "Emmanuel Macron is heading for victory over far-right leader Marine Le Pen in the French presidential election on a pro-business, pro-European Union platform, bolstering the bloc in the midst of its worst security crisis for decades.\n\nWith counting still under way, projections by France\u2019s five main pollsters put Macron on course to win more than 57% of the vote in Sunday\u2019s runoff compared with 42% for Le Pen. The nationalist leader conceded defeat in a speech to her supporters in Paris.\n\nThe 44-year-old Macron becomes the first incumbent to win a second term since Jacques Chirac two decades ago. With campaigning shaped by the war in Ukraine, Macron\u2019s pledge to make France a cornerstone of a stronger, more integrated EU won out over the nativism and protectionism championed by Le Pen.\n\nThe outcome is good news for investors who had predicted that a Le Pen victory would deliver a shock to markets on the scale of the U.K.\u2019s vote to leave the EU or the election of Donald Trump in the U.S.\n\nYet the margin of victory is far narrower than last time, when Macron beat Le Pen by more than 30 points. The rise in support for her nationalist program reflects a bitterly divided country.\n\n\u201cThe result in itself represents a stunning victory,\u201d Le Pen said, before leading her supporters in a chorus of the national anthem. \u201cMillions of people voted for the national camp and for change.\u201d\n\nMacron\u2019s challenge over the next five years will be to heal those rifts and muster support for his plans to make the country more competitive by overhauling social policies such as pensions and improving the country\u2019s economic fundamentals.\n\nThat won\u2019t be easy. France has one of the sharpest urban-rural cleavages in Europe and Macron\u2019s first term was marked by complaints that he gave affluent city dwellers preferential treatment. That fury exploded during protests against his pension reform and economic inequality. A spate of terrorist attacks added to the sense of insecurity and rekindled debate on what it means to be French.\n\nWith the traditional parties of the left and right in disarray, 53-year-old Le Pen was the main beneficiary, along with far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon who narrowly missed qualifying for the runoff vote. On Friday, the last day of campaigning, Macron pledged to do more to address the grievances of poorer voters to reverse the steady increase in support for Le Pen.\n\n\u201cShe feeds on the things we haven\u2019t managed to do,\u201d Macron said, \u201cthings that I haven\u2019t succeeded in doing myself, namely quelling a certain anger, responding to demands quickly enough, and in particular, succeeding in giving the prospect of progress and security to the French middle and working classes.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s European allies will also be relieved by the result.\n\nWhile Le Pen said she no longer wants to abandon the euro or pull France out of the EU, she argued for transforming it into a looser alliance of nations, with French and not European law supreme. That would fundamentally undermine the way the bloc works.\n\nShe also advocates withdrawing from NATO\u2019s command structure and creating a pact with the Kremlin once the guns in Ukraine fall silent.\n\nGerman, Spanish and Portuguese leaders took the unusual step of wading into the domestic affairs of another country by calling on French voters not to support her in a joint column published in several newspapers on April 21. They described her as the candidate \u201cwho openly sides with those who attack our freedom and democracy.\u201d\n\nBut Le Pen\u2019s focus on pocketbook issues did resonate with many voters. As she crisscrossed France on the campaign trail, she cast herself as a sort of modern day Robin Hood at the service of people struggling with energy and food prices driven higher by the Ukraine crisis. The gap to Macron was as little as two percentage points around the time of the first round on April 10. But that was not enough once Macron turned his full attention from the war to the election.\n\nWhen Macron became the youngest-ever elected French head of state in 2017, he was seen as a breath of fresh air and a bulwark against the rising tide of illiberal populism. But admiration turned to resentment. The former investment banker educated at France\u2019s most elite institutions struggled to connect with less well-off voters. He earned a reputation for aloofness and arrogance, and became known as \u201cpresident of the rich.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, Macron did win approval for his handling of the pandemic. The French economy is recovering faster than major European peers and he has so far shielded families and businesses from the worst of the inflation shock.\n\nBut Macron himself has acknowledged that he failed to fully deliver on his bold early promises and has tried to strike a more humble tone.\n\nAttention will now turn to legislative elections planned for June, when Macron will be defending the parliamentary majority he needs to push through his program.\n\n\u201cThe question is: Can he get a clear majority? How will the political landscape fall into place around the re-elected president?\u201d said Pierre Giacometti, co-founder of No Com consultancy and a former pollster. \u201cWe\u2019re entering unchartered territory \u2014 this is an unprecedented situation.\u201d",

          "text": "Shanghai authorities battling an outbreak of COVID-19 have erected fences outside residential buildings, sparking fresh public outcry over a lockdown that has forced much of the city\u2019s 25 million people indoors.\n\nImages of white hazmat suit-clad workers sealing entrances of housing blocks and closing off entire streets with roughly two metre-tall green fencing went viral on social media, prompting questions and complaints from residents.\n\n\u201cThis is so disrespectful of the rights of the people inside, using metal barriers to enclose them like domestic animals,\u201d said one user on social media platform Weibo.\n\nOne video showed residents shouting from balconies at workers trying to set up fencing before relenting and taking it away. Other videos showed people trying to pull fences down.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this a fire hazard?\u201d asked another Weibo user.\n\nMany of the fences were erected around compounds designated \u201csealed areas\u201d \u2013 buildings where at least one person tested positive for COVID-19, meaning residents are forbidden from leaving their front doors.\n\nIt was not clear what prompted authorities to resort to fencing. A notice dated Saturday from one local authority shared online said it was imposing \u201chard quarantine\u201d in some areas.\n\nReuters was not able to verify the authenticity of the notice or all of the images, but saw green fencing on a street in central Shanghai on Sunday.\n\nThis week, Reuters has also seen police in hazmat suits patrolling Shanghai streets, setting up road blocks and asking pedestrians to return home.\n\nThe Shanghai government did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMISERY\n\nChina\u2019s most populous city and most important economic hub is battling the country\u2019s biggest COVID-19 outbreak with a policy that forces all positive cases into quarantine centres.\n\nThe lockdown, which for many residents has lasted over three weeks, has fuelled frustration over access to food and medical care, lost wages, family separation and quarantine conditions.\n\nIt has also dragged on the world\u2019s second-largest economy, with factory production disrupted by snarled supply chains and difficulties faced by locked-down residents returning to work. read more\n\nShanghai is carrying out daily citywide COVID-19 tests and accelerating transfer of positive cases to central facilities to eradicate virus transmission outside quarantine areas.\n\nIn the past week, authorities have also transferred entire communities, including uninfected people, saying they need to disinfect their homes, according to residents and social media posts.\n\nMany residents have turned to the internet to vent about the lockdown and express dissent, using euphemisms and other means to battle government censors who often remove content critical of the authorities.\n\nVideos of \u201cDo You Hear The People Sing?\u201d, a protest anthem from \u201cLes Miserables\u201d, have been widely reposted, with the title of the French musical receiving over 90 million mentions on WeChat on Saturday, the chat app\u2019s data showed.\n\nShanghai reported 39 COVID-19 deaths for April 23, versus 12 a day earlier and by far the most during the current outbreak.\n\nIt did not report any deaths in the first few weeks, fuelling doubt among residents about the figures. It has since reported 87 fatalities, all in the past seven days.\n\nThe city recorded 19,657 new locally transmitted asymptomatic cases, versus 20,634 a day prior, and 1,401 symptomatic, versus 2,736.\n\nCases outside quarantined areas totalled 280 from 218 on the previous day. Other cities that have been under lockdown began easing restrictions once cases hit zero.\n\nChina largely succeeded in keeping COVID-19 at bay following the initial outbreak in Wuhan in late 2019, with a \u201cdynamic zero\u201d policy aimed at stamping out chains of infection.\n\nThat approach has been challenged by the spread of the highly infectious but less deadly Omicron variant, which has prompted cities to impose various levels of restrictions on movement.\n\nNationwide, China reported 20,285 new asymptomatic coronavirus cases for Saturday, versus 21,423 a day earlier, with 1,580 symptomatic cases, versus 2,988.\n\nBeijing recorded 22 new COVID-19 cases \u2013 all locally transmitted \u2013 compared with six the day before, prompting a number of gyms and after-school activity providers to suspend in-person classes.\n\nReuters",

          "title": "French Vote as Incumbent President Macron Aims to Beat Far- Right Le Pen",
          "text": "French voters are heading to the polls to decide whether to give centrist Emmanuel Macron five more years as president or replace him with far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.\n\nAfter a divisive election campaign, Ms Le Pen faces an uphill battle with her 44-year-old opponent polling ahead.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nIn order to win they both need to attract voters who backed other candidates in the first round.\n\nBut these are two polarising figures in France and abstention is a key factor.\n\nMr Macron\u2019s detractors call him arrogant and a president of the rich, while the far-right leader has been accused of having ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPolls opened in the run-off vote at 08:00 (06:00 GMT) and 48.7 million people are eligible to take part. First projections of who has won will come at 20:00.\n\nMr Macron rose to power on a whirlwind promise of change, but many complain they are yet to see it. His presidency has been buffeted by protests, the Covid pandemic and now the rising cost of living.\n\nMarine Le Pen, meanwhile, has learned from the mistakes she made when she was resoundingly beaten by the same opponent in the second round in 2017. This is her third tilt at the presidency and if she fails it could be her last.\n\nThe great unknown in this election is how many voters will refuse to back either candidate, whether by casting a blank ballot or not turning out at all. Much of France is on holiday and turnout could be historically low.\n\nThe campaign has been short but the choice for voters is clear, between a pro-European sitting president and a nationalist candidate who seeks to ban the headscarf and restrict immigration.\n\nWhatever the result, Mr Macron will address voters on Sunday evening from a stage at the foot of the Eiffel Tower.\n\n\u2018This place is dead after 7pm\u2019\n\nThe rising cost of living \u2013 described in France as pouvoir d\u2019achat or spending power \u2013 has become the number one issue for French voters and Marine Le Pen has promised voters an immediate onslaught on it if she wins.\n\nShe has fared particularly well in the smaller towns and rural areas that have struggled economically during the Macron era.\n\nShe came top two weeks ago in La Fert\u00e9-sous-Jouarre, a pretty town on the River Marne an hour east of Paris. Sitting outside a bar, C\u00e9cile says the pandemic hit the area particularly hard: \u201cBefore Covid there was a bar here called Avenue de Champagne, but that shut and now the place is dead after 7pm.\u201d\n\nShe will vote Le Pen as will Fred, who works on the Paris metro network: \u201cPeople can\u2019t afford to pay for gas and electricity. When I\u2019m in Paris some things are too expensive and you have to eat.\u201d African immigrants he knows in the capital also say they will vote for her, he adds.\n\nThere are plenty of shy Le Pen voters here too. France needs to change, they say, and they leave it at that.\n\nShe has carefully moderated her views, but still plans a referendum on strict immigration controls and her idea for a \u201cEurope of nations\u201d would tear the EU apart.\n\nJean-Claude, 66, may not agree with her hostility to the EU, but he complains too many people take advantage of France\u2019s welfare system and take drugs.\n\nLe Pen and Putin\n\nAcross France Emmanuel Macron is particularly popular with younger and older voters, and that is the case in La Fert\u00e9 too.\n\nApprentice accountant S\u00e9r\u00e9na, 18, is worried about the war in Ukraine: \u201cWe don\u2019t really know what Le Pen feels about Putin. Changing president would destabilise the situation now.\u201d\n\nNicole, 76, runs a library in a nearby village and she has noticed many people turning to the far right. \u201cI\u2019m not so worried about her, more about the people behind her \u2013 her lieutenants.\u201d\n\nMs Le Pen fares less well in the big cities, like Paris and Lyon, where her opponent led in the second round. But what could decide this election is who secures the support of almost 22% of the electorate who voted for far-left candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon.\n\nHe was narrowly beaten by Marine Le Pen but won in cities including Marseille and Nantes.\n\nThe town of Trappes, to the south-west of Paris, is a M\u00e9lenchon stronghold where Le Pen voters are in short supply.\n\nOutside the local shops, a woman in a hijab condemns the far-right\u2019s policies as racist. \u201cI\u2019m going to vote blank,\u201d she says. It\u2019s a popular idea that is seen as a protest vote that benefits neither candidate. On reflection she adds she might back Mr Macron, or even not vote at all.\n\nMany M\u00e9lenchon voters here appear undecided. Outside a nursery school, Murad says he might vote blank too. \u201cMacron is more for the rich than the poor,\u201d he says, before adding that he could still vote for him.\n\nUnemployment may be down and purchasing power may be higher than in 2017, but many voters on the left are disillusioned with the sitting president for cutting housing aid to millions of low earners and abolishing a wealth tax that targeted millionaires.\n\nWhen Emmanuel Macron swept to power, it was on the promise of change. But a remark you hear everywhere is that nothing has changed at all.\n\nIf the opinion polls are accurate and he does win, he will not face an easy second term.\n\nBBC",
