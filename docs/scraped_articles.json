          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nSays\u2018ll address needs of women, girls who menstruate\n\nBy Gabriel Ewepu \u2013 Abuja\n\nAs millions of Nigerian women and girls continue to grapple with different health challenges and to keep fit, WaterAid, Friday, joined a team of experts from around the world to establish new definition of menstrual health that comprehensively addresses the needs of women and girls who menstruate in order to advance gender equality and global health.\n\nThis was contained in a statement made available to Vanguard, where WaterAid Nigeria pointed that despite increased global attention on period poverty, up until now there has been no universal agreement on the definition of menstrual health, which has diluted advocacy efforts and led to fragmented action.\n\nAlthough, it is hoped having a new definition will provide a common language, harmonise approaches and unite efforts to support the range of menstrual needs.\n\nThis new move on the definition of menstruation is part of 2021 Menstrual Hygiene Day with theme, \u2018More action & Investment in Menstrual Health &Hygiene Now!\u2019\n\nThe statement reads in part, \u201cAs the world continues to grapple with the impacts of COVID-19 on health, livelihoods and socio-economic activities, women, and girls, especially the poorest and most marginalised who already faced health and safety implications in managing their menstruation without access to clean water and private toilets before the crisis, are finding that the pandemic has only exacerbated the obstacles they face in managing their periods.\n\n\u201cThis Menstrual Hygiene Day, WaterAid Nigeria is urging the government to take urgent action to increase investment in menstrual health and empower women and girls to unlock educational and economic opportunities through improved access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene.\u201d\n\nHowever, the statement noted that shame and stigma around periods prevents women and girls from engaging in conversations around their periods including cultural beliefs that have silenced these women and girls from certain rights they have.\n\n\u201cSadly, the shame and stigma around periods prevents women and girls from engaging in conversations around their periods. Persisting taboos around menstruation results in the exclusion of women and girls from socio-economic activities and contributes a threat to the overarching theme of the Sustainable Development Goals to leave no one behind.\n\n\u201cThe theme for this year\u2019s campaign, \u2018More action & investment in menstrual health &hygiene now!\u2019 is a clear call to step up investment in menstrual health to ensure no woman or girl is held back because she menstruates.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the Day, the Country Director, WaterAid Nigeria, Evelyn Mere, said: \u201cWe need to create a world where no woman or girl is held back because she menstruates. This means a world in which every woman and girl is empowered to manage her menstruation safely, hygienically, with confidence and without shame.\n\n\u201cMenstrual health is vital to the empowerment and well-being of women and girls and beyond access to affordable sanitary products and water, sanitation and hygiene facilities, it is also about ensuring women and girls live in an environment that values and supports their ability to manage their menstruation with dignity.\n\n\u201cIt is about helping women and girls and all the people around them have the information awareness and the knowledge around this issue. It\u2019s about making sure we have services that respond to the needs of our young girls and women.\u201d\n\nMere also added that, \u201cMenstrual health is a human rights issue that matters to the achievement of several Sustainable Development Goals including the goals on health (3), education (4), gender equality (5), water and sanitation (6), economic growth (8) and sustainable consumption and production patterns (12).\n\n\u201cA lack of water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities in public places like schools, offices, and healthcare centres mean millions of women and girls are unable to manage their menstruation with dignity. It is a situation that is further fostering inequality and affecting the health of millions of women and girls. This is unacceptable and things need to change.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on the government and relevant stakeholders to Include menstrual health in post pandemic recovery plans, including mobilising resources to facilitate water, sanitation and hygiene facilities in public places that will provide safe and private spaces for women and girls to manage their periods hygienically; Increase access to sanitary products by partnering with the private sector to supply disposable sanitary products to girls in school and marginalised women.\n\n\u201cFollow the example of 36 countries including Kenya, India, South Africa, New Zealand and the UK who have applied either a tax reduction or exemption to menstrual products and are providing free period products in schools and public institutions; Reduce the stigma and shame around menstruation by promoting open discussion of menstrual health and hygiene and curriculum policy reforms.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, recently published in the journal \u2018Sexual and Reproductive Health Matters\u2019, menstrual health is defined as \u201ca state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in relation to the menstrual cycle.\u201d\n\nThe statement also added that the new definition, launching ahead of Menstrual Hygiene Day on 28 May and brought together by the Global Menstrual Collective is grounded in the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of health, and sets out clear requirements for achieving menstrual health.\n\nThese include access to clean water, good sanitation and hygiene, access to information about the menstrual cycle and self-care, materials, timely diagnosis and treatment for menstrual disorders and discomforts, and a positive and respectful environment and the freedom to participate in all spheres of life throughout the menstrual cycle.\n\nQuoting the Regional Programme Manager, South Asia, WaterAid, Senior Author, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Mahon, said: \u201cBy defining menstrual health holistically, we aim to bring together stakeholders and help ensure menstrual needs are prioritised by all responsible.\n\n\u201cAs we are starting to see UK aid cuts around programmes addressing water and sanitation, sexual and reproductive health, and girls\u2019 education, it\u2019s never been more important for governments to reaffirm their commitments to gender equality and to take action.\n\n\u201cLarge-scale investment is needed to improve menstrual health as well as water and sanitation provision but co-ordination is needed across sectors. Adopting this new definition and a shared vocabulary will improve collaboration and investment in sexual and reproductive health, gender, education, water, sanitation, and hygiene to ensure no one is held back because of their period.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

And sooner or later, there will be another coronavirus, not COVID-19, may be COVID-25 or COVID-30. But it will be there,\u2019\u2019 the predicted.\n\nThe governor said that \u2018\u2019the imperative for us as governments is to prepare for the eventuality\u2019\u2019 adding that Kaduna state has been preparing for it.\n\nAccording to him, the only Infectious Disease Centre of Kaduna state had just a capacity of only 16 beds when the index case of Covid-19 was recorded on March 28, 2020.\n\n\u2018\u2019 We had no infectious Disease Hospital, we had no testing centre, we had nothing. I\u2019m happy to say that because of COVID-19, as of yesterday (Friday) 28th May 2021, we have eight COVID-19 testing laboratories, from zero in March 2020. We conducted over 102 tests, a little over one percent of our population, and we continue to do so,\u2019\u2019 he disclosed.\n\nEl Rufai further said that Kaduna state has \u2018\u2019built a brand new 136-bed Infectious Diseases Hospital in record time, and we are in the process of building five infectious diseases wards in our general hospitals. Indeed, our plan is that before the end of 2022, every General Hospital in Kaduna State will have an Infectious Diseases, Isolation Ward.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe governor revealed that \u2018\u2019as at yesterday(Friday), 9,079 residents of Kaduna state have been infected by covid-29, 9, 002 have been discharged, that gives a balance of 77. 65 have died and 12 are still being treated. \u2018\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2019Our infection rate has gone down to less than .5%, we are quite comfortable with the infection rate.

It is my intention to ultimately rest it on the shoulders of the various LGA Chairmen who will have the responsibility of making sure that the geographical entities they superintend over are well supervised and adequate security Intel and report made available timeously\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I want us to have an idea of where we are going. For instance, what do we do with Ebubeagu? What do we do with Homeland Security? What do we do with Abia Vigilante Service? And how do we integrate them with what is existing already?\n\nWhile describing traditional rulers as critical stakeholders in the implementation of the outcomes of the Summit, Governor Ikpeazu directed chairmen of the 17 LGAs of the state to also take ownership of security within their various geographical coverage.\n\nHe noted that the over-centralization of the security architecture of Nigeria has been counterproductive.\n\nThe number one citizen of Abia also suggested that the office of the National Security Adviser summons trustees of the various cult groups registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) to impress on them the need to rein in their youth wings that are terrorizing secondary and tertiary institutions in the country or face sanctions.\n\nIkpeazu commended law enforcement officers in the state for their gallantry but expressed concern over the unchecked movement of armed herdsmen into farms and communities leading to recurring herders-farmers clashes.\n\nHe also noted that the latest robbery incident leading to the loss of the life of security personnel along Mission Hill in Umuahia was a product of the activities of criminal elements who took advantage of the ungoverned space created by the activities of unknown gunmen who are working on destroying existing institutions of civil order.\n\nMeanwhile, a former Chief of Army Staff, General Azubuike Ihejirika (rtd) assured Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of his preparedness and that of his colleagues towards coming up with implementable resolutions that will help address the prevailing security situations in the state.\n\nGeneral Ihejirika while assuring that Abia State has a formidable security council comprising of all security agencies in the state comprising of highly qualified and competent senior law enforcement officials, noted that Abia is sure of improving its security architecture through the roundtable discussions christened Abia security summit.",

We will vehemently resist abandoned projects.\n\n\u201cThe Federal government should immediately include Itsekiris in the recently concluded recruitment of over 300 staff in NDDC. Any exclusion of our people in the recruitment of staff in NDDC will be resisted because, under our production quantum of oil and gas, we are major stakeholders in the region and Nigeria at large.\n\n\u201cItsekiri sons and daughters must be included in NDDC skill acquisition and empowerment programs. We were shocked to see NDDC engage over 200 indigenous people of the Niger Delta without a single Itsekiri man or woman, this is the gross neglect of the Itsekiri people.\n\n\u201cThat Itsekiri sons and daughters be considered for the position of the MD and executive position, this is because, over the years (20 years) that the Commission was created, Itsekiris who produce 22.8 % of the National Oil and gas has not to be considered for either the MD or executive position. We won\u2019t take it anymore, we call on all our members and Itsekiri Nation to resist this act of wickedness done by the federal government.\n\n\u201cWe will not be peaceful anymore because it appears our peaceful disposition is being taken for granted.

          "text": "\u2022Predicts critics will give a resounding applause by end of tenure in 2023\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nAs the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration clocks six years today, the Presidency has reeled out major achievements of the regime, with a prediction that even known critics of the President would give a resounding applause to the administration when it finally ends on May 29, 2023.\n\nA statement titled: \u201cThe Buhari Administration At Six: Counting The Blessings One By One\u201d, issued yesterday by the Media Adviser to the President, Mr. Femi Adesina, captured the President\u2019s score card under 26 subheads, including extension of over N2 trillion to the 36 states as bail out to pay workers\u2019 salaries and issuance of nine executive orders, as well as assenting to 14 legislative bills.\n\nThe Presidency stressed that the six years of Buhari\u2019s administration afforded it an opportunity to reflect, and recount the impact that had been made, \u201cand is being made on different sectors of national life.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Presidency, the administration is recording giant strides, from infrastructure, to finance, education, healthcare, sports, anti-corruption moves, human development, housing, oil and gas, foreign relations, and many others, enough to make Nigerians proud, \u201cthat is, those who are dispassionate and fair-minded, not beclouded by political partisanship and undue cynicism.\u201d\n\nThe sector by sector breakdown of the achievements of President Buhari from 2015 to 2021, as listed by the Presidency, showed that under infrastructure category, came the Presidential approval, in 2020, for the establishment of InfraCo Plc, a world class infrastructure development vehicle, wholly focused on Nigeria, with combined debt and equity take-off capital of N15 trillion, and managed by an independent infrastructure fund manager.\n\nOther efforts under this category include the establishment in 2020 of the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF), with more than $1 billion in funding so far.\n\nOn investment committed to rail transportation in the country, the statement listed the 156km Lagos-Ibadan Standard Gauge Rail nearing completion; the 327km Itakpe-Warri Standard Gauge Rail which was completed and commissioned 33 years after construction began.\n\nOthers are the Abuja Light Rail, which was completed in 2018; the ground-breaking for construction of Kano-Maradi Standard Gauge Rail, and revamp of Port-Harcourt-Maiduguri Narrow Gauge Rail.\n\nIt also listed ongoing financing negotiations for Ibadan-Kano Standard Gauge Rail project.\n\nOn road projects, the statement listed the PIDF, the investment of over a billion dollars on three flagship projects: Lagos-Ibadan expressway, Second Niger Bridge and Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano expressway.\n\nOther efforts in this regards included the Executive Order 7 to mobilise private investment into the development of key roads and bridges like Bodo-Bonny in Rivers and Apapa-Oshodi-Oworonshoki-Ojota in Lagos.\n\nThe Buhari administration, according to the statement, has done well in boosting the capacity of the nation\u2019s ports.\n\nAdesina cited such efforts as the completion of new terminals for International Airports in Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt; Construction of New Runway for Abuja and Enugu International Airports and the Presidential approval for four International Airports at Special Economic Zones: Lagos, Kano, Abuja and Port Harcourt.\n\nOthers include, the approval for new private-sector funded deep sea ports: Lekki Deep Sea Port (construction already well underway, for completion in 2022); Bonny Deep Sea Port (ground-breaking done in March 2021); Ibom Deep Sea Port; and Warri Deep Sea Port. The list includes the development of capacity at the Eastern Ports.\n\nIn the power sector, Adesina listed President Buhari\u2019s effort to include the implementation of Energising Education Programme, which involves taking clean and reliable energy (Solar and Gas) to Federal Universities and Teaching Hospitals across the country. Projects in four Universities have been completed and commissioned: BUK (Kano), FUNAI (Ebonyi), ATBU (Bauchi) and FUPRE (Delta). Others are ongoing.\n\nHe listed another achievement to include the National Mass Metering Programme, which involves the nationwide rollout of electricity meters to all on-grid consumers, launched in August 2020.\n\nListed as achievements were the ground-breaking on 614km Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano Gas Project, successful completion of Nigeria\u2019s first Marginal Field Bid Round in almost 20 years, expected to raise in excess of half a billion dollars.\n\nThe achievements also included the Policy, Regulatory and Funding Support for the establishment of Modular Refineries across the Niger Delta.\n\nOn agriculture, the administration maintained that the Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP) of the Central Bank of Nigeria, launched by President Muhammadu Buhari on November 17, 2015, has made more than N300 billion loans to more than 3.1 million smallholder farmers of 21 different commodities (including Rice, Wheat, Maize, Cotton, Cassava, Poultry, Soya Beans, Groundnut, Fish), cultivating over 3.8 million hectares of farmland.\n\nIt noted that the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC) has helped anti-corruption agencies devise clearer strategies for obtaining forfeiture of assets suspected to have been acquired fraudulently, mainly from State coffers, before prosecuting suspected culprits.\n\nThe Presidency noted that the administration had been able to secure billions of dollars in concessional infrastructure funding for critical road and rail projects. It noted, for instance, that President Buhari\u2019s April 2016 official visit to China has unlocked billions of dollars in infrastructure funding, primarily for road, rail and port projects, as well as the implementation of a Chinese Yuan (CNY) 15 billion Currency Swap Agreement between the Peoples Bank of China and the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nIt noted that the administration had been able to secure international recognition within the period of six years and this include the designation of President Buhari as the African Union (AU) Anti-Corruption Champion for 2018, and by ECOWAS Heads of State as West Africa\u2019s COVID-19 Champion in 2020.\n\nIt also listed the appointments of eminent Nigerians into international posts.

          "text": "\u2022Says he was selected based on national interest, not on ethnic, religious sentiments\n\n\u2022New COAS resumes, Irabor charges him to build on Attahiru\u2019s legacy\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos and Kingsley Nweze in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday defended its choice of Major General Farouk Yahaya as the new Chief of Army Staff (COAS), while also revealing plans to immortalise the former COAS, late General Ibrahim Attahiru and others that perished in a plane crash about a week ago in Kaduna State.\n\nDefending its choice, the government insisted that contrary to public opinion, the appointment of Yahaya, who resumed duty yesterday, was based on national interest and not on ethnic and religious sentiments.\n\nAlso yesterday, the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor, charged the new COAS to build on the legacy of his predecessor, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, who died in a plane crash on Friday, May 21.\n\nThe appointment of the new COAS on Thursday had elicited fierce criticisms from a wide spectrum of Nigerians who alleged that other more qualified senior army generals were denied the position because they hailed from the south-eastern part of the country.\n\nCritics also argued that the office of Army Chief had been restricted to Northerners in the six years Buhari has spent so far as President and that the President ought to have shifted a bit by picking the new Army Chief from among Southern Generals in the Army, so as to give the rest of the country a sense of belonging.\n\nApparently reacting to the criticisms yesterday, the Minister of Defence, Major General Bashir Magashi said the appointment of Yahaya was strategic and was based on national interest and not on ethnic and religious sentiments.\n\nThe Minister, in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mohammad Abdulkadri, described the new Army Chief as \u201can organic infantry general who is tested and trusted to actualise the national aspirations to restore peace in the dark spots and areas of insurgency, kidnapping, and banditry, as well as other allied threats to the nation\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nMagashi commended President Buhari \u201cfor the well thought-out strategic appointment of Yahaya as a replacement for the late Attahiru.\n\n\u201cWith the appointment of General Yahaya, President Buhari has expediently put national interest above ethnic and religious chauvinism by fulfilling all requirements necessary. These include his unblemished track records of service, professional, command, and operational competencies among other yardsticks that culminated into his emergence as most suitably qualified new Army boss.\u201d\n\nThe Defence Minister expressed optimism in the professional pedigree of General Yahaya, the former theatre Commander Operation \u201cHadin Kai\u201d, in sustaining the trajectory of taking offensive and aggressive campaigns to the camps, corridors, and cells of the adversaries to obliterate them.\n\nWhile pledging the support of the Ministry of Defence under his watch to the new Army boss in carrying out his mandate, the minister said plans were in the pipeline by the federal government to immortalise the late General Attahiru and others who died in the plane crash.\n\nYahaya is from Sokoto State and he was a member of the 37th Regular Course of the Nigerian Defence Academy.\n\nThe choice of Yahaya, according to independent analysis, means Nigeria would lose heavy investments made on about 60 army generals from the Army Regular Courses 35 and 36, who, by army tradition, have to proceed on summary retirement as a result of the choice of the new COAS, who belongs to the course 37 set.\n\nYahaya Resumes\n\nMeanwhile, General Yahaya formally resumed duty as the nation\u2019s Chief of Army Staff yesterday.\n\nHe took over during a ceremony held at the Army Headquarters in Abuja, where on arrival, he inspected a guard of honour at the sentry, thereafter, he proceeded to the conference room.\n\nBefore the commencement of the programme, he led others to observe a minute silence in honour of his late predecessor and 10 others, who died in the plane crash.\n\nA statement by Army Spokesman, Brigadier-General Mohammed Yerima, said the newly appointed Chief of Army Staff was received at the Army Headquarters by the Chief of Policy and Plans (COPP) Army, Maj Gen BI Ahanotu and thereafter inspected a quarter guards mounted in his honour and the symbolic lowering and hoisting of command flag to signify the end and beginning of a new command in line with army traditions.\n\n\u201cGeneral Yahaya later held a brief meeting with principal staff officers after observing a minute silence in honour of former COAS, late General Ibrahim Attahiru and 10 others. He requested maximum cooperation of the senior officers in order to achieve the mandate of safeguarding the country from the multifaceted security challenges facing the country\u201d, the statement said.\n\nThe COAS further stressed \u201cteam work and synergy as the way forward for the Nigerian Army and the nation as no single individual or agency can make it alone\u201d.\n\nBuild on the Legacy of Attahiru, Irabor Charges New Army Chief\n\nMaking a point of what he expects, the Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, yesterday charged the new COAS to build on the legacy of his predecessor, describing his appointment as well-deserved.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Acting Director Defence Information, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, Irabor gave the charge when he hosted the new COAS at the Defence Headquarters (DHQ), Abuja on resumption of duty.\n\n\u201cI urge you to build on the legacy of your predecessor, particularly in the fight against insurgency and armed banditry,\u201d declared the CDS.\n\nThe statement from the DHQ continues: \u201cThe CDS also wished him a successful tenure in office as he assumes command. General Irabor further urged the new COAS to build on the legacy of his predecessor, particularly in the fight against insurgency and banditry.\u201d The COAS was accompanied on the visit by the Chief of Policy and Plans Headquarters Nigerian Army, Maj Gen Benjamin Ahanotu.\n\nHighlight of the visit was the presentation of Nigerian Army flag to the new COAS by the CDS, Brigadier General Nwachukwu said in the statement.\n\nPresident Buhari appointed Gen. Yahaya as the COAS on Thursday, May 27, 2021.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The estimated value of houses for the former Minister of Petroleum, Diezani Allison is worth $80 million\u201d.\n\nBawa attributed the delay in disposing of the assets to long court processes and administrative exigencies.\n\nHe pointed out that with the setting up of the committee by the government, all assets recovered by the EFCC, as well as those recovered by other authorised agencies would be disposed of quickly.\n\nThe EFCC Chairman assured that once all recovered assets were disposed of, the Commission would be dealing with issues on a case by case basis and would not let them accumulate again.\n\nThe chairman of the committee opined that it was not ideal to continue keeping such recoveries as they were losing value over time.\n\nAdeogun said, \u201cGiven the financial situation of Nigeria, shouldn\u2019t we just auction these things fast and put the money to use.

          "text": "Chuks Okocha, Alex Enumah in Abuja and Adibe Emenyonu in Benin City\n\nThe Supreme Court yesterday dismissed the appeal of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on the alleged certificate forgery against Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki.\n\nThe apex court in a unanimous judgment held that the appellants failed to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nThe APC and one of its chieftains, Williams Edobor, had appealed the judgment of the Abuja Division of the Court of Appeal, which had dismissed their case of certificate forgery against Obaseki on the grounds that the allegations were not proved.\n\nHowever delivering judgment in the appeal, the apex court just like the appellate and trial courts held that the appellants failed woefully in their case having not provided any disclaimer from the school that the said result was not issued by it.\n\nThe apex court in the judgment delivered by Justice Emmanuel Agim, also agreed with the lower courts that the appellants did not meet sufficient requirement of the law in proving their allegations.\n\nThe court accordingly upheld two judgments of the Court of Appeal Abuja and the Federal High Court, Abuja, which had earlier dismissed the case of the appellants for lacking in merit.\n\nThe court in addition awarded a cost of N1 million in favour of Obaseki.\n\nReacting to the judgment, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) hailed the judgement of the Supreme Court which upheld the election of Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki, describing it as the inevitable triumph of the will of the people over anti-democratic forces.\n\nAlso, the Edo State Deputy Governor, Mr. Philip Shaibu, described the Nigeria Judiciary as the referee of Nigeria\u2019s democracy through enforcement of the rule of law, to protect the minorities from the power of the majority, despite their attempts to tilt the playing field against the rules.\n\nThe Abuja Division of the Court of Appeal had on March 18, dismissed the appeal of the APC seeking to upturn the judgment of Justice Ahmed Mohammed of a Federal High Court, Abuja which dismissed the case of the plaintiff on grounds of abundant evidence that the certificates Obaseki tendered to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) were genuine and issued by relevant authorities.\n\nAPC in the suit was seeking the sack of Obaseki as governor on grounds that he forged documents he submitted to INEC in aid of his qualification for the 2020 governorship election in Edo State.\n\nThe 3-man panel did not only dismiss the appeal of the APC for being incompetent and lacking in merit but went ahead to award the sum of N250, 000 as cost in favour of Obaseki.\n\nJustice Stephen Adah had in the judgment held that the lower court was right in its findings and conclusion in the APC suit.\n\nThe appellate court also upheld the testimony of the Deputy Registrar, Legal, Mr. Abayomi Ajayi who confirmed that Obaseki attended University of Ibadan in 1976 and fulfilled the requirement for admission into the institution.\n\nAdah added that the evidence of the Deputy Registrar was direct in showing that Obaseki did not forge his University of Ibadan certificate submitted to INEC and as such fulfilled all requirements to contest for the governorship position of Edo State.\n\nThe trial court had on January 9 this year dismissed the alleged certificate forgery suit against Obaseki, on grounds that the party failed to substantiate its claim of forgery.\n\nBut not satisfied APC approached the Appeal Court to challenge the judgment of the lower court.\n\nThe PDP asserted that the verdict of the apex court in throwing out the petition of APC was a resounding reinforcement of the popularity of the PDP and Governor Obaseki in Edo State, as firmly established in the election.\n\nThe party in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, urged Governor Obaseki to continue in his commitment towards the development of the state and the well-being of his people in line with the manifesto and ideology of the PDP; the very reason he was overwhelmingly re-elected as governor of the state.\n\nThe PDP said that it was proud of Governor Obaseki for the empowerment of the people as well as massive infrastructural development of Edo State in critical areas of healthcare, education, agriculture and food production, oil and gas, industrialisation among others.\n\nThe party also commended the judiciary for its courage in upholding justice and the will of the people in the Edo governorship election.\n\nShaibu while reacting said, \u201cThe ruling of the Supreme Court today has shown that the judiciary does not lack teeth. The rule of law is the strong pillar and rock on which Nigeria\u2019s democracy stands. Every other foundation is made of sinking sand because the judiciary is no longer bound by artificial limitations.\n\n\u201cThe judiciary constitutes the most important vessel in the sustenance of democracy in Nigeria, even as he reminded politicians that the Supreme Court is not a systematic instrument for the acquisition of political power.\n\n\u201cThe final judgement today has demonstrated to the World that the Nigerian Judiciary is not a pawn in the hands of desperate politicians to realise their ambition. The rule of law has prevailed and this has demonstrated further that no one can sit above the law. Justice is the greatest interest of man and the ligament which binds civilised people together. Today\u2019s judgement has reinforced this saying due to the celebration all over Edo State and other parts of the World.\n\n\u201cThe extent to which the Nigeria Judiciary is free to perform it\u2019s roles and efficiently too, will determine how developed and how deep rooted our Democracy will be.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Nokia X20 Review \u2013 Dualsight Camera, 2-day battery life, and more",
          "text": "The Nokia X20 is your chance to use a high end smartphone with many features that are likely to help with your content creation, gaming, and overall selfie experience.\n\nEarly in April, HMD Global announced the launch of six new Nokia Android smartphones. I got my hands on one of the phones in the X Series and explored some of its features.\n\nIts major selling points include 3 years worth of Android updates from Nokia, cinema mode and dualsight camera, 2-day battery life and a large screen that allows you to watch virtually anything in full HD+.\n\nSo let\u2019s get into it.\n\nWhat\u2019s in the box?\n\nThe front of the box is branded with Nokia\u2019s logo and a photo of the phone. The phone is available in both Midnight Sky and Nordic Blue.\n\nThe Nokia X20 retails for about $480.\n\nOn the box, there\u2019s also a circle that tells you that you\u2019ll be getting 3 years of Android updates but that\u2019s for a different section of this review.\n\nFinally, inside the box we have the following:\n\nThe Nokia X20 : I mean, it would be extremely awkward if this was not in there.\n\n: I mean, it would be extremely awkward if this was not in there. USB-C Cable: It\u2019s helpful to note that there is no wall charger.\n\nIn a world that is currently piling up more and more e-waste, the makers of Nokia figured everyone already had some type of wall charger in their homes so they decided to not include them in the packaging.\n\nI for one know that I have enough standalone wall chargers as is so this was actually a welcome development.\n\nCompostable case: Remember what I said about avoiding e-waste, well they also added a biodegradable phone case that shouldn\u2019t be a menace to the environment if you were ever to throw it out.\n\nSim Slot Pin : personally I would really love it if more phone manufacturers imitate the Sony Xperia 1ii \u2013 which allows you eject your sim slot without a need for a very easily misplaced pin.\n\n: personally I would really love it if more phone manufacturers imitate the Sony Xperia 1ii \u2013 which allows you eject your sim slot without a need for a very easily misplaced pin. There are the warranty papers but that\u2019s not what you\u2019re here for is it? Thought as much. Onward!\n\nThe Look, The Feel, The Heft\n\nI will start by saying the Nokia X20 is a large phone. With a 6.67-inch screen, it is quite hard to operate it entirely with one hand \u2013 I couldn\u2019t reach the top left corner with my thumb when I held it in my right hand.\n\nThe back of the phone is Nordic Blue and has four cameras (main \u2013 64MP, ultra-wide \u2013 5MP, macro \u2013 2MP, depth \u2013 2MP) surrounding the ZEISS logo that most Nokia users have come to know and expect on Nokia phones.\n\nOn the left, we have the sim slot which allows for two sims but if you only need one sim, you can also put a MicroSD card in the space created for the second sim.\n\nThere\u2019s a dedicated button for the Google Assistant on the left of the phone as well. I think this button is overkill mostly because on the phone you have two other ways of accessing Google Assistant \u2013 you can click the actual Google Assistant app or you can swipe up from the bottom right corner. Thankfully this button can be deactivated in your settings.\n\nLeft showing sim slot and Google Assistant button\n\nOn the right side of the phone, there are volume control buttons. There\u2019s also the fingerprint sensor (which is also the power button).\n\nOn the bottom of the phone, we have our old friend the 3.5mm headphone jack \u2013 it feels like more phones are leaving this guy out. We also have the USB-C port and mono speakers.\n\nAnd finally, the screen. The first thing I notice is the pre-applied screen protector \u2013 good looking out, Nokia.\n\nThe screen has thick bezels and the manufacturers went for a hole punch (with a 32MP camera) instead of a notch. I\u2019m yet to decide which of those I prefer.\n\nAt the bottom of the screen, we have some extra Nokia branding \u2013 just in case you forgot you were holding a Nokia phone.\n\nThe phone feels a bit heavy but not so much that it grows uncomfortable. I put the compostable case on almost immediately because I like my phones protected at all times.\n\nCan we turn it on now?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nWhen you press the power button the screen goes white and you see the \u201cAndroidOne\u201d logo. The startup time is slow so you see that logo for a couple of seconds. By my count, I would say about 14 seconds of waiting before you hear the oh so familiar Nokia starting tune.\n\nAfter that, the phone is on and you can set up your fingerprint AND face recognition. Both of them are quite responsive and don\u2019t take long before your phone is unlocked.\n\nX20 showing volume controls and fingerprint sensor\n\nWhat\u2019s under the hood?\n\nThe Nokia X20 is running Android 11, the latest version of the Android OS.\n\nRemember how I mentioned the 3 years worth of Android updates? Well, users of this phone do not need to worry about software or security updates for the next 3 years. This is probably one of its biggest selling points.\n\nThe phone comes with 128GB of storage but this is expandable (up to half a terabyte) through the MicroSD card slot I mentioned earlier. It also has 8GB of RAM.\n\nChipset for this gigantic phone? Qualcomm Snapdragon 480. The phone also allows 5G. I guess we\u2019ll be patiently waiting till we get that now, won\u2019t we?\n\nChipsets usually determine how fast your phone works and while the Snapdragon 720g (which can be found on other phones in this price range) has better CPU performance, the 480 uses less battery life.\n\nThe phone\u2019s 60Htz screen and Snapdragon 480 chipset allow it not to use too much of its 4470 mAh battery (with 18W fast charging), thereby allowing you to use it for up to 2 days.\n\n2-day battery life? For real?\n\nImmediately I saw it on the box I knew it was something I had to check out so as soon as I got the phone out, I charged it fully \u2013 this was on Monday night.\n\nI downloaded a few apps and just went to town \u2013 mostly watching Netflix and playing some Call of Duty.\n\nI didn\u2019t need to charge the phone till about Thursday night and even then the phone still had some juice.\n\nSo if you don\u2019t use your phone for much more than texting and calling, you can very easily get more than 2 days out of it.\n\nFor you gamers and perpetual video watchers, you\u2019ll probably get a full day\u2019s use without frantically searching for your USB-C cable.\n\nDisplay, Audio and Camera\n\nThe Nokia X20\u2019s 6.67-inch screen\u2019s resolution is 1080 x 2400 and it\u2019s also full HD+. What this means is that you can very comfortably watch your favourite videos on YouTube or Netflix in great quality.\n\nThe phone\u2019s sound comes from a mono speaker that is admittedly quite loud. However, because it\u2019s not a stereo speaker, your audio experience can be a little one-sided when you use it but it shouldn\u2019t affect your listening experience too much.\n\nI did find something peculiar with the videos I shot on the phone\u2019s camera. At full volume, I struggled to hear my voice in these videos. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the phone\u2019s microphone or something else but it\u2019s definitely not great to record videos and barely have enough audio coming from them.\n\nNow that we are at the cameras, I will post two images I took in the different modes below. You tell me what you think.\n\nPortrait selfie mode\n\nMain selfie mode\n\nTwo standouts for me are both video modes on the X20 \u2013 dual sight and cinema\n\nDualsight: This feature allows you to record a video with both your front and back camera at the same time. I find that this will be extremely useful for vloggers who want to be able to capture an event and their reactions to the event at the same time.\n\nStill from dualsight video\n\nCinema mode: This feature can only be used in landscape mode and basically allows you to turn yourself into an amateur filmmaker with access to settings and filters that help give your video a cinematic feel.\n\nStill from video shot in cinema mode with filter\n\nThe phone delivers on many promises but could do better with some of the things I pointed out. Overall, if you\u2019re looking for a phone with a large screen, interesting camera features, Android updates till Android 14, and long battery life, this is definitely a phone for you.\n\nUntil our next review.",

          "text": "This Friday, May 28th at 11 am, Tomiwa Aladekomo, CEO, Big Cabal Media will be speaking with Adeoluwa Akomolafe \u2013 Chief Information Security Officer, Wema Bank; Daniel Osineye \u2013 Co-founder and CTO, Evolve Credit and Joseph Onyema \u2013 Group Chief Information Officer at United Capital Group; Sophina Kio-Lawson, Co-founder at SheSecures and Nick Maxwell \u2013 General Manager, Ava Security (UK, MEA & ANZ).\n\nAdeoluwa, Daniel, Joseph, Sophina and Nick will be discussing how you can protect your organization and customers from online fraud.\n\nRegister here to join the event.\n\nEvery year, there\u2019s an increase in the number of people connected to the internet, but this means there\u2019s also a corresponding increase in the number of people who are susceptible to cyberattacks. In some countries, these attacks come at a very high cost.\n\nThis reduces the level of trust people have in the internet or systems that use the internet. For instance, when it comes to savings, some people prefer not to save their money in traditional banks; and trusting their savings with a fintech company would probably be their last option.\n\nAnd that\u2019s only one example\u2013 there\u2019s a lot of customer data scattered across other tech-enabled services. Losing your money is perhaps the least harmful way cyber fraud can harm you.\n\nFirstly, your data could be used to carry out illegal activities which could put you in even more trouble. Secondly, your company\u2019s trade secrets or other sensitive business data could be leaked to the public. You could lose your good reputation in a blink.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of work to be done to improve cybersecurity measures, and the work of improving these measures isn\u2019t the sole responsibility of tech companies. In our present digital age, traditional sectors like oil and gas need new and more effective ways to protect their customers from cyber fraud, too.\n\nAn estimated $103.1bn was spent on security-related software, hardware and services in 2019 and this spending is expected to increase to $133.8bn by 2022. However, improving cybersecurity measures will not only involve spending more on security but also making it a part of the company culture. Every employee should have a role to play in keeping the organization safe.\n\nTomorrow at 11 am on TechCabal Live, we will be discussing with Adeoluwa, Daniel, Joseph, Sophina and Nick about some of the best practices they\u2019ve picked up in the course of their careers.\n\nRegister here to join the event.\n\nAdeoluwa is a skilled Information Security Professional. He has built a career spanning about 20 years in the field and has honed his expertise in some of the world\u2019s leading organizations, including Barclays, Brown Shipley and the British Council.\n\nDaniel is the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at Evolve Credit, a loan and financial products marketplace. He is responsible for building the backend infrastructure, driving product roadmap, leading the technical team and driving company strategy.\n\nOver the past year, Joseph led the United Capital Group of companies to transition to a 100% remote work structure due to the COVID limitation while improving services and automation, leading to a 61% growth in revenue for the year ended 2020, with customers transacting seamlessly and securely.\n\nSophina is a cybersecurity professional currently working with a leading financial services firm.

          "text": "Nigerian public procurement and regulation can be labyrinthine, but recent policy reforms and the model of good practice provided by Kaduna State hint at opportunities for public-purpose innovation to flourish in the country. The result could be more accountable and effective governance institutions.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic found Nigeria\u2019s health system largely unprepared. When the Federal Government first announced a lockdown in March 2020, the country only had 6 testing centres. With a population of 200 million across 36 states, it needed to expand its ability to test quickly. One of the government\u2019s readiest supporters in this situation, the genomics research startup 54gene, had only been on the scene for a year. 54gene studies the African genome in order to personalise medication for Africans. It put these research capabilities to use establishing its DNA biobank lab as Nigeria\u2019s first accredited private testing centre and\u2013strikingly\u2013converting shipping containers into mobile testing laboratories, helping to augment testing capacity.\n\n\n\n54gene is one of many high-quality startups driving large investments into the Nigerian ecosystem and earning its position alongside Kenya, South Africa and Egypt as Africa\u2019s top four VC funding destinations\u2013Africa\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d. The government partnered with 54gene out of necessity, but broader gains await should it systematically seek out such partnerships as a means to achieving its service delivery and administrative rationalisation goals. Its capacity to deliver on plans to digitise all government operations is questionable\u2013the 2020 UN e-government survey revealed that Nigeria\u2019s online service quality declined from already low levels in 20181. Accountable and well-managed partnerships with innovative startups can tip the scales in its favour, here and in other areas: improving education, promoting sustainable forms of energy and tackling healthcare challenges from both the most served verticals and some of the most pressing governance challenges.\n\n1 According to the UN e-government survey, Nigeria\u2019s online service index declined from 0.5278 in 2018 to 0.5176 in 2020. Scores range from 0 (worst) to 1 (best).\n\n\n\nPolicy progress?\n\nThe Federal Government looks to be aware of this opportunity. Its recently released National Digital Innovation and Entrepreneurship Policy aims to prioritise the use of tools developed by Nigerian startups to automate public processes and services, including modifying the Procurement Act to better allow for the procurement of innovation. It has also mandated Nigerian companies with large public sector IT contracts to engage Nigerian startups as R&D partners on the projects. Ideally, a more immediate intervention to consider is introducing the Nigeria Sustainable Development Goals Fintech Hackathon. In its first iteration, the hackathon will allow FinTech startups with innovative approaches to agricultural credit schemes, cash transfers to the financially vulnerable and clean energy to partner with relevant public sector bodies.\n\nThese are all steps that, on their surface, should enable more startups to work with it. However, to truly capitalise on potential gains, the government must focus on unravelling deep-seated behavioural barriers to access. The strength of these biases\u2013such as a preference for partnering with large, established companies and a tendency for harsh regulation of innovation\u2013will determine how well the above-mentioned initiatives play out.\n\nLabyrinths of Procurement and Regulation\n\nThere is plenty of evidence of these biases\u2019 detrimental impact on the potential for partnerships. When the Nigeria Railway Commission (NRC) started the train line between Kaduna State and the Federal Capital Territory, a payments startup called Payant Technologies sent in an unsolicited proposal to handle the digital booking and payments infrastructure. They didn\u2019t receive a response.\n\nUndeterred, Payant sent another in when the official request for Expressions Of Interest came out, but this also went unanswered. Why? The NRC was, according to its eligibility criteria, only looking for companies with an annual turnover of a billion naira ($2.4 million) or more, something only a few startups in Nigeria have. Preferring to work with large firms does more than stymie startup growth. It could lead to vendor lock-in and eventually, bilateral dependence between government and supplier. Both do not bode well for the quality of services rendered.\n\nHarsh regulatory policies also deter local and global partnerships. Like US-headquartered 54gene, many of Nigeria\u2019s best startups have chosen to incorporate outside the country. When one defines startup location as a place of incorporation, Nigeria falls out of the top four African VC funding locations\u2013the most adversely impacted country.\n\nThis year alone, government actors have stopped banks from processing transactions associated with cryptocurrency exchanges and issued a cease and desist to investment startups offering access to foreign securities. Both actions have negatively impacted startups working in those spaces. More importantly, they may signal an unwillingness to cooperate that will put off startups serving the government market.\n\nAso Villa Demo Day \u2013 Enterprise 54\n\nFor Inspiration, Look Local\n\nMitigating these and other negative behaviours will be hard work. But the Federal Government need not look far for inspiration; it can take a page out of the Kaduna State Government (KDSG)\u2019s Govtech playbook. Govtech developments in Kaduna have unfolded as part of a broader governance reform programme; reform has itself been driven by the capable leadership of seasoned public servant Nasir El-Rufai. Elected for a second term in 2019, perhaps the most important quality Governor El-Rufai brings to the table is a capacity for making unpopular but ultimately effective decisions. He previously displayed this capacity as Minister of the Federal Capital Territory from 2003 to 2007; in the face of limited resources, he downsized the civil service, an action he is repeating in Kaduna.\n\nBuoyed by experienced leadership, KDSG is blazing the trail for both digital government interventions and partnering with startups and SMEs. Its globally recognised Eyes and Ears budget monitoring program enables citizens, via a mobile app, to provide feedback on public infrastructure projects. It worked with Yellow Line Services, a Kaduna-based IT company, to facilitate electronic voting during its 2018 local government elections, Nigeria\u2019s first and Africa\u2019s second electronic voting exercise. It has recently signed a deal with drone-delivery unicorn Zipline to deliver Covid vaccines and other on-demand medications. According to the World Bank\u2019s latest subnational Doing Business ratings, Kaduna is the most accessible state to register property and get contracts enforced in Nigeria. Kaduna\u2019s example is an exciting preview of what could be should the Federal Government follow through on a promising start.\n\nWritten by Tolu Segun, Fellow at StateUp.\n\nStateUp is a leading provider of public-purpose technology intelligence. We aim to bridge the gap between the worlds of government and technology through specialist, multi-disciplinary advisory, training, and information services focused on digital innovation that serves a public purpose.",

          "title": "How GOtv Nigeria Built the Widest Coverage in Nigeria with Investments in Local Infrastructure",
          "text": "Nationwide digital terrestrial television operator GOtv has greatly contributed to Nigeria\u2019s digital migration through eye-watering infrastructure investment.\n\nMore often than not, what comes to mind when people think of digital pay-television is its expensive nature. To a great extent, GOtv has changed that notion in Nigeria, where it brings family entertainment and information to millions of homes at ridiculously pocket-friendly prices, essentially becoming a lifestyle choice and transforming the national pay-TV landscape.\n\nGOtv Nigeria is not only affordable, but also widely available. Presently, Nigerians can access the service in over 50 cities across 26 states, which makes it by far the widest nationwide digital terrestrial television (DTT) network coverage, despite not being the first operator to launch in the country.\n\nAchieving this is no mean feat, especially when one considers the challenge of Nigeria\u2019s notoriously acute infrastructural deficit which by itself is enough to discourage any potential investor. But GOtv, launched by Details Nigeria in October 2011, has shown confidence in the local broadcast industry. That is demonstrable in the fact that in a decade, it has spent well over $100 million/N48 billion on investments in broadcast technology and infrastructure in the country, which oustrips those of licensed signal carriers and has significantly contributed to the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nGOtv has been the foremost figure in pushing Nigeria\u2019s drive towards migration from analog to digital transmission after the government joined a host of other countries in signing up to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) agreement of 2006. The company has since worked closely with the government and the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) in providing affordable digital television for everyone through unmatched investments in modern broadcast infrastructure.\n\nIn line with Nigeria\u2019s aspirations to get on the digital broadcasting train, GOtv at inception rolled out the DVB-T2 decoder, a second-generation technology platform approved by the ITU as the standard for digital television broadcasting. The DVB-T2 technology allows for up to 20 channels per frequency, compared to DVB-T1 technology, an outdated system that only allows for 12 channels per frequency and was widely used by first movers in the digital migration. It also delivers a vastly superior digital audio-visual quality, a higher number of channels, access to Free-to-Air after subscription expiry, and prevents signal depreciation in adverse weather conditions.\n\nSo with the launch of GOtv came a dramatic improvement on the dividend of terrestrial frequencies available to Nigeria when DVB-T2 was deployed. The company was the first Nigerian DTT provider to offer its service on the modern technology, which is one of the most advanced broadcast systems and infrastructure established in Africa and globally. For Nigerians, it meant access to a premium digital audio-visual quality and enhanced viewing experience at extremely cheap rates. And for Nigeria, that effectively put the country at the forefront of technology on the global digitalisation map.\n\nOver the years, GOtv has continued to invest heavily in the latest technology in digital television, especially on its transmission technology, which it has consistently improved upon. Notable among investments made in infrastructure was the building of 73 transmitter sites between 2011 and 2015 at a cost of $95.5 million, to provide DTT coverage for over 50 percent of Nigeria\u2019s population.\n\nAs the coverage increases, so does the need for similar significantly large investments to maintain the transmitter sites in peak condition for effective transmission. GOtv has not been shy to spend in that regard too. Between 2014 and 2018, more than N8 billion was expended on the maintenance of transmitter sites. In 2014 alone, N572.2 million was spent and the sum rose consecutively in the following years \u2013 to N1.39 billion in 2015; N1.9 billion in 2016; N2.033 billion in 2017; and N2.28 billion in 2018. It is vital to note that the huge sums invested in the provision and maintenance of broadcast infrastructure are exclusive of what was invested in bringing digital broadcasting to Nigeria.\n\nThese investments by GOtv in the local broadcast infrastructure and the expansion of its network coverage have come as the government-driven digital switchover programme (DSO) progresses in fits and starts. The country has missed several deadlines since the digitisation process took off in 2008, mainly because of inadequate funds. Meanwhile, the two signal carriers licensed by the government to spread DTT coverage across the country have not functioned optimally. Set up about five years ago, they have been unable to provide nationwide coverage due to lack of finance and technical capacity.\n\nThe sub-par infrastructure provided by the carriers has led to endless complaints by Nigerians in most states where the switchover programme has been launched. Among those who have bought the device recommended by the National Broadcasting Commision (NBC) as its digital transition vehicle, there have been issues such as partial or total lack of reception, which sometimes lasts for several months, as well as service availability limited to the state capitals.\n\nWhile the heavy investments by GOtv have been crucial in helping the company beat topographical hindrances that most DTT operators face and ensure subscriber access in several cities across the country, they rarely occur without a ripple effect on national development and the impact has been massive, in terms of improving lives and job creation.\n\nAt the heart of it all is a commitment to stimulate the national digitisation process, boost the government\u2019s efforts towards national socio-economic development and impact millions of lives, as GOtv puts pay-TV services at the disposal of as many households as possible that wish to migrate into the digital age.",

          "text": "Lagos, Nigeria. 26th of May, 2021. \u2013 In the recently released Africa\u2019s Best Brands 2021, TECNO ranked for five consecutive years among the TOP 6 brands on the African continent, marking another prestigious recognition of the brand\u2019s leadership in Africa.\n\nEstablished in 2011, the Brand Africa 100: Africa\u2019s Best Brands rankings is the most authoritative survey and analysis on brands and underlying businesses in Africa, based on a study by Geopoll across 28 countries spanning all the five economic regions and analysis and ranking by Kantar and Brand Leadership. Collectively they account for over 80% of the population and over 80% of the GDP of Africa. The 2021 survey was conducted between March and April 2021 and yielded over 80,000 brand mentions and over 3,500 unique brands.\n\nSince its entry into the African market, TECNO\u2019s operations have been customer focused. Year in year out, they have ensured that their offerings are tailored to meet the needs of Africans.\n\nSpeaking to this at a virtual event organised by Brand Africa, Vincent Uzoegbu, Public Communications Manager, TECNO said; \u201cFrom the first day of our business, TECNO made a strategic decision to focus exclusively on Africa, and when we first entered Africa, our core strategy was to focus on sub-Saharan Africa, where mobile phone penetration was still very low and largely ignored by global mobile phone manufacturers. The aim was to bring a mobile phone that would suit African consumers and improve the lives of as many people in Africa as possible by bridging the digital gap through technology and innovation.\u201d\n\nTECNO has worked tirelessly all these years to do just that. With the brand\u2019s Phantom, Camon, Spark and Pova smartphone series, TECNO has been able to set numerous records that define its success and popularity on the continent, evident of its dogged resolve to present Africa with the best of technology and innovation. When TECNO launched dual SIM cards in Africa, there had been nothing of the kind before then. TECNO was also the first to develop long-lasting batteries that lasted 3 days to combat the epileptic power supply in places like Nigeria. The brand was also the first to bring camera solutions on their smartphones that suited the predominant African dark skin.\n\nAfter more than a decade of commitment and consistency, the rewards are finally falling in. Earlier in the year, Counterpoint Research ranked TECNO as Africa\u2019s number one smartphone brand in 2020, stating that TECNO made its breakthroughs in mobile photography technology and continued investment in the market throughout the pandemic despite a challenging year. And now, with Brand Africa\u2019s new rankings, TECNO has once again come out tops, becoming a leading player in mid to high-end mobile brand segments in Africa.\n\nAttai Oguche, Marketing Manager TECNO Nigeria said; \u201cWe\u2019re very honoured to be listed again amongst Africa\u2019s Best Brands ranking this year and to be part of the key contributors to the development of African business. Shouldering African consumers\u2019 trust and great support, we will keep the momentum to continuously unlock our best of contemporary products and technologies for consumers across Africa and inspire them to pursue a better life via mobile technology innovations.\u201d\n\nAbout TECNOTECNO Mobile is a smartphone brand from TRANSSION Holdings.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "Microsoft announced in a blog post that it would retire the Internet Explorer (IE) on June 15, 2022.\n\nLaunched globally in August 1995, Internet Explorer became the most widely used web browser with about 95% market share between 2002 and 2003. And in 2015, it was already one of Africa\u2019s most used web browsers.\n\nDespite being the pioneering Internet browser, its security, speed, and reliability have been the butt of jokes for a few years now. Maybe that\u2019s why Microsoft has decided to pull the plug on the browser\u2019s life support.\n\nDue to its longevity, no other software has had more security bugs than Internet Explorer before 2019. Its users are prone to get tricked by hackers into opening malicious websites from search queries or clicking on an email link.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Microsoft reportedly confirmed a security flaw in January 2020, the company said it had no immediate plan to fix the defect used by hackers on IE until they released a new update in February of that year.\n\nIn January 2020, Microsoft ended support for Windows 7 after announcing that it wouldn\u2019t offer security updates for Windows users in January 2019.\n\nDespite the patches rolled out almost every month, its security and low network connectivity, which make it unreliable, do not inspire confidence.\n\nThat explains why some users started looking for alternatives.\n\n\u201cInternet Explorer was the go-to to download Chrome back in the day. I left it for Chrome because IE is very unreliable, and has bugs,\u201d IheAnyi Okere, a Geographic Information System (GIS) analyst, told Techpoint Africa.\n\nA Techpoint Africa Twitter poll revealed that most respondents share their sentiments and quit using IE due to unreliability.\n\nOne hundred and twenty respondents voted, and 48 people (40%) said they stopped using IE due to its unreliability; 36 people (40%) discontinued using it, citing bad network connectivity. Approximately 7 people (5.8%) stopped because of security bugs, and about 29 people (24.2%) said they never used it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsequently, it appears some Nigerians won\u2019t miss the browser when Microsoft eventually puts it to rest.\n\nNonetheless, while Internet Explorer was going through its steady decline in market share, and Google Chrome dominated other browsers with 69% market share, Microsoft was building Microsoft Edge to replace IE.\n\nWhat about Microsoft Edge?\n\nWith the Microsoft Edge browser launch in 2015, the software giant revealed plans to kill off Internet Explorer, though it would continue working until the end.\n\nRecall that on August 17, 2020, Microsoft announced that the Microsoft Teams web app would no longer support IE. And on November 30 of the same year, Microsoft Teams stopped endorsing IE.\n\nFrom August 17, 2021, Microsoft services like OneDrive and Outlook will no longer support IE.\n\nInterestingly, Edge has an IE mode despite being touted as faster, more secure, modern, and reliable than its predecessor.\n\nThe IE mode is built in to access the legacy Internet Explorer-based websites and applications directly from the browser.\n\nMicrosoft also claims that Edge is its solution to the security issues faced on Internet Explorer over the years.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, approximately 579 password attacks are attempted every second. And with reportedly the highest-rated protection against malware and phishing attacks, Microsoft Edge seems to be up to the task of protection.\n\nAccording to browser statistics, Edge can identify 98% of phishing sites while Chrome and Firefox can successfully recognise 96%.\n\nMicrosoft Edge promises to give out security patches for instant vulnerabilities within hours compared to the monthly security patches on IE 11.\n\nAccording to research, Edge can immediately block 89% of phishing sites, outperforming Chrome (79%) and Firefox (77%). This suggests that Edge is more secure than Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.\n\nIn the blog post released on Wednesday, May 19, 2021, Microsoft said, \u201cthe future of Internet Explorer on Windows 10 is in Microsoft Edge.\u201d\n\nBut how much of this do users believe?\n\n\u201cI enjoy using Microsoft Edge, and it\u2019s better than Chrome because it helps me retrieve my previous tabs whenever I log in again. Also, whenever I want to read, I can use the Immersive Reader. It\u2019s like you\u2019re reading on AnyBooks,\u201d says Damilola*, a Microsoft Edge user who never used IE.\n\nAccording to the Market Share Statistics for Internet Technologies, Chrome ranked first with 69.28% market share, while Microsoft Edge ranked second with 7.75% between November 2019 and April 2021.\n\nNew Edge Features\n\nOn Tuesday, May 25, 2021, Microsoft announced two new features for version 91 of the Edge browser at its annual Build conference.\n\nStartup boost allows Edge to start up almost immediately. The second feature \u2014 sleeping tabs \u2014 puts your tabs to sleep so that they don\u2019t use up memory and the CPU cycle.\n\nWith the new Edge features and the retirement of Internet Explorer in June 2022, Microsoft might finally build a reliable brand known for speed and security and probably overtake Chrome some years down the road.\n\nIn Africa, according to Browser Usage Statistics, 68.37% use Chrome while 1.26% use IE and Edge, respectively. However, chrome is still the most vulnerable web browser in 2019, with 177 vulnerabilities detected.\n\nThat is, even with its vulnerabilities, people still chose Chrome over Edge.\n\nSo, what might prompt Africans to use Edge more? The reliability of a browser that hasn\u2019t passed the test of time? How much work do you think Edge has to do to catch up with Chrome? We are also asking the same questions.\n\n* Not real name\n\nFeatured Image by Firmbee from Pixabay\n\nNew licence requirements for Nigerian fintechs\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest, a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you subscribe now\n\nGood day,\n\nOluwanifemi and Bolu here.\n\nToday we\u2019re discussing:\n\nWhat tech is doing for African kids\n\nCrypto withdrawal on PayPal\n\nFacebook\u2019s plan to hide Like counts\n\nTwitter Spaces available on web browsers with new features\n\nCelebrating Children\u2019s day\n\nIn Nigeria, Children\u2019s Day is observed every May 27. As to the \u2018why?\u2019 I believe it\u2019s a day when we are all reminded to celebrate and promote children\u2019s rights. Yearly, conversations are driven in specific directions to discuss action points for making the world a better place for children.\n\nTrivia: World\u2019s Children\u2019s day is celebrated yearly on November 20, while International Day of the African Child happens every June 16.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTalking of making the world a better place for kids, exposure to tech solutions makes way for the same advancement that has made life easier for everyone. In fact, edtech has become a huge part of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nWe did a compilation of a few: These 11 startups are preparing African kids for the future\n\nNot only for kids, here\u2019s a list of eight tech careers you can get into and how to get started.\n\nHowever, it appears it is becoming harder by the day to protect them from the evil that comes with it. While some media platforms have versions for kids, others have age limits.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the US government prevented Facebook from going ahead with releasing Instagram for Kids. During the pandemic, this came in handy, suggesting ways to protect kids since they had to spend more time online.\n\nCheck this out: We owe it to our kids to put an age limit on social media\n\nApart from the solutions provided by startups, some schools now run hybrid models where kids learn both in the classrooms and at home.\n\nDo you remember how Nigerian schools fared after the lockdowns?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn a different note, Ikorodu Bois, Emmanuella: meet the top 5 Nigerian kid influencers on social media. Interesting!\n\nPayPal\u2019s crypto withdrawal\n\nPayments giant PayPal will soon open up crypto withdrawals for its customers. The company\u2019s crypto lead, Fernandez da Ponte, revealed this at CoinDesk\u2019s crypto event Consensus 2021 on Wednesday, May 26, 2021.\n\nBecoming even more crypto-friendly: Currently, PayPal users cannot withdraw or send cryptocurrencies directly to friends and families. Only the fiat equivalent can be sent, which means customers have to sell their holdings. Now, da Ponte says PayPal wants to \u201cmake it as open as possible\u201d, allowing direct purchases and transfers in crypto.\n\nMore crypto users? PayPal\u2019s purported crypto tolerance could be a ploy to lure more crypto users to its platform. In an interview with the Time Magazine, the CEO, Dan Shulman, revealed that the demand for crypto is \u201cmultiple fold\u201d of initial expectations.\n\nMore crypto features coming? This might be the first of many crypto features on PayPal as the venture is seemingly profitable for the company.\n\nFacebook to hide Like count\n\nFacebook is giving users the option to hide the Like count on their posts. It announced this on Wednesday, May 26, 2021, on Facebook Newsroom. Instagram and Facebook users now have more control over their experience on the apps.\n\nFacebook has been testing this new feature since 2019. According to them, they wanted to see if hiding the count could take the pressure off people. Some found it useful, while others found it annoying.\n\nAn end to Like-chasing? Not quite. Users can decide if they want to see a Like count on others\u2019 posts, theirs by others, and which of their posts they want a like count on. This way, Facebook satisfies those who feel pressured by Likes and those who depend on Like counts \u2014 such as influencers \u2014 to use the app.\n\nAccording to Facebook, pressure caused by Like counts, made people focus less on content and more on content engagement.\n\nWhy does Facebook care? Per TechCrunch, the pressure from Like counts made people opt for \u201cLike free\u201d platforms. The new Like counts feature could be a way to retain users.\n\nTwitter Spaces comes to the Web\n\nTwitter\u2019s Clubhouse competitor, Spaces, hits the web. This means users can now host and join sessions via desktop and mobile browsers. You can also preview a session before joining and minimise the website to continue browsing.\n\nTranscriptions anyone? What other way to be one up on competitors than live transcriptions? Perks: accessible to people who are hard of hearing, deaf, or want the sound off. I\u2019m not sure how the platform plans to pull this off for non-native English speakers. We all know how it is on web conferencing platforms.\n\nNot slowing down: Since it launched in December 2020, Spaces has continued to evolve as Twitter keeps adding new features. Meanwhile, Clubhouse only recently became available for Android users.\n\nTwitter\u2019s monetisation plan is adding up: Last week, Twitter disclosed its plans on how Ticketed Spaces would enable users to make money from their followers. Guess what? Twitter makes money too.\n\nHow? It\u2019s a 20-20-60 (Google/Apple-Twitter-User) sharing ratio for every ticket sold. For now, only users in the US can sell tickets, while anyone around the world can buy.\n\nIt appears we\u2019re already getting answers to how social audio-chat apps can monetise the platform. Remember this discussion \u2014 This is the last one, we promise, but we\u2019re not sure?\n\nWe\u2019ll see if Twitter\u2019s first-move advantage into Android and monetisation plans will work out well for the platform.\n\nICYMI on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat\u2019s the fate of Nigerian fintech following banking regulator\u2019s fresh regulations? Read\n\nWhat you need to know, as Kenya moves to outlaw pornography.\n\nWhat else we\u2019re following\n\nDubai is a paradise for \u201cdigital nomads\u201d \u2014 and hell for low-wage gig workers.

          "title": "How insecurity blights gains of Nigeria\u2019s 22-year democracy",
          "text": "Nigeria returned to civil rule in 1999 after several years of military occupation of power stool. Today marks exactly 22 years since the transition took place.\n\nFrom President Olusegun Obasanjo to the late Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, Goodluck Jonathan and to the current President Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria has recorded some appreciable achievements, particularly in the area of telecommunication, agriculture and infrastructure (for instance, there has been a lot of investment in rail transportation).\n\nBut these achievements appear to have been dwarfed by the high level of insecurity in the country and worsening disunity among the different ethnic nationalities in the country, leading to agitation for restructuring.\n\nAyo Adebanjo, a chieftain of the pan-Yoruba cultural association, Afenifere, said there was nothing to celebrate.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing to celebrate for now; rather we are mourning the dream of our forefathers; all the problems bedevilling Nigeria now had been settled before independence until the military came in 1966. What is the problem now? It is the problem of creation of local government autonomy, revenue allocation, I mean true federalism?\n\n\u201cEven revenue and how it would be shared. These issues have been sorted before independence, before the military came and that was why we had the 1963 Constitution. It is the 1963 Constitution that takes care of all these issues caused by the British amalgamation of 1914. Except you want to fool us, these current exercises would not bring anything good,\u201d Adebanjo said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhen we say let\u2019s change the 1999 Constitution we are not talking nonsense. If Buhari has no hidden agenda, let him return us to true federalism, which is the solution. If you don\u2019t agree with Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s constitutional conference why don\u2019t you set up your own? The current constitution is fraudulent and it is the source of our problems. You are asking a legislature that was created by the fraudulent constitution to amend the law and expect something good. We are under a dictator regime. For some of us who fought for the independence of the country, it is sad.\u201d\n\nTade Ademola, Lagos State chairman, Inter-Party Advisor Council (IPAC), said: \u201cWhen there\u2019s relative peace, development is assured; progress is constant and planning is simpler. The insecurity has taken us back many years. And this has affected Nigeria in all its ramifications. This insecurity has changed so many things, including hyping the restructuring agitations which has snowballed into ethnic groups ready to leave Nigeria. Nigeria is at the lowest ebb now.\u201d\n\nLanre Oyegbola, politician, is of the view that Nigeria is not where it could be, saying, \u201cWe surely can be much better than this and we surely have what it takes to be better. I am more persuaded that with the rise in more forthright Nigerians getting involved in the affairs of Nigeria and in the politics of who governs Nigeria at different levels, we are surely going to be tilting the clock positively.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cInsecurity, no doubt, has been with us for like forever, and it\u2019s become more pronounced in recent days and years, but we must also accept that the hype around insecurity and the stereotyping around the whole matter are not doing the country any good.\n\n\u201cIn all, I wish we keep Nigeria democratic by engaging our political elite to work for the interest of all and evolve a process that is competence and character-focused. This will ensure we put round pegs in round holes and avoid the trap of doing politics the same old way and expect a different result.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Rising insecurity amid humongous security votes\n\nFrom North East, considered as the epicenter of insecurity, the challenge is now across the country in different shades.\n\nBut it would be recalled that early this year, when President Buhari finally listened to Nigerians and changed the military Service Chiefs, who many insisted were incompetent, there was respite as Nigerians and the world at large hoped for improvement in the country\u2019s security, which has worsened over the years.\n\nIn his excitement over the appointment of the new Service Chiefs, Abdulai Yeri, a retired Army Colonel, and now APC chieftain in Bauchi State, assured that he knew Ibrahim Attahiru, the then new Chief of Army Staff, as a no-nonsense man and that he and team would deliver.\n\nSadly, the fresh air anticipated by many, courtesy of the new appointments, did not happen as was evident in the last four months of the new Service Chiefs, with little or no feat at making Nigeria safe for the citizens to live in.\n\nIf the country had made any progress in the last four months of the new Service Chiefs, the recent death of the chief of army staff in an air crash is a big setback to the fight against insecurity as many suspected foul play in his death.\n\n\u201cFor over five years, somebody has been shouting in Benue that they are killing his people and nothing has happened since. People die in Plateau every day, there is strategic killing now in South East, residents of Borno have since relocated, many more are leaving as those who remain are being killed. Is the bloodshed not enough, is the Federal Government waiting until some tribes are wiped off before responding?\u201d Bem Ujah, an Abuja-based lawyer, cried out.\n\nThe forensic lawyer further lamented that the Federal Government is not helping the matter with its inaction.\n\n\u201cHow can people keep crying out to you, who is elected and also sworn in to protect them, yet you sleep comfortably and only send a message to console them after each attack when you can flush out the killers. I think Nigeria is far from getting solutions to our insecurity challenge until presidency gets serious and accepts the reality,\u201d Ujah said.\n\nWhat worries many observers is the inability of Nigeria to seek help from foreign partners who have successfully addressed their insecurity challenges.\n\n\u201cWhy always asking for loans to build infrastructure that bandits will destroy soon, why not ask for military and intelligence assistance. If you invite the United States of America, it will clear Sambisa forest in a minute, but why are we not getting such helps, Nigerians should protests on this, force presidency to engage foreign powers now\u201d, Freeman Alabo, a security expert and Niger Delta politician said.\n\nFor Alabo, the Federal Government is insincere with the fight against insecurity, especially with insurgence and bandits in the north.\n\n\u201cIf Niger Delta militants make noise now, the Federal Government will send dreaded soldiers with institution to kill at sight, why not do same in the north. You saw the killings in the East because IPOB, if the presidency continues to have soft spot for bandits and insurgence, our security will even get so much out of hand that Aso Rock will not be same. The president should act now and get the help needed,\u201d Alabo advised.\n\nHe thinks that the Nigerian security authorities have been compromised, those ready to work are demoralized by the poor treatment meted on their dead colleagues, while others are resigning to keep their lives.\n\nConsidering the many challenges faced by Nigeria and the need to rejig the security architecture of the country, some observers advised that government should get foreign help now.\n\n\u201cWe need a collaboration of America, Germany, France and others to fight insecurity. But we need to flush out sabotage in the security system and be honest with them in order to get results. No geopolitical zone should hide records to save its dissidents\u201d, Alabo said.\n\nToeing Alabo\u2019s line, Ojobo Ameh, a concerned parent and school principal in Niger State, called on Nigerians to protests in favour of bringing foreign help.\n\nFor now, the only solution to our problem is foreign help because our security is compromised; they are eating from the problem, hence foreign assistance. If this is going to be \u2018#EndInsecurity\u2019 protest let it be because presidency has not responded enough to people\u2019s plights. We are dying shamefully by our brothers\u2019 guns and machetes,\u201d the angry principal said.",

He admonished ACGs to design\n\nempathy maps to help them in understanding how people experienced a problem in their communities and their perspectives about finding solutions or responding to requests for proposals, whether solicited or unsolicited.\n\nIn the functions of Resource Mobilisation, he stated that finding \u201cnew business opportunities\u201d is same as proposal development, and after action, review process followed before project implementation. He however cautioned that service provision to clients should not be discontinued but that organisational sustainability will help scale up goods and services the organisation currently provides.\n\nHe listed resource Mobilisation sources to include members contribution, sale of goods and services for user fees, foundation contributions, government contracts, grants, national and international donors, amongst others.\n\nDr Emonena noted that there were certain truths about resource Mobilisation, and they included that organisations are not entitled to supports but that it depended on what organisations bring to the table, and that gaining trust/confidence will aid search for supports.\n\n\u201cSuccessful Resource Mobilisation requires a lot of work and takes a lot of time. Organisations need to be thoroughly prepared. If your organization needs additional revenue in one year, start today!\u2019 he stated emphatically.\n\nHe admonished participants to be ready, willing and able to sell the programme they are raising fund for and be sure that fund mobilisation efforts are in alliance with organization\u2019s mission, objectives and strategic plans. He however noted that fundraising is also about the needs of the prospective donor.\n\n\u201cYou must understand the needs of your constituents or markets and apply an evidence-based research on what works. Your organisational performance today impacts on your ability to generate resources tomorrow.\u201d\n\nOrganizational, programmatic, industrial and financial sustainability, according to Dr Emonena, are key for organizational optimal performance.\n\nOn his part, Dr Jude Obasanmi took participants through an organizational development\n\nchecklist, which includes need for self assessment, action planning, development of Resource Mobilisation Plan and the internal/external Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats(SWOT), including\n\nLeadership and Governance, stating that organisations must be governed by documented constitution, constituted CSO Board and meeting, visible NGO vision, mission and value statement, organizational chart, NGO strategy plan, and so forth.\n\n\u201cSocial Innovation has a new formula for success, and it is combining capital with a do- good mentality.\u201d Dr Obasanmi stated.\n\nThe training also considered the process of proposal development from formation of team and calendar, technical approach, methodology and project description, monitoring and evaluation plan, among other sub-titles, including the Theory of Change,\n\nNetworking and referral systems.\n\nHighpoint of the training was the distribution of a sample of an Organization Resource Mobilisation Plan, 2021-2023 to participants, and it included Projected Resource Needs for FP/AYSRH, 2021 to 2023, a three-year planning map.\n\n...",

The western Region government also established DAILY SKETCH and SUNDAY SKETCH in 1964, while the Midwestern State government set up the Midwest Newspapers Corporation under an edit of December 2, 1967 to produce THE Nigerian OBSERVER newspapers which was first published on May 29, 1968.\n\nThe idea of publishing a government owned Newspaper in the state was first conceived by Colonel Samuel Osaigbovo Ogbemudia\u2019s predecessor, Governor David Ejoor while in office.\n\nThe name of the paper originally planned for the state was \u201cMidwestern Nigeria Sentinel\u201d which was to be a weekly newspaper. The plan to set it up did not materialize before Colonel Ogbemudia was posted to take over as Governor of the then Midwest State.\n\nWithin a brief period of conception, ogbemudia invited Mr Abiodun Aloba in 1967, whom he entrusted the task of helping to set up a state-owned newspaper. Mr Aloba later became the pioneer General Manager of The Nigerian OBSERVER. He had come from Lagos on holiday to Benin City to see his relations. On his way back to Lagos, he was held back by some soldiers, who told him the Military Governor wanted to see him.\n\nOn meeting the Governor, after a brief on the proposal, Aloba was taken to several locations in Benin City with a view of choosing a befitting location for the newspaper company.\n\nHowever, after much search, the governor personally zeroed in on the present site, No. 24 Airport Road, then No. 18 Airport Road; a site which originally belonged to the Nigerian Police Force.\n\nToday, The Nigerian OBSERVER remains the longest surviving government owned newspaper in the country after series of re-launching and re-designing to meet industry standard.\n\nThe Nigerian OBSERVER in 1972 was circulating about 95,000 copies of its editions daily, a number which today has reduced to less than 1000.\n\nLate Fred Opubor, a one time chairman of the company\u2019s Board of Directors blamed the fall in circulation of government owned newspapers on interference on editorial policy.\n\nThe Nigerian OBSERVER was a child of political necessity published as a document for daily circulation that would inform the public on activities of government of the then Midwestern State Fifty-three years after establishment, The Nigerian OBSERVER has to its credit, three editions: Daily, The Sunday OBSERVER and The Weekend OBSERVER on October 6, 1990.\n\nWhile the Sunday OBSERVER was established on October 27,1968, the Sporting OBSERVER (now defunct) was established in 1974 and the Weekend OBSERVER in October 6,1990.\n\nAs at the 4th anniversary of the establishment of the corporation, the daily circulation of The Nigeria OBSERVER throughout the then 12 states of the federation has risen to 95,000, while The Sunday OBSERVER maintained a steady circulation n of 180,000 copies weekly.\n\nFollowing the creation of Edo and Delta States from the then Bendel State in 1991, and subsequently sharing of assets and liabilities by the two states. Edo retained Bendel Newspapers Company Limited (BNCL).\n\nThe government of Delta State, on its part, set up Delta Printing Press on August 8, 1994 to produce a state owned newspaper.\n\nThe newspaper which was later known as THE POINTER first appeared on the news stand in October 25, 1994.\n\nIt was set up basically to accommodate staff of the Bendel Newspaper Company Limited who were displaced from the company following the sharing of assets and liabilities by the two states. It was also a newspaper meant to project Delta state with its people to the outside world, as well as bring the world closer to Delta people.\n\nThe publication which started as weekly newspaper that was published every Sunday later added Thursdays and Saturdays (weekend) editions while it is presently a daily publication.\n\nThe basis for establishing THE POINTER newspaper was developmental journalism and grass root enlightenment, specifically patterned along the line of regional newspaper.\n\nWithin the first decade of its existence, the name Midwest Newspaper Corporation was subjected to geo-political changes that affected the political structure at the federal level.\n\nFirstly, it was Midwest Mass Communication Corporation and following the creation of more states, including Bendel from the defunct Midwest State, the corporation\u2019s name was changed to Bendel Newspapers Corporation.\n\nAfter several reforms, in January 1, 1989, in a bid to accentuate its news value and determination, the corporation\u2019s name was changed to Bendel Newspapers Company Limited (BNCL), a name which is retained till date.\n\nThe decision to change the name was taken at management level as a means to deliberately strip the company of all elements that made it a parastatal. It was subsequently registered under the Company Allied Matters Act.\n\nDespite the change in the legal status of the company, it is today still owned by government which retained every element of control and management.\n\nAt the inception of Midwest Newspapers Corporation in 1968, the then governor of the state, Colonel Ogbemudia observed that if The Nigerian OBSERVER publication is to discharge its sacred function effectively and efficiently too, it should be free from government control as to what it should write and not write. It should be free to criticize any aspect of government policy which it considered worthy of criticism in public.\n\nNevertheless, The OBSERVER Newspapers thrived in the face of challenges and competitions from privately owned newspapers, to emerge as the longest surviving government owned newspaper in the country.\n\nThe newspaper also had its fair share of unfavorable moments, both during the military regime and civilian government.\n\nA case in point was the case between one Mr. Amakiri Minere (now late) and the then River State governor, Alfred Diette Spiff (now a traditional ruler in Rivers State) in July 1973. Amakiri was the River State correspondent of the Benin \u2013Based The Nigerian OBSERVER. He wrote about an impending Teachers\u2019 strike in River state and had it published on the Military Governor\u2019s birthday anniversary. Diette Spiff felt insulted about the reportage and saw it as well calculated news to embarrass his personality.\n\nThe governor\u2019s ADC, ASP Ralph Micheal Iwowari intervened to pacify his paymaster (Diette) and sent for the reporter. Ignorantly, the reporter appeared at the gate of the governor\u2019s house and was received and detained by soldiers until further orders. The governor ordered and supervised the soldiers shaving of Amakiri\u2019s head with a broken bottle and caned 24 times publicly.\n\nThere was public outcry over the insult and injury caused Amakiri by Governor Diette Spiff and his aides to the extent that Amakiri\u2019s case is today a case study in any discuss on Press Freedom both in Nigeria and beyond.\n\nIn July 22, 1993, General Ibrahim Babagida closed The N igerian OBSERVER newspapers and some other national newspapers for their reportage on the June 12 crisis which he considered as a criticism against his administration.\n\nAside these, in the 1980s, the Newspaper house began to experience some difficulties principally among which was declined readers into the hands of privately owned newspaper until recently when the Editorial appeal was reignited by a vibrant youthful journalist, Mr. Eddy Akpomera. The daily product won back a high number of readers and advertisers who appreciated quality product.\n\nPrior to this period, situation became worse when the then Military Administrator of Edo State, Group Captain Baba Adamu Iyam introduced self- sustenance policy where BNCL and other parastatals were asked to fend for themselves through a Self- Sustenance. Workers of the company started going on incessant strikes as management could not afford workers\u2019 salaries.\n\nThis ugly experience continued until Governor Lucky Nosakhare Igbinedion came to the aid of the company. He cleared off the company\u2019s backlog of 13 months\u2019 salary arrears and employed the services of consultants made up of the duo of Emeka Ogbeide and Orobosa Omo-Ojo who revived the company and put it back on a sound footing.\n\nOn the note of advancing the newspaper house, Edo state Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki after paying an unscheduled visit to The Nigerian OBSERVER, revealed his intention of revamping the state owned media, including The Nigerian OBSERVER with the installation of a state of the art Printing Machine.\n\nHowever, it is on record that the 53 years old Newspaper produced notable journalists some of who made marks in journalism profession, including Mrs. Adekumbi Ero, Nosa Igiebor of TELL magazine, Osa Director, Emma Niboro, Nduka Obaiggbena, publishers of THIS DAY Newspaper.\n\n...",

          "title": "Governor Oyetola and the Chinese fable, by Charles Adeyemi",
          "text": "Before the rinderpest, I came across a well-known fable from Chinese mythology about the virtues of willpower and perseverance as a regular adherent of the Confucian doctrine of social co-existence. Wikipedia would discover that the tale first appeared in Book 5 of the Liezi, a Daoist text of the 4th century BC, and was retold in the Garden of Stories by the Confucian scholar Liu Xiang in the 1st century BC. It was also used by Chairman Mao Tsetung, the first premier of the people\u2019s republic of China in his famous speech of 1945.\n\nThe myth concerns an Old Man of 90 years who lived near a pair of mountains in the Yu Province. He was annoyed by the obstruction caused by the mountains and sought to dig through them with hoes and baskets. To move the mountain, he could only make one round trip between the mountain and his home in a year. When questioned as to the seemingly impossible nature of his task, the Old Man replied that while he may not finish this task in his lifetime, through the hard work of himself, his children, and their children, and so on through the many generations, some day the mountains would be removed if he persevered. The gods in Heaven, impressed with his determination, hard work and perseverance, ordered the mountains separated.\n\nDrawing the Nexus, it takes an unusual willpower ganished with brilliance and a total believe in the miracle working God to lead a state like osun in 2018. The last Administration has given their best but majority of Osun people and spectators of Governance of Osun doesn\u2019t see the state rising from the toga of issues it was confronted with prior to the Advent of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola.\n\nFor instance, Osun was a state popular with all sort of complications ranging from reactions to different policies and initiatives of the system, from school merger, to single school uniform policy, to avoidable religious crisis, attempt at building of a cargo airport which many believe was a white elephant adventure. for a protracted period of time, workers were subjected to modulated salary option which was popularly reffered to \u2018Afusa\u2019, funny as it was then, the senior staff of government were collecting half salary, the brutal situation is not even the half salary but that all status quo deductions were implemented to the full from the supposed modulated salary. Bank deductions never stopped, gratuity payment for pensioners were also modulated, cooperative deductions were used by the system of that time leaving an average workers with empty pocket.\n\nOf course, the sad effect was conspicuous and felt in the entire state, it made the narrative popular that Osun is a civil service state. By the time the last Administration was winding down, it became obvious that a new approach must be explored, a new agenda must be sought for, yet premised on the continuity mantra. Ogbeni Aregbesola, the former Governor and current minister of interior accented to this when he publicly told osun people to expect a new approach and probably a reversal of some of his policies should they felt it\u2019s necessary, they can tell the party and the party will relate to Ilerioluwa. He admonished them to expect Ilerioluwa to do things differently. A prophecy that would come to pass sooner.\n\nTalking of willpower and determination, the alpha shock started when the current Governor started telling people of Osun that he will pay full salaries as and when due to the workers of osun.\n\nTruth be told, even top members of the party hierarchy both in the state and federal dispell this promise as a mere campaign contents to sway votes, what was clear to all then was that osun has bitten more than she can chew and future generations will continue to pay for it with obvious punishment such as \u201cAfusa\u201d and it\u2019s attendant hardship on the people of Osun. The second category of people that doubt this campaign promise by candidate Oyetola were the workers! Yes they are the worst hit by the \u2018Afusa\u2019 tsunami, imagine working for a month and collecting half of your normal salary with full deductible deductions.\n\nGovernor Oyetola has not only fulfill his promise of paying full salaries, he has went further to approve minimum wage for all levels of Osun workforce, isn\u2019t this a miracle? An illustration of dry bone rising again, yet infrastructural development hasn\u2019t stop for a single day!\n\nPeople begin to wonder how the man of the moment is doing it, questions like what\u2019s the secret? the magic and whatever is it should be shared for younger generation to learn. An economic expert, Dr Ogunyemi said it takes a miracle worker to do what Oyetola is doing. Is this hard to know?\n\nI find out it\u2019s about prudence in Public Financial Management (PFM), a process by which money comes into the purse of the government and the process by which goverment expend the money through implementation of project and services.This is the premise on which the financial encyclopedia based his fiscal governance on.\n\nOsun Government under the leadership of Governor Oyetola has been able to develop Medium Term Sector Strategy (MTSS) and Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) which has been assisting the state in preparing realistic budget since 2018.\n\nThe budget performance of the state government of osun is available on the state website (www.stateofosun.gov.ng). Both national and international partners in the area of public finance has credited osun as one of the states that has developed and signed into law virtually all financial management laws.\n\nWithin two years of his Adminstration, the payment system of internally generated revenue has been digitalized, this is in line with blocking all loopholes and thus remitted IGR skyrocketed in an ever increasing scale. To solidify this system, State of Osun Audit law of 2018, which provides the legal backup for the office of the Auditor General for the state and Auditor Generals for the local governments was signed into law and later within the same first two years, Osun Public Financial Management law 2020 was also accented.\n\nThe Administration has invested heavily on ICT via State integrated financial management information system (SIFIMIS) which assist the administration in Setting realistic budget. The Gboyega Oyetola Administration has put in place a robust procurement system and auditing institutions has also been repositioned.\n\nIn recognition of all this fiscal efforts, SFTAS (State Fiscal Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability Project) rated Osun among the top in public financial management in Nigeria. This is a world bank funded project alongside federal government of Nigeria. At the end of their fact finding mission accross the country which includes but not limited to evaluation of Budget Preparation process, budget performance process, public procurement process, financial accounting process, auditing process and even revenue collection process. They declared osun one of the best in the entire country.\n\nAnother project that played a key role in osun fiscal governance is SLOGOR (State and Local Governance Reform Project). Under Governor Oyetola leadership, SLOGOR has repositioned the fiscal space in the State of osun and can compete with comity of performing States, it has been adjudged by the World Bank Assisted State Fiscal Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability Project as one of the best in Nigeria. The project has open the State Of Osun to budget support from international development community.\n\nGovernor Oyetola has repositioned the fiscal governance of osun than before. Within the armbit of international development organizations like WORLD BANK, UNESCO, European Union (EU), United Kingdom Department for International Development ( DFID) and others, they are now seeing osun as a state they can partner with. They are more willing than before to support the government. These are development partners that can\u2019t inject their money into a system that\u2019s not transparent.\n\nAll osun audit reports are on the osun website and this has raise the level of confidence of donors and development partners. It can only happened when you have a thourougbred professional and technocrats in power. There\u2019s more to be done and osun people are willing to give a man with Will power, determination, and perseverance in the thoughts that things can be better.\n\nOsun couldn\u2019t have Achieve so much with so little if not for financial mastery and prudence of the Governor. A Bantu proverb situates that \u201cWhen money realizes that it is in good hands, it wants to stay and multiply in those hands.\u201d this is the testimony of our grass to grace fiscal reality in osun, the reason why we must insist on retaining Governor Gboyega Oyetola to continue this frugal display of financial mastery, discipline and brilliant fiscal governance.\n\nForward With Governor Gboyega Oyetola forever!\n\nCharles Adeyemi writes from osogbo.

          "title": "Governance Cost: Sacking Workers Not Long-term Solution \u2013 Osinbajo",
          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said sacking of public servants may not be a long-term solution to reducing the high cost of governance in the country.\n\nProf. Osinbajo stated this on Saturday in his keynote address at the Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola Leadership Colloquium 2021, themed \u2018Government and Big Development: Realities & Solutions for Nigeria\u2019 organised to mark the birthday of the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola.\n\nAccording to him in a statement by his media aide, Laolu Akande, despite the fact that the country has a large public service, there are still huge shortages of manpower.\n\nResponding to a question on the cost of running the public service, the Vice President said the focus should be \u201con people being in the right place in the public service. We have a large public service but you still have huge shortages in, for example, health and education sectors. So, there are massive shortages in many parts of the public service whereas you find redundancies in other aspects of the public service.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that, \u201cwe should be training and engaging more teachers, nurses, doctors and several other participants in the public service, and we may end up with more or less the same cost.\n\n\u201cBut my view is that those costs themselves, so long that we are spending them right, so long as they are spent on the right quality of public servants, are costs that we should bear.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not certain that just a willy-nilly cost cutting is the solution, long term. Of course, we find within the public service, so many who are not qualified, many whose jobs are replicated, huge redundancies, we need to correct those redundancies, we need to ensure that those who are not qualified are either retrained or we let them go.\n\n\u201cBut we must ensure that we do not allow ourselves to be trapped in a way of thinking that suggests that the problem is really just the cost of governance, so that if we just downsize, everything will be alright.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI think the problem is a bit larger than that. I think we have to look at really, the professionalization of our public service, ensuring that we have the right quality of people in the right jobs.\u201d\n\nHe also stated that just like the implementation of the Social Investment Programmes, the Buhari administration has over the years deployed significant resources to address challenges in education and healthcare sectors, in its efforts to address human capital development and related issues in the country.\n\nExplaining circumstances where government may need to intervene directly, including in human capital development, the Vice President said, \u201cdirect state (government) intervention is crucial. You cannot have such conditions (such as in the country) and not have some direct interventions from government.\u201d\n\nHis words: \u201cThe point is that, for many of the challenges that face a developing economy, there is very little, immediate term profit for private actors in addressing those challenges, but of course, there are huge medium to long term social and economic gains to be reaped.\n\n\u201cIn order to fill that gap, government must come in, government must intervene. This intervention in my view, are the issues of big development. How do you educate the largest youth population in Africa? How do you ensure healthcare for that large number of people, and all of the various issues? These are the big development issues that confront us. And we must be able to find solutions to them.\u201d\n\nMaking reference to some specific interventions of the Federal Government, Prof. Osinbajo noted that \u201cin our first budget, we devoted for N500 billion to our Social Investment Programme. 500,000 young graduates were engaged in the N-Power programme, and 9.5 million children being fed daily in the school feeding programme (just before COVID-19) across 34 States.\n\n\u201cThe programme employs well over 135,000 cooks, and over 100,000 small-holder farmers linked to the programme, supplying locally sourced ingredients. At some point, this translated to 594 cattle, 138,000 chickens, 6.8 million eggs, 83 metric tons of fish, that are procured, prepared, and distributed every week. The higher outcomes for enrollment of pupils in school, retention and performance of students have all been empirically verified.\n\n\u201cThere was also the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP) \u2013 TraderMoni, MarketMoni initiatives where micro credits were offered to traders (about 2 million traders in all).\u201d\n\nHe further explained that \u201cthese programmes are important because they are in many ways government efforts at directly creating opportunities. A country such as ours clearly require a social welfare programme, a situation where those who cannot work and those who have no work and the vulnerable are provided with one way of earning something and provided with opportunities.\u201d\n\nIn the health sector, the Vice President said: \u201csince the inception of this administration, we have done a few other direct social investment-type things aimed at human capital development.\n\n\u201cAfter the National Health Act was passed in 2014, the Federal Government in 2018 began including the 1% minimum portion of the Consolidated Revenue Fund \u2013 amounting to N55 billion to fund the Basic Health Care Provision Fund (BHCPF). The Fund is designed to deliver a guaranteed set of health services to all Nigerians, through the national network of Primary Health Care Centers.\u201d\n\nIn education, Prof. Osinbajo noted that \u201csince 2015 also, the Federal Government has disbursed more than N170 billion in matching grants to States and the FCT under the Universal Basic Education Programme, N8 billion in Special Education Grants to States and private providers of Special Education, and N34 billion from the Teachers Professional Development Fund to States and the FCT.\u201d\n\nThe statement added the Vice President noted that the interventions were in line with the administration\u2019s \u201ccommitment of lifting 100 million people out of poverty\u201d, noting that \u201cwe recognize the threats posed by social immobility and deprivation\u201d.\n\nCommending the efforts of Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, as governor of Osun State, and describing him as \u201ca repentant Marxist\u201d, the Vice President said \u201che stands out as a reason why one should at least have some socialist blood in them while recognizing the fundamental role of markets and the public sector.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOsun State which Ogbeni governed for 8 years received the lowest in federal allocations but was for those years, the State with the lowest poverty rate. The incidence of poverty for the State of Osun was 10.9% in 2017 as against 37.5% in 2010. A sharp drop in the incidence of poverty between 2010 and 2018. As of early 2020 the incidence of poverty has fallen further to 8.2%. Why would a State with one of the least revenues record lowest levels of poverty?\n\n\u201cTo a large extent, it is arguable that the social intervention policies he initiated and implemented were largely responsible. The State launched several job creation efforts \u2013 Osun State Youth Empowerment Program (OYES) hired about 20,000 young people.\n\n\u201cThere was also the school feeding programme, the precursor to our National Homeschool Feeding Programme, serving 155,000 children at inception to over 250,000 children in all 1,382 public elementary schools in the State. 7000 jobs were directly created and 3700 cooks, most of them women. The programme led to an increase of 60% in primary school enrollment and all meals served were from farms and suppliers of food items benefitted from the programme.\u201d\n\nAside the convener, other speakers and special guests at the colloquium moderated by noted broadcaster, Mr. Boason Omofaye, included the Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai; the Statistician-General of the Federation/CEO, NBS, Mr Yemi Kale; President of the Nigerian Labour Congress, Mr. Ayuba Wabba; the vice chairman of the Ibadan School of Government and Public Policy, Prof. Tunji Olaopa, among others.",

Quite a large number of Nigerian children have fallen victims of illicit commercial activities which include human trafficking, sexual exploitation domestic servitude, and street begging.\n\n\u201cThe safety of our children from kidnappers, abusive parents and guardians as well as the sale of our children for exploitative purposes further re-enforces the need to strengthen the resolve to accelerate action on policies and programs including a legal framework that will help in enhancing the protection of our children from these evil elements and criminal minds.\n\n\u201cThis framework includes the need for the passage and full implementation of the Child\u2019s Right Acts, and the Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Act in all States that have neither passed nor implemented these laws as these laws have been designed to provide a safe-net for our children.\n\n\u201cThere is a great need to begin instilling in our children the core values of honesty, hard work, selfless service, moral rectitude, patriotism, respect for elders, accountability, discipline and self-confidence. We as leaders must set a good example for the children.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that if our children grow with these core values instilled in them, the hope of having a truly great Nation in the near future will be rekindled.\n\n\u201cTo parents, teachers, guardians and religious leaders, I implore you all on this day to take into cognisance the need to protect our children and wards from unscrupulous elements that see our children as mere commodities and toys to be toiled with and exploited.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore imperative that parents work closely with NAPTIP and other law Enforcement Agencies in ensuring that perpetrators of evil acts towards our children are reported in order to ensure that such perpetrators are brought to book.\n\n\u201cNAPTIP on its part shall continue to work assiduously towards the protection of our children,\u201d she said.",

The pandemic is threatening decades of progress we have made for children.\n\n\u201cViolence is perpetrated against one in four Nigerian children \u2013 and one in three Nigerian girls is sexually abused. This has only increased during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cToday of all days, we must commit to reinforce the protection mechanisms for all children.\n\n\u201cBut we have learned from this pandemic too. One thing we have learned is that education takes place not only in schools \u2013 children can and should learn both in and out of school. A learning continuum is critical, so that all children continue to get an education irrespective of their situation, location, or the pandemic.\n\n\u201cNigerian children are resilient, talented and aspire to do great things. And it is our responsibility to give them the platform and encouragement to do just that.\n\n\u201cWe know that protecting children and investing in women and families is not only the right thing to do it has proven to be a sound economic choice and a cost-effective tool for national development.\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate our children today, we must act in their best interests and deploy innovative solutions to fast-track learning and health services to build back better, for every Nigerian child.\u201d",

          "text": "Chelsea have won the Champions League for the second time in their history as a Kai Havertz goal was enough to see off Manchester City 1-0 at the Estadio do Dragao in Porto on Saturday.\n\nThe match marked the London side\u2019s first appearance in a final since their dramatic 2012 triumph over Bayern Munich in Munich, and third overall.\n\nThe win gives Thomas Tuchel \u2014 who took over the club in January \u2014 his first as manager after guiding Paris Saint-Germain to the final last season.\n\nThe all-England decider was the eighth time clubs from the same country have matched up with a European Cup on the line, and handed the country its 14th crown overall which is only behind Spain for most all time.\n\nA lively first-half rife with chances for both sides looked set to head into the break scoreless. Chelsea defender Thiago Silva came off in the 39th minute with an apparent leg injury and seemingly left the Blues\u2019 defence vulnerable with substitute Andreas Christensen replacing him at centre-back. But it was City whose back-line was split open three minutes later.\n\nFrom a goal kick, Ben Chilwell played on Mason Mount who found a streaking Kai Havertz racing into a massive gap between City defenders.\n\nEderson charged out of his goal but couldn\u2019t clear the ball from the Germany international who calmly rounded the keeper and slotted home into an empty net.\n\nCity were dealt another blow when star midfielder Kevin De Bruyne was taken off at the hour mark after an ugly clash with Chelsea\u2019s Antonio Rudiger, who received a yellow card for the foul.\n\nUnited States midfielder Christian Pulisic made history in the 66th minute, becoming the first American male to appear in a UCL final when he was subbed on for Timo Werner, and nearly made an immediate impact but saw his stretching shot with only Ederson to beat bounce wide of the far post.\n\nAnd despite seven minutes of added on time and Phil Foden going close, Pep Guardiola and City were left to rue an opportunity missed, as Chelsea celebrated their triumph.",

Assimi Goita, who assumed power after the sacking of the Transition Government\u2019s President Bah Ndaw and Prime Minister Moctar Ouane.\n\nA statement on Saturday by Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey, Minister for Foreign Affairs and regional integration on the extraordinary session of the authority of Heads of state and government on the situation in Mali noted that the Summit will also enable the authority deliberate and take consequential decisions on the evolving political and security situation in the country.\n\n\u201cIn line with the ECOWAS Protocol on Democracy and Good Governance, the President of the Republic, H.E. Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, in his capacity as Chair of the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State and Government, following due consultations with his peers decided to convene this Extraordinary Summit,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of the Summit is to enable the Authority deliberate and take consequential decisions on the evolving political and security situation in the Republic of Mali.\n\n\u201cAs you are all aware, the past few days have witnessed some worrying developments in Mali. The arrest and detention of the President and Prime Minister of the Transition Government by the military has necessitated a re-evaluation of the strategies adopted by ECOWAS to bring normalcy to the country.\n\n\u201cAt the behest of the President of the Republic, an ECOWAS Mediation team, led by H.E. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, ECOWAS Special Envoy and Mediator for Mali, embarked on a fact-finding mission to Mali from 25th to 26th May, 2021 to assess the situation and explore opportunities for the resolution of the crisis. H.E. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan will, therefore, report to the Summit on the outcome of the mission.\n\n\u201cMay I indicate that the convening of the Extraordinary Session demonstrates the unwavering commitment of the President of the Republic towards addressing the political situation in Mali.\n\n\u201cIt would be recalled that barely a week after his assumption of office as Chair of the ECOWAS Authority, H.E. the President, convened an emergency Summit, held at Peduase, in response to the military intervention, which saw the ousting of the then President H.E. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita on 18th August, 2020. That meeting took important decisions, including a demand on the Malian authorities to ensure that the Transition Government was Civilian-led and should last for a period of eighteen (18) months, with effect from 15th September, 2020. The Summit also affirmed that once a civilian-led transition government had assumed office, ECOWAS within the context of its protocols will assist Mali to return to democratic governance. It is important to note that H.E. the President has since been at the centre of efforts, including mediation initiatives, to bring lasting peace and stability to Mali\n\n\u201cIt is hoped that all the political actors in Mali will support the outcome of the Extraordinary Summit to be held tomorrow in order to restore constitutional order in our sister country as soon as practicable. The outcome of the Summit will be critical to sustaining the momentum for the return of democracy and stability in Mali.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
