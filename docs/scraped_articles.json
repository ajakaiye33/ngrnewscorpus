          "text": "At least 26 per cent of schools in Nigeria\u2019s North-East have been targeted by suicide bombers, according to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund.\n\nIt said an improved system of school data collection, analysis and usage would help bridge the gap caused by protracted conflict in the education sector.\n\nThe Chief of the Maiduguri Field Office, UNICEF, Phuong Nguyen, said this in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to Nguyen, 50 government education officers in the North-East region have been trained in the collection of quality data with support from the European Union.\n\nShe added that the capacity building initiative would serve as evidence to guide interventions in the education sector.\n\nNguyen explained, \u201cIn Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states, 1.9 million conflict-affected boys, girls and adolescents are without access to basic quality education. Since 2012, 31 per cent of all schools in North-East Nigeria have been hit, at least once by bullets, shells, or shrapnel.\n\n\u201cTen per cent have been deliberately set on fire and 26 per cent targeted by suicide bombers. At 47.3 per cent, almost half of all schools in the region require rehabilitation.\u201d\n\nAccording to the UNICEF chief, the training will ensure that data on out-of-school children, children attending Tsangaya and Islamiyya schools, and non-formal education pathways will be captured and stored digitally to improve education planning and targeting services to support girls and boys.\n\n\u201cFor conflict-affected children across North-East Nigeria, it means one thing \u2013 schools will have adequate teachers, more inclusive and child-friendly learning environment, including safe classrooms, gender-segregated toilets and water points as enablers to stay in school, transition, complete their education and contribute positively to the society. This initiative will help improve access to quality education for marginalised children, especially girls and others living with disabilities.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

That is the only thing I can remember but I just know that we suffered but again we are thankful to the Nigerian Army and the police they really helped us because they brought us to the hospital.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t sit by the window side. It was inside. The terrorists entered the train but they didn\u2019t reach my own side. It were bullets that just hit people.\n\n\u201cThey entered SP 17 when they entered we were looking at them while we laid down because they asked us to lie down. The police in the train were the ones that told us to lay down so that bullet will nit hit us and that is why the bullet hit me. I didn\u2019t know that we were to lie down.\n\n\u201cThey are young guys, small boys, they should be between 18-20, and they are like Fulanis but not Nigerians. Some of them have turban on their heads and they were chanting Allahu Akbar. We even saw when they were abducting some people, they were driving them out of the train and went away with them.\n\nAnother survivor, Muhammadu Ishaq, said: \u201cWe heard a loud voice of something, then the train started shaking then suddenly it stopped. Then we started hearing gunshots from every angle.\n\n\u201cThen police that inside the train they ran and came out and started firing back. They told us to all lie down in the train. The police went through the front to fire them back but they followed through the back Coach 17.\n\n\u201cThen they broke the door with gun and they gained access. Then they said everyone should come out, then me when I saw that they have successfully entered the train. Then we started running from coach 17 to 16, 15 and so on and so on.\n\n\u201cAs I was running for my life, than I noticed I shot on my hand, then I held my hand to continue running. I didn\u2019t even know it was gunshot. But I know something hit me and then I held the place. It was when I was soaked with blood I knew it was gunshot.\n\n\u201cThen we laid down and praying but was still hearing gunshots for like one and half hour, then we started hearing the soldiers from far and they started shooting them back.\u201d\n\nAnother survivor, Fatima Shuaibu, a student, said: \u201cI was sitting close to the window. They just threw something like bomb and the train started shaking. Then the train tried to fall down, after then when the train has stopped they started shooting. So they broke the door of the train on the VIP side, so they came inside, carry some people, shoot some, went away with some and took them through the bush before the security came like one hour thirty minutes after the attack, over 500 security came and saved.\n\n\u201cI was inside the VIP coach, they were targeting the VIP coach. After that they targeted the economy side, SP 17 they shoot many people there. They told us they came with five Sharon car and machines. They just put People inside and went away.\n\n\u201cThey are small children like 18-20 years and they did not look like Nigerian people. They looked like Chadians, Nigeriens because they spoke languages like Fulani but not purely Fulani of Nigeria. And they were not even more than 20.\u201d",

          "text": "\n\n*Orders rescue of abducted passengers, immediate arrest of perpetrators\n\n*Orders integrated security surveillance for Abuja-Kaduna, Lagos-Ibadan rail lines\n\n\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has directed the nation\u2019s security agencies to ensure, without further delay, the release of all kidnapped passengers on the Abuja-Kaduna train that was attacked on Monday by terrorists. He also ordered the immediate arrest of the terrorists that carried out the dastardly act of attacking the train to face justice, and the implementation of integrated security surveillance for Abuja-Kaduna and Lagos-Ibadan rail lines. The President gave the directives at the State House, Abuja, Tuesday after being briefed by the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Lucky Irabor and service chiefs as well as the Inspector General of Police, among other top military officers, about the attack by terrorists on the Kaduna bound passenger train.He charged the law enforcement chiefs to bring back all passengers kidnapped and ensure that each of the callous terrorists were hunted down and made to face justice for their heinous acts as no one or group should be allowed to make the country prostrate.\n\n\n\nPresident Buhari reiterated his earlier directive that the military should deal ruthlessly with terrorists. He asked them to be more decisive and not spare anyone unlawfully wielding the AK 47 weapon.\u201dNo one should be allowed to hold the country to ransom,\u201d said the President.President Buhari strongly condemned the bombing of the passenger train, describing it as a \u201cmatter of grave concern.\u201dAccording to him, \u201clike most Nigerians, I am deeply pained by its occurrence, the second of its type, which has resulted in the death of a yet to be determined number of passengers and others who suffered injuries.\u201cThe attack on the train, a safe means of transport to many, is callous; and our thoughts are with the families of the deceased and prayers for the injured,\u201d he said.The President commended the Law Enforcement agencies for their prompt response and emergency personnel who were responsible for the evacuation and treatment of the injured persons. President Buhari also directed the immediate conclusion of all the processes for the implementation of the integrated security surveillance and monitoring solution for the Abuja to Kaduna railway line adding that this be extended to cover the Lagos-Ibadan railway line.He further directed the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) management to speedily repair the damaged lines and resume normal service without delay.Briefing newsmen after the closed door meeting with the President Buhari, the Chief of Defence Staff, General Irabor said: \u201cwe have come to brief the President regarding the unfortunate incident of yesterday, where some criminals, bandits had gone to lay improvised explosive devices on the rail tracks and a passenger train was demobilised and seven Nigerians were killed, 29 others wounded and some were kidnapped and we are yet to establish the exact number.\u201cSo we went to the scene this morning, inspected the entire area and gave out instructions on what is to be done and we have come to brief the President on this development.\u201dThe CDS said security agencies will build on the lessons they have learnt from the latest incident while assuring Nigerians that the military and other security agencies will not rest on their oars until everywhere is secured. According to him: \u201cThe challenge of insecurity is a constant one and so the defence and security agencies need to be on their toes 24/7. This is unfortunate and we believe that the lessons out of this are what we need to build upon going forward.\u201cI can perhaps use this opportunity and reassure the nation that based on the President\u2019s directive, we will take every necessary action, not just to apprehend those behind this dastardly act are not just apprehended but for them to also face justice. \u201cGoing forward, certainly there will be greater security for the nation and I will like to urge everybody to go about their normal duties\u201d.Apart from the CDS, others who took turns to brief the President were the Chief of Army Staff, Lt-General Faruk Yahaya; Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Isiaka Amao; Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba, as well as the Chief of Defence Intelligence, Major General Samuel Adebayo and the Director General of the Department of State Services (DSS),Yusuf Magaji Bichi.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*El-Rufai visits victims in hospitals\n\nBy John Shiklam\n\nSurvivors of Monday\u2019s attack on a Kaduna-bound train have recounted their ordeals on their hospital beds.\n\nSeveral people were believed to have been killed while many others were reported to have been abducted by the terrorists during the attack between Kateri and Rijana communities in Kaduna state.\n\nAlthough there has been no official confirmation of the number of fatalities, sources said no less than 10 people may have been killed.\n\nThe number of those injured could not be ascertained, however, majority of them are said to be receiving treatment at the 44, Nigerian Army Referral Hospital, Kaduna and St. Gerald Catholic Hospital, Kakuri, Kaduna.\n\nIt was gathered that among those killed, was Dr. Chinelo Megafu Nwando of St. Gerald Hospital whose death was confirmed by sources in the hospital.\n\n\n\nAlso, a former deputy governor of Zamfara state, Alhaji Ibrahim Wakkala, was injured in the attack.\n\nYusuf Idris, a former spokesman to the ex- deputy governor said Wakkala, was shot in the leg and he\u2019s currently receiving treatment in a medical facility in Kaduna.\n\n\u201cHe is responding to treatment very well. He is answering phone calls on his bed. I spoke to him and several other people spoke to him also. There is no cause for alarm,\u201d Yusuf said.\n\nThree of the the survivors at the St. Gerald Catholic hospital, described their ordeals as horrible.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with journalists in Kaduna, one of the survivors, Maimuna Ibrahim, who was shot on the thigh, said it was a horrible experience.\n\n\u201cWe saw hell, I prayed and prayed and prayed\u201d, she said.\n\n\u201cI went to a workshop in Abuja in the morning and I was on my way back to Kaduna that same day after the workshop.\n\n\u201cI was shot on the thigh. But the bullet did not touch my bone. The bullet penetrated out of my thigh.\n\n\u201cHonestly, we suffered seriously, but thank God soldiers came and they really helped us\u201d, she said.\n\nAccording to her, she was unable to walk after she was shot and soldiers had to carry her out of the train to a vehicle by the expressway.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was unable to walk, it was the soldiers who carried me on the back to the vehicle that brought us to the hospital. \u201cThey were able to pass over the cliff, carrying us on their backs! Seriously, they tried because it was not easy climbing the cliff,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe terrorists came, were moving about in the train, but they did not come to where I was seated.\n\n\u201cI was hit by the bullet through the window.\n\n\u201cThey entered SP17. As they were shooting, the police security on the train asked us to lie down on the floor of the train so that the bullet will not get at us.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately before I could lie down the bullet hit me.\n\n\u201cI saw the terrorists from the window. They were many, they were small boys of between the ages of 18 and 20. They appeared like fulani.\n\nThey wore turbans. They don\u2019t look like Nigerians. They were shouting Allahakubar.\n\n\u201cThey abducted some people, I saw them forcing people out of the train. They were beating them as they were taking them out of the train.\n\nThey were shouting Allahuhakubar, Allahuhakubar as they shot sporadically\u201d, she said.\n\nAlso speaking on her hospital bed, another survivor, Fatima Shuaibu, a student of College of Education, Gidan Waya, Kaduna state, said her sister was killed in the attack.\n\nShe was being treated for dislocation on her right leg.\n\n\u201cMy sister, Zainab Awal, was shot on the stormach and she died,\u201d she said amid tears.\n\nShuaibu said she was seated by the window when she started noticing flashes of torch lights.\n\nShe said initially, she thought it was the villagers around the area, but when she suddenly heard a loud explosion and the train went off track, she knew there was trouble as her heart started palpitating.\n\nShe said, \u201cI was seated by the window in the train. Suddenly I started seeing flashes of touch light, this was around 8pm.\n\n\u201cThen there was a loud bang as if something exploded.\n\nThen the train went off track as if was falling down. We started shouting and praying.\n\n\u201cAs soon as the train stopped, we started hearing gunshots.\n\n\u201cThe security personnel on the train announced that everybody should lie down on the floor of the train.\n\n\u201cThey attacked the VIP couch, they abducted some people and took them to the bush, they shot other people.\n\n\u201cThey operated for about two hours or so before soldiers and Airforce arrived and they exchanged gunshots.\n\n\u201cThe terrorists came with five buses and motorcycles. Those who were abducted were taken away in the Sharon buses.\n\n\u201cThe terrorists were small boys of between 18 to 20 years. I saw them, they dont look like Nigerians. The soldiers rescued us in the train.\n\n\u201cThose of us who were injured were evacuated from the train. They climbed the cliff with us and took us to the expressway where vehicles were brought to carry people.\n\nAlso speaking from his hospital bed at St. Gerald, Mohammed Isa, who was shot on his right arm, said the whole episode was like a dream.\n\nHe said, \u201cI was seated by the window and they shot me on the right arm.\n\n\u201cThere was an explosion and the train lost control and went off track.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden they started shooting at the train from afar, then they started coming closer.\n\n\u201cWhen they got to the train they attempted to force the door open, but they couldn\u2019t. So they shot at the door and it opened.\n\n\u201cThey were speaking Hausa\n\nIt took quite some time before soldiers came and they exchanged fire with them\u201d.\n\nAt the Army hospital, journalists were prevented from seeing the victims.\n\nMeanwhile the Kaduna state governor, Mallam Nasir, El-Rufai has visited victims of the attacks in the hospitals.\n\nIn a statement issued after visiting the 44 Nigerian Army Referral Hospital and St. Gerald Catholic Hospital on Tuesday, the state government condemned the terrorist attack on the Kaduna-Abuja train.The statement expressed sympathy and solidarity with all the passengers, and extends its condolence to the families of the those that died in the attack.\n\nThe statement signed by Muyiwa Adekeye, spokesman to El-Rufai, said the governor and his deputy Dr. Hadiza Balarabe, visited the injured in hospitals.\n\n\u201cThe governor prays for the peaceful repose of the souls of the deceased persons and wishes the injured persons speedy recovery.\u201d\n\nAdekeye said \u201cwhile the evacuation of passengers from the scene of the attack has been completed, efforts are still being made to account for all the passengers, crew and security officers that were on the train\u201d.\n\nThe statement said the Kaduna State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) had issued a contact number 09088923398 for inquiries and information from family members of the passengers.\n\nThe state government appealed to all citizens to uphold law and order, and promote peace and harmony in our communities.\n\nIt added that, \u201cThe state government continues to liaise with the Federal Government and security agencies to protect our people and defeat the terrorists and other criminals.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to stand together against those who threaten civilised order.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The African Action Congress (AAC) has called on Nigerians to resist any attempt by President Muhammadu Buhari to hand over the leadership of the country to terrorists when his tenure ends in May 2023.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday by the party's National Publicity Secretary, Femi Adeyeye, the AAC said that human life was no longer worth anything tangible under Buhari's administration hence the need for citizens to reject any person or group thrown forward by the President as his successor in 2023.\n\nThe statement reads, \"Our country is yet again thrown into a mourning mood as terrorist attacks keep hitting all corners of our space and our people are mindlessly and in the most gruesome manner, slaughtered. It wouldn\u2019t be out of place to ask the Muhammadu Buhari regime, what is the worth of human life in today's Nigeria?\n\n\"Yesternight, the so-called bandits furthered their attacks on the Kaduna International Airport by bombing a train ferrying about 1,000 passengers to Abuja. As we write, the number of casualties is yet to be ascertained, as figures and profiles keep rolling in. It\u2019s actually a sad time for all of us.\n\n\"A point of concern for us at the African Action Congress is that if Kaduna State; a state that houses major military formations in the country -- the training academy, defence houses, intelligence, etc. could be easily breached, without any ounce of information leaking to our security apparatus, where else in the country is safe? It is clear that these repeated attacks of this magnitude are products of some high-level intelligence compromise.\n\n\"The bombings and renewed confidence of these terrorists keep justifying our long-term suspicion that President Buhari is only interested in looting and destroying all that is left in the country, in order to hand over to his terrorist allies.\n\n\"Buhari has failed severally to expose to the world many of his political and personal allies that have been linked to the various violent activities of terrorists. These terrorist sponsors and chieftains are members of the Buhari cabal, and despite all the expositions by globally recognised security agents, the President has failed to arrest or prosecute any of them. In fact, President Buhari keeps one of these known terrorist allies like Isa Pantami in his government as Communications Minister.\n\n\"Patriots like the late Obadiah, Commodore Kunle Olawuni and the researcher David Hundeyin have all come up with evidence. This is separate from the daily exposures from Sahara Reporters and some other media outfits. All this evidence being consciously ignored points to nothing but the fact that the President definitely has ulterior motives.\n\n\"Recall that Buhari practically lives in London hospitals while the rest of his family have relocated to Dubai. The President has also ignored all the hues and cries of Northerners, even in his home state Katsina -- a hotbed and capital of terrorism today. Recall also that the same Buhari has decided to kill all elements of social security left while putting citizens in mass hardship and advanced suffering.\n\n\"For us at the African Action Congress, we call on Nigerians to stop lamenting, organise and take action. This is the only way we can take our destinies into our hands. The army, police, and other security agencies have been long decimated and weakened through poor remuneration and bad welfare. And they are also forcefully attacking all voices of dissent including arresting and detaining police officers over the long-overdue police strike.\n\n\"AAC believes that cries cannot resolve the issues at hand. We call on Nigerians to rise and conduct another mass actions that will be multiple of the #EndSARS protests. When we rise, no one can stop us. Nigerians must never mind the scare tactics and intimidations by the secret police and government rogues. We have a date with the future that we must never allow to be buried in this rotten present.\n\n\"Finally, we send our condolences to affected families. May the souls of the departed rest in peace. Our consolations will come when we all rise irrespective of our ethnic or religious affiliations to march for a new Nigeria where all these fatalities and sorrows would be a thing of the past. There is no other time for such revolution but now, now, and now!\"",

          "text": "Buy now pay later (BNPL)\u2014a short-term consumer financing that allows shoppers to purchase products online and pay in installments with nominal or no fees\u2014is sweeping the global e-commerce sector. Afterpay, Klarna, Affirm, and Zip are some of the players leading this charge while tech and payments giants Apple, Square, PayPal, and Visa have their respective BNPL initiatives as they look to get a slice of the action.\n\nIn Africa, BNPL activity is beginning to take shape and one of the pioneers in this space, CredPal, on Tuesday announced that it\u2019s raised $15 million in a bridge round comprising equity and debt. This will be used to expand its consumer credit offerings in its home country, Nigeria, and scale across Africa.\n\nLaunched in 2018 by CEO Fehintolu Olaogun and COO Olorunfemi Jegede, Y Combinator- and Google-backed CredPal allows individuals and businesses to pay for purchases in instalments across online and offline merchants, for both large and small-ticket items\u2014from as low as \u20a62,000 up to \u20a65 million. CredPal claims to have over 85,000 active customers and more than 4,000 active merchants.\n\nIn addition to providing infrastructure that allows banks and other financial institutions to deliver consumer credit in real-time, CredPal offers its customers access to credit cards, which was launched in November 2020.\n\nWhen it comes to credit cards, the frequent user wins!\n\n\n\nThe more you use your credit card, the more your reward \u2013 from 1% to 15% across our partnered merchants!\n\n\n\nImagine being rewarded for spending! pic.twitter.com/PCekh7M5oZ \u2014 CredPal (@CredPal) November 26, 2020\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is encapsulate the lifestyle of the average working-class Nigerian and ensure that every person can find something specifically for them on CredPal,\u201d Olaogun said in a recent interview. \u201cFor instance, a professional who earns \u20a6250,000 can get a credit card with a limit that they can pay back at the end of their billing cycle or use it to buy now and pay later.\u201d\n\nWith the new funding, the startup plans to extend partnerships with merchants through its recently deployed CredPal Pay, an omnichannel merchant suite that allows businesses seamlessly accept buy now, pay later. The point-of-sale infrastructure enables BNPL through various means, including a credit payment link, checkout plugin, QR codes, and a transaction management system.\n\n\u201cOur commitment to better credit facilities for African consumers and helping sellers grow their sales is getting a huge boost with these latest milestones,\u201d Olaogun says in a statement.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe latest funding brings the total investment secured by CredPal to $16.7 million, per Crunchbase data, having previously raised $1.5 million in 2020, part of which was used to roll out its credit cards.\n\nParticipating in this bridge round are existing investors, including Greenhouse Capital (which is also an investor in Kenya\u2019s BNPL startup Lipa Later), as well as new backers including Uncovered Fund, LongCommerce, First Circle Capital, and Adii Pienaar, co-founder and former CEO of WooCommerce. Meanwhile, a number of undisclosed financial institutions provided the debt facility.\n\nCredPal co-founders Fehintolu Olaogun (left) and Olorunfemi Jegede.\n\nThe funding announcement coincides with a new partnership with Airtel Nigeria to enable consumers across Nigeria to access BNPL to own smartphones and broadband modems, CredPal says, without sharing specific details about the deal.\n\nThe fresh investment will also support the startup\u2019s planned expansion across Africa, starting with Kenya, Egypt, Ghana, and Cameroon, the company said.\n\nWith the bulk of African consumers severely starved of efficient and sustainable credit solutions, the BNPL movement is waxing strong across the continent and so is the competition among players.\n\nLipa Later is one of the early companies in the space in Kenya and there is M-Kopa\u2014which has since expanded into phones and retail products\u2014in Kenya, Uganda, and Nigeria. CDCare, PayQart, and Carbon also play in Nigeria. And in South Africa, there are PayJustNow and Payflex. The latter was recently acquired by Australian BNPL Zip.\n\nWhile competition appears to be heating up, there is a significantly large market of consumers and merchants to be tapped. But success will largely be determined by how effectively players can drive the adoption and use of credit financing and cards by African consumers.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Digital Nomads: The pastor turned tech bro",
          "text": "\u201cEven if I have the call of God, it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t have a career. I shouldn\u2019t have to rely on church offerings to survive. Here\u2019s where people have a problem with pastors: they believe that most pastors wait for tithes or offerings. But that\u2019s not me.\u201d\n\nWhen Jay*, a pastor-turned-data-scientist, was in his final year as a computer engineering student at the Oduduwa University in Osun state, Nigeria, he decided his final year project would focus on e-voting in Nigeria. \u201cBut that topic wasn\u2019t approved,\u201d he says. The reason, Jay says, was that the lecturers in charge, at the time, knew nothing about the applications of tech. \u201cThey told me to be realistic. This was 2018, mind you, but they said that tech wasn\u2019t that important in the country, and that I should research something else. I can\u2019t remember what I finally wrote about, but I know it had nothing to do with tech and its potential impact on our society.\u201d\n\nIf the impact of tech on voting would not be important in 2018, the year before Africa\u2019s most populous country conducted its last general elections, when would it ever be?\n\nFor Jay, this event pushed him towards putting his degree to good use and becoming an all-round tech bro. He doesn\u2019t think his lecturers meant any harm, but he believes their lack of knowledge on the impact of tech will have damning consequences on the students they teach.\n\nAlthough he\u2019d been studying computer engineering, Jay already had a first love: ministering. Born to a Muslim mother and Christian father, he believes he\u2019s been ordained by God to preach the gospel. \u201cMy father died early, so I had to live with my paternal grandmother, and that\u2019s where I got introduced to the word.\u201d\n\nFrom his university days, Jay had been working as a minister, teaching the bible under his own ministry. His only worry was how to make an income independent of the church\u2019s income. \u201cI knew I had to have a career outside ministering. The problem most people have with pastors is that a lot of us depend on the church\u2019s income. I didn\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\nSo, during his National Youth Service\u2014a mandatory 1\u2013year programme all Nigerians must participate in, in service of their country\u2014Jay branched out into tech. He developed design skills and worked as a graphics designer for 17 months before moving to another company to work as a user interface designer.\n\nMonths later, in 2020, Jay landed a hybrid role working as a data annotator for a US-based company that uses artificial intelligence to measure consumer needs.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering what a data annotator does, you\u2019re right to wonder. It\u2019s an unsung profession. \u201cAs a data annotator, my job is to collect and label data that the AIs will use to forecast how consumers will react to e-commerce products,\u201d Jay explains. \u201cFor example, we take the iPhone 13 and try to figure out its impact on users in the next few years.\u201d\n\nThink of data annotation as teaching or training a computer. Focus on AI increased significantly this decade with $77 billion getting invested in the sector, a 113% increase from 2020\u2019s $36 billion investment. In Africa, though, investment in the AI sector is low, accounting for only 3% of total startup investments. It\u2019s no surprise then that data annotators, whose work primarily focus on AI, are scarce on the continent.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t really hacked the importance of AI on the continent, and that\u2019s why there aren\u2019t many data annotators. Whenever I tell people about my job, there\u2019s a bit of scepticism and doubt. There are always questions about what I do, even from top professionals in the field.\u201d\n\nOn his experience with the job, Jay says he enjoys the process and hopes more Africans would get into the field. If there\u2019s any complaint he has, though, it\u2019s the pay gap between him and his non-Nigerian colleagues working for the same company. In the Nigerian context, the job pays fairly well, with Jay getting \u20a6250,000 ($600)/month plus benefits, including pension, HMO, and a work laptop. The benefits are the same with the company\u2019s non-Nigerian employees, except for one big difference.\n\n\u201cI know some of my US colleagues earn about \u20a62.5 million per month, even though we\u2019re doing the same job for the company.\u201d\n\nEven with the pay disparity, Jay is still pretty comfortable with his job. \u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing, and it helps me provide for my family without having to depend on the church\u2019s income.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his design, product, and data annotation skills, he\u2019s also learning software engineering to help him become an all-round tech bro.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not just doing this for me,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the same way I\u2019m teaching the word, I also want to teach tech, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m learning these skills.\u201d\n\nIn the near future, he hopes to bring more people to the altar of tech and preach to them the good news of how much tech can improve their lives.\n\n*Name has been changed to protect the owner\u2019s identity.\n\n\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech. A new episode drops every Wednesday. If you think your story fits the Digital Nomads bill, reach out to us here.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Okubanjo to step back from people decisions at Bento Africa",
          "text": "In an email circular that went out from Bento Africa\u2019s board of directors to the company\u2019s customers and partners on Wednesday evening, the board announced that Ebun Okubanjo will be taking \u201csome time off\u201d and handing over all people-related decisions to his co-founder and COO, Chidozie Okonkwo. Chidozie will lead people operations alongside the company\u2019s country directors.\n\nBento\u2019s board\u2019s decision comes a few days after TechCabal exposed the harrowing experiences of ex-employees of payroll startup Bento Africa and how Okubanjo had allegedly been the orchestrator of that through direct and indirect bullying, verbal abuse, and threats to employees.\n\nIn their email to Bento\u2019s customers and clients, the board condemned Ebun\u2019s initial reaction to the story, especially his tweets attacking the credibility of publication TechCabal.\n\n\u201cAs professional Investors and Operators, we were aghast at the defensive and escalatory first tweets of Ebun on the matter, which we quickly moved against. Our responsibility and charter is to the Company, not the founders we invest in,\u201d the board said in an email sent to all Bento employees, past and present.\n\nFurthermore, the board said that while Okubanjo is taking a back seat with immediate effect, an internal investigation into Bento\u2019s workplace culture has begun. It also announced that it would be reviewing Bento Africa\u2019s internal management practices and processes.\n\n\u201cWe are reviewing the HR and People practices and guidelines at Bento and will work with HR consultants and the company\u2019s in-house team to make sure that it is reflective of human values that drive sustainable performance,\u201d said the board in the email.\n\nThe board claimed to have \u201c\u2026ensured that the current team is safe and free to speak freely. We voided any NDA\u2019s that may have been in place and instructed Management to let the Team know they were free to speak to any journalist that contacted them.\u201d TechCabal reached out to current Bento Africa employees who confirmed that they had been granted permission to speak freely without worrying about consequences.\n\n\u201cI think not restricting us from talking to journalists and cancelling our NDAs is the right thing to do,\u201d said one of the 3 employees TechCabal reached out to for the expose.\u201d\n\nOkubanjo also published a personal apology to current and past employees of the company via his Medium page. In the post titled From ebun. With Love, Okubanjo admits to encouraging a work culture of \u201clong workdays and weeks\u201d and apologised for his abusive outbursts. He also confirmed the board\u2019s decision to appoint Chidozie to lead people operations at the company.\n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d Okubanjo writes. \u201cI have some work to do here and there is a lot of room for growth. It will [sic] be a lie if I say this is a switch I can make overnight, I would [sic] need to learn how to balance passion with empathy. I will step away from all people decisions in the company. Chidozie will take over along with our new Head of People \u2014 Her arrival could not have been more timely. The country leads will also be instrumental in helping shape a more humane people policy.\u201d\n\nIn a bid to repair broken bridges, the CEO also encouraged former and current employees who have \u201cfelt that fire that burns [sic] so hot when we are in the thick of it\u201d to reach out to him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in support of the way Ebun handled the situation, and we\u2019re currently running an internal investigation to quantify the scale of the damages his actions have brought to employees and the business,\u201d said board member and CEO at Zedcrest, Adedayo Hamza. \u201cWe\u2019re open to speaking to anyone about this process.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "title": "Investors on high alert as Y Combinator shows interest in East and North Africa",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2005, while walking home after dinner, Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston decided to start Y Combinator (YC). At the time, Livingston worked at an investment bank, was dissatisfied with her job, and was exploring other options.\n\nGraham, who had founded Viaweb with Robert Morris and Trevor Blackwell, had a few ideas on how VCs should operate but had put off investing in startups for seven years.\n\nWith a rough idea of how they were going to work, Graham called Morris and Blackwell, who brought $50,000 each while Graham put in $100,000, and so what is now known as Y Combinator was born.\n\nTiming its launch to coincide with the summer holidays for US college students, Y Combinator took in its first batch of startups, including social news aggregator, Reddit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company has invested in over 3,000 companies since 2005 and has expanded its focus to include startups from outside the United States.\n\nInvesting in African startups\n\nAlthough it invested in Infogami \u2013 a UK startup \u2013 YC did not invest in another startup outside the US until 2008, when it invested in a Canadian startup, A Thinking Ape.\n\nIn 2012, the accelerator accepted its first Africa-focused startup, Wave, a fintech startup in Senegal.\n\nOver the next three years, no other African startup made it into YC until 2015, when another Senegalese startup, Oolu, and Kenyan startup, Saida, joined its summer batch. Every year since then has seen at least one African startup get into the famous accelerator programme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWave was YC\u2019s first investment in Africa. Image source: TechCrunch\n\nIn addition, each year has seen more African startups get accepted to YC. In its Summer 2021 batch, 15 startups were from Africa, a record at the time. However, the Winter 2022 batch will smash that record with 24 startups.\n\nThe African startups that have gone through the famous accelerator reveal that most of them are founded or operate in the Big Four \u2013 countries that receive the most venture capital investment.\n\nNigeria leads the way with a whopping 49 startups, while Egypt, a distant second with 11 startups, and Kenya with seven round up the top three. The last member of the Big Four, South Africa, is tied in fifth with Tanzania, Senegal, and Ethiopia.\n\nInvesting in startups operating in these four countries is a no-brainer for most investors. For example, with a population of over 200 million people, Nigeria is Africa\u2019s most populous country. It also has a population mostly under 25 and one of the continent\u2019s highest Internet and smartphone penetration rates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoasting similarly attractive prospects to Nigeria, Egypt has a population of 102 million people. While a large population is not a guarantee of investment, the right environment could do that.\n\nThe Egyptian government\u2019s focus on promoting innovation has been vital, while its Central Bank\u2019s $57 million fund in 2019 has boosted innovation in the fintech sector. Consequently, it received $491 million from VCs in 2021, up from $191 million in 2020.\n\nWhy invest outside the Big Four?\n\nBeyond the usual suspects, Y Combinator has invested in startups founded or operating in Namibia, Uganda, Zambia, and Sudan in the last three years. These countries have received little VC investment in the past decade, so why would Y Combinator invest in startups operating there?\n\nLindsay Amos, Director of Communications at Y Combinator and Michael Siebel, Managing Director and Group Partner at Y Combinator, provided some answers.\n\nIn the beginning, YC invested in early-stage startups, some of which were just ideas. With no product or numbers to guide their judgement, the decision to invest frequently in a startup came down to the founder(s), and Amos says this is something they have retained. The accelerator now invests in startups at different stages but maintains its focus on their founders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrican YC alumni founders\n\n\u201cWhen deciding whether to fund a startup, we are most interested in the team \u2014 specifically their technical skills, evidence they can build, and how well they work together. We also look for ideas that have the potential to become large companies if the business succeeds, but this is secondary to the founders. We saw this in Numida, Bloom, and Union54.\n\n\u201cWe like to see that the team has the ability to build. Often that means having a technical founder. It can also look like a track record of building or evidence that you can build an incredible team around you to help execute. When building in a highly-regulated industry like financial services, it\u2019s helpful to have some domain expertise,\u201d she said.\n\nA look at the founding teams of these startups supports her claim. For example, Bloom was founded by Ahmed Ismail, Khalid Keenan, Youcef Oudjidane, and Abdigani Diriye. The quartet all studied at top universities in Europe and America with experience gotten by working at companies like Amazon, Barclays Investment Bank, Goldman Sachs, and IBM.\n\nThe same could be said about Union54, another fintech startup founded in Zambia. The startup was built following the founders\u2019 frustration to create debit cards for their first startup, Zazu. Founded by Perseus Mlambo and Alessandra Martini, Union54 (an allusion to the number of African countries) is a card-issuing API startup.\n\nMeanwhile, Numida was founded by Mina Shahid, Catherine Denis, and Ben Best. They brought experience working at notable organisations like the World Bank and studying at the University of Toronto, and the University of Waterloo; also in the mix was the knowledge from having built businesses before.\n\nThe second part of Amos\u2019 response deals with building businesses that could grow big. At the time of YC\u2019s investment in Paystack, there were few payment processors in Nigeria. As one of the first payment processors in Nigeria, it had the potential to get big. A few years later, there are a lot of startups in Nigeria with similar services.\n\nHowever, while the fintech fever has spread across West Africa, the same cannot be said of East Africa, where startups like Bloom and Numida operate. Like their West African neighbours, a broken financial system means that most East Africans are cut off from essential financial services.\n\nAccording to a 2017 World Bank report, only 16% of Ugandans keep their savings in a formal deposit account. The report also stated that more than 65% of Ugandans couldn\u2019t access credit facilities. Without access to quality financial services, these individuals cannot improve the quality of their lives.\n\nNumida, for example, provides working capital loans to small and medium enterprises in the country that reportedly employ 90% of those working in the country\u2019s private sector. On the other hand, Bloom allows Sudanese residents to save in dollars, helping them hedge against inflation.\n\nWhat are the chances of success?\n\nIn some ways, investing in a startup is similar to investing in any other business. Startups don\u2019t succeed in a vacuum, and events in the countries they operate in could affect their operations, as Nigeria\u2019s fintech and mobility startups can attest to.\n\nSo, beyond great founders and business models, is there an enabling environment for these startups to thrive? We begin with Sudan.\n\nDue to the conflict in the North African country, there have been several sanctions from the United Nations, the United States, and the European Union since 1997. The sanctions were gradually removed from 2017, with the United States finally taking the country off its list of sponsors of terrorism in 2021. In October 2021, the country also received its first VC investment in over 25 years as digital marketplace, alsoug closed a $5 million round.\n\nA major reason for the Sudanese government seeking to get these sanctions removed was to improve the country\u2019s economy since it couldn\u2019t conduct business with most countries. However, a 2018 BBC report claimed that very little had changed in the country, with inflation going through the roof despite the sanctions being lifted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumida team. Source: TechCrunch\n\nAt the time, inflation was 55%, but it has since risen to 115%, according to data from the World Bank. Ironically, one of Bloom\u2019s value propositions is to help its users hedge against inflation by saving in dollars.\n\nAs great as that sounds, one would need to have money before thinking about hedging against inflation and with 36% of Sudanese living in poverty, it appears the problem is bigger than hedging against inflation.\n\nIn Uganda, the story is slightly different. With Numida focused on providing working capital to the country\u2019s SMEs, it would seem that they have found the perfect niche to play in serving the country\u2019s SMEs. With 77% of the population younger than 30 and only 75,000 jobs for the 700,000 Ugandans who reach working age annually, the country could do with more Numidas.\n\nFor Seibel, YC is committed to working with smart and motivated founders to bring more innovation and opportunity to Africa.\n\n\u201cWe believe that African startup founders will be a massive part of the continued development of the continent. I predict that many African countries will leapfrog countries in other parts of the world because they will be faster to adopt more modern software solutions in their economies,\u201d he said.\n\nWith Y Combinator\u2019s reputation for picking winners, one would hope that its recent investments will spur other investors to pay attention to startups from these regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

In the past year, it has placed a limit on International transactions when using a naira card, and it keeps reducing that limit.\n\nFirst, it was $200 a month, then it was reduced to $100, $50, and, I hope my eyes are deceiving me, $20 a month.\n\nOn paper, policies like these are intended for good effects, but things are not so straightforward in Nigeria.

Sounds too good to pass up on right? Well, I, personally, never looked at it twice.\n\nA certain Nigerian startup, Rent Small Small, made such a promise to Nigerians sometime in 2019. However, following a recent investigation by Technext, the proptech startup has repeatedly reneged on these promises leaving its customers with sour stories.\n\nRead the full story: Infections, substandard materials, exclusive emails reveal Rent Small Small\u2019s disregard for customer satisfaction\n\nThe investigative piece exposed sub-par practices and leadership negligence from the startup.\n\nIf anything, this once again puts a big question on how much impact proptech startups can have on Africa\u2019s housing problems.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHow deep does this rot run?

Kenya\u2019s elections are coming up in August 2022, and we\u2019re gearing up for presidential, legislative, and county-level elections.\n\nLast week, Meta promised to let people know who is running a political ad they see on the platform; while equipping political advertisers with tools to reach their supporters. It also promises to verify advertisers before allowing them to place ads.\n\nThe ads, according to the tech giant, will be placed on a searchable database to aid fact-checking and transparency.\n\nProbably unrelated: In February 2022, Mozilla Foundation alleged that Spanish Advocacy group, CitizenGO, had been paying Kenyan influencers between $10 \u2013 $15 to spread misleading information about two important bills currently undergoing discussions in the Kenyan parliament.\n\nThe big picture: I probably don\u2019t need to state that social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are becoming forces of nature. With such power, comes great responsibility, and these platforms seem to be putting the gears in place to fight against misinformation.\n\nBut there are significant questions that need to be answered. Should big, primarily profit-driven, corporations be the custodians and watchdogs of marquee moments in a society like elections?\n\nThe shadow of Cambridge Analytica, one of the biggest global scandals in recent memory, looms large whenever election conversations come up.\n\nThis has led to the Web3 buzz, which aims for a more decentralised and collaborative Internet.

Saying football fandom is a big deal in Africa is probably an understatement. I can\u2019t count the number of times our Lead Sub-editor, Precious, has used a football analogy to explain several personal situations and it sticks like glue.\n\nFantasy football is also becoming a bigger deal as it gives football fans the opportunity to immerse themselves in the beautiful game like never before, and make money while doing so.\n\nGo deeper in the news: Eksab gets $3M to scale its fantasy football platform across MENA and Africa\n\nThe big picture: While betting platforms are popular in Africa, fantasy football companies have not yet poured out in droves. While startups like Draftkings and Fanduel grace countries like Canada, few people are recreating such experiences for the millions of football fans in Africa.\n\nHowever, while the English Premier League and other European leagues have dominated fandom in Africa, support for local football remains relatively minimal.\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nElon Musk thinking about creating a new social media platform\n\nThe US Admitted a Group of Russians at the Border Under Secret Deal With Mexico\n\nThe race to be India\u2019s electric vehicle capital\n\nOpportunities\n\nFluidcoins is looking for a business development and sales manager.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nEurope appears to be gearing up for some interesting times with its new Digital Markets Act. The law aims to allow smaller messaging platforms to access the \u201cgatekeepers\u201d of the messaging world.\n\nIf it ends up getting implemented by October, this could mean that messaging apps like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, and iMessage could become interoperable.\n\nBasically, you might be able to send messages on WhatsApp to someone on Telegram or unlike the current exclusive use case of the iMessage platform, from iMessage to Facebook Messenger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t get too excited yet, though. According to The Verge, \u201cthe language in the press release is unclear on whether the big apps would have to work together.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, today I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nRide-sharing newcomer\u2019s launch in Lagos, and\n\nThe correlation between Right of Way charges and Nigeria\u2019s electricity supply\n\nHytch launches in Lagos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few years ago, during my compulsory national youth service, to save transportation costs, I hitchhiked part of the way to my office. Not the safest option, but certainly one of the cheapest. Basically, I stood by the side of the road and hailed strange cars going in the same direction I was going.\n\nUnfortunately, due to some stern African parent \u2014 I feel this phrase is tautological \u2014 warnings, I couldn\u2019t continue.\n\nFor Laolu Onifade, the journey to hitchhiking was a little different. Borne out of unpleasant experiences with ride-hailing companies, he got three other friends to join in his desire to build a ride-sharing platform that connects drivers and riders going in the same direction.\n\nOn Friday, March 25, 2022, Hytch \u2014 Onifade\u2019s ride-sharing platform \u2014 was publicly launched and currently operates in Lagos State.\n\nBut how does Onifade hope to ensure user safety and prevent stern African parent warnings? I spoke with him a few days ago, and among other things, we discussed Hytch\u2019s safety measures and plans.\n\nYou can find it here: Ride-sharing newcomer, Hytch is providing a new way to travel, hitchhiking style\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight of Way charges disrupt Nigeria\u2019s electricity supply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome interesting news: On Friday, March 25, 2022, the Nigerian Federal Government directed state governors to remove Right of Way (RoW) barriers to fast-track the expansion and strengthen the national grid.\n\nWhy? According to the Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu, issues with RoW has stalled 32 transmission projects across Nigeria worth $137 million.\n\nAn age-long problem: Before now, the federal government has made some inroads into challenges surrounding RoW charges. In 2017, the National Executive Council (NEC), approved a policy, which resulted in an RoW Charge Agreement reached with all the governors of the 36 states of Nigeria.\n\nThis agreement was meant to harmonise charges across board but has yet to materialise enough changes in the system with some states increasing their tariffs.\n\nRoW charges affect the overall amount telcos spend in laying optic fibre and eventually affect the cost of calls and Internet data. Now, it appears it could also be affecting electricity transmission as well.\n\nThis is not the first time we have seen federal government directives on the issue, and it remains to be seen if any changes will occur.\n\nMeanwhile, for your reading pleasure: When calls and data could get cheaper for Nigerian states that slashed RoW charges\n\nLast week on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nWoke up to Elton John\u2019s Don\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart ringing in my head and went on an oldies path for the rest of the day.\n\nSome lessons on patience, albeit from a footballing perspective.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I understand the concept yet, but this video about understanding dimensions was an interesting watch.\n\nOpportunities\n\nFluidcoins is looking for a business development and sales manager.

          "title": "How excess taxes on telecom operators hurt consumers",
          "text": "Nigerians enjoy some of the world\u2019s cheapest data plans with 1GB sold for less than $1 (N200), and the country is eighth on the list of top 10 countries in Africa where data is sold for below $1 ($0.88)), according to a report by World Mobile Data Pricing 2021.\n\nBut cheap data does not equate to quality data. In other words, the quality of the internet has not kept pace with fallen prices nor has it led to a reduction in the digital divide. Nigeria is languishing somewhere at 148 out of 164 countries on the 2022 Internet Accessibility Index published recently by comparison site Broadband Choices.\n\nThe site ranks 164 countries and territories on the quality of their broadband and mobile infrastructure to find the world\u2019s most connected countries. Leading Africa in quality internet are South Africa (34), Egypt (41), Morocco (53), Tunisia (82) and Botswana (102).\n\nThe quality of the internet is mostly dependent on the level of investment in broadband infrastructure. For example, to improve connectivity, the GSMA estimates in its latest mobile economy report that global telecom operators will invest $620 billion in their networks between 2022 and 2025.\n\nBut investment in broadband in sub-Saharan Africa is not at the same level compared to other parts of the world due to issues that include multiple taxation, which adds to the huge capital expenditure the operators face on the continent as a result of rising inflation.\n\n\u201cThe operators in the Nigerian telecommunications industry pay more than 32 taxes to states and local governments. The operators in this sector are overtaxed and this has really contributed to the slow pace of telecommunications infrastructure in Nigeria because the monies that were set aside for the development and spread of telecom infrastructure were being used to pay all these illegal taxes demanded by states, local and agencies,\u201d said Ajibola Olude, executive secretary and chief operating officer of the Association for Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria.\n\nIt is the consumers that bear much of the brunt of the lag in broadband investment. Here are five ways it affects consumers.\n\nLow digital infrastructure investment\n\n\u201cMultiple taxation has been a major issue in the Nigeria telecommunication sector, and this really discourages investments and denies the government long-term revenue as well as destroying the foundations of future growth,\u201d said Wole Abu, CEO of Liquid Telecom Nigeria.\n\nMultiple taxation contributes to telecom investors\u2019 decision not to push more capital into broadband infrastructure, which affects the quality of internet users get.\n\nThe latest capital importation report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that the telecom industry did not record any capital investment in the fourth quarter of 2021. The total capital import into the industry was $107 million.\n\nThis is a far cry from what the industry recorded in 2020 and 2019. Although the industry saw a decline in 2020, it managed to pull in approximately $417 million, compared to $942.8 million in 2019.\n\nThe GSMA in their Mobile Economy 2022 report recommends the adoption of a balanced approach to collecting revenues through taxes and fees on the mobile sector, without jeopardising medium-term investment and economic growth.\n\nRead also: Achieving financial inclusion in Nigeria and the role of the telecommunications industry\n\nOver-concentration of capital investment in urban areas\n\n\u201cThe implication of multiple taxes has manifested in areas such as poor access to digital technology in the rural areas, the poor spread of telecom infrastructure, lack of access to financial inclusion, and a lot of others,\u201d Olude said.\n\nDue to the nature of their business, telecom service operators are supposed to be in every state of the federation and provide equal services to users in those states. But operators often are in conflict with states and LGAs due to incessant demands for taxes and levies.\n\nHence, although urban areas like Lagos and Port Harcourt are not exempted from the multiple and illegal taxes problem, they still receive more capital from operators because of the large concentration of consumers that are able to pay for broadband service.\n\nWidening digital gap\n\nThe consequence of low investment in infrastructure and the concentration of much of the infrastructure in urban areas is a widening digital gap between those in the rural and urban areas of the country.\n\nAccording to the Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC), there are still over 100 communities without access to telecom service. Experts say it is unlikely that operators will prioritise these places any time soon, given that there is still a lot of infrastructure needed to be deployed in areas with relative connectivity.\n\nIt should also be noted that while Nigeria\u2019s internet data is relatively cheap, it is still too high for many existing and potential users \u2013 one of the reasons Nigeria is not among the top five countries in Africa with the cheapest data. The GSMA report on mobile taxation found that the purchase of 1GB of data represents 5.37 percent of income in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIn its latest report, the NCC showed that broadband penetration is still at 41 percent, which means that about 59 percent of the population has no broadband coverage. Experts say this can be partly addressed by reducing discriminatory taxation on the mobile sector to improve affordability.\n\nFractured digital economy\n\nWithout sufficient telecom infrastructure providing the digital backbone, Nigeria\u2019s digital economy drive will face huge challenges. The World Bank recognises that a 10 percent increase in broadband penetration increases GDP per capita growth between 1 and 1.5 percentage points in low-middle income countries.\n\nA key channel through which mobile connectivity delivers growth is enhanced productivity. The GSMA also found that a 10 percent increase in mobile penetration increased productivity by 4 percentage points in developing markets.",

The model that birthed the refinery project is being deployed for similar high-impact development and industrial projects in the state.\u201d\n\nObaseki further noted, \u201cThere is no better illustration of the expanding private sector space than the increased air traffic and high occupancy rate of hotels in the state. When we came into office, there were only two airlines flying into the state, today, there are five of them.\n\n\u201cThe state has generally become more attractive to investments with the influx of investors in real estate, hospitality, oil and gas, industries, technology, agriculture, and manufacturing, among others.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe security situation in the state has improved significantly with the linkage of the Edo State Security Network with the federal security structure.

Yet, I cannot celebrate knowing what has happened to so many of our beloved people.\n\n\u201cEarlier I stood before the attendees at the annual colloquium held on my birthday, explaining to them, and asking for their understanding, why the event could not proceed given what had happened.\n\n\u201cNow, I ask for something further from you, as a show of compassion. I have been informed that many people continued to celebrate my birthday at various events in different locations throughout the day. I appreciate the show of support and affection. However, I must ask that such celebrations stop. Now is not the time.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, I ask all who can, to join me in donating to the families of the bereaved and to the immediate needs of the wounded and distressed. We are one national family. We must aid our brothers and sisters at this time.\n\n\u201cNigeria deserves better than what took place yesterday, and at other times. Terror and banditry have no place here.\n\n\u2018\u2019We must eradicate them such that these twin evils have no hold on even a centimetre of our national soil. We must not stop until we realize a better future, a greater, more peaceful Nigeria.\u2019\u2019\n\nTinubu who empathized with the bereaved added that, \u201cI offer my thoughts and prayers.

          "text": "Former U.S. President Donald Trump has called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to release any damaging information he has about the Biden family.\n\nAccording to CNN, Trump made the brazen and reckless request to America\u2019s top adversary in an interview published Tuesday.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest example of Trump\u2019s willingness to solicit and embrace domestic political help from foreign powers \u2014 even from Putin, who is currently overseeing a bloody war against Ukraine.\n\nIn an interview with JustTheNews, Trump pushed an unproven claim about Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Russia, and asked Putin to release any information that he might have about the situation. It\u2019s not clear that any material exists, or if the Kremlin has access to it.\n\n\u201cI would think Putin would know the answer to that,\u201d Trump said, referring to Hunter Biden\u2019s potential dealings in Russia.\n\n\u201cI think he should release it. I think we should know that answer.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s public appeal to Putin harkens back to his infamous July 2016 comment in which he said, \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening,\u201d and then urged Putin to hack Hillary Clinton\u2019s personal emails. It was the start of a years-long effort by Trump to raise his political prospects with foreign help.\n\nThe Trump campaign in 2016 also embraced and capitalized on Russia\u2019s election-meddling operation against Clinton.\n\nFor instance, the campaign regularly played up Democratic emails that were hacked and leaked by the Russian military, and members of Trump\u2019s inner circle also met during the campaign with a Russian agent who promised dirt on Clinton.\n\nIn 2019, Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch unfounded corruption investigations against then-candidate Joe Biden and withheld nearly $400 million in US military aid as part of the scheme.\n\nThis incident led to Trump\u2019s first impeachment.",
          "summary": "Former U.S. President Donald Trump has called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to release any damaging information he has about the Biden family.\nAccording to CNN, Trump made the brazen and reckless request to America\u2019s top adversary in an interview published Tuesday.\nIn an interview with JustTheNews, Trump pushed an unproven claim about Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Russia, and asked Putin to release any information that he might have about the situation.\n\u201cI would think Putin would know the answer to that,\u201d Trump said, referring to Hunter Biden\u2019s potential dealings in Russia.\nThe Trump campaign in 2016 also embraced and capitalized on Russia\u2019s election-meddling operation against Clinton.",
