          "text": "\n\n\n\nBy Luminous Jannamike, Abuja\n\nSOME Northern leaders have reacted to the recent demand by their counterparts in the South and Middlebelt regions for the 2023 presidential slot to be zoned to the south in the interest of a united Nigeria without which, the country may no longer exist\n\nThe northern leaders said although they believed the South had competent people who could be the next President, the leaders of the Southern and Middlebelt regions must note that they cannot get the Presidential seat by threatening the North with secession.\n\nThe Northern leaders further stated that politics had to do with negotiations and convincing others why they should vote for a particular person or group.\n\nThey, therefore, maintained that Southerners must adopt this approach if they want to produce a successor to the current President.\n\nSpeaking with Our Correspondent in Abuja, the spokesman of the Northern Elders Forum, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, said: \u201cIt is a sad reflection of how low Nigerian politics has sunk that matters that should be processed through the political system are now raised to levels of threats and intimidation.\n\nREAD ALSOIPOB: Buhari must create opportunity for dialogue \u2013 Obi, House of Reps member\n\n\u201cThere are southerners and northerners in the two major parties,but it would appear that they have abdicated their responsibilities to groups that think they can achieve results with threats.\n\n\u201cThe north is the target of these threats. Northern voters are not impressed and they will not be intimidated by threats to abandon their rights to choose freely, the same rights that are available to other Nigerians.\n\n\u201cPoliticians and tribal leaders who think they can extract concessions or advantages using threats forget that Nigerians are already bleeding from all forms of threats and violence.\n\n\u201cWhat type of leadership will they provide when they have to threaten to destroy the country on their way to power? These people who speak like this do not represent the majority of Nigerians who just want peace and progress under good leaders.\n\n\u201cIn any case, they should know that they are demanding what no one is in a position to give. We run a democracy. If they want a southern president, they need to learn the basic tool of politics which are persuasion and compromise. If they want something else, they should say so, so that Nigerians can see them for what they are.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, a former presidential aide, Alhaji Salisu Yakassai, noted that no region in Nigeria can attain the Presidency without the support of others.\n\nConsequently, he advised those who want to be President to hit the road and convince all people that they mean well for them.\n\nHe, however, explained that the politicians and tribal leaders resort to threats because of the fault-lines in Nigeria\u2019s democracy which make votes seem not to count.\n\nYakassai blamed that the failure of leadership, especially at the centre, for the decline of nationalism and embrace of parochialism among the people.\n\nHe added, \u201cI am a Nigerian to the core, and so, our brothers and sisters all over the country are welcome to air their views, because we are in a democracy. However, the collective aim should be to build our country.\n\n\u201cYes, we are practising democracy and we acknowledge that there are faultlines in it, because votes appear not to count. That in itself is a bought which creates frustration.\n\n\u201cSo, the demand by the Southern and Middlebelt leaders which was capped with a threat may not be far from the frustration that votes do not count in this country. However, it is laughable that politicians and tribal leaders should be making such threats in the 21st century.\n\n\u201cWell, even the presidency has said the unity of Nigeria is not negotiable but we say everything is negotiable. But if our brothers in the South and Middlebelt regions rather than negotiating are threatening secession, then their demands won\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cNo doubts, there are daunting challenges in the country. Because the government appears not to be working, citizens are going micro day-by-day and embracing parochialism. Leadership is responsible for the decline of nationalism in the country today.\n\n\u201cHowever, all leaders must note that dividing Nigeria is much ore difficult than keeping the country united.\u201d",

          "title": "Uproar over plan to reopen grazing route",
          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu Noah Ebije, Kaduna and Paul Osuyi, Asaba\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s pronouncement last week that his administration would reinstate cattle routes and grazing areas across the country to ensure herders have free access for their animals have continued to generate flaks\n\nIn apparent response to the ban on open cattle grazing by the 17 Southern governors, the president said when the governors gave the directive that open grazing would be banned, he referred them to the gazette that makes provisions for cattle routes and open grazing areas. He then said he has resolved to revive those routes and grazing areas in the country to resolve the issue.\n\n\u201cWhat I told the governors was to ask them to go and dig up the gazette. There are certain routes and grazing areas so that when cattle rearers were moving from the north to the west, they were allowed to go through there. But if you allow your cattle to stray into any farmer\u2019s farm, you are arrested and the farmer is invited to submit his claims. Those who encroach on these cattle routes and grazing areas would be dispossessed.\u201d\n\nHowever, in separate reactions, Arewa, Igbo and Yoruba groups roundly condemned the statement saying the move rather than resolve the issue would exacerbate it.\n\nAs far as the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) is concerned, reactivating open grazing routes may cause legal and security problems.\n\nSpokesman forf the group, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, in a telephone interview, reminded the president that the 1999 Constitution gives state governors powers cover land and to even revoke federal land.\n\n\u201cThe reactivation of open grazing routes in southern part or any other parts of the country is problematic both in legal terms and security. I would have said the best way to go is for us to seek legal interpretation beyond the Office of the Attorney General. The Federal Government can actually sue governors that ban open grazing and the court will rule whether they are right or wrong.\n\n\u201cI will reserve final judgment on the president\u2019s position. We caution that there is more to open grazing than availability of land and routes. It is not about opening the grazing routes, it is also about the security of the cattle and herders, and getting the support of communities that they will go through. Our open grazing requires political will. The Federal Government has already adopted the National Livestock Transformation programme to equip the Fulani. We, in the North, are in favour of ban of open grazing but we want it to be done in phases, in an orderly manner that does not harm the cattle and the Fulani. We also support the active intervention of the Federal Government, the northern governors and everybody to make sure that in the next one year or two, open grazing is abolished completely. I think this is the way to go.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Association of South East Town Unions (ASETU) in collaboration with other respected Igbo groups, including Nzuko Umunna, Aka Ikenga, Igbo World Assembly (IWA), World Igbo Congress (WIC), Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), Ekwe Nche, European Igbo Communities, Igbo Board of Deputies, Council of Igbo States in America, Nkata Ndi Inyom Igbo and South East Community Youth Leaders, rose from a one-day emergency security meeting with a vow to resist open grazing in the region.\n\nThe coalition warned that governors in the zone who fail to implement the ban would be treated as foes.\n\nNational President, ASETU, Chief Emeka Diwe who made their position known, said the meeting totally condemned the continued attacks by killer herdsmen in Igbo communities and urged governors to rise to the occasion and protect their people.\n\nStressing that the primary purpose of political governance was the security of lives and property, the Igbo groups charged governors who had not kick-started the processes of enacting anti-open grazing laws, to as a matter of urgency, send Executive Bills to their respective Houses of Assembly.\n\n\u201cOur position is very clear, which is the stand of Ndigbo; we say no to open grazing and are not making any pretences about that. We insist that any cattle in the South East must be ranched. So, we urge all nomadic herders to leave our land. We also urge our governors to do everything possible to implement the ban on open grazing. In fact, Ndigbo will treat any governor who fails to carry out this heartfelt desire and demand as an enemy. We equally urge each state to have forest guards with legal backing to ensure that our forests do not harbour terrorists and criminals,\u201d Diwe said.\n\nThe groups regretted that President Muhammadu Buhari who had never spoken strongly against the atrocities of Fulani herdsmen and bandits was threatening to visit another festival of blood on the Igbo.\n\nADF recalled that it had been in the forefront of the agitation for the banning of open grazing in Igboland since 2015, hence its insistence on the enactment of anti-open grazing laws as the most potent strategy to prevent armed Fulani herdsmen from overrunning the Southern states.\n\nIts spokesman, Abia Onyike, said the law to be passed in the State Houses of Assembly should be accompanied by clear modalities, instrumentalities and machineries for their enforcement. He added that the effectiveness of this move depended on the synergy between the governors, the legislators and the people, including the civil society organisations.\n\nSimilarly, the pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, said the president\u2019s pronouncements fell far short of what was expectation.\n\n\u201cWe have some questions for Mr. President and the Attorney General in this respect. One, who created the so-called grazing routes? At what time in our history did our founding fathers gather to designate specific routes from the north to the south as \u2018grazing routes\u2019? Two, assuming without conceding, that there were so-called grazing routes, what would now happen to structures that have been built in areas where the so-called routes are to be re-opened? Would such structures, including residences and factories be pulled down so that cows would have places to graze? Compared to what would be lost economically, socially, politically and in security terms if these structures are to be pulled down, is it not better to encourage the building of ranches? We can go on and on.\u201d\n\nAfenifere claimed President\u2019s pronouncement on open grazing and his confession on how he determines who occupy positions at the national level seems to indicate that Buhari\u2019s government is operating a constitution that is different from the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cFor instance, Section 2 of the Land Use Act, the law governing land matters in the country, vests the administration and control of lands in a given state in the hands of the governor of the state. It is such that even when the Federal Government wants to use a portion of land, it has to seek the consent of the governor of the state concerned. Since most governors in the country have outlawed open grazing in their respective states, on which land does the Federal Government want to \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018re-open\u2019 its vaunted grazing routes? Why talking of grazing routes in this age when ranching is the fad in all civilised climes?\u201d\n\nThe group claimed President Buhari seems to derive pleasure in shifting blames and responsibilities when pressed on what his government ought to do.\n\nUnknown persons threaten mayhem in Delta\n\nMeanwhile, unknown persons, yesterday, raised the tension in Delta State as they threatened to attack Asaba, the state capital, and Agbor, if Governor Ifeanyi Okowa does not withdraw his support for the ban on open grazing within 72 hours.\n\nAn unsigned letter containing the threat was pasted in strategic locations in Asaba including the fence of the Living Faith Church (Winners Chapel) at Infant Jesus Road.\n\nThe letter titled \u2018Fulani Jihadist Warning: An Open Message of 2 Paragraphs to Delta State\u2019 dated June 13, 2021 warned that \u201cfailure to adhere to this demand for been the host of the 17 governors, Delta State, most likely the city of Asaba and Agbor, shall encounter severe consequences than that of Bornu, Kebbi, Kastina, Kaduna, Enugu, Benue, Oyo and many more that will not respect the Fulani\u2019s heritage, as we take responsibility for the detonate explosive uncovered in the state capital secretariat, which should serve as warning to the Delta State Government for what is to come, should the governor fail to abide to our demand.\u201d",

          "text": "From Agaju Madugba, Katsina\n\nKatsina Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has faulted President Muhammadu Buhari on reasons for worsening insecurity in the country.\n\nThe president had during a television interview last week attributed the menace to failure of states and local governments across the country to manage security issues in their respective domains.\n\nBut citing Constitutional provisions, Masari said it was wrong for anybody to blame states and local governments.\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of the Federal Government to ensure protection of lives and property of citizens in all nooks and cranny of the country. When you look at the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the issue of security is under the Exclusive List. So, it is the responsibility of the Federal Government and states can only complement and that\u2019s what we have always done and are still doing.\n\n\u201cFrom the local governments, we assist the police, the DSS, the NSDC. There may be states that do not complement efforts of the security agencies and perhaps those are the states that the president was referring to.\n\n\u201cBut sincerely speaking, based on provisions of the Constitution, the blame should go to the Federal Government for the general state of insecurity in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nMasari said he was 100 per cent in support of the clamour for restructuring and devolution of more powers to states which should also entail enhanced revenue to the tiers of government to enable them adequately perform their constitutional roles.\n\nAccording to him, the establishment of a state police would enhance general security as the personnel will be expected to perform their defined roles without infringing on duties of the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cThe issue of a state police is part of what we are talking about and I am for it. All we need to do is to formalise activities of the vigilance groups and community policing and give them clear definitions on their limits and those of the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cWe have the Nigerian police and the NSDC that we currently support their operations and nothing stops a state police from coexisting side by side with the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cThe issue of security is actually the responsibility of everybody as we all have roles to play. It\u2019s not about the president or the governor or local government chairman or a legislator or minister.\n\n\u201cThese bandits and their informants have addresses. They live within the communities and the people know them and security has no colorations in terms of political party affiliations or religion.\n\n\u201cI am also 100 per cent for restructuring and devolution of powers or whatever you call it. If you devolve, states and local governments will have more financial independence. We should earn resources according to the size and economy of our states.\n\n\u201cDuring the First Republic, Emir of Kano was the highest paid because of the state\u2019s revenue base. What we have today as Katsina State was a province made up of Katsina and Daura emirates. They ran their civil service and police and prisons and judiciary then were under the Native Authority and they did well.\n\n\u201cThey built and managed schools. If it was done successfully then, who says it cannot be done today? We ought to take another look at the Constitution. With the right leadership and proper arrangement, these things are still possible.\n\n\u201cThere are some federal ministries with so many parastatals under each one. How can one person as minister provide effective oversight for these parastatals?\n\n\u201cWe should devolve more power to the states but in such a way that we don\u2019t have to weaken the authority of the Federal Government in terms of performing its constitutional responsibilities.\u201d",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nFormer national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, has asked President Muhammadu Buhari and the ruling party to address the separatist agitations in the country through democratic means instead of deployment of military.\n\nHe said the fact that things are bad and people hungry and angry was not questionable, saying that these were worldwide phenomenon.\n\nHowever, Odigie-Oyegun decried the current security challenge in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is my hope that we will begin to get control of the security of this nation,\u201d he said.\n\nHe spoke during the public presentation of a book, APC\u2019s Litmus Tests, written by Director-General of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Salihu Moh. Lukman, in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nThe former Edo governor said the earlier the APC-led government addressed the escalating agitations, the better to diffuse the kind of stresses the nation is passing through.\n\n\u201cLet me refer to just one aspect of what Governor Atiku Bagudu said. That is the document on true federalism which the party put together that passed through all the organs of the party. The executive of the party, the NWC, the Caucus, the NEC which is the highest organ of the party.\n\n\u201cWhy did we do it at that time? We did it because like, it is happening today, there was this cacophony of voices. Two people in the party could not agree on what they meant by restructuring. So, the party needed to take control of the debate, define the issues, proffer solutions and went so far as to have some drafts legislation. It is not by any chance a perfect document.\n\n\u201cBut it reflects then the thinking and the desires of the Nigerian people. Everybody kept quiet after we brought that document out, publicised it, held press conferences over it and most Nigerians were very, very happy. But once again, we did not make the kind of progress that we could have made and it has become once more, the topical subject in the Nigerian polity.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it has gone beyond us, we now have one or two things that did not happen before, people now wanting to disengage from the federation, which did not happen before and that is a warning sign. If a child ask for garri today you don\u2019t give him, tomorrow he may decide it\u2019s cake he wants and we must not, as political party, we must not as the government of the federation, give the impression that only military governments can fundamentally tamper with the basic structure of this nation.\u201d",

          "text": "Says terminal operators to contribute to reconstruction of Apapa port\n\nSays deep blue project to solve maritime insecurity, boost revenue, reduce oil production cost\n\nBy Kasim Sumaina\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Mr. Chibuike Rotimi, has said the problem of Apapa seaport is efficiency, citing the drastic changes in the Port on the day the President visited to commission the Deep Blue Project.\n\nHe also said that terminal operators must contribute to the total reconstruction and reorganisation of the Apapa Seaport.\n\nThe Minister stated this Monday when he appeared as a guest on The Morning Show on Arise TV, THISDAY broadcast arm.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI was in the train with the President on that day and noticed that everything had disappeared, even inside the Port that looked like a market place was very well organised, no persons were found loitering about, no trucks. What it shows is that the problem of the Seaport is the problem of efficiency.\u201d\n\nHe observed that if they had the capacity in just one night, \u201cbecause I was there the previous evening, and when I came back in the morning, everything had disappeared; If that can happen in one night, it means that the problem is management, nothing else. Do we need to wait for the President to come before we can be efficient?\u201d Amaechi queried.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve done, was to have a meeting with the terminal operators, and I told them that they have to contribute to the reconstruction of the Apapa Seaport. We must rebuild the Apapa Seaport, taking into cognisance all the issues that we are seeing now that is frustrating the Seaport, like where do you park the trucks, how many trucks are coming into the Seaport at what point in time?\n\n\u201cHow can a person come into the seaport who has no business being there, what is he doing at the Seaport? The Seaport is a security area and it\u2019s not for everybody, even me, after my tenure as Minister, I\u2019m not entitled to go into the Seaport unless I have business in the seaport\u201d, he added.\n\nAmaechi noted that the Ministry of Transportation will partner with the Customs and the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) to solve the problem, adding thatt freighting of cargoes from the Seaport through the rail, when it begins, will also help in arresting the situation at the Port.\n\n\u201cWe are going to partner with customs because they are largely involved. Between them and the NPA, they are the operators (or regulators) of the Seaport, and see how to arrest this situation. I believe that when we begin to freight cargoes from the seaport through the rail, we\u2019ll reduce some of the challenges that we have at the seaport\u201d, he said.\n\nAmaechi also spoke on the recently launched Deep Blue Project being overseen by the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) in partnership with the Ministry of Defence, stating that the project will not only boost security in the country\u2019s waters, but will also improve trade in the Gulf of Guinea and reduce cost of production for the Oil industry, while improving revenue for Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\nHe stressed that, \u201cbefore we came, various contractors were contracted to provide security for oil companies in the water. There was a case between the government and OMSL in which the company provides about 3 or 4 boats to the Navy and they collect $2500 per vessel for the first day and $1500 for about 30 days. In a year, like in 2020 they made about $67m, and when you hand over the security of a country to individuals, it becomes very challenging and irresponsible.\n\n\u201cSo, the President kindly approved that the Police, Army, Air force and other security agencies should be involved in providing security with the equipment that we have provided.\n\n\u201cWe have about 3 helicopters, 2 fixed-wing planes, 17 interceptor boats, 2 vessels, drones, and more; what it does is that it gives you information about where the criminals are, those who go and destroy pipes just because they are looking for oil to bunker.\n\n\u201cIt provides you that information, then you deter them or arrest them. So, we are able to provide security in the coastal region, both on land and on the sea. Now, those who provide the coastal security on land will be the Nigerian Army and the Police, and we\u2019ve provided them with all the necessary tools they need.\n\n\u201cWe have ammunition, we have vehicles, like Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) and all that for patrol by the coast. All that, we believe will begin to yield fruits between now and next year.\u201d\n\nExplaining further, Amaechi said, \u201cWhat , we\u2019ve done with Deep Blue project is that we will reduce the cost of producing oil in Nigeria, because in producing oil, they also build-in the cost of security. By the time we provide this security in the water, the economy will be improved because there will be more money coming into the economy. That\u2019s the impact it will have when it comes to the Deep Blue project.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the Israelis who did the training said in six months to one year, if there is no improvement in the economy in terms of how much comes in, both to NIMASA, NPA and the oil industry, \u2018come back to us and we\u2019ll be willing to refund.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut you know it is simple mathematics; It is true that the moment you can take away the criminals from the water, and the contractors from the water, then the cost of security which is borne either by NNPC or the Oil Companies will be part of what will come back to us as income. Then on land, in all our rail and train coaches, you have enough armed policemen in any trip we are making to withstand any criminal attack.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

With the global shift from fossil fuels to renewable forms of energy picking up pace, the passage of the PIB may just be too little, too late,\u201d the FDC report added.\n\nIt said it was unlikely that Nigeria would be able to make up for either the lost time or the lost investment, adding that information available to it suggests that the bill is currently undergoing last-minute modifications in three key areas to enhance its effectiveness.\n\nIt listed the areas as the deregulation of the price of gas supplied to power plants, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation\u2019s (NNPC\u2019s) public offer and the adoption of a single regulator for the industry.\n\nAccording to the report, price deregulation of gas supplied to power plants is a key ingredient in incentivising power output in Nigeria.\n\nHe added that while this is likely to translate to increased tariffs for electricity, it is needed to attract investment in both the gas and electricity generating industry.\n\nOn the NNPC\u2019s public offer, it stated that selling shares to the public will mean that the corporation will be able to source its own funding and come under a higher level of corporate governance and scrutiny.\n\nBesides, it said while the adoption of a single regulator would ensure more efficiency and allow for enhanced cohesion in regulating the entire industry value chain, the PIB as currently constructed, recommended two regulators-one for the upstream and another for the midstream and downstream sectors.\n\nFDC said it envisaged a situation where the PIB could also become a source of acrimony as it gives legal backing to the complete price deregulation of the downstream segment of the oil and gas industry.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), made up of the governors of the 36 states, has proposed the implementation of the full deregulation of the downstream oil industry and determined that the pump price of petrol will be somewhere around N385/litre (137.65 per cent above the current fuel pump price of N165/litre).\n\n\u201cWhile this will bring relief to the state governments that have been grappling with lower revenues, the chance of the federal government allowing such a spike in the near term is slim because of the negative impact on the poor.\n\n\u201cThe subsidy will cripple the government\u2019s finances if sustained, but deregulation is the only way to unlock domestic refining. There is simply no easy way around or through the dilemma. Something is going to have to give.\u201d\n\nThe report said the International Oil Companies (IOCs) were already squarely in the thick of the energy transition, while some were on well laid-out paths that would see them fully evolve to clean-energy companies.\n\nFor instance, it stated that Royal Dutch Shell is in talks with the federal government to divest from its onshore oil fields and focus on its offshore and gas operations citing recurring incidents of theft, sabotage, and oil spillage.\n\n\u201cThe IOCs have stated that Nigerian onshore business is incompatible with their long-term strategy, which focuses on climate change and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,\u201d the FDC document said.\n\nFDC added that foreign oil companies have been gradually disposing of their onshore assets over the last decade, emphasising that beyond the obvious reasons of insecurity and unrest in the Niger Delta stated by Shell, the protracted stalemate in passing the PIB remains a major factor in the oil giant\u2019s decision to exit its onshore operations in Nigeria.\n\nWith slightly under 40 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s crude and condensate production capacity, FDC stated that while Shell\u2019s move to offload its onshore oil fields could have implications on Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas output, it could also send wrong signals to international investors considering doing business in Nigeria.\n\nIt added: \u201cOther IOCs, Chevron and Mobil, have also begun to gradually dispose of their Nigerian assets in response to their changing goals and strategies, which have been influenced by climate change and the need to go green. A number of questions arise.\n\n\u201cWhat will happen to Shell\u2019s onshore assets? Are they going to be acquired by the NNPC through its upstream arm, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) or does the government invite bids from indigenous and foreign producers?\n\n\u201cDo the indigenous producers have the capacity to acquire these assets even as we expect more divestments in the future across the continent? Does this create an opportunity for indigenous players in the oil and gas sector to grow the continental footprint?\u201d\n\nThe report noted that it remains uncertain how the events will play out, adding that what is certain is that the passage of the PIB should have happened at least a decade ago and would have been crucial in the federal government\u2019s drive to achieve production of 4mbpd and domestic oil refining for regional exports.\n\nOPEC: Nigeria\u2019s Oil Production Hit Record Low in May\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria\u2019s crude oil production output hit record low levels in May, the June Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), has shown.\n\nThe monthly report indicated that in the first quarter of 2021, Nigeria\u2019s average production was 1.410 million barrels per day.\n\nApril production stood at 1.460mbpd and it was 1.388 barrels per day in May, leading to the loss of 72,000 daily barrels during the month.\n\nBut based on direct communication with OPEC, the cartel put the figure at 1.429 million barrels per day in March, 1.372 barrels per day in April and 1.344 mbpd in May, resulting in a shortage of 28,000 barrels between April and May.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear why production has remained low even after the country announced earlier in the year that it had fully complied with the OPEC cuts after defaulting initially and the cartel\u2019s decision to gradually open the taps since April.\n\nThe country\u2019s average crude oil production based on secondary sources was 1.78 Mbpd in 2019 and 1.57mbpd in 2020, while total OPEC 13-member crude oil production averaged 25.46 mb/d during May.\n\n\u201cIn May 2021, production was up by 0.39 mb/d m-o-m. Crude oil output increased mainly in Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iran, while production decreased primarily in Nigeria and Angola,\u201d OPEC said.\n\nIn terms of oil rig count, Nigeria\u2019s total was 13 in 2018, 16 in 2019 and 11 in 2020, according to the report, but the number of operational rigs fell to five in April and rose by one to six rigs last month.\n\nThe OPEC report showed that Africa\u2019s demand for crude oil was 3.43 million bpd in 2019, which fell to a 4.37million bpd in Q1, 2020. It further fell to 3.76 million bpd in Q2,2020, was 3.94 mbpd in Q3,2020 and 4.27 mbpd in Q4, 2020.\n\nThe MOMR indicated that Nigeria\u2019s real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) advanced 0.5 per cent y-o-y in Q1, 2021, following a 0.1 per cent y-o-y rise in the last quarter of 2021.\n\nIt said the country registered the second consecutive quarterly growth since Nigeria\u2019s economy faced recession in the third quarter of 2020, amid the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and an improvement in oil prices.\n\nOPEC added: \u201cNon-oil sector expanded 0.8 per cent y-o-y in 1Q21 following a 1.7 per cent y-o-y growth in 4Q20. The current growth was powered by the agriculture sector, which expanded by 2.3 per cent y-o-y.\n\n\u201cIndustrial activity moved back into the growth of 0.9 per cent y-o-y, after dropping by 5.6 per cent on average in 2020. Moreover, the annual inflation rate declined to 18.12 per cent in April 2021, from a four-year high of 18.17 per cent in March, but producer inflation accelerated to a significantly high level, amid raw material shortages and unfavourable exchange rate depreciation.\u201d\n\nThe report said Nigeria\u2019s business sentiment remained optimistic, driven by the current expansion in manufacturing operations as well as higher oil prices.\n\nBut OPEC stuck to its prediction of a strong world oil demand recovery in 2021 led by the United States and China despite uncertainties stemming from the pandemic, pointing to a need for more oil from the producer group.\n\nThe cartel said demand would rise by 6.6 per cent or 5.95 million barrels per day this year, remaining unchanged for a second consecutive month, despite a slower-than-expected recovery in the first half of this year.\n\n\u201cGlobal economic recovery has been delayed due to the resurgence of COVID-19 infections and renewed lockdowns in key economies, including the Eurozone, Japan and India.\n\n\u201cOverall, the recovery in global economic growth, and hence oil demand is expected to gain momentum in the second half,\u201d OPEC said in the monthly report.\n\nThe cartel stated that it sees 2021 world economic growth at 5.5 per cent, unchanged from last month, assuming the impact of the pandemic will have been \u201clargely contained\u201d by the beginning of the second half.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing vaccination efforts, a growing share of recovered cases leading to increasing herd immunity, and the easing of lockdown restrictions lend optimism that the pandemic could be contained in the few months to come,\u201d OPEC said.\n\nIn April, OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, had agreed to gradually ease oil output cuts from May to July and confirmed the decision at a meeting on June 1.\n\nThe report showed higher OPEC oil output, reflecting the decision to pump more and gains from Iran, which is exempted from making voluntary cuts due to U.S. sanctions, increasing May output to 390,000 bpd to hit 25.46 million daily production from the oil cartel.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Public perception of Buhari changed after ARISE Television interview, says Tinubu\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nA former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, has said that the federal government must restructure the country in the interest and the survival of the nation.\n\nOyegun spoke in Abuja on Saturday night at the public presentation of a book titled, \u2018APC\u2019s Litmus Tests\u2019 written by the Director-General of Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), Dr. Salihu Lukman.\n\nThe former Edo State governor said it was vital that these issues should be addressed as the country cannot continue to allow the subject to become a recurring threat.\n\nAlso, National Leader of APC, Senator Bola Tinubu, said the public perception of President Muhammadu Buhari had changed after his interview with ARISE NEWS Channel. He added that the face-off between Odigie-Oyegun\u2019s successor, Mr. Adams Oshiomhole, and Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, was a collateral damage for the party.\n\nOdigie-Oyegun stated that there was no question that the nation and its political parties were going through difficult times, adding that all those at the formation of the APC knew the uniqueness of the party\u2019s constitution and its manifesto that promised change.\n\nAccording to him, the forces of economics have made things, not quite the way the party wanted them to be.\n\nHe said the document the APC produced on true federalism, which passed through all the organs of the party was produced because there was a cacophony of voices over the issue of restructuring.\n\nHe said at that time, just as it is happening now, two people could not agree on what they meant by restructuring and the party needed to take control of the debate, define the issues, proffer solutions and went as far as having some drafts legislation.\n\nOdigie-Oyegun said it was not by any chance a perfect document, but it reflected the thinking and the desires of Nigerians.\n\nHe stated: \u201cUnfortunately, it has gone beyond that. We now have one or two things that did not happen before. People now want to disengage from the federation, which did not happen before and that is a warning sign. If a child asks for garri today you don\u2019t give him, tomorrow he may decide it is cake he wants and we must not as a political party, we must not as the government of the federation give the impression that only military governments can fundamentally tamper with the basic structure of this nation.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cAs a progressive government, it is proper that we show the nation that when the people want some degree of change, the party should be responsive to it and should address it.\u201d\n\nOdigie-Oyegun added: \u201cCompromises have to be made, there\u2019s no question about that. The report itself is not final. It still has to go through the litmus test of compromises. The ideas of people from different parts of the country will be different up to the extent they want to go with the proposals in the document, but it is necessary. It must be mandatory in the interest of the survival of our nation, that these issues be addressed. We cannot continue to allow the subject to become something that threatens our nation at any turn.\u201d\n\nChairman of PGF and Governor of Kebbi State, Senator Atiku Bagudu, said the party was not shy to acknowledge that the country\u2019s constitution was not perfect hence the setting up of Governor Nasir el-Rufai Committee on true federalism.\n\nHe said: \u201cAPC believes in letting us amend the constitution because society is dynamic not because somebody has been wronged and cheated. If that is the basis for correction, then the agitation will never stop but if it\u2019s based on let us make it better.\u201d\n\nBagudu stated that there are fundamental challenges to be addressed, stressing that the ruling party will not shy away from acknowledging them and providing transparent leadership.\n\nHe said there was a need to increase Nigeria\u2019s budget to $300 billion or $500 billion to be able to fix the nation\u2019s challenges in the various sectors.\n\nComparing Nigeria\u2019s budget with the United States, a country with 331 million people, Bagudu said you would find that in 2019, the US budget was over $3.5 trillion and one per cent of $3.5 trillion is $35 billion.\n\nAccording to him, that means Nigeria\u2019s budget is less than one per cent of the US\u2019 budget despite having a population that is about 70 per cent of the United States population.\n\nThe governor added: \u201cIf one considers the actual distribution of revenue, it even reflects the truth. For example, from January to May, the Federation Allocation Account Committee meetings, there is no month yet, where the equivalent of $2 billion has been distributed. So, if things go this way that means $24 billion will be distributed by the three tiers of government.\n\n\u201cBut our quest includes expanding our horizon so that we can see how we will move the $35 billion federal budget to $300 billion or $500 billion federal budget because only then, can we meet some of our expectations, some of our aspirations in all sectors.\u201d\n\nThe governor said that before then, the country would continue to struggle to find enough money for security, health, education, stressing that part of APC\u2019s litmus test was to communicate this properly to Nigerians so that in making choices, they would not be blinded by promises.\n\nRepresented by former National Legal Adviser of APC, Mr. Babatunde Ogala (SAN), Tinubu said the public perception of the president had changed since last Thursday\u2019s interview aired by ARISE NEWS CHANNEL, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers.\n\nHe stated: \u201cAfter the interview of the president with ARISE NEWS, the perception of the public has changed. Yet those who will not see good will never see it.\n\n\u201cHave we sold our party and the achievements of this government enough \u2013 I think not.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 devastated the whole world. It\u2019s even a bigger form of insecurity than even the banditry that we have made a big issue of. We all saw India, we saw Ecuador where people were counting corpses of their relatives as their own luggage. We all knew their predictions for Africa, how well have we sold these achievements to the public.\u201d\n\nOn the clash between Oshiomhole and Obaseki that cost APC Edo State in the last governorship election in the state, Tinubu said he was one of those who facilitated behind-the-scene visits to Lagos \u2013 by Obaseki and by APC governors \u201cbecause we knew the consequences for our party. Whether you like it or not, it was collateral damage for all of us.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhatever our party has gone through in the last eight years, we are still facing a lot of challenges. They\u2019ve called our party different names, some even predicted that we are not going to have 12 months or 24 months.\n\n\u201cAnd if I must say, a party that has gone through eight years, it\u2019s still an infant. There will still be more of these tests \u2013 disagreement, misunderstanding, realignment but one thing is that you are part of the intellectual content of our party.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Here are ten VPNs you can use in Nigeria",
          "text": "Virtual private networks (VPNs) have been around for a long time but have become more popular recently. Whether you want to use it to watch a show that\u2019s not available in your country or access a site that\u2019s been banned by the government, there\u2019s one question that most people have had to deal with: Which VPN should I use?\n\nIt can be daunting to choose from the hundreds, if not thousands, of VPN services available. So we\u2019ve come up with a list of ten reputable VPN services you can use.\n\nExpress VPN\n\nExpressVPN is rated highly because of its very fast speeds across over 3,000 remote servers in 160 locations and 94 countries. It provides advanced security on both apps and servers.\n\nIts high quality comes at a price. The lowest monthly plan is priced at $6.67, making it slightly more expensive than its rivals. It\u2019s also currently unavailable on the Nigerian App Store.\n\nA user TechCabal spoke to said, \u201cI\u2019ve been using ExpressVPN for over a year now, mostly to watch Netflix from other countries. I also use it for HBO Max and Disney+. I\u2019ve had to move to another VPN because I need to use it on my phone \u201d\n\nNord VPN\n\nUnlike ExpressVPN, NordVPN is available on the Nigerian App Store, it has one of the fastest speeds on the market and it\u2019s cheaper than ExpressVPN: Its lowest price is $4.89/month. It has more than 5,200 servers in 62 countries.\n\nNordVPN has a feature that ExpressVPN doesn\u2019t have, it\u2019s called VPN chaining. It routes your traffic through two servers, encrypting data packets twice. A helpful security feature, but it slows down your connection.\n\nProton VPN\n\nProton has the best free subscription in the market. Unlike NordVPN and ExpressVPN, the first subscription tier of ProtonVPN is its free VPN offering, which includes just three VPN server locations (Japan, Netherlands, and the US). It has over 1,246 Servers in 55 countries.\n\nThis free subscription offers unlimited browsing bandwidth but at slower internet speeds. It only allows one device to be connected at a time and also has few server locations compared to most other VPN providers.\n\nTunnelBear\n\nTunnelBear offers its users both free and paid VPN services. However, the free version is only limited to 500MB/month bandwidth.\n\nIt\u2019s not as fast as ExpressVPN and NordVPN but has a decent speed. It has servers in 22 locations, which means fewer options for its users.\n\nA user Techcabal spoke to said, \u201cI started using Tunnelbear, but I\u2019m being very Nigerian about it so I refuse to pay after I exhaust my 500MB limit in a few days.\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t do much on the internet, TunnelBear would be a good fit.\n\nWindscribe VPN\n\nJust like TunnelBear, Windscribe VPN has a free version and it gives 10GB free every month. It\u2019s safe and secure to use. It works on most devices and most streaming services. It has 180 servers in over 63 countries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve moved to Windscribe. They give 10GB free every month, so that\u2019s nice.\u201d A user TechCabal spoke to said, \u201cThe only thing is it definitely drains my battery. I don\u2019t like the mental stress of having to connect to a VPN before opening Twitter, then having to remember to turn it off before I do other things like open YouTube. I opened YouTube earlier today from Dallas, Texas and it loaded straight into 1080p. I was shocked. Americans are enjoying themselves. I hate this VPN life. Also having to remember to turn off my VPN before I use my bank app. \u201c\n\nIPVanish\n\nIPVanish stands out because it allows unlimited simultaneous connections. It has over 500 servers spread across 55 countries.\n\nIt has no free version. It costs $10 per month, or $77.99 billed annually. You can alternatively opt to pay $26.99 every three months.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t allow for more customisation and it has a confusing privacy policy.\n\nCyberGhost\n\nCyberGhost has been around for a while and it serves more than 15 million users. It boasts 6,700+ servers in 110+ locations across 90 countries. That\u2019s far more than all others.\n\nCyberGhost offers a VPN service for virtually every device out there but it\u2019s more expensive than a few others. It costs $12.99 per month, $47.94 for six months and $49.50 for eighteen months. Additionally, a student discount is available, the cost of the student offering is $2.75 per month, and you\u2019ll have to sign on to a year-long contract.\n\nPsiphon\n\nThis VPN separates itself away from the pack by not needing an email address to use it. You can download the free app (on all platforms except MacOS, Linux, or routers) and start using it immediately. It uses an open-source code which increases transparency\n\nA downside is that because it\u2019s free, it has a very small server network \u2013 a little over 20 countries. It\u2019s slower than other alternatives out there. It doesn\u2019t work with Netflix or torrenting. It explicitly says that it\u2019s not a privacy tool.\n\nPsiphon is supported by ads, and it does share statistics with sponsors so they can see, for example, how often their sites are visited through Psiphon and from which countries. These are further aggregated by date, sponsor and region. All of the data Psiphon collects is discarded after 60 days.\n\nSurfShark\n\nSurfshark has been around for roughly a year now. It offers a safe and private connection. It\u2019s available on many platforms. Its speed is pretty good.\n\nIt has over 1,000 servers in more than 61 countries. For a relatively new service provider, this is a very large network and something that many VPN service providers haven\u2019t achieved even after years in the business.\n\nYou can use SurfShark on unlimited devices and its lowest price per month is $2.49/ for 2 years.\n\nPrivate VPN\n\nPrivateVPN is a great all-rounder with excellent privacy and high speeds. Its reliable connections and ability to unblock sites like Netflix make it ideal for streaming. It can also be used to torrent and works well in China.\n\nWith only around 200 servers, it\u2019s still pretty much a good choice. It\u2019s lowest monthly cost is $2.08.\n\nThat\u2019s all from us. These are our top ten VPNs. Which other VPNs do you use and what do you like or don\u2019t like about them?",

          "text": "When Pearl\u00e9 Nwaezeigwe is not busy creating policies that protect African users on TikTok, she spends most of her time planning for her future, creating inspirational videos targeted at young people with ambitious career goals, and settling into her new community in Ireland.\n\nTikTok\u2019s presence and influence cannot be denied in Africa. The app is perfect for hyper-creative content creators who know their way around editing tools and special effects. But even amateur video creators, dancers, and comedians are also making waves and growing their TikTok following every day. As TikTok\u2019s popularity soars, the company is intentional about creating policies that protect both creators and viewers.\n\nI\u2019m bringing Pearl\u00e9 to Centre Stage because I\u2019m inspired by how dedicated she is to honing her craft, learning more about product policy, and fighting for human rights. As a social activist, Pearl\u00e9 isn\u2019t afraid to speak against policies that harm our fundamental human rights, making her the perfect fit for her role at TikTok.\n\nFor the love of TikTok in Africa\n\nWhat about TikTok\u2019s presence in Africa excites you?\n\nPearl\u00e9: It\u2019s exciting to see how well the creative industry is thriving and booming, especially on TikTok. I feel very inspired when I see creators showcasing their many talents on our platform. And TikTok videos go beyond captions and hashtags \u2013 creators have to bring their A-game and capture multiple viewers\u2019 attention within the first ten seconds and keep them watching for up to a minute. Also, African TikTokers are showing us that we all have shared experiences. They are also showing the world how diverse Africans at home and in the diaspora.\n\nWhat kind of freedom does TikTok give to African content creators?\n\nPearl\u00e9: It gives them the freedom to showcase how rich our culture is and how talented we are as a people. Nigerian and South African creators are especially famous for their dance and comedic videos. TikTok gives them the opportunity to be as expressive as they want to be as long as they stick to our community guidelines.\n\nLet\u2019s get personal\n\nTell me about the last good book you read?\n\nPearl\u00e9: A lot of people find self-help and motivational books very cheesy, but I enjoy reading them.\n\nI recently read \u2018You Are a Badass\u2019. I like the way the book was written because it does not contain a lot of rules and regulations. She uses storytelling to encourage her readers to focus on what matters and the beauty of life. I also love that each chapter ends with a reminder to love yourself and the special parts of you.\n\n\u2018Loud black girls\u2019 is next on my list. It contains a compilation of short stories by different black women living in the UK. The book delves into their experiences with living, working and navigating life in the UK. I\u2019ve always seen the black and POC experience from the lenses of women living in Nigeria and the US, but Loud Black Girls opened my eyes to see how black women deal with racism and microaggression in the UK. \u201c\n\nWhat are some of your favourite accounts on social media?\n\nPearl\u00e9: I tell people that I am obsessed with The Verge because they have a section dedicated to Tech Policy. I\u2019m a policy nerd. I also read TC Daily and I have to say, it\u2019s exciting to see how much innovation is coming out of Africa. For tech policy related news and updates, I follow Wired, MITTech, and Access Now.\n\nWho are your favourite content creators?\n\nPearl\u00e9: Beyonc\u00e9, obviously. I also follow Shesecures, Useshukran, and Fbeinghumble on social media. On TikTok, I enjoy watching King Science. He uses animated videos to address sensitive topics and create content that is easy to digest and understand.\n\nInfusing creativity, learning new skills and making an impact\n\nWhat kind of skills do you need to be successful in your role?\n\nPearl\u00e9: Firstly, you need a fundamental understanding of human rights. We want people to express themselves and feel inspired to create but we also want them to feel safe on our platform.\n\nSecondly, you need to understand the local context. The trends that are peculiar to one region will be different from the rising trends in a different region. We have to pay close attention to gender, religious, and cultural nuances. Most of the popular trends we see on TikTok are fun, but some have potential to be harmful.\n\nLastly, you need to research industry standards. We aren\u2019t as focused on competition as much as we are on collaboration. There are trends that crossover from other social media platforms into TikTok \u2013 which isn\u2019t unusual \u2013 but we have to ensure that crossover trends don\u2019t harm or impede our users\u2019 privacy and rights.\n\nWhat impactful lessons have you learned on the job so far?\n\nPearl\u00e9: My dad calls me an activist because I like (non-violently) fighting for people. When I think about impact, I think about the fact that I see the policies we create getting enacted in real time. The speed at which we push these policies matters because our users need to feel safe at all times. I\u2019m especially excited that the policies we come up with are focused on protecting creators in Sub-saharan Africa.\n\nWhat is your role teaching you about content creation?\n\nPearl\u00e9: I\u2019ve learned that content creation has many layers. When I think about the time that goes into creating a really dope animated video or beauty vlog, I appreciate how much creators put into giving us their best works. You might watch a one minute animated video on TikTok without realizing how much effort went into putting it together. I\u2019d say watching these TikTokers create magic is my favourite part of the job.\n\nWhat makes TikTok stand out from other content creation platforms?\n\nPearl\u00e9: I can\u2019t speak for other platforms but TikTok draws a lot of Gen-Z and millennial creators. Again, people feel safe on our platform. When creators come on TikTok, we give them the tools they need to express themselves without fear of being shut down, threatened, or abused. It\u2019s better to create from a place of freedom than fear.\n\nHow do you infuse creativity into your role?\n\nPearl\u00e9: Watching TikTok videos inspires me to keep going and encourages me to do more at work. When you see the policies you create getting executed and doing what they\u2019ve been designed to do, it inspires a level of creativity within you.\n\nWhy is product policy important to the creative tech industry in Sub-Saharan Africa?\n\nPearl\u00e9: For us, as product policy managers, we are at the centre of every company. People like me are responsible for seeing all sides to the story. Yes, we see the creative side of things, but we also have to consider safety and security. Big tech companies still have a long way to go where product policy is concerned. Our ecosystem is very funding and investment-focused \u2013 which I understand because capital is essential \u2013 but policy and security are equally important.",

          "title": "Top Three Nigerian Stocks for Sustainable Investors",
          "text": "Socially responsible investors put principles before profit. They choose stocks of corporations known for fair and sustainable practices. Environmental protection, animal rights and the absence of workplace discrimination are in the spotlight. Only some companies in Nigeria have praiseworthy policies. So, which stocks are sustainable?\n\nDangote Cement\n\nDangote, a construction and manufacturing giant, follows sustainable procedures throughout its project cycle. Its policies bring benefits to the environment, community, and economy. This is an exception, as the industry, in general, is responsible for massive pollution and depletion of natural resources.\n\nSo, what exactly does the company do? Dangote is committed to green growth \u2014 development through eco-friendly activities. Its corporate culture is data-centric and sustainable.\n\nThe staff collect data via Microsoft SharePoint to ensure its integrity. The group provides full-time study leave for its employees, which is a rare benefit. In 2018, it provided training for almost 10,000 employees across sites and headquarters.\n\nAnother example is the company\u2019s safe work initiative. It reduces the frequency of accidents and near misses. Meanwhile, employees providing customer service commit excellence across value chains.\n\nThe company supports small and medium enterprises. It has paid over 3 billion nairas for 125 trucks for its distributors and provided a 5-year payback period. Finally, the company\u2019s key subsidiary, Dangote Cement, has a range of sustainable operations.\n\nFirst, it repurposes its own waste, which is used to generate power for the kiln. Secondly, fractional mineral traces from waste are used instead of primary minerals in cement production. The shares of Dangote Cement are some of the most sustainable. If you invest through the Forextime Forex trading app, they will make a great addition to your portfolio.\n\nSterling Bank\n\nThe sustainable policies of Sterling Bank allow it to prevent credit fraud and reduce its own carbon footprint. They include systems for environmental management and management of social risks. The company has a range of energy-saving projects.\n\nThe bank recycles its waste in cooperation with a recycling agency and waste management services of Lagos. It abides by the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights. The campaign includes competitions between creative entrepreneurs focused on the use of recycled materials. The winner receives 1 million nairas for their startup.\n\nThe bank has reduced its carbon footprint by turning to renewable energy. Its branches in Nigeria and abroad use more sustainable sources of power. The company has been involved in solar and hybrid power projects. At the moment, such policies have been implemented by 10 branches.\n\nAside from environmental sustainability, the bank has improved its social and financial impact. All stakeholders receive regular updates, and the company boosts engagement through social media. Sterling Bank has an impressive 3.1% deposit market share and a 12.6% capital adequacy ratio.\n\nFidelity Bank\n\nFidelity Bank abides by the international bill on human rights. It also complies with the principles of banking sustainability of the Central Bank of Nigeria. These include promotion of financial inclusion, women\u2019s empowerment through inclusive workplace culture, and minimization of environmental impact.\n\nThe bank\u2019s mission is to make financial services accessible to all groups of customers. Its operations contribute to the reduction of poverty in Nigeria and sustainable economic development overall. The Environmental Social\n\nGovernance practices for the basis of the bank\u2019s policies; the lending services and decisions are focused on three aspects: economic viability, environmental responsibility and social relevance. Fidelity Bank acts in line with local and international standards. These include The Nigerian Sustainable Banking Principles (NSBP), Equator Principles and the\n\nInternational Finance Corporations (IFC) Performance Standards.\n\nSustainable Investment in Nigeria\n\nThese are three examples of sustainable stocks in Nigeria. These should be considered by local investors with a focus on eco-friendly practices. They are often added to multi-asset portfolios. Stocks may be combined with Forex trading and derivative trading.\n\nWhen socially responsible companies disclose their practices, this contributes to the transparency of opportunities and risks. The country\u2019s manufacturing brands, conglomerates and commercial banks provide annual sustainability reports. These help investors decide whether their stocks are worth buying.\n\nFor socially responsible individuals, profitability is not the first priority. They allocate their capital based on multiple factors. These include the company\u2019s relationships with customers and staff, the treatment of animals, and the environment. The general public must have access to full descriptions of the values, assets, and policies of an enterprise.",

          "title": "New USSD rate may further encourage financial exclusion in Nigeria",
          "text": "An agreement between the deposit money banks (DMBs) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has resulted in new USSD rate borne by mobile phone users in Nigeria.\n\nThe Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) system is a convenient channel that aids the delivery of financial services, especially for individuals without access to the internet or other physical banking infrastructure.\n\nIn October 2019, MTN Nigeria, a network service provider, moved to charge N4 for every USSD transaction made by customers. Still, there have been contentions regarding who should be the cost bearer for the service. Banks and telecommunication companies have had a zero-sum resolve about who should bear the cost for the USSD service provided by the telecoms companies, and the dispute lingered for a while.\n\nThe Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) soon took centre stage to address the scuffle between the banks and the tech firms, setting the charge at N4.98 for each USSD session, estimated to last for 20 seconds.\n\nHowever, this new charge could not be effected due to the NCCs suspension of MTN Nigeria, which resumed the new pricing arrangement without proper notification to the concerned parties.\n\nBy March 15, 2021, a new official fee set at N6.98 for USSD transactions was announced.\n\n\u201dThis replaces the current per session billing structure, ensuring a much cheaper average cost for customers to enhance financial inclusion. This approach is transparent and will ensure the amount remains the same, regardless of the number of sessions per transaction,\u201d a statement by CBN and NCC reads.\n\nThe USSD service is praised for being a game-changer in improving financial inclusion in the country. It allows those without bank apps or the internet to enjoy bank balance checks, cash transfers, and bill payments.\n\nIn June 2020 alone, N390 billion in transaction value due to USSD service was recorded.\n\nThose in favour of the upward review of the service charge maintain a positive outlook for the new price era. They believe that dissatisfied individuals have the option to patronise other service channels such as mobile bank apps, internet banking, and ATMs to offer the same solutions the USSD platform provides.\n\nHowever, not everybody is happy with this new fee. Many Nigerians believe that the new pricing scheme is set to negatively impact the drive towards financial inclusion rather than positively promote it. Experts also believe that Nigeria\u2019s thinning economy may worsen since key macroeconomic indicators show a weakening posture of the country.\n\nWith an increase in electricity tariff from N2.00 per Kilowatt hour to N4.00 per Kilowatt hour, inflation rate reaching as high as 18 per cent and exchange rate depreciating more frequently than expected, the cost of living for the average Nigerian have indeed soared, and the least expected policy decision by government is another hike in prices.\n\nIt is believed that the frequency and volume of USSD based transactions may significantly reduce, especially among the low-end or low-income earning individuals. Unlike the high net-worth individuals who perform large transactions per session, the low-income earners usually employ the USSD service for airtime or mobile data purchases.\n\nWith a thinning of the economy through high living costs and a consequent lowering of living standard for most Nigerians, the newly introduced USSD charge is expected to expand the financial exclusion net; the number of low-end user\u2019s transactions will decline and expected revenue surplus would be lost.\n\nAlternative platforms such as mobile bank application services and internet banking services also come with their attendant costs. Accessing the internet requires out of pocket expenses to purchase data, and usage will require data consumption, whose cost many describe nowadays as overbearing and unnecessarily high. Therefore, exploring internet-based platforms may not be an efficient alternative to the low-income earner.\n\nAutomated Teller Machines (ATMs), which also provide the same services as the USSD platform, attract intra-bank charges, depending on the service demanded and the number of transactions carried out. Access to working ATMs, internet service availability and security of customers are other challenges to consider while using the machine\u2019s banking platform.\n\nWith these challenges in mind, it is easier to think about the convenience that the USSD platform offers and the advantages that accrue to users and providers of the service in the country. Incremental charges on the service platform, especially at this time, can signal a moody user-provider atmosphere. It may not be too long before service providers appreciate the importance of low-end patronage in a large informal driven economy like Nigeria.",
          "summary": "By March 15, 2021, a new official fee set at N6.98 for USSD transactions was announced.\nThe USSD service is praised for being a game-changer in improving financial inclusion in the country.\nIn June 2020 alone, N390 billion in transaction value due to USSD service was recorded.\nThose in favour of the upward review of the service charge maintain a positive outlook for the new price era.\nIncremental charges on the service platform, especially at this time, can signal a moody user-provider atmosphere.",

          "text": "Though the real estate sector limped to the finish line of 2020 with bruises sustained from impact of Covid-19, the sector holds out promise for investors with residential and industrial facilities brightening its outlook for 2021.\n\nThe residential, construction and industrial segments are the sector\u2019s major growth drivers at the moment and are poised to deliver good returns for developers, investors and landlords, according to a new report on the sector.\n\nThe report compiled by a leading firm of estate surveyors and valuers, Ubosi Eleh + Co, notes that rising demand for these two segments of the real estate market is a fallout of the Covid-10 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe office space market that was on its way from the effects of the 2017 recession took a hit from the pandemic which, because of the social distancing rule, questioned the purpose and value of office space,\u201d the report says.\n\nOn the flipside, the fate that befell the office market turned a big boost to residential real estate because the pandemic offered opportunity to developers, more so as companies embraced the new normal, working virtually or remotely away from physical office building.\n\n\u201cThe lockdown and reduced economic activities were some of the reasons that accounted for the rise in demand in the residential market. But the demand was mainly for small-sized, pocket-friendly, family housing units,\u201d the report explains.\n\nThis means that prospective investors should not just move cash to the market, but also have the good sense to dimension the market and know that residential is the way to go, but focus should be on small-size family units.\n\nThe report points out that as a result of the crisis from the pandemic, it was no surprise that healthcare real estate jumped to the forefront in investment decisions with emphasis on emergency care developments.\n\nIt stresses that the demand for logistics and mid-size warehousing increased because \u201clast mile warehousing, logistics and home delivery gained traction from the transition to on-line shopping\u201d.\n\nThe 125-page annual report which also comes with prediction for 2021 highlights how Covid-19 pandemic affected economic activities including real estate in 2020, recalling that on March 20, 2020, the federal government\u2019s travel restrictions took effect.\n\nThe ban applied to travels from countries where more than 1,000 cases had been recorded including China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Japan, France, Germany, US, Norway, UK, Netherlands and Switzerland, according to Nigeria\u2019s Centre for Disease Control report.\n\n\u201cCovid-19 pandemic with the attendant lockdown in Nigeria and across the nations of the world was a singular event that changed global economy, Nigeria inclusive. This, by many accounts, was the most significant health crisis in half a century,\u201d Chudi Ubosi, principal partner at Ubosi Eleh + Co, noted.\n\nUbosi affirmed that there is hope of growth and good returns for investors in the sector. He cited a recent survey by KPMG as a major source of hope. The survey shows that the percentage of CEOs that plan to cut back on offices has come down from 69 percent in August 2020 to just 17 percent currently.",

This is imperative because access to blood and blood components is an essential service that must be guaranteed if we are to make progress toward universal access to health and universal health coverage.\u201d\n\nHe however reassured that ongoing reforms in the Edo health sector, through the Edo Health Improvement Programme (Edo-HIP), would provide mechanisms to ensure patients in rural areas have access to safe blood.\n\nAccording to the WHO, \u201cWorld Blood Donor Day aims to raise global awareness of the need for safe blood and blood products for transfusion and of the critical contribution voluntary, unpaid blood donors make to national health systems.\n\n\u201cSafe blood and blood products and their transfusion are a critical aspect of care and public health. They save millions of lives and improve the health and quality of life of many patients every day. The need for blood is universal, but access to blood for all those who need it is not. Blood shortages are particularly acute in developing countries.\n\n\u201cTo ensure that everyone who needs safe blood has access to it, all countries need voluntary, unpaid donors who give blood regularly.

The pandemic soon made a bad situation worse, what with its impact on business continuity, working hours, and supply chain blueprints.\n\nTo make up for the COVID-19 losses and simultaneously record noticeable gains in economic growth, poverty eradication and good governance, Mr Balogun, a professor, advised African States to focus attention not only on broad constitutional issues like devolution, power sharing, human rights, and resource control, but also on the continuous enhancement of agency governance standards. This calls for periodic but proactive diagnoses of practices, processes, and attitudes in public as well as private sector agencies.\n\nHe further called on the Pan African Conference of Public Service Ministers and the African Union to collaborate with African Governments and select regional and international organizations on the establishment a Working Group on Agency Governance Research and Training.",

Hence, external debt service payments fell to N126.02 billion (or $332.07 million) in the first quarter (Q1) 2021 from N170.60 billion (or $472.57 million) printed in Q1 2020.\n\nFurther breakdown of the total external debt stock in Q1 2021 showed that multilateral loans accounted for 54.26 per cent ($17.83 billion) of which loans from the International Development Association (IDA) was $11.09 billion, loan from IMF was $3.48 billion while others stood at $3.26 billion. According to DMO, bilateral loan accounted for 12.73 per cent ($4.18 billion) of which loan from China (Exim Bank of China) was $3.40 billion and loan from France was $0.49 billion in Q1 2021.\n\nNigeria\u2019s total public debt stock rose year on year by 15.64 percent to N33.11 trillion as of March 2021 (from N28.63 trillion as of March 2020), figures from the DMO show.\n\nThe year on year increase was mainly due to a 24.86 per cent rise in external debt to N12.47 trillion (or $32.86 billion at N379.50/$) as of March 2021 from N9.99 trillion (or $27.67 billion at N361.00/$) in March 2020. Within a year, Nigeria received $3.48 billion worth of loans from the International Monetary Fund. Also, an additional loan of $1.43 billion was gotten from IDA. More so, the depreciation of the Naira against the greenback exacerbated external debt: yo-y, Naira depreciated against the US dollar by 5.10 per cent to close at N379.50/$ as of March 2021. Commercial loans accounted for 32.47 per cent ($10.66 billion) of which Eurobonds was $10.37 billion while diasporal bond was $0.30 billion.

Who knows, the person you help today can be of help to you tomorrow.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of Nigerians attitude towards philanthropy, he averred: \u201cWhen many people see the cases we posted on our Facebook, they are always touched and many of them are willing to help and support through donations.\u201d\n\nWhile taking stock of Givers Supportive Foundation\u2019s progress in the past two years, he also reviewed the foundation\u2019s long-term objectives.\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to offering support to the less privilege, the sick people and the extremely poor, and we will continue to provide opportunities for them, and these include widows and widowers and orphans in motherless children homes.\u201d\n\nOn the plan of Givers Supportive Foundation for the rest of the year, Smith avowed, \u201cWe have been able to visit over five states.

Don\u2019t use the money for personal needs because such will kill the business sooner than later.\u201d\n\nSmith also used the occasion to share how Givers Supportive Foundation helped to alleviate poverty and starvation during the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic last year\n\nHe said, \u201cWe helped more during the COVID-19 lockdown. We shared foodstuff, such as Semovita, spaghetti and noodles, to over 200 families everyday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe are planning to improve more in our area of giving and supporting the less privilege and in reaching out to many people who are sick or handicapped.\u201d\n\nListing the Foundation\u2019s achievements since its establishment in the past two years, he affirmed: \u201cWe have helped many people suffering from kidney and heart diseases, breast cancer and hydrocephalus, all of whom had successful surgeries.\u201d\n\nWhile highlighting insufficient fund and lack of trust and transparency as the two major hurdles before charity organisations in the country, Ologbenla Babatunde Smith called on the government to support more hospitals by equipping them adequately and in turn sponsor non-profits organisations to reach out to as many people who needed help.\n\nHe also urged Nigerians to cultivate the spirit of giving, noting, \u201cHelp comes from anywhere; whatsoever help you render today will come back to you tomorrow. Who knows, the person you help today can be of help to you tomorrow.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of Nigerians attitude towards philanthropy, he averred: \u201cWhen many people see the cases we posted on our Facebook, they are always touched and many of them are willing to help and support through donations.\u201d\n\nWhile taking stock of Givers Supportive Foundation\u2019s progress in the past two years, he also reviewed the foundation\u2019s long-term objectives.\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to offering support to the less privilege, the sick people and the extremely poor, and we will continue to provide opportunities for them, and these include widows and widowers and orphans in motherless children homes.\u201d\n\nOn the plan of Givers Supportive Foundation for the rest of the year, Smith avowed, \u201cWe have been able to visit over five states. This December, we will be going to Lagos State to do more for the less privileged.\u201d",

Jechonia Albert, said, \u201cwithout mincing words, Northern CAN wish to state that the current state of the Nation has plunged the vast majority of the people into hunger, poverty, frustration and despondency.\n\n\u201cAmid increasing insecurity, bad economy and undemocratic tendencies among the leaders, is there anything really worth celebrating? Certainly none!\n\n\u201cWe are particularly concerned about the security situation which appeared to have overwhelmed the government.\n\n\u201cThe security situation has crippled the economy as traveling on the highways across the country has become a nightmare to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nCAN further averred that the security situation in the country today has worsened with bandits, kidnappers and Boko Haram insurgents unleashing mayhem on Nigerians, killing innocent people and sacking communities.\n\n\u201cThousands of Nigerians, especially, in rural communities have been rendered homeless by bandits. On a daily basis across the country, communities are being raided, people are being killed or abducted by rampaging bandits and other criminal elements,\u201d it added.\n\nThe Christain body noted that the rains are here but farmers cannot go to the farms for fear of being killed or abducted by bandits, stressing that the implication of this, is that a looming food crisis stares the nation in the face and unless steps are taken to provide a secured environment for farmers to return to the farms, Nigeria may be in for more trouble with a hungry and frustrated population.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNorthern CAN also expressed concern with the frequent attacks on schools and the abductions of students and pupils by bandits, especially, in states like Kaduna, Katsina, Zamfara and Niger.\n\n\u201cWe fear that these attacks, if not checked, many parents will be discourage parents and children would be force to abstain from school, given the recent cases in Kaduna, Zamfara, Katsina and Niger states, where parents of abducted school children paid hundreds of millions of naira to bandits for the release of their children.\n\n\u201cWe fear that if nothing is done to stop the attacks and abductions in schools, many parents may not send their children to school again.\n\n\u201cThis will bring about serious set back to the quest by the north to bridge the wide educational gap between it and the southern states of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe join other Nigerians to once again, call on the federal government for the umpteenth, time to urgently address the security situation once and for all to liberate Nigerians from criminal gangs and their reign of terror.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the efforts by the security agencies despite the challenges they also face in protecting Nigerians.\n\n\u201cMany of them have lost their lives while others were injured in the line of duty, partly as a result of lack of equipment to confront the criminals.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari, has repeatedly promised to address the security situation. He reiterated this during his broadcast on Democracy on Day, promising to protect Nigerians.\n\nWe urged the President to go beyond rhetorics and match his words with action this time around in order to inspire confidence among Nigerians,\u201d it said.\n\nOn Democracy Day anniversary, Northern CAN said that there was nothing to celebrate in view of the excruciating pain and hardship Nigerians are facing.\n\nIt averred that democracy is about recognising and guaranteeing the fundamental human rights of the citizens, adding that it is about allowing the will of the people to take preeminence in matters of public concern.\n\n\u201cThe larger majority of Nigerians cannot breathe because of certain undemocratic tendencies of our leaders.\n\n\u201cAgainst this backdrop and the prevailing economic and security challenges, celebrating June 12 as Democracy Day makes no meaning to the Nigerian populace hence not worthy of Celebration,\u201d the statement stated.",

We have seen turbines that have been running for over 40 years. We have seen efforts being made by Egbin management to effect a turnaround at the plant through overhaul of he entire system.\n\n\u201cWe have also seen the support you have been giving to the youth through employment and capacity development opportunities.\n\n\u201cI have listened to the concerns you raised, particularly, in the area of transmission restrictions. I am aware that works are ongoing in this regards to ensure that all the power we generate is safely evacuated.\n\n\u201cAn area of concern to me is when you talked about the gas constraints. We are going to support you to make sure that the power supply is steady. We are having a session with gas suppliers in this regard.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Sonubi said the Egbin Power Plc under, its Phase Two investment expansion plan, would add between 1,750MW and 1,900MW to Nigeria\u2019s power generation pool.\n\nSonubi said the plant had gone through major overhauling, which had helped to increase its generation from the low capacity it had before 2013.\n\nHe said: \u201cEgbin has 1,320 MW capacity. As at the time we took over, the plant was generating 300MW which is abysmal 22 per cent.\n\n\u201cAs at today, our generation capacity has surged and we do 89 per cent.\n\n\u201cWe have reached the highest peak of 970 MW and we are working hard to ensure sustainability of this feat.\n\n\u201cThe 970MW we hit is the highest in the history of the plant and based on our core value of sustainability, we are working round the clock to make sure that we sustain the gains we have made.\u201d\n\nSonubi listed the challenges being faced by the company to include grid limitation, gas constraints and liquidity.\n\nHe, however, said stakeholders including the NNPC, Central Bank of Nigeria and the Transmission Company of Nigeria were working tirelessly to solve the issues.\n\nSonubi appealed to the NNPC to sustain effort towards gas development and supply of the product to keep turbines at Egbin working productively at optimal capacity.

          "text": "A report has revealed that the dreaded Boko Haram group and bandits have kidnapped almost a thousand school students in Nigeria between December last year and June 5, 2021.\n\nNaija News understands that secondary schools and tertiary institutions in the country witnessed a series of attack by criminal groups who abducted no fewer than 936 students in total within the specified date.\n\nAbductions were recorded in Ohordua, Edo State; Effurun, Delta State; Kankara, Kaduna State; and Mahuta village, Katsina within the speculated period. Other places where cases of abduction were recorded are Kagara, Niger State; Jangebe, Zamfara State; and Afaka, Kaduna State, among others.\n\nREAD ALSO: Updated: Fulani herders kill 12 in Plateau village\n\nSome parents of the abducted students who spoke with reporters had lamented the situation, saying they would not allow their children to return to school. One of them, Alhaji Ibrahim Baba, whose children were among the kidnapped Jangebe schoolgirls, said, \u201cI have decided to withdraw my children from school because of the security situation in the whole country.\n\nHe added: \u201cOur children are no longer at ease due to rampant cases of student abduction across the country and as such, I feel that it is better to withdraw my children so that I will have peace of mind.\u201d\n\nNaija News recalls also that a parent whose two children were abducted by bandits during the Jangebe School abduction, Hafsat Sani, had said many parents are sceptical about the government\u2019s readiness to fight banditry; and as such, do not wish to allow her children too to return to school.\n\n\u201cTwo of my children were kidnapped; I will not allow them to go back unless something tangible is done,\u201d she reiterated.\n\nMeanwhile, the presidency has warned Nigerians to stop rejoicing when cases of insecurity such as kidnappings and killings happen in the country.\n\nThe special assistant on media and publicity to President Muhammadu Buhari, Femi Adesina said those who rejoice when criminals kill security agents or some other negative things happen in the country need to repent.\n\nNaija News understands that the presidential aide stated this in an opinion article made available to newsmen a few days ago. Adesina said that some Nigerians are found to be shouting over the rooftops and amplifying every misfortune or negative occurrence that happens in the country but are always silent when the government records positive/good achievements.\n\nOn his part, the Director of Press, Ministry of Education, Bem Goong, had told newsmen earlier that the Federal Government was working hard to ensure that schools were safe.\n\nHe urged state governments to also do the same. Goong said, \u201cIf you go to our unity schools, you will notice the presence of security operatives. During the 2021 Common Entrance Examination monitoring exercise, the permanent secretary also added that unity schools are the safest and it is because we have deployed security operatives there.\u201d",

          "text": "The Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) has called for more funding of the National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS) centres across the country.\n\nNMA President Prof. Innocent Ujah made the call on Monday, in Abuja, at a news conference organised by the association, in collaboration with the NBTS, to mark World Blood Donor Day, usually celebrated on June 14, every year.\n\nUjah said that the lack of proper funding of the NBTS had led to deficiencies in the quality of services offered by the organisation.\n\nHe lamented the inadequacy of the laws guiding the practice of blood transfusion medicine in Nigeria as they had resulted in the proliferation of quackery and other sharp practices in the sector.\n\nAccording to him, state NBTS centres were worst hit since the withdrawal of donor funds by implementing partners, as state governments were yet to take full ownership of such centres in their domains.\n\nHe, therefore, recommended sustained positive actions by all stakeholders on making voluntary blood donation a culture, and for the state governments to take ownership of the NBTS centres under their jurisdictions.\n\nUjah stressed that improved budgeting and release of funds to the NBTS centres across Nigeria would give room for effectiveness and efficiency in service delivery.\n\nThe NMA president also called on all stakeholders, in the public health sector, to join hands and push for the speedy passage of the national blood service commission bill.\n\n\u201dThere are some mind-blowing statistics about blood transfusion services in Nigeria that had made it imperative for NMA and all stakeholders to get involved in creating awareness about blood donation and transfusion services in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nHe cited some of the challenges of the sector to include, low level of eligible adult blood donor population, low level voluntary blood donation, high level commercial blood donation, high rate of transmission of transfusion transmissible infection among blood recipients from commercial donors, among others.\n\nUjah said the NMA was delighted to join the NBTS and stakeholders, within and outside the health sector, in the celebration of 2021 WBDD which has as its theme, \u2018Celebrating the gift of blood\u2019.\n\nHe noted that the celebration highlighted the uniqueness of the selfless act of voluntarily donating blood and the need for everyone to take responsibility and act to support the drive, under the slogan: \u2018Give blood and Keep the World Beating\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe NMA stands in full support of the NBTS and joins all voices of good reason to create sustained advocacy for a comprehensive improvement in blood transfusion services in Nigeria\u201d, he said.",

          "text": "By Jethro Ibileke/Benin\n\nThe immediate past governor of Edo State, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, has said that it did not matter that he did not complete his tenure as national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nHe stated this on Monday during the party\u2019s enlarged leaders\u2019 meeting across Edo North Senatorial District of the state, held in Auchi.\n\nOshiomhole had to step aside as national chairman of the party, following a law suit that affirmed his removal as a member of the party in his ward.\n\nHe, however, said that what mattered was that he occupied the office of the national chairman of the party, for which he said he remained thankful to God for.\n\n\u201cI have every reason to be grateful to God for His grace upon me. It is on record that I did not only do 8 years as governor, but the party also worked hard to have my successor elected on the platform. It does not matter what happened thereafter.\n\n\u201cI also was privileged to become the national chairman of our party and it does not matter even if I had spent just two days in that office. All that matters is that I occupied the office and it is a history that cannot be changed and for which I am grateful to God.\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason that I have an obligation to continue to maintain and sustain the ladder which by the help of other people I used to climb up, so that others too can take advantage of that ladder to even climb higher than I did,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting on members of the party who were elected to the State House of Assembly, but were yet to be inaugurated, Oshiomhole thanked them for keeping their faith, noting that even though they committed no sin, they were being denied their right to be sworn-in to represent their constituents.\n\nHe, however, said he believed that God would deliver justice to them in His own way and at His own determined time.\n\nOshiomhole thanked the leaders for remaining steadfast inspite of sponsored negative stories against some of them, even as he saluted the foot soldiers for their trust and confidence and sacrifices in and for the party.\n\n\u201cSome resigned from their positions based on principles, some resisted the temptations to betray the party for monetary gains, while others were sacked or illegally suspended from their elected positions,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe former state governor who urged the party members across the senatorial zone to be proud of themselves, disclosed that no projects were ongoing in Edo North, apart from constituency projects being done by APC legislators in the National Assembly and those influenced by Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Prince Clem Agba.\n\nHe noted that since 2012, the party has not lost any position from House of Assembly, House of Representatives and Senate, not because the people elected were perfect, but \u201cbecause our people were determined, based on party discipline, that we must vote for the party\u2019s candidates at all times.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s spokesman, Garba Shehu, said on Monday that the president is now more determined than ever to rid the country of \u201cartificial divisions that are impeding national cohesion and growth.\u201d\n\nThe Buhari administration has been plagued by widespread discontent, with secessionist agitations rising in the South-East and South-West.\n\nThe agitations, which have been led by the Independent People of Biafra, IPOB, and proponents of the Oodua Nation, have mostly been motivated by alleged injustices against some parts of the country and evident favoritism of the president\u2019s region in the distribution of federal benefits.\n\nMr Shehu, appearing on state-run broadcaster NTA, believes that the regime\u2019s adversary is the outlawed microblogging site Twitter, which is used to spew hate messages and endanger Nigeria\u2019s business survival.\n\n\u201cI think in the last few days, we are seeing a firmer determination by the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari to tackle artificial divisions that are standing in the way of national cohesion and progress of the country,\u201d Mr Shehu said.\n\n\u201cAs I said, Twitter is one of them, but from the pronouncement of the president, in the interview he did on Arise TV and the one on NTA here, the speech he gave in Lagos and the broadcast he gave, I think they are suggestive of the fact that the growing heat in the country must not continue.\u201d\n\nSince the government announced the suspension of Twitter activities in Nigeria, the decision has been met with harsh criticism both locally and globally. Many citizens accused the president of infringing on citizens\u2019 right to free speech and depriving them of their primary source of income.\n\nWith over 30 million users in Nigeria, Twitter is not only a social networking site, but also a venue for Nigerians to communicate their thoughts on national issues and build social cohesion.\n\nBut, in justifying the ban, Mr Shehu claimed that it was the proper method in ensuring that the country\u2019s \u201crising heat\u201d was put to an end.\n\nThe decision, according to the presidential adviser, also reflects the current administration\u2019s willingness to address challenges that endanger Nigeria\u2019s peaceful coexistence.\n\nMeanwhile, the Buhari dictatorship has been extensively chastised for gross human rights violations, increasing insecurity and the economy, corruption, and nepotism, among other things.",

In all, they took eight people from our residence. We also saw some of their colleagues bringing out other people mostly males from our neighbourhood and later went away with them.\n\n\u201cAbout seven gunmen stormed our residence, those that I saw with my eyes and two of them outside were about 30-year of age while those that came to pick us from our rooms were between ages 15 and 20,\u201d Hafsat said.\n\nSpeaking further on Sunday morning, Hafsat Kusfa confirmed the release of her father and mother, whom she said were immediately hospitalised because none of them could speak.\n\n\u201cFrom their condition, it is evident that they received severe beating from their abductors which made them ill,\u201d she said.\n\nUnconfirmed report, however, has it that a former bank manager was also abducted at his residence at Graceland area of Kwangila, Zaria, at about 9pm Friday night.\n\nN30m ransom on Ekiti farmer\n\nAlso, kidnappers of a successful farmer at Iyemero Ekiti in Ikole local government area of Ekiti state, Alhaji Jimoh Olodan, have demanded N30 million ransom for his release.\n\nOlodan was abducted Friday night when suspected herders invaded Elegure farm settlement, some few kilometres to Iyemero-Ekiti.\n\nIt was gathered that his captors, who wielded guns, had contacted the Olodan family and demanded a N30million ransom.\n\n\u201cThe people who kidnapped Alhaji Olodan had contacted the family asking for money that has caused a serious problem for the victim\u2019s relations.\n\n\u201cThey were asking for a sum of N30 million, which the family found to be too outrageous and they were not comfortable with such demand.\n\n\u201cThe family and the entire town are very cautious of the safety of the man, because of his role in the community. He is a successful farmer and one of those people looked up to in the community.\n\n\u201cThey are running around to be able to raise some money so that the man can be freed. The negotiation is still on with the abductors,\u201d said a source.\n\nBut spokesman of the state police command, Sunday Abutu, said the police were not aware of any negotiation.\n\n\u201cWe are not aware that they had contacted the family and asked for ransom. But I know that our men are combing the surrounding bushes in collaboration with local hunters and Amotekun corps,\u201d Abutu said.\n\nNiger on education\n\nMeanwhile, the Niger state government has said it would continue to give priority to the provision of high quality education and motivation of teachers despite the insecurity and attacks on educational institutions by bandits.\n\nThe state\u2019s Deputy Governor, Mohammed Ahmed Ketso stated this at the weekend in Minna.\n\nSpeaking at the Teachers Award Day ceremony organised by the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), the deputy governor said such situation won\u2019t deter the administration from sustainable development of the education system in the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe empowerment of teachers is a priority to us because we cannot raise the quality of students without first standardising the quality of those to impart knowledge and character on them.\u201d\n\nHe explained that government had taken adequate measures to provide security in schools and also secure lives and property, adding that teaching and learning can only flourish in peaceful atmosphere.\n\nSpeaking with journalists, chairman of the board, Dr. Isa Adamu, said pupils displaced by bandits have been placed under special learning arrangements whereby they receive lessons from teachers.\n\nUnder the arrangement, he said, pupils have contacts with teachers and \u201cthis is made possible by the fact that most of them are in the IDPs located in other school.\u201d\n\nHe said the board decided to honour some of the teachers with excellent records of performance as motivation, adding that some head teachers, principal and education secretaries were also honoured.",

          "text": "The Youth Wing of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) , in Kaduna State, have has warned Mr. Philip Atagah to desist from his coordinated and irresponsible attack of Senator Danjuma Laah.\n\nThe party also said that Mr. Atagah\u2019s continued mobilization of cheap writers to denigrate and discredit the good work of Senator Danjuma Leah to score cheap political goals could attract severe consequences.\n\nThe PDP youth, Kaduna State Chapter, gave this warning during a meeting to review the possibility of instituting legal action against Mr Atagah and his accomplices for character assassination.\n\nMalam Aminu Musa who spoke on behalf of the aggrieved youths said that Atagah should come clean and stop misleading the general public.\n\nWhile warning that Senator Danjuma Laah should not be distracted, the youths alleged that Mr Atagah is trying to obtain money he hasn\u2019t worked for.\n\n\u201cWe are disturbed at the incessant inciting statements coming from a paid writer whose write-up failed to state the real fact but was used to create cheap attention as our political leader can not and would not be distracted. Nevertheless, such assignment will be an impossible job to do considering the pedigree of Senator Danjuma Laah.\n\n\u201cMay we remind Atagah and Co that distinguished Senator Danjuma Laah is the elected political leader of the Southern Kaduna People in Nigeria and in diaspora. We are aware of many enemies of Southern Kaduna people that use cheap conductors of blackmail and conflict entrepreneuers whose attitude is known.\n\n\u201cSenator Danjuma Laah has worked and contributed effortlessly to see that Southern Kaduna improves greatly and deserves better.\n\nHowever, we shall not tolerate agents that are trouble makers and who think they can disrespect our elders while we watch with blind eyes\u201d.\n\nNoting that some friends are like pennies, two-faced and worthless, the youths said \u201cIt is in this regard that we are strongly appealing to them to stop their unhealthy activities against the unity of Southern Kaduna\u201d.\n\nThey added, \u201cIt\u2019s important to bring to the knowledge of the general public from a reactionary note made available from one Bege Mark who published the following on his facebook page\u201d.\n\nThe facebook post which is titled \u201cThat Atagah false claim of N1 million Naira from Distinguished Senator Danjuma La\u2019ah on medical outreach in 8 local government areas of zone 3: puting the records straight,\u201d reads:\n\n\u201cIt has become pertiinent for me to clear the air on the issue above because I am the one who introduced Ataga to them \u2018Shettiman Kagoro\u2019. So I stand in a better position to give a clearer picture of the whole event. Apart from fabricating lies and trying to gain cheap publicity, the \u2018Randy Hotelier cum Doctor\u2019 is being used by the political opponents of Senator Danjuma La\u2019ah to destroy the hard earned reputation and political image of the Masses General of Zone 3 ahead of the 2023 General Election.\n\n\u201cWhen the guy contacted me to do a Medical Outreach in 2018, I informed Oga and Ataga was immediately invited to defend his Proposal and he agreed to do the following: \u2018Bring a Team of Medical Doctors for the excercise, the Team was to visit all the 8 Local Government Areas for the exercise and to ensure Ataga\u2019s active participation since it is an issue concerning human health, which needs feedback\u2019.\n\n\u201cContrary to the plan, Ataga brought his \u2018Non-Medical Girlfriend\u2019 and her inexperienced I.T Students (School of Health) without a single Medical Doctor as previously agreed. He only covered Jema\u2019a, Kachia and Kaura leaving the other 5 L.G.A\u2019s. He was not steady despite offer of Hotel and Feeding by the Senator. Instead he was shuttling from Kaduna supervising his Hotel and Night Club Shows by Artists from Lagos.\n\n\u201cNot impressed with his breech of the agreed work plan, the God fearing and kind hearted Senator paid him #1 million naira with instruction for him to go and complete the work then come for the said balance but he ran away and never returned to do the work up till date.\n\n\u201cNow that 2023 is around the corner, he has succumbed to blackmal and media propaganda to destroy the Senator via political opponents justling for the Senate seat in the coming election.We have Video and Pictures of all that transpired\u201d.\n\nThe post continued that by this publication, Ataga is mandated to go and complete the work with Professional Doctors or kindly return the money given to him, failure of which a Legal Action will be taken on him for duping Distinguished Senator La\u2019ah and putting people\u2019s lives at risk through \u2018Quack\u2019.\n\nDr. Bege Saidu Mark also mandated Ataga to write an Apology in 5 National Dailies within 14 Days or risk being drawn to a Court of Law for Defamation of the Senators character.\n\nIn a similar situation the convener of Senator Danjuma Laah 100% Volunteer group, Hon.Victor Mathew Bobai said that the statement credited to the publisher of Elanza Media outfit, carrier of Atagah\u2019s utterances is very irresponsible, unacceptable and basically childish.\n\nHe added that it is also immoral on his part to have made that statement without verifying facts and figure because it\u2019s said that he who must come to equity must come with clean hands.\n\nHe accused the author of suffering from diarrhoea of the mouth and does not know when to mix Political play with professionalism and when to be serious on important issues.\n\nHe challenged the publisher to enumerate what he has achieved for trying to destroy a good Man\u2019s name.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) , yesterday said it is not aware of any civilian casualties in Niger State as a result of an aerial offensive against bandits in Genu Community.\n\nThis denial by the service followed the trending stories that the Nigerian Air Force aerial offensive in Niger State hits wrong target killing wedding guests and wounding several others in in Rijau LGA of Niger state\n\nThe NAF fighter jet which was scrambled from a military base in Katsina State, was reported to have allegedly bombed\n\na location of a wedding party in an adjoining village.\n\n\u201cWe saw the small aircraft dropping bombs from afar on the location of fleeing bandits and one of the explosives hit a wedding event in Argida Village.\n\n\u201cTwo villagers were also killed, unfortunately. We gathered that several others, who were guests at the wedding feast, sustained injuries,\u201d eye witness said.\n\nHowever, the Director of Public Relation and Information, Nigerian Air Force, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet while responding to the trending story in a chat with one of the online news portals said the service has no record of unintended casualties apart from the bandits.\n\nHe explained that the Air Force got credible information about the location of the bandits and was able to kill them.\n\nWhile Confirming the bombardment in Niger State, Gabkwet said: \u201cWe undertook a mission to the northern part of Genu after receiving information that scores of bandits were gathered around the area with bikes and vehicles.\n\n\u201cWe found out it was very credible information, so our aircraft were dispatched to the area.\n\n\u201cWe have not had any complaints from anywhere other than what we are reading on papers. All we know is, through the efforts of our pilot and preciseness of their strikes, those bandits were neutralised.\n\n\u201cWe were able to hit our target which is important so that people can go about their lives in peace and go about their business without being threatened or put in harm\u2019s way.\u201d\n\nThe NAF Spokesperson further raised the following questions, \u201cIf indeed a wedding party was hit, the question Nigerians should be asking is, \u2018Why would a wedding party be held in a forested area with high concentration of banditry activities?\n\n\u201cIt is clear that recent coordinated activities of the NAF, alongside the Nigerian Army and other security agencies are yielding the expected result and obviously, some people are out to discredit these efforts.

The borrowing spree of the APC administration if unchecked will certainly lead Nigeria into avoidable bankruptcy,\u201d a communique issued at the end of the meeting read in part.\n\nThe governors decried that the debt profile of Nigeria with over 80 per cent of normal appropriation spent on debt servicing was rising and becoming uncontrollable.\n\nThey stated that all the gains of the PDP government under former President Olusegun Obasanjo when the nation exited its foreign debt obligations had been destroyed.\n\nREAD ALSO: JAMB Asks Applicants To Complete UTME Registration By Tuesday\n\nThe governors accused the present administration of borrowing for frivolous items, stressing that such an action was scandalous.\n\nThey faulted the operational system and methods of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) which they claimed was functioning as an independent government-within-a-government.\n\n\u201cA situation where CBN creates money, decides how much of it to spend, on what to spend it on without any form of controls or supervision is patently subversive of our constitutional order.\n\n\u201cIt has become not just a leviathan, but also a Father Christmas of sorts, dabbling into every sphere and scope of governmental activity, not just as a lender of last resort, but as a full executing agency of government,\u201d the communique read.\n\nIt added, \u201cThe meeting observed that the CBN has become such an octopus that it threatens state governments publicly, without decorum, about sanctions on any attempt to question its Modus Operandi. The CBN should take immediate steps to halt the depreciation of the naira.\u201d\n\nTackling Insecurity\n\nThe governors also called for the decentralisation of the operations of the security apparatus of the state, even within the existing legal framework.\n\nThey explained that the move became necessary in the face of the disturbing spate of insecurity in the land, to ensure the input of local operators in state and local governments in policing and security.\n\nThe governors decried that President Muhammadu Buhari seemed not to be aware that the coercive instruments of state security were firmly within his hands and not the governors, considering his recent media interview on the subject.\n\nThey reminded the President that he has ultimate authority under the Constitution over the security organisations, even though the states have a role to play.\n\nThe leaders believe cooperation and synergy between states and the Federal Government in security operations were critical in securing the nation and its people.\n\nThey stated that despite being on the Exclusive List, the states spend huge sums of money to support the police and other security agencies to carry out their duties.\n\nThe governors called on the National Assembly to expedite action in passing the Electoral Act and Constitution amendments to ensure restructuring and decentralisation of governmental powers and functions.\n\nRead the communique issued at the end of the meeting below:",

          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has launched the Dash Me Store, an outfit of the Dash Me Foundation founded by the immediate past Minister of Finance, Mrs Kemi Adeosun.\n\nThe store is established to mobilise resources for onward distribution to vulnerable people in the society via grassroots charities.\n\nThe Vice President during the opening on Sunday said, \u201cI am excited to be here for several reasons, but most of all because of Mrs Adeosun\u2019s commitment to the notion that all service to man is actually service to God, and she took that very seriously.\n\n\u201cThis is why, as Minister, she prioritized the Social Investment Programmes, when for the first time, the country voted almost N500B of our annual budget to welfare programmes which are called the Social Investment Programmes, which involved engaging 500,000 young men and women and also giving microcredit to about 2 million traders and also a home-grown school feeding programme for 9.5 million children daily in public schools across the country.\n\n\u201cI am therefore really not surprised that she has decided to use some of her enormous talent and influence to establish an organization that raises funds and provides resources for indigenous grassroots charities working with orphaned and vulnerable children, disadvantaged youth, and victims of domestic violence,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on the establishment of Nigeria\u2019s first thrift-for-charity online store, Prof. Osinbajo said adding social enterprise to philanthropy with a structure that allows for resource mobilization for charity as well as creates the opportunity for people to earn a living in the process, should be the way to go.\n\n\u201cWhat I think is happening here is that philanthropy is not like it used to be when all you needed was a good and kind heart and you didn\u2019t need to plan or organize as you would a business for-profit\u201d.\n\nAccording to the Vice President, one of the factors responsible for the impactful implementation of the Social Investment Programmes of the Buhari administration over the years is the realization that \u201cyou can\u2019t reach Nigerians if you don\u2019t have a plan for the grassroots\u201d.\n\nHe said the realization has influenced the structure designed for the SIP and is largely responsible for the successes of the programme (which is now regarded as one of the biggest social welfare schemes in the continent).\n\n\u201cWhat Kemi and her team have done is to bring the new notion of social enterprise to this project. Philanthropy run with the discipline, attention to detail, and financial prudence of a successful business, and she can do all of that, and I am sure her team is imbibing that, given her background in finance in both the private and public sector.\n\n\u201cThe idea of this thrift-for-charity store is brilliant and the first of its kind in Nigeria. It is a unique model which does not just give to the needy in the conventional way of merely handing out donations.\n\n\u201cIt is an innovative and structured way of aggregating donations to earn income to transform the lives of the vulnerable and needy while creating jobs in the process.\n\n\u201cI must say that your focus on funding grassroots charities is so crucial and I know that, having campaigned with you on behalf of our party, the APC all around Ogun and in every part of Nigeria, it is clear that you can\u2019t reach Nigeria and Nigerians if you don\u2019t have a plan for the grassroots\u201d, Osinbajo added.\n\nIn her response, the former Finance Minister, Kemi Adeosun said the idea of the store is to aggregate donations of different kinds for charitable causes, noting that Nigerians from different fields of endeavour and from across the country would be enabled via the online store to contribute to supporting the needy in the society.\n\nShe said the organisation would work closely with charitable organisations in the grassroots to ensure that funds and other materials donated via the Dash Me Store get to actual beneficiaries.",

This is proof we are ready to join.\n\n\u201cWe are proving every day that we are ready to be in the alliance more than most of the EU countries.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainian president also accused the West of being unwilling to discuss in detail Ukraine\u2019s aspirations for NATO and EU membership.\n\n\u201cI believe this is not nice,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you bang your head against the wall for seven years, saying \u2018well, you see that there\u2019s a war, can you support us?\u2019 and you get an answer \u2018we support the desire, but\u2026\u2019, you can get unwillingness in a few years,\u201d Zelensky said.\n\nUkraine, which applied to join the US-led alliance in 2008, is pressing Western powers for more support as it seeks to deter any new aggression from Moscow.\n\nBut NATO members remain reluctant to embrace Ukraine as they want to avoid ratcheting up tensions with Russia.\n\nKiev has already criticised the bloc\u2019s decision not to invite Ukraine to a NATO summit in Brussels on Monday.\n\nZelensky expressed his disappointment in the \u201ctiredness\u201d of Kiev\u2019s Western allies with his country\u2019s problems, accusing them of being \u201cunfair\u201d to Ukraine, when it comes to questions of joining the EU, the distribution of vaccines against the coronavirus or financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund.\n\nInstead of constantly demanding reforms as a condition of support, \u201ceveryone must be more flexible and understand that we are at war and that we are protecting democracy in Europe\u201d, he said.\n\nZelensky also accused Russia of delaying his proposed meeting with Putin to discuss the conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI believe that today \u2014 I don\u2019t know the reasons for it \u2014 they are delaying this meeting,\u201d the Ukrainian leader said, expressing hope that a date would be set soon.\n\n\u201cI believe that a meeting with the Russian president is unavoidable.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Canada Pays Final Homage To Family Killed In Truck Attack\n\nIn April, Zelensky invited Putin to meet in eastern Ukraine but Putin appeared to shoot down that offer, saying the Ukrainian leader was welcome in Moscow \u201cany time\u201d.\n\nPutin also stressed that Zelensky should discuss the conflict in eastern Ukraine with separatists directly.\n\nKiev has been battling pro-Russia separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions since 2014, following Moscow\u2019s annexation of the Crimean peninsula. The war has claimed more than 13,000 lives.\n\nKiev and its Western allies accuse Russia of sending troops and arms to support the separatists, which Moscow has denied.\n\nAFP",
