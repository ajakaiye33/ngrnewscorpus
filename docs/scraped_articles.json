          "text": "Tanzanian-born novelist Abdulrazak Gurnah, whose work touches on colonialism and refugee life, on Thursday won the Nobel Literature Prize, the Swedish Academy said.\n\nGurnah, who grew up on the island of Zanzibar but came to England as a refugee at the end of the 1960s, was honoured \u201cfor his uncompromising and compassionate penetration of the effects of colonialism and the fate of the refugee in the gulf between cultures and continents,\u201d the Swedish Academy said.\n\nGurnah has published 10 novels and a number of short stories.\n\nHe is best known for his 1994 novel \u201cParadise\u201d, set in colonial East Africa during the First World War, which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize for Fiction.\n\nThe theme of the refugee\u2019s disruption runs throughout his work.\n\nBorn in 1948, Gurnah began writing as a 21-year-old in England.\n\nAlthough Swahili was his first language, English became his literary tool.\n\nThe Nobel Prize comes with a medal and a prize sum of 10 million Swedish kronor (about 980,000 euros, $1.1 million).\n\nLast year, the award went to US poet Louise Gluck.\n\nAhead of Thursday\u2019s announcement, Nobel watchers had suggested the Swedish Academy could choose to give the nod to a writer from Asia or Africa, following a pledge to make the prize more diverse.\n\nIt has crowned mainly Westerners in its 120-year existence.\n\nOf the 118 literature laureates since the first Nobel was awarded in 1901, 95 \u2014 or more than 80 percent \u2014 have been Europeans or North Americans.\n\nGurnah would have normally received the Nobel from King Carl XVI Gustaf at a formal ceremony in Stockholm on December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of scientist Alfred Nobel who created the prizes in his last will and testament.\n\nBut the in-person ceremony has been cancelled for the second straight year due to the pandemic and replaced with a televised ceremony showing the laureates receiving their awards in their home countries.\n\nAFP",

His novel \u201cParadise\u201d was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1994.\n\nThe prestigious award comes with a gold medal and 10 million Swedish kronor (over $1.14 million).\n\nThe prize money comes from a bequest left by the prize\u2019s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel, who died in 1895.\n\nThe 2021 Nobel Prize for literature was announced today, Thursday.

          "text": "Buhari living in the past over open grazing\n\nN/Deltans who joined in looting NDDC\u2019re blind\n\nWhy insecurity persists in the country\n\nMOST Rev. Hyacinth Oroko Egbebo, Bishop, Catholic Diocese of Bomadi, Delta State, is both a preacher and activist on the pulpit. In this interview with Vanguard, he speaks on the just concluded Niger-Delta Development Commission, NDDC, forensic audit, controversial Petroleum Industry Act, PIA that President Muhammadu Buhari has sent back to the National Assembly for amendment after formal acceptance, raging insecurity in the country and other issues.\n\nThe much awaited forensic audit report of NDDC has been submitted to the Federal Government with available bits and pieces on some recommendations in the public domain, what is your reaction?\n\nWe are very grateful that the herculean task of forensic auditing is over. We now eagerly await the positive utilisation of the fruits of this worthy effort. It is my guess that a lot of money has been spent to ensure that this thoughtful auditing process is finally realised. The huge sums of money spent on a project like this means that we should take the result seriously on two counts: Firstly, justify the huge expenditure of funds on this project and secondly, learn how we fared in the past years on how NDDC has handled development projects in our region. This is why I am very grateful to the President and the auditors that have carried out this crucial exercise.\n\nPart of the findings is that N6 trillion had so far been released to NDDC and 13, 777 projects abandoned, how does this make you feel as a Niger-Deltan?\n\nThanks to those who worked hard to expose this painful reality. The travesty of this sad event is felt more due to the unfortunate betrayal by our sons and daughters who are so deeply involved in this destructive looting in collaboration with their masters who appointed them to foist this fate on us. I feel exceedingly sad and depressingly traumatized. As the Scripture says in Psalm 52:12, \u201cIf this was done by an enemy, I could have borne it\u201d and all I say is Et tu Brute? This is a dirty sell out by our own children. The land needs to be cleansed of this defilement of trust by her sons and daughters. Let it be echoed loud that we do not need thieves to be our leaders. When a child leads his parent with dim sight into a gutter so that he would enjoy life without her, even God in heaven would personally revisit such an incident with grave consequences. But I would rather say that our sons and daughters who were involved in this treacherous betrayal, are the blind people. The time of reckoning has come.\n\nWhile outsiders blame Niger-Delta leaders for the scandal, some Niger-Deltans blame powerful Nigerians in the Presidency and National Assembly, who appointed their cronies to man NDDC and control the agency from Abuja, collecting money for contracts and abandoning them. What\u2019s your view?\n\nThe child that sells his parents, brothers and sisters for money under any circumstance has sold his birthright to be called a son or daughter of the soil. It is an abomination! They were not under any spell to do so. The acute measure of suffering being cast upon the people of the Niger-Delta is obviously noticeable to our children who worked in favour of these foreigners. They cannot be excused. They are culpable and must not have anything to do with our future engagements for development of the Niger-Delta. They have a desire to see that we go into extinction in order for them to exist. They meant to destroy us all. This shocking betrayal would eternally and indelibly stand up against them in the annals of our collective history as a people.\n\nThere is no doubt that powerful people in the NASS were and are largely responsible for this huge mess but these people do not live here. They do not live in the Niger-Delta to know that our lives are under siege in so many ways. I spend more fuel to travel from point A to B on the rivers here. I have no access to drinking water. We are compelled to drink from the stream after the acid rain had fallen on our rivers. As a result, we have been in perpetual danger of losing our dear ones to cancer and other health hazards. Road transportation is a forgotten feature of development here. There are no functional hospitals here. Children go to school in make-shift buildings. There are no teachers to teach them in these rural places of total abandonment. There are no prospects of work opportunities here! Although our gas, like the crude oil is used to produce electricity for others, we only hear about electricity. Our representatives only use the Niger-Delta to boost their profile and for their financial and political rewards. We do not seem to be important to them.\n\nA top official of NDDC once said that if the names of looters were made public, the country would break, do you subscribe to the names of NDDC looters being made public?\n\nNigeria has seen lots of very important personalities who have come and gone. As the saying goes, \u2018just as a soldier comes and goes, the barrack remains,\u2019 so shall it be with these people too. The integrity of this nation does not rest on one set of people. There must be consequences. We are anxiously waiting to unmask the evil faces of those who have ruined our fortune in no time. Indeed, they have imprisoned us in this pigeon-hole of poverty for too long. These people do not love us. They are not leaders. They are looters.\n\nWhat in your opinion, should be the way out for NDDC?\n\nThey should allow us to vote for representatives to lead rather than appoint people from Abuja. The monthly accounts and all financial activities of NDDC should be made known to us via electronic media. There should be no secrecy to the projects to be done here. We need to have a generally agreed blueprint to be in place for the development of the Niger-Delta.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum, NNPC GMD and others say Niger-Deltans should be happy with three per cent for Host Communities Development Trust Fund in the PIA. Juxtaposing it with the 30 percent set aside for exploration of frontier basin, what is your opinion?\n\nThis is a gross anomaly to be addressed in the future. We have always provided the funds for the entire nation since this crude oil resource became available to Nigeria since 1956. Interestingly, we are told that the gold that is excavated in Zamfara State is only for their private business in that part of Nigeria. So many other mineral resources are being excavated for the benefit of their people. It is sad that our children have been used by this government to develop other parts of this country, rather than think of doing what would be of some benefit to us too. As we speak, there is no railway line running through the Niger-Delta region. But the priority project seems to be done in the northern part of this country and probably more importantly, our oil funds are targeted to provide railway to Niger Republic.\n\nThere will be time to secure a redress on these issues. Next year presents another opportunity for change of government. I have no doubt that this ugly trajectory of oppression will change for the better. However, we look forward to President Muhammadu Buhari bringing courage and foresight in the near future to do justice to matters affecting the Niger-Delta. For quite a long while, we have been treated by Nigerian government with disdain, hence we did not expect the PIA to be passed in the first instance by this administration. We recall with lots of regret that our own son who was the immediate past president did not have the courage to make the PIA a reality. It is my belief that this is the beginning of many good things to be realised in this region. This government too will come to an end. The next government will certainly remedy the injustice and insult of this government\u2019s allocation of paltry sum of money for Host Communities Development Fund if Buhari failed to do the needful before handing over.\n\nPresident Buhari\u2019s government continues to insist on open grazing against all odds, what justification do you see?\n\nThe president is not a young man. His antecedents go back to ancient times. Hence, he seems to be able to only relate to his past years. This proposal seems to suggest that he is still living in the past. No right thinking person would subscribe to open grazing these days. The cost effective and reasonable method of ranching is glaringly the preferred mode of operation now. This will make for better neighbourliness and more productive yield for the cattle industry. Examples abound in regard to how this has been done elsewhere in civilized countries of the world. We import Peak milk from abroad without any hassle. We cannot subscribe to a system that places economic advantage of one group as more important than others or to the detriment of other people. After all, it is the private business of the Fulanis. It is unthinkable that it has been made to assume a thing of importance at the national level. The invitation to support the destructive method of rearing cattle that eat up the crops of farmers, cannot be countenanced. This is an evil practice that can only be endorsed by people from an ancient generation.\n\nEvery part of the country is having security challenges. Are you satisfied with the FG\u2019s handling of the situation?\n\nIt is unfortunate that insecurity has become the new norm in Nigeria. This is so because those who are perpetuating it seem to have the support of the government of the day. There seems to be no commitment by the government to undertake a genuine plan of engagement with the culprits. This is why it has persisted until now. There might be no sufficient food for us to buy in the future. I pray we do not starve. It is unjust to allow some people to have access to guns and the rest of the nation subjected to this evil adventure of dominance of one group over the rest of us. The fact that Miyetti Allah group claimed responsibility for their killings, there is no need for anyone to tell lies about what they are up to. The government has favourably opted to support this group and it is obvious to everyone. They won\u2019t be able to do so beyond this regime.\n\nThere has been agitation for secession by some ethnic nationalities in the country; what is your view on this, especially as Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho are in custody over it, whereas bandits and killer-herdsmen are moving freely?\n\nI am surprised that Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho are held in prison. These people did not commit any offence. They are entitled to request for a country of their own. This is done everywhere when people are not satisfied with the bargain for their coexistence with others. For this reason, some people seek asylum in other countries. Sometimes they hold referendum to settle such cases when quite a number of people are seeking to leave the union.\n\nBut I would have advised those who are seeking to leave Nigeria to give it another thought and trial beyond this government. It has not been this bad in Nigeria. The change Nigerians expected was for the better but it has turned out to be like a lion in a sheep\u2019s clothing kind of affair.\n\nTell Kanu and Igboho that there can be another day for Nigeria to regain its freedom from these handlers. We hope for a Nigeria that would be free from ethnicity, nepotism, corruption, religious bigotry and poverty-driven spirit. Consequently, people would be allowed to live freely in their enclaves and develop along the lines of their aspirations and dreams for better humane existence. These people will not define our future for us. They are certainly going to go away some day. Please, know that Nigeria is a gift by God to the black race. Therefore, it is my hope and prayer that someday and in our waking moments of God-given opportunity, our gifted children will see the daylight in which they will soar to their peak moments in actualising their dreams. Africa looks up to Nigeria as the most populous Black Country with potentials beyond measure. God loves Nigeria. It is not a dream but a reality to be attained.\n\nHow are you winning souls, especially militants and ex-militants in the creeks and generally, ministering the gospel to people at this difficult time and season in Niger- Delta?\n\nI take exception to that word \u2018militants.\u2019 I would not call them militants. These boys are not militants and if there was anything militant, it was Nigeria herself that was militant against us. Nigeria took everything away from us and when the people are crying, they call them names in order to hang them.\n\nIt\u2019s like the saying in English, give a dog a bad name so you can hang it. Who will take this devastating humiliation from anybody? They have taken all our wealth away and seemingly deceive everybody to make us think that they gave so much to us whereas they are the ones appointing these people siphoning the money away. What I do primarily is to use my office as a bishop to proclaim the truth, the good news to everybody. I do not isolate who is a militant and who is not, whatever name they call them.\n\nI speak the truth into the hearts of everybody to hear, both those who are killing us and those who are not really trying to be conscientious in looking for God.\n\nI speak to all of them, that in both good and bad times, we need to stand strong to do the will of God, and that means try and do the right thing. I proclaim against injustice, poverty, humiliation of our people and corruption, which has really destroyed our people. I proclaim the word of God in season and out of season. I preach to young people not to go violent because it\u2019s not the way forward and that has been my message.",

However, there is also the need for caution on the part of media practitioners particularly in the South-East to be more circumspect in the news they disseminate to the public concerning the insecurity in the region. The news being churned out to the other parts of the country with regards to the insecurity situation in the region is far from the reality on the ground.\u201d\n\nThe National President however declared his preparedness to review the constitution of the union to checkmate quackery and other irregularities that are being perpetrated by enemies of the union.\n\n\u201cThe NUJ in the coming administration is going to take a critical look at this monster trying to rare its head before it dents the image of practitioners.\n\n\u201cThe good news is the fact that our automated identity card is already addressing the issue of quacks and fake media practitioners. Any individual who wants to belong to the NUJ must adhere to the provisions of the constitution with respect to membership,\u201d he stated.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja, Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri, Obinna Odogwu, Awka and Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu\n\nThe Federal Government, yesterday, threatened to invoke a state of emergency in Anambra State to ensure the sanctity of the November 6 governorship election.\n\nAttorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, dropped the hint when he briefed correspondents at the end of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) at the presidential villa, Abuja.\n\nThe meeting was presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja on Wednesday.\n\nStakeholders in the Anambra election, including the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) have raised the alarm over the upsurge in violent attacks on individuals and government facilities in Anambra as the governorship election in the state draws closer.\n\nMeanehile, angry reactions have trailed the state of emergency threat of the Federal Government.\n\nMalami, however, said the Federal Government had the responsibility to sustain democratic order and would not hesitate to declare a state of emergency if the security situation in the state did not improve to allow peaceful conduct of election.\n\n\u201cWhen our national security is attacked, and the sanctity of our constitutionally guaranteed democracy is threatened, no possibility is ruled out. As a government, we have a responsibility to ensure the sustenance of our democratic order, we have a responsibility to provide security to life and properties. So, within the context of these constitutional obligations of the government or the desire to establish democratic norms and order, there is no possibility that is out ruled.\n\n\u201cAnd you cannot rule out possibilities, inclusive of possibility of declaration of state of emergency where it is established that there is a failure on the part of the state government to ensure the sanctity of security of lives, properties and democratic order. So, our position as a government is that this elections are going to hold. And necessary security in terms of democratic order must certainly prevail for the purpose of this election,\u201d he said.\n\nThe AGF assured that the government would do the needful in providing security for lives and properties in Anambra.\n\nWhen asked whether the positions his office expressed on both the open grazing laws by states and on the Value Added Tax (VAT) would not influence the course of justice since the matters were in court.\n\nHe replied: \u201cWell, on the issue of farmers/ herders clashes, no position was taken by the Office of the Attorney General outside the scope of the constitutional provisions.\n\n\u201cThe position of the Office of the Attorney General is about freedom and liberty of movement among others\u2026And what the Office of the Attorney General has simply succeeded in doing is making a reference to relevant constitutional provisions and established a position that each and every Nigerian is entitled to freedom of movement. Simpliciter. So, the issue is whether that freedom of movement is constitutionally guaranteed or not. And my answer to it is the freedom of movement is indeed, constitutionally guaranteed.\u201d\n\nOn governors push for states to collect VAT, he said the Federal Government was contemplating heading straight to the Supreme Court, which according to him, has jurisdiction over such matters.\n\n\u201cThe Court of Appeal has granted an order of stay of execution, directing these state governments (Rivers and Lagos) to maintain status quo pending the determination of the main appeal and these matters are being considered for determination.\n\n\u201cAnd some other governors have filed in an application for joinder, seeking to be joined in the matter as interested parties. But again, there is pending, equally, an application and preliminary objection for that matter, challenging the competence of the action and indeed the judgement that was obtained. But the Federal Government is still looking at other possibilities, all options open in terms of challenging the action, the action of the state government.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

Nnamdi Ezeigbo and Chairman/Chief Executive Officer, Seahorse Lubricants Industries, Chief Ebuka Onunkwo, have described The Sun Awards as worthy recognition that excites every winner.\n\nThe duo, speaking separately when a delegation of The Sun Publishing Ltd, led by the Managing Director/Editor-in-Chief, Mr. Onuoha Ukeh, presented letters announcing them as winners of The Sun Entrepreneur of the Year 2020 and The Sun Industrialist 2020 in Lagos and Ozubulu, Anambra State, said the image built by the newspaper as the voice of the nation has placed its awards above every other honour in the country.\n\nCommending The Sun for speaking the truth and defending the voiceless, Ezeigbo said he was happy to join other eminent Nigerians who had been honoured by the newspaper.\n\nHe said: \u201cI feel humbled and very honoured. It\u2019s an honour to be counted, to be listed as Entrepreneur of the Year by The Sun. Nigeria has about 200 million people; so, it\u2019s something very special to be picked out of this number.\u201d\n\nDescribing The Sun Awards as prestigious.

When one takes a cursory look at the calibre of past winners of this prestigious award, one has to be grateful to the Almighty God that my modest efforts is being recognised.\n\n\u201cFor me, this award is valued more because I had no idea that the newspaper has been monitoring what we have been doing in the lubricants manufacturing sector of the economy.\n\n\u201cThe most surprising aspect of it all is that prior to the time I was notified of my nomination as the Industrialist of the year, no contact was made to me. This is what makes this award unique. I am therefore excited because The Sun award is the most prestigious in the media industry. It is just like winning a Grammy.\u201d\n\nEarlier, The Sun MD praised Ezeigbo and Onunkwo for dominating their environment, even in the face global lockdown occasioned by the devastating impact of COVID-19 last year.\n\nHe said their selection was based on merit, citing their outstanding achievements in their businesses.\n\nUkeh commended Ezeigbo for leading what he called a revolution in the telephone and computer gadgets sector in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cYour company is always one of the first to announce and introduce new mobile phones to the Nigerian market and provide first-class after-sales support. The company has more than 70 retail outlets across the various states in Nigeria and employs more than 1,000 people.\u201d\n\nHe told Onunkwo: \u201cYou recorded outstanding feats and impact in the manufacturing sector, thereby contributing to the growth of the Nigerian economy.\u201d\n\nThe Sun Awards ceremony will be held at the Expo Convention Centre, Eko Hotels & Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos on Saturday, October 16, 2021.\n\nApart from Ezeigbo and Onunkwo, there are 22 others who will receive awards.

          "title": "How Buhari Visited Ailing Ex-Lagos Governor, Tinubu In Corruption-tainted London Villa Acquired By Osun Governor, Oyetola",
          "text": "Investigation has revealed that the London mansion where the National Leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu welcomed President Muhammadu Buhari on August 12, 2021 is the subject of a multi-billion fraud scandal.\n\nThe investigation is part of the global International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)-led Pandora Papers project, which Nigeria\u2019s PREMIUM TIMES is a part of.\n\nThe project involved 600 journalists from 150 news organisations around the world sorting and analysing a trove of almost 12 million confidential files, tracking down and interviewing sources, and adding context using public records and documents.\n\nThe leaked files were retrieved from some offshore services firms around the world that set up shell companies and other offshore entities for clients, many of them influential politicians, businesspersons, and criminals seeking to conceal their financial dealings.\n\nThe investigation added that the Buhari government had also secured a freezing order on the property from a Federal High Court before the previous owner, who is now an international fugitive, sold it at a huge discount to an offshore company owned by the governor of Osun State, Gboyega Oyetola, a known proxy and a relative of Tinubu.\n\nThe property, which is situated at 32 Grove End Road, in the wealthy Westminster neighbourhood of London, has become a sort of mecca to associates of Tinubu, and politicians of the ruling APC, after the former Lagos Governor started staying there to recuperate.\n\nApart from Buhari, other politicians who have visited Tinubu at the expanse 6,975 sq ft property are the governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; a former governor of Ogun State, Ibikunle Amosun; Amosun\u2019s successor, Dapo Abiodun; the governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi; the governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu; members of the Lagos State House of Assembly; the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; a contingent from Kano State led by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje; top Fuji musician; Wasiu Ayinde, among other dignitaries.\n\nDocuments obtained from the UK property register revealed that in July 2013, the property with title number 340992, was bought for \u00a311.95 million by Zavlil Holdings Ltd, a shell company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, a notorious tax haven.\n\nFurther documents obtained by PREMIUM TIMES revealed that Zavlil Holdings Limited is owned by Kolawole Aluko, an international fugitive wanted by law enforcement agencies in Nigeria and the United States for money laundering.\n\nKola Aluko and his associate, Jide Omokore, were indicted in the U.S. and Nigeria for multi-million-dollar fraud and money laundering violations allegedly in collusion with a former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Diezani Alison-Madueke.\n\nIn 2016, the Nigerian Government filed a Mareva injunction at a Federal High Court in Lagos seeking to confiscate a list of properties belonging to Messrs Aluko and Omokore valued at $1.8 billion.\n\nA Mareva injunction is a Court order which freezes the assets of a defendant pending the outcome of a litigation.\n\nIn the suit against Messrs Omokore and Aluko, alongside their companies, Atlantic Energy Drilling Concepts Nigeria Limited and Atlantic Energy Brass Development Limited, the Nigerian Government asked the court to grant it seven orders to prevent the accused from disposing the assets. The government alleged they were acquired through fraudulent means.\n\nThe third prayer the government made to the court was to grant it an order restraining the accused \u201cfrom giving any instruction, demanding, accepting, receiving payments and/or transacting, transferring, mortgaging or howsoever dealing in any manner with assets of the Defendants in both houses and land in Abuja and Lagos and others located outside Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe government then listed 17 properties in Abuja, Lagos, the U.S., Canada, Dubai, Switzerland, and the UK. Among the listed properties was \u201cGrove End Road, London\u201d.\n\nThe court granted the government all its prayers. In October 2017, an attempt by the defendants to dismiss the Mareva injunction granted on the properties was subsequently dismissed by Oluremi Oguntoyinbo, the trial judge.\n\nBut just around the time (on October 18, 2017) the court dismissed the defendant\u2019s attempt to dismiss the injunction, documents obtained from the U.K. property register revealed that Mr Aluko sold the house for \u00a39 million to Aranda Overseas Corporation, an offshore company incorporated in the British Virgins Island by two of Tinubu\u2019s most trusted surrogates \u2013 Adegboyega Oyetola, formerly chair of Paragon Group of Companies and incumbent governor of Osun State and Elusanmi Eludoyin, Mr Oyetola\u2019s successor at Paragon.\n\nIn November 1999, 18 years before it was used as a vehicle to purchase the London property, Oyetola and his billionaire partner, Eludoyin, sought the service of a Bristol, UK-based international company registration agent, Jordans Limited, to help them set up a company.\n\nThey wanted a kind of setup that would guarantee some secrecy and on November 11 of that year, the company was registered.\n\nLeaked confidential records revealed that Messrs Eludoyin and Oyetola became the shareholders and directors of Aranda and we did not see any record that the latter resigned from the management of the company even as he served as chief of staff to his predecessor, Rauf Aregbesola, thereby breaking Nigeria\u2019s law.\n\nIn Nigeria, a person is statutorily obligated to withdraw from engaging in or directing a private business, except if it is farming, upon becoming a public officer, Section Six (6) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act stipulates.\n\nApart from Aranda, Oyetola has another footprint in the offshore shadow economy. He and Eludoyin, in 2003, incorporated another shelf company in the British Virgin Islands, Global Investments Offshore Limited.\n\nHe ran the company as a director almost throughout his term as Mr Aregbesola\u2019s Chief of Staff. However in June 2018, months before he became governor, he withdrew from the company and made his children \u2013 Rukayat Oyetola, Hafiz Oyetola, and Rasheedat Oyetola directors.\n\nHe also transferred his shares in Global Investments Offshore Limited to Mr Eludoyin and his son Haifz in June 2018. A register of directors we saw shows that all the formalities for the transfers were concluded and signed on June 1, 2018.\n\nBy remaining a director of Global Offshore for the entire period he was Chief of Staff to Aregbesola, Oyetola violated Nigeria\u2019s code of conduct law and could be arraigned before the Code of Conduct Tribunal if authorities decide to prosecute him for the infraction.\n\nIt however remains unclear why Oyetola would rush to buy a property his country was pushing to confiscate due to well-known corruption allegations against its then owner.\n\nAlso unclear is why Tinubu, who apparently wants to become Nigeria`s president, would agree to stay at the controversial property.\n\nAs for Buhari, it is yet unknown why he would visit Tinubu at a property suspected to have been originally bought by Mr Aluko from the proceeds of alleged theft of Nigeria\u2019s oil money.\n\nOyetola ignored multiple requests for him to comment on this story. His spokespersons declined to revert days after they promised to do so.",

          "text": "Investigation has revealed that the London mansion where the National Leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu welcomed President Muhammadu Buhari on August 12, 2021 is the subject of a multi-billion fraud scandal.\n\nThe investigation is part of the global International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)-led Pandora Papers project, which Nigeria\u2019s PREMIUM TIMES is a part of.\n\nThe project involved 600 journalists from 150 news organisations around the world sorting and analysing a trove of almost 12 million confidential files, tracking down and interviewing sources, and adding context using public records and documents.\n\nThe leaked files were retrieved from some offshore services firms around the world that set up shell companies and other offshore entities for clients, many of them influential politicians, businesspersons, and criminals seeking to conceal their financial dealings.\n\nThe investigation added that the Buhari government had also secured a freezing order on the property from a Federal High Court before the previous owner, who is now an international fugitive, sold it at a huge discount to an offshore company owned by the governor of Osun State, Gboyega Oyetola, a known proxy and a relative of Tinubu.\n\nThe property, which is situated at 32 Grove End Road, in the wealthy Westminster neighbourhood of London, has become a sort of mecca to associates of Tinubu, and politicians of the ruling APC, after the former Lagos Governor started staying there to recuperate.\n\nApart from Buhari, other politicians who have visited Tinubu at the expanse 6,975 sq ft property are the governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; a former governor of Ogun State, Ibikunle Amosun; Amosun\u2019s successor, Dapo Abiodun; the governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi; the governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu; members of the Lagos State House of Assembly; the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; a contingent from Kano State led by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje; top Fuji musician; Wasiu Ayinde, among other dignitaries.\n\nDocuments obtained from the UK property register revealed that in July 2013, the property with title number 340992, was bought for \u00a311.95 million by Zavlil Holdings Ltd, a shell company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, a notorious tax haven.\n\nFurther documents obtained by PREMIUM TIMES revealed that Zavlil Holdings Limited is owned by Kolawole Aluko, an international fugitive wanted by law enforcement agencies in Nigeria and the United States for money laundering.\n\nKola Aluko and his associate, Jide Omokore, were indicted in the U.S. and Nigeria for multi-million-dollar fraud and money laundering violations allegedly in collusion with a former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Diezani Alison-Madueke.\n\nIn 2016, the Nigerian Government filed a Mareva injunction at a Federal High Court in Lagos seeking to confiscate a list of properties belonging to Messrs Aluko and Omokore valued at $1.8 billion.\n\nA Mareva injunction is a Court order which freezes the assets of a defendant pending the outcome of a litigation.\n\nIn the suit against Messrs Omokore and Aluko, alongside their companies, Atlantic Energy Drilling Concepts Nigeria Limited and Atlantic Energy Brass Development Limited, the Nigerian Government asked the court to grant it seven orders to prevent the accused from disposing the assets. The government alleged they were acquired through fraudulent means.\n\nThe third prayer the government made to the court was to grant it an order restraining the accused \u201cfrom giving any instruction, demanding, accepting, receiving payments and/or transacting, transferring, mortgaging or howsoever dealing in any manner with assets of the Defendants in both houses and land in Abuja and Lagos and others located outside Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe government then listed 17 properties in Abuja, Lagos, the U.S., Canada, Dubai, Switzerland, and the UK. Among the listed properties was \u201cGrove End Road, London\u201d.\n\nThe court granted the government all its prayers. In October 2017, an attempt by the defendants to dismiss the Mareva injunction granted on the properties was subsequently dismissed by Oluremi Oguntoyinbo, the trial judge.\n\nBut just around the time (on October 18, 2017) the court dismissed the defendant\u2019s attempt to dismiss the injunction, documents obtained from the U.K. property register revealed that Mr Aluko sold the house for \u00a39 million to Aranda Overseas Corporation, an offshore company incorporated in the British Virgins Island by two of Tinubu\u2019s most trusted surrogates \u2013 Adegboyega Oyetola, formerly chair of Paragon Group of Companies and incumbent governor of Osun State and Elusanmi Eludoyin, Mr Oyetola\u2019s successor at Paragon.\n\nIn November 1999, 18 years before it was used as a vehicle to purchase the London property, Oyetola and his billionaire partner, Eludoyin, sought the service of a Bristol, UK-based international company registration agent, Jordans Limited, to help them set up a company.\n\nThey wanted a kind of setup that would guarantee some secrecy and on November 11 of that year, the company was registered.\n\nLeaked confidential records revealed that Messrs Eludoyin and Oyetola became the shareholders and directors of Aranda and we did not see any record that the latter resigned from the management of the company even as he served as chief of staff to his predecessor, Rauf Aregbesola, thereby breaking Nigeria\u2019s law.\n\nIn Nigeria, a person is statutorily obligated to withdraw from engaging in or directing a private business, except if it is farming, upon becoming a public officer, Section Six (6) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act stipulates.\n\nApart from Aranda, Oyetola has another footprint in the offshore shadow economy. He and Eludoyin, in 2003, incorporated another shelf company in the British Virgin Islands, Global Investments Offshore Limited.\n\nHe ran the company as a director almost throughout his term as Mr Aregbesola\u2019s Chief of Staff. However in June 2018, months before he became governor, he withdrew from the company and made his children \u2013 Rukayat Oyetola, Hafiz Oyetola, and Rasheedat Oyetola directors.\n\nHe also transferred his shares in Global Investments Offshore Limited to Mr Eludoyin and his son Haifz in June 2018. A register of directors we saw shows that all the formalities for the transfers were concluded and signed on June 1, 2018.\n\nBy remaining a director of Global Offshore for the entire period he was Chief of Staff to Aregbesola, Oyetola violated Nigeria\u2019s code of conduct law and could be arraigned before the Code of Conduct Tribunal if authorities decide to prosecute him for the infraction.\n\nIt however remains unclear why Oyetola would rush to buy a property his country was pushing to confiscate due to well-known corruption allegations against its then owner.\n\nAlso unclear is why Tinubu, who apparently wants to become Nigeria`s president, would agree to stay at the controversial property.\n\nAs for Buhari, it is yet unknown why he would visit Tinubu at a property suspected to have been originally bought by Mr Aluko from the proceeds of alleged theft of Nigeria\u2019s oil money.\n\nOyetola ignored multiple requests for him to comment on this story. His spokespersons declined to revert days after they promised to do so.",

See Also Corruption N5bn Scandal: How AGF Malami, Senate President Are Frustrating Stella Oduah's Trial\n\nSaharaReporters had learnt that the trial of Oduah could not proceed in February because the co-defendants and the ex-minister failed to appear before Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja.\n\nThe judge had given the prosecution additional weeks and slated April 19 for the continuation of trial, but the case of the former minister again did not come up as scheduled.\n\nIt was gathered that Oduah met with Lawan and Malami to frustrate her case with the EFCC.\n\n\u201cFebruary 22 has passed but she was not arraigned.

          "text": "Gboyega Oyetola, governor of Osun, bought a mansion in London from a company belonging to Kola Aluko, a Nigerian businessman who is being tried for money laundering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was revealed in leaked files retrieved from offshore services firms around the world and released in a Pandora Papers project led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), and which Premium Times is a part of.\n\nAccording to Premium Times, documents obtained from the UK property register revealed that in July 2013, the property with title number 340992, was bought for \u00a311.95 million by Zavlil Holdings Ltd, a shell company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, a tax haven.\n\nZavlil Holdings Limited, the paper reported, is owned by Aluko.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAluko, an ally of Diezani Alison-Madueke, Nigeria\u2019s former minister of petroleum resources, has been the subject of various investigations in Nigeria and abroad for allegedly taking part in shady oil contracts.\n\nThe federal government had in 2017 sought an injunction to freeze the assets of Aluko, including the UK property located at 32, Grove End Road, London.\n\nA federal high court in Lagos subsequently granted the federal government\u2019s request.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut just around the time (on October 18, 2017) the court dismissed the defendant\u2019s attempt to dismiss the injunction, documents obtained from the U.K. property register revealed that Mr Aluko sold the house for \u00a39 million to Aranda Overseas Corporation, an offshore company incorporated in the British Virgins Island by two of Mr Tinubu\u2019s most trusted surrogates \u2013 Adegboyega Oyetola, formerly chair of Paragon Group of Companies and incumbent governor of Osun State and Elusanmi Eludoyin, Mr Oyetola\u2019s successor at Paragon,\u201d the newspaper wrote.\n\n\u201cThe huge discount at which the property was sold is curious and raised questions of whether Mr Aluko desperately needed to sell the property even while a court of law had placed a freeze order on it.\n\n\u201cThe United Kingdom, especially the greater London area, is noted for rapid increase in the value of properties. According to PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 calculation of the likely value of the property when it was bought by Aranda Overseas Corporation done on the website of UK\u2019s National Building Society, which is the largest building society in the world, the property should be worth approximately 17 million pounds. Thus, Mr Aluko sold the property at a discount of \u00a38,000,000.\u201d\n\nAccording to Premium Times, Oyetola and one his associates had in 1999 sought the service of a Bristol, UK-based international company registration agent, Jordans Limited, to help them set up a company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeaked records, the paper said, revealed that Oyetola and his partner became the shareholders and directors of Aranda and \u201cwe did not see any record that the latter resigned from the management of the company even as he served as chief of staff to his predecessor, Rauf Aregbesola, thereby breaking Nigeria\u2019s law\u201d.\n\nUpon becoming a public officer, such a person is mandated to withdraw from engaging in or directing a private business, except if it is farming.",

          "title": "From hawking dry fish to coding at Bloomberg: the story of a Nigerian first class graduate",
          "text": "When Kemi*, 26, received a rejection email from Twitter about a software engineering role she\u2019d applied to, she was devastated, and she cried. She\u2019d previously aced Palantir\u2019s recruitment process for the same role and was going to travel for the final interview, on-site, when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and thwarted that plan.\n\nBefore all of these, Kemi had applied to Google, Amazon and Apple but didn\u2019t scale through their recruitment processes. These initial rejections didn\u2019t faze her like Twitter\u2019s, though, because, by the time she applied to the social media giant, she felt she\u2019d already acquired enough skills to land the job.\n\nYet she didn\u2019t. The common response she got across these companies was that she\u2019d submitted her coding assessments later than required; they thought she was slow in coming up with solutions. But she had a demanding, full-time job, and that took up most of her time.\n\nShe decided, then, to take a break from applying for international jobs and focus on her current job at the time. The job paid her enough to sort out personal and family bills, after all.\n\nAnd yet, her ambitions wouldn\u2019t take a break. So it was only a matter of weeks before she was back to applying again to these international jobs.\n\nSo, how did a girl like her \u2013 who came from a poor background \u2013 go from selling fufu and dried fish on a university campus to almost working with Google, Amazon, Twitter and Palantir, and finally landing a software engineering role at the world\u2019s biggest financial data and news company, Bloomberg?\n\nIt all began in Lagos, Nigeria, 26 years ago.\n\nKemi was the first child of her family, born in 1995, in the Akowonjo area of Lagos, Nigeria. Her mother, Mrs Adeoye*, was a schoolteacher and fabric trader. But not the kind that owned shops. Mrs Adeoye sold fabric to her colleagues at school and neighbours. On weekends, she and Kemi hawked them on the street.\n\nDue to their inadequate salary, it\u2019s common in Nigeria for teachers, especially female ones, to double as traders. But it\u2019s not common to see a schoolteacher hawking on the street.\n\nMrs Adeoye collected the fabrics on credit from wholesalers and could only restock after paying for the previous wares. She embodied steadfastness and diligence \u2013 values she has passed down to her daughters.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nKemi watched her mother juggle two jobs to provide for her and her sister and that influenced her decision to work hard and smart. \u201cMy mum raised us alone, and I just got the memo, from a young age, that if I didn\u2019t want to suffer, I\u2019d have to hustle.\u201d\n\nIt was a lonely journey for a single mother raising two daughters alone in Lagos with the little money she made from her teaching job and side hustle.\n\nBut where was her father?\n\n\u201cBold of you to think my dad is dead,\u201d Kemi said, when I asked when her father had died.\n\nHer father had left her mother when her younger sister, Ayo,* was a year old. There was no reason for his disappearance \u2013 at least not any Kemi or her mother knew of. Kemi was five when he left and never looked back.\n\nThe next time Kemi saw him again, she was 12.\n\nHer father\u2019s return was bad luck\n\nIn 2007, Kemi\u2019s sister Ayo fell seriously sick and Mrs Adeoye had to send for her daughters\u2019 father. He showed up, surprisingly, like a hero who\u2019d come to save the day. He spent some months with his earlier-abandoned family and ended up turning everything upside down before he left them yet again. Kemi, her mother and sister had gone out one day, and when they returned, found that he had disappeared with Mrs Adeoye\u2019s goods and put her in debt.\n\nThis event marked the beginning of a negative turn for the family, throwing them into a state of penury that would last over three years. Those goods had been collected on credit and now the wholesalers were upset and wanted their money.\n\nMrs Adeoye had to repay her debts in bits, from her meagre salary, leaving her with almost nothing for feeding and housekeeping. Sometimes, her creditors stormed the school where she taught to embarrass her about their money. By now, things had gotten so bad that Kemi and Ayo used polythene bags to carry their books to school.\n\nSchool fees were the least of the Adeoye sisters\u2019 problems, however, because they both attended schools where their mother taught. There was a staff discount for teachers\u2019 kids at these schools, and sometimes, a complete fee waiver.\n\nExcelling in school\n\nAmid all this chaos, Kemi remained one of the most brilliant students in her class. Being a teacher\u2019s kid may not have come with life\u2019s best comforts, but it gave her something: strict supervision that drove her to excellence.\n\nTwo years after secondary school, Kemi was admitted into the Faculty of Engineering at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ife.\n\nThings had gotten better for her family while she was in SS 3, her final year of secondary school. Her mother got a new job in another school. The job came with accommodation, free lunch and better pay. Mrs Adeoye bought Kemi her first laptop and was able to pay her university bills.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut their problems were far from over.\n\nA few months into Kemi\u2019s freshman year, terror hit again. Her mother lost the new job, and the family was back to square one. Her mother never found her feet again after that.\n\nFor five years, Kemi struggled through university. In her second year, her friend\u2019s father paid her school fees, and in her third year, her fees would come from money she made hawking food on campus. In her third year, she took fufu, eggs and dried fish from one hostel room to another, calling on her fellow students to come buy.\n\nShe stopped selling food after her internship at a tech firm in Lagos. And she used part of the money she made during the internship to sort out her fees for her fifth year of school.\n\nWriting code changed Kemi\u2019s story\n\nKemi started writing code in her freshman year. Some guys at her school had organised a coding bootcamp, which she passively attended. At OAU, it was easy to get into coding as there were always coding camps going on, on the campus.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to continue coding. After the bootcamp, Kemi wasn\u2019t really excited about the skill and discontinued further development in that area \u2013 until her third year when she started working as a software development trainee in a tech company in Yaba, Nigeria\u2019s biggest tech hub. The company picked up students, trained and paid them a stipend for learning.\n\nWhile that was going on, one of her lecturers organised a coding training and, at the end of it, a hackathon, which marked the beginning of it all.\n\nIf Nigerian universities were to be graded based on the number of top tech talents produced, OAU would be in the top three. The school is popular for this, and the Nigerian tech ecosystem testifies to this.\n\n\u201cI like to say I officially became a software engineer during my internship at Konga,\u201d Kemi said. \u201cThat was the turning point for me.\u201d\n\nSince her internship at Konga, all the jobs she\u2019d gotten had been based on recommendations.\n\nDuring her time at her first job out of school, she got an offer from a company based in Germany, but her Nigerian company made a counter-offer and she remained with them. However, when Bloomberg called, it was a case of not every offer can be countered.\n\n\u201cGetting into tech wasn\u2019t really about passion. It was more about getting stability in life,\u201d Kemi told me. \u201cA career as a software engineer has allowed me to do things I could only dream of [before].\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s reality is the same for most Africans, especially young people going into tech; many available jobs can barely cater for their own immediate needs, not to talk of catering for other family members.\n\nKemi wants to continue supporting her mother and sister, not only by clearing their bills but also helping them to be independent of her. \u201cI want to help my family build generational wealth, and you know that can\u2019t happen if I\u2019m the only one giving.\u201d\n\nKemi graduated from OAU with a first-class. This revelation was enough to start an entirely new conversation. There were so many more questions I wanted to ask her, but the answer to them all, she told me, was grit, ambition and a staunch fear of poverty.\n\n*Names have been changed to protect subjects\u2019 identities.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

Its subsea cable Equiano will run through South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria and St Helena and connect the continent with Europe.\n\nAs part of Google\u2019s commitment to supporting Black-led startups in Africa, the company announced the launch of an Africa Investment Fund. Through this fund, it will invest $50M in startups and provide them with access to Google\u2019s employees, network, and technologies to help them build meaningful products for their communities. This is in addition to Google\u2019s existing support through the Google for Startups Accelerator Africa, which has helped more than 80 African startups with equity-free finance, working space and access to expert advisors over the last three years.\n\n\u201cI am so inspired by the innovative African tech startup scene. In the last year we have seen more investment rounds into tech startups than ever before,\u201d Nitin Gajria, Managing Director for Google in Africa said.\n\n\u201cI am of the firm belief that no one is better placed to solve Africa\u2019s biggest problems than Africa\u2019s young developers and startup founders. We look forward to deepening our partnership with, and support for, Africa\u2019s innovators and entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nTo cater for small businesses and entrepreneurs, Google is collaborating with non-profit organisation Kiva to provide $10M in low-interest loans to help small businesses and entrepreneurs in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa get through the economic hardship created by COVID-19.\n\nNonprofits haven\u2019t been left out of this, Google.org is expanding its commitment to support nonprofits working to improve lives across Africa, with an additional $40M to help more partners organisations. In the case of the Airqo team at Makerere University, who use AI and sensors to monitor poor air quality, a leading cause of premature death. Google is providing $3M in new grant funding to expand this pioneering work from Kampala across 10 cities in 5 countries on the continent.\n\nThe announcement of the $1bn investment is commendable and a testament to Google\u2019s commitment to supporting digital transformation in Africa. Since 2017, Google has trained 6 million young Africans and businesses in digital skills. Google has also supported more than 50 nonprofits across Africa with over $16 million of grants and enabled 100 million more Africans to access internet services for the first time through Android.\n\nShare this article\n\nAdegoke Oyeniyi | Author @seunadegoke01",

          "text": "The family of Kenya\u2019s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, has for many years secretly owned a web of offshore companies in Panama, the British Virgin Islands, and other tax havens, according to a new leak of documents known as the \u201cPandora Papers\u201d.\n\nThe Kenyattas have dominated Kenyan politics since the country\u2019s independence in 1963. In addition to the vast political power amassed over the decades, they are believed to be one of the richest families in the country \u2013 with significant interests in the financial services, hospitality, agriculture, and media sectors.\n\nIn 2018, President Kenyatta told the BBC \u2013 while stating his intention to fight corruption and promote transparency \u2013 that his family\u2019s wealth was known to the public, and that he had declared his assets as required by law.\n\nHowever, secret offshore assets belonging to the Kenyattas have been uncovered by an investigation published on Sunday by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), Finance Uncovered, Africa Uncensored, and other news organisations.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe secrets were discovered from almost 12 million documents from the archives of 14 law firms and agencies that specialise in offshore company formations. The files were leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and processed by more than 600 journalists, as part of a global investigation that\u2019s taken around two years.\n\nSeven members of the Kenyatta family, including the president, are revealed, through the Pandora Papers, as being variously connected to more than 10 offshore companies and foundations. The Kenyattas\u2019 offshore investments include a company with stocks and bonds worth $30 million.\n\nLargest-ever leak\n\nThe Pandora Papers represent the latest and largest, by data volume, in a series of major leaks of financial data about the offshore world over the last five years.\n\nIn 2016, the Panama Papers, which consisted of 2.6 terabytes of data, leaked from the law firm, Mossack Fonseca. The following year saw the release of the Paradise Papers, worth 1.4 terabytes of data.\n\nContaining 2.94 terabytes, the Pandora Papers is the largest of the three leaks. The files come from a much wider array of offshore providers than previous leaks, with locations ranging from Vietnam, Belize, and Singapore, to the Bahamas and Seychelles.\n\nThe papers expose the secret offshore affairs of 35 world leaders, including current and former presidents, prime ministers, and heads of state. Other world leaders named in the Pandora Papers include Gabon\u2019s President Ali Bongo Ondimba; President of Congo-Brazzaville, Denis Sassou-Nguesso, King Abdullah II of Jordan, and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nLinks were found between almost 1,000 companies in offshore havens and 336 high-level politicians and public officials, including ministers, judges, mayors, and military generals from 117 countries.\n\nMore than 100 billionaires feature in the leaked data, as well as celebrities, rock stars, and business leaders.\n\nThe global offshore economy enables some of the world\u2019s richest people to hide their wealth and, in some cases, pay little or no tax. Also, many use shell companies to hold luxury items such as property and yachts, as well as hidden bank accounts and art. For politicians, these help them loot state resources.\n\nOther African countries featured\n\nUp to 10 Nigerian politicians are implicated in the Pandora Papers, including former Anambra State governor Peter Obi, according to findings from the leaked documents. Fellow major African oil producer, Angola, has nine politicians.\n\nFive Ivorian politicians and three Ghanaian public officials were helped by foreign agents to stash money suspected to be looted away.\n\nChad, Kenya, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Congo Brazzaville have two politicians apiece, Gabon has three politicians while Mozambique has one.\n\n\u201cThese reports will go a long way in enhancing the financial transparency and openness that we require in Kenya and around the globe,\u201d President Kenyatta\u2019s spokesperson, Kanze Dena Mararo, said in response to the ICIJ Pandora Papers leaks, without contesting the allegations.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\neNaira and private blockchains\n\nGoogle\u2019s $1b plan for Africa\n\nChari\u2019s $5m seed raise\n\nThe eNaira dilemma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Central Bank of Nigeria revealed its plans to launch eNaira on October 1, 2021, it also said it would be using a private blockchain \u2014 The Hyperledger Fabric.\n\nBut, here\u2019s the thing, a private blockchain means there\u2019s no room for transparency. And although blockchain is known for its security and decentralisation, when it\u2019s private, whoever is in control of it can manipulate records.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy not use a public blockchain? That could work, of course, but that would mean sacrificing speed, amongst other things.\n\nWhat would a private blockchain entail for the eNaira? Are there alternatives?\n\nThese questions and more have been answered. Click here: eNaira: How much control does a private blockchain give the CBN?\n\nGoogle plans to invest $1b towards a digital Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, October 6, 2021, Google announced its plan to invest $1 billion in Africa to support digital transformation in the next five years.\n\nThe announcement was made by Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s CEO, at the company\u2019s first-ever Google for Africa event.\n\nHow will it happen? Well, the money will be distributed across different sectors \u2014 including eCommerce and telecommunications \u2014 with Google partnering with other African companies as well.\n\nFor example, a subsea cable dubbed Equiano would be built to enable affordable Internet access. It would run through South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria, and St Helena to connect the continent with Europe. A Device Financing plan would also be implemented.\n\nDevice Financing? Yes. Google says affordable Internet is good, but in the grand scheme of things, being able to buy cheap data would mean nothing if you can\u2019t afford a phone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, free iPhones? Well, it\u2019s definitely going to be Androids, but I wouldn\u2019t bank on something fancy. However, the Device Financing plan will be in partnership with Safaricom and will start in Kenya.\n\nIt will be expanded across other parts of Africa through partners including Airtel, M-KOPA, MTN, and Orange. According to Google, \u201cThese partnerships will help millions of first-time smartphone users gain access to quality, affordable Android smartphones.\u201d\n\nAnything else? Google plans to launch the Africa Investment Fund to invest $50 million in African startups. It will also be providing $10 million in low-interest loans to help small businesses and entrepreneurs.\n\nNon- profits solving different challenges in African communities will also receive $40 million to keep up the good work.\n\nSo, why the generosity? \ud83e\udd14 According to Pichai, the company wants to make \u201cthe Internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African.\u201d\n\nHowever, we\u2019ve seen companies like Facebook investing in providing Africa with better Internet with its 2Africa subsea Internet cable, but with Africa\u2019s projected population of 2.2 billion by 2045, are these acts of kindness just investment in potential customers?\n\nOur Senior Reporter, Emmanuel Paul, gives a detailed analysis on the subsea Internet cable here: With its massive subsea Internet cable, Google says it\u2019s playing the long game in Africa\n\nChari closes $5m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChari Co-Founder.

The startup is digitising the distribution of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) from local manufacturers to local mom and pop stores.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Sophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat, the duo got the idea for Chari during a trip to understand how FMCG worked in sub-Saharan Africa. They discovered how hard it was for mom and pop stores to get their products and decided to make things easier.\n\nPer TechCrunch, small shops order products via the startup\u2019s mobile app and receive them in less than 24 hours.\n\nIt also partners with FMCG Multinationals like American Consumer Goods company, Procter & Gamble (P&G), giving exclusive access to some products.\n\nAccording to Belkhayat, \u201cP&G works with Chari exclusively. So in case any other player wants to sell P&G products, either they have to go through Chari, or they have to buy the goods from the supermarket,\u201d\n\neCommerce in North Africa: eCommerce startups in the region have been on the radar of investors for some time now.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the first Google for Africa event held today, October 6, 2021, global Internet giant, Google, has announced significant initiatives for the African continent. They include a $50 million venture fund for black-led African startups, small business loans, grants for non-profits, and most importantly, the launch of Equiano, a subsea Internet cable to increase Africa\u2019s Internet capacity\n\nIn partnership with Safaricom, Google will also be kick-starting a device financing plan to ensure people actually have smartphones and other Internet-enabled devices to access the Internet.\n\nA little over a year ago, Google announced similar initiatives and affirmed plans to deepen Internet access in Africa and contribute to the continent\u2019s digital transformation. While we could open discussions about Google\u2019s impact later, CEO, Sundar Pichai, reaffirmed this again today.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made huge strides together over the past decade \u2014 but there\u2019s more work to do to make the internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African. Today I\u2019m excited to reaffirm our commitment to the continent through an investment of $1B over five years to support Africa\u2019s digital transformation to cover a range of initiatives from improved connectivity to investment in startups.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle has made significant and relatively successful strides in Africa\u2019s startup space. More on that later. However, its efforts at deepening Internet connectivity has had mixed results both in Africa and outside the continent.\n\nGoogle has, so far, focused its efforts on launching Equiano. This 100 terabit fibre optic cable will stretch from Portugal to South Africa, with landing points in Namibia, Nigeria, and St Helena and will connect Africa with Europe.\n\nSidenote: Fibre optic cables help transmit Internet signals across vast oceans and seas at high speeds. Equiano is Google\u2019s third cable named after a Nigerian writer and abolitionist, Olaudah Equiano who was sold into slavery, bought his freedom and helped abolish slavery in the United Kingdom.\n\nThough Africa already has 13 subsea cables, Google\u2019s new cable features a more advanced (fibre switching) technology. A more compact, cost-effective and power-effective switching solution. So it would be a massive boost to the current crop of cables in Africa.\n\nGoogle also claims that it would lead to a 21 per cent reduction in Internet prices, increase Internet speeds, and help create 1.7 million jobs in Nigeria and South Africa by 2025.\n\nBut there\u2019s one small problem. Africa\u2019s current fibre optic cables already have up to 170 terabits combined capacity at the Eastern and Western shores, but just 5.8% (10 terabits) on average gets to the last mile (regular people living far from the coast).\n\nSidenote: As of 2020, Nigeria only used 10% of the MainOne cable capacity, nearly ten years after installation\n\nThe big question\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNitin Gajria, Managing Director, Sub-Saharan Africa, Google. Source: Supplied\n\nGoogle\u2019s services which include, Video conferencing, streaming, and emails, require reliable Internet. So then comes the question, why is Google adding an extra 100 terabits to what is already a huge glut of underused capacity in Africa?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNitin Gajria, Managing Director, Sub-Saharan Africa, Google, explains that when it comes to large infrastructure like laying a subsea cable, one has to think about it over a very much longer period.\n\n\u201cYes, there is already a huge capacity. But if you project the numbers out into the future, we have 300 million people we\u2019re expecting to get online over the next few years. So the demand for data would continue to rise exponentially. We\u2019ve also seen data cost coming down across the continent. So we\u2019ve got to think about data demands over several years out.\u201d he says.\n\nThough Gajria agrees that last mile Internet delivery has been one of Africa\u2019s biggest challenges, he points out that Google is currently not delivering connectivity to end consumers. A job mainly for telecom companies (telcos) and Internet Service Providers (ISPs).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with several telcos and ISPs, both within the Equiano stream of thinking and otherwise, to facilitate last-mile deliveries. We\u2019re also working on innovative solutions to help bring down the cost of setting up traditional infrastructure to bring data to underserved regions.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Google has previously implemented projects aimed at deepening Internet access to underserved areas.\n\nOne of the most prominent initiatives was the Loon project. Started in 2011 by Loon LLC, Google\u2019s subsidiary working on providing connectivity to rural and remote areas, It used high altitude balloons of 18 km \u2013 25 km to beam wireless connectivity, mainly in South America and Eastern Africa.\n\nIn January 2021, it shut down Loon, stating that it couldn\u2019t find a sustainable business model and partners for the project.\n\nGoogle\u2019s free wifi initiative, which it launched in 2015, offered free wifi in thousands of public places in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It also worked with several partners on this project. But in February 2020, it announced that it was shutting down the project, claiming that data had gotten considerably cheaper, making the wifi station irrelevant.\n\nOutside of the connectivity space, Google, like most other big techs, to be fair, has a litany of projects it started and killed almost abruptly for one reason or the other.\n\nSilver Linings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Google\u2019s partnership with CSquared, a shared Internet infrastructure provider working to provide last-mile Internet access to some African countries, has seemingly endured. It is currently active in three countries: Uganda, Ghana, and Liberia.\n\nCSquared started in 2013 as a project within Google. The tech giant is now a shareholder after bringing in Convergence Partners, International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Mitsui as investors in 2017.\n\nCharles Murito, Director, Sub Saharan Africa, Government Affairs & Public Policy, reveals that this scheme has deepened connectivity in these countries.\n\n\u201cWhen you take countries like Liberia where connectivity in the metro areas was deficient. We were able to improve connectivity in Liberia in a way that had not been seen before, especially post the war,\u201d he reveals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve partnered with organisations like that. Some we have an interest and others like Liquid Intelligent Technologies, who are also doing good work across the continent,\u201d he says.\n\nOn September 16, 2021, Liquid Technologies announced that it is now delivering high-speed Internet to communities in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of Congo, using cutting-edge Wireless Optic Communication (WOC) Technologies from Project Taara at X, Alphabet\u2019s (Google\u2019s parent company) semi-secret research facility.\n\nJust 4.8 km away, separated by the Congo River, lies Brazzaville in the Republic of the Congo, where the Internet was considerably cheaper and faster than in Kinshasa. This was because telecom services providers could not lay fibre cables across the Congo River, the world\u2019s deepest and fastest river.\n\nFibre cables had to travel 400km around the river to get to Kinshasa, making the Internet five times more expensive.\n\nLiquid tried to solve this problem for two years but with little success. But with Project Taara, the company could beam Internet signals across the river in just a few days.\n\nLiquid briefly explained how this technology works in a statement to Techpoint Africa thus:\n\n\u201cIn the same way traditional fibre uses light to carry data through cables in the ground, Taara\u2019s WOC links use narrow, invisible beams of light to deliver high-speed connectivity. Capable of transmitting up to 20 Gbps each, Taara\u2019s links across the Congo River will help the 17 million people in these cities have access to much faster and more reliable connectivity.\u201d\n\nThough the Taara team is not confident it will maintain peak performance in different weather conditions, it believes it will still provide reliable and affordable Internet for both cities.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2018, Google invested $47 billion in capital expenditure, which helped build Equiano.\n\nWith Africa\u2019s well-documented bottlenecks for Internet infrastructure, and the actual number of Internet users in Africa sketchy, Google is making a massive bet on the continent, and it has good reasons to make sure it pays off. Long term that is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Senior Reporter at Techpoint Africa | Website Writer and Narrator. Tech, business and policy analysis is my daily bread. Looking to chat?

          "text": "This article is part of Techpoint Africa\u2019s Crypto Explorer , a monthly series featuring in-depth analysis on the crypto sector in Africa. Expect topics on innovation, regulation, financial inclusion, remittance, eCommerce, and more. for email updates.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, July 22, 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) revealed that the pilot scheme of its digital currency \u2014 eNaira \u2014 will launch on October 1, 2021.\n\nHowever, due to reasons ranging from a clash with Independence Day activities to the ill-preparedness of commercial banks, the much-anticipated launch was postponed\n\nWhile addressing the postponement, CBN\u2019s Director of Communications, Osita Nwasinobi, again recited some benefits of the eNaira \u2014 peer-to-peer transactions, reduction of cash use, and financial inclusion.\n\nWhile the eNaira has its benefits, concerns have been pointed out regarding transparency and how it could aid illegal financial practices by those in control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a Twitter user, a closed or private ledger means crucial information such as supply rate, burn rate, and every eNaira transaction will be known to and controlled solely by an entity \u2014 trusted intermediary \u2014 that has access to the blockchain.\n\nCBN said it's expensive to print Naira and E-naira will reduce this cost because they will print Naira electronically. You already know they are dabbling into an area they don't know. No Open Ledger, we can't see current supply/ burn rate so it's laundering on steroids. Goodluck \u2014 $AYOBAMI \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfb (@dondekojo) September 21, 2021\n\nWhile we\u2019ve explored how this currency will work, what it means, and how it differs from other digital currencies, we\u2019re yet to examine the possibilities of a closed or private blockchain aiding \u201claundering on steroids\u201d\n\nWhat is a private blockchain?\n\nA private blockchain is accessible and controlled by a single entity, organisation, or enterprise. The Hyperledger Fabric, chosen to run the eNaira by the CBN, is an example of a private blockchain.\n\nThey\u2019re also known as permissioned blockchains. A trusted intermediary can choose to grant full or partial access to another entity if it deems fit.\n\nBitcoin made blockchain technology famous, so like the cryptocurrency, the tech is associated with decentralisation and openness. But private blockchains are the opposite. Although it\u2019s the same tech, there\u2019s no form of decentralisation; a single entity controls everything.\n\nBlockchain is a database or a record book, if you like, that stores data. It is a distributed ledger that stores transactions that have been validated on a blockchain network.\n\nValidated transactions are aggregated and stored in a block; this block is added to previous blocks creating a chain, hence the word blockchain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the case of private blockchains, the process of validating transactions that leads to the creation of blocks is decided by one entity, bearing similarity with an original banking system.\n\nHow about public blockchains?\n\nPublic blockchains, like the name implies, are open to everyone. Anyone can join the network and see transactions that have taken place. For example, by simply typing https://www.blockchain.com/explorer on your browser, you can search for a Bitcoin address, see the number of Bitcoins in it, and the transactions it has performed.\n\nAlso, anyone with the proper hardware can validate transactions on a public blockchain. While it\u2019s open to the public, it is secure and offers a lot of transparency.\n\nHow private blockchains work, compared to the public ones\n\nImmediately, the difference between a private and public blockchain is clear \u2014 control and access. However, to get an idea of how much power a trusted intermediary \u2014 in this case, CBN \u2014 has on a private blockchain, it is important to break down the transaction process.\n\nAccording to an explanation by Bird & Bird, a global law firm, a trusted intermediary controls a private blockchain.\n\nThis means the CBN will have total control. A trusted intermediary can either build the entire blockchain software from scratch or licence it from a third party like the Hyperledger Fabric, as the apex bank did.\n\nThe private blockchain network is set up using nodes that run this software. A node is simply a system that validates transactions in a blockchain network.\n\nThe CBN will run the validator nodes itself or use a subsidiary \u2014 most likely BItt Inc. It will also create an app with which users \u2014 Nigerians \u2014 can interface with these nodes. Once you carry out a transaction on the app, it is relayed to the CBN who validates them.\n\nAlso, there are two major ways to set up a private blockchain:\n\ndistributed ledger model, and\n\nshared ledger model.\n\nFrom the presentation by the CBN containing the role of strategic stakeholders in the eNaira launch, it can be inferred that the regulator will most likely use the shared ledger model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of eNaira presentation\n\nIn the presentation, banks, fintechs, the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBBS), and other stakeholders will be playing major roles in the deployment of the eNaira, a setup that fits the shared ledger model.\n\nUsing this model, the CBN has the master node and a full copy of the ledger. We then have the first layer of participants \u2014 banks or fintechs \u2014 that run nodes but only have a partial copy of the ledger and have their information limited to the apex bank\u2019s control.\n\nThe third layer of participants is the app users.\n\nIn contrast, a public blockchain does not have a trusted intermediary. There\u2019s a network of equal nodes that interact with each other.\n\nPer Bird & Bird, \u201cthese nodes are responsible for verifying and relaying the transactions on the blockchain network, but they can also act as end-user software that allows a user to create transactions and/or mine/verify transactions before they are added to the blockchain.\u201d\n\nUsing Bitcoin as an example, the transaction starts from a wallet broadcasted to the network where the digital signatures are verified.\n\nThe mining nodes then try to validate the transaction using something called a consensus algorithm \u2014 a rule written into the blockchain software that makes certain transactions are validated correctly. The whole process is known as proof of work (PoW).\n\nA private blockchain goes through somewhat the same process, but instead of a network of nodes deciding the fate of the transaction, it is done by one entity.\n\nHow much power does a private blockchain give the CBN\n\nAdedayo Adebajo, Managing Director of Jelurida Africa, the blockchain company behind Ardor, an open-source blockchain network, believes that while blockchain is immutable, in the case of a private blockchain, the owners can doctor information on it.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re running a private blockchain, there are a number of things you need to sacrifice, part of which is transparency.\n\n\u201cSome of the reasons people run a private blockchain is to remove the need for transparency, to be able to scale, increase transaction speed with reduced energy consumption, and reduce the need for numerous gadgets in terms of nodes.\u201d\n\nHe says it bears a lot of resemblance with the kind of banking operations we have today, the difference being that the currency is digital and could in the future be deployed for decentralised applications where smart contracts will come into play.\n\nInterestingly, he points out that manipulation of information is possible on a private blockchain.\n\n\u201cIt becomes pretty much easy for people to manipulate data and go away with it for a while before it can be discovered or detected as the nodes continue to generate.\u201d\n\nAdebajo believes that a public blockchain would be more suitable for creating the eNaira, making information available to many people.\n\nThis corroborates @dondekojo\u2019s tweet that burn rates or circulation rates will be unknown.\n\nBurning in this sense is reducing the amount of a particular currency in circulation to control inflation. If a certain amount of eNaira were to be burned, it would be almost impossible to confirm if it was indeed burned or laundered.\n\nWould a public blockchain be better?\n\nWhile launching the eNaira on the public blockchain could provide more transparency, it also has limitations.\n\nTo maintain security, public blockchains such as Bitcoin run thousands of nodes which makes transactions very slow.\n\nIf this is applied to the eNaira, transactions will take minutes to several hours to complete.\n\nAlso, running a validator node on the Bitcoin network is expensive. It requires significantly powerful computing hardware, one of which costs between $5000 and $10,000. It\u2019s important to note that thousands of these will be needed to run a secure network.\n\nWhile it can be argued that there are faster public blockchains with a less expensive consensus mechanism such as proof of stake (PoS), their security and true decentralisation isn\u2019t as assured as Bitcoin\u2019s model.\n\nFlowing from this, is transparency a valid price to pay?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "The new petroleum industry law does not specify exactly when the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation will cease to exist, a development that could impact how quickly the corporation can be reformed to run more efficiently, an expert has said.\n\nTaiwo Oyedele, Fiscal Policy Partner and Africa Tax Leader at leading global services firm PwC, during the 2021 edition of the company\u2019s Capacity Enhancement Workshop for Journalists on Wednesday, said this was a major omission in the PIA which could affect how quickly reforms progress.\n\n\u201cThis is no specific timeline for the old NNPC to cease, does it mean it will continue to operate like this year from now, what then will change,\u201d Oyedele said.\n\nThe Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) provides a legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the Nigerian petroleum industry, the development of host communities, and related matters.\n\nIt was signed into law by President Muhamadu Buhari on August 16, and among other things mandated that the NNPC would become a commercial entity.\n\nRead also: Investor strikes commercial oil, gas at Oza marginal field\n\nThe PIA provides for the incorporation of NNPC limited and the transfer of assets and liabilities of NNPC to NNPC limited. The assets and liabilities not transferred will remain with NNPC until they are extinguished or transferred to the government.\n\nOyedele said the concern is that the inefficiencies associated with the NNPC will persist longer than is necessary without a concrete date to turn it into NNPC Ltd.\n\nAccording to him, if NNPC were efficiently operated like its peer, Saudi Aramco, it should be recording profits of up to $10bn yearly. With this kind of revenue, Nigeria will have enough to pay teachers and doctors, build roads and schools, create jobs, and ultimately improve the wealth of the country.\n\nIn March, Saudi Aramco paid the government, its major shareholder $75billion in dividends, an amount twice the size of Nigeria\u2019s 2021 budget.\n\nThe NNPC declared N287 Billion profit in September, saying it is the first in its 44-year history but Oyedele said the profit was possible due to its efforts to retrieve debts that it had previously thought were impossible to recover the past.\n\nOyedele also said that the quick amendment of the PIA raises further uncertainties as more amendments may also be suggested by different parties and further impair the new law.\n\nHe also said the government should be concerned with the effective implementation of the new law and appoint technocrats rather than politicians to lead the reforms.",

          "text": "The American pharmaceutical giant Moderna has outlined infrastructure endowment as well as political stability as part of conditions for locating its planned five hundred million dollars covid manufacturing plant in Africa. It already has a short list of five African countries but won\u2019t say if Nigeria has a chance.\n\nModerna which is keeping the short list of five countries to its chest, also listed well educated workforce suitable for a high-tech messenger RNA factory. In July, Pfizer ignored Nigeria and chose South Africa to host its own covid plant and Senegal has been mentioned as a possible candidate by other global pharmaceutical companies.\n\nA decision on which African country will host the plant is to be taken in the coming months, says CEO Stephane Bancel. The hosting rights come with significant well paying jobs, technology acquisition capable of spurring advancement in the pharmaceutical and allied sectors and the country that eventually wins can brag about its credentials in a world where investment decisions like this help determine your power and influence.\n\nRead Also: Study shows Moderna vaccine creates twice as many antibodies as Pfizer\n\nThere is a short list of some five African countries with the political stability, infrastructure and educated workforce suitable for a high-tech messenger RNA factory, Bancel said. Moderna plans to talk to those countries and make a decision where to build the African plant in the coming months, Bancel said.\n\nThe $500m African plant will be capable of producing half a billion messenger RNA vaccine doses a year. Moderna will start working on site selection soon, it said. It is unclear if Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous nation which has lost out in previous deals is in contention to win the battle to host the Moderna plant.\n\nIn a statement, the company said that the new factory would produce the drug substance for messenger RNA vaccines, including its Covid-19 vaccine and shots for other diseases, and potentially also have vial-filling capabilities.\n\nModerna has been under pressure to make its vaccine in Africa, the continent with the lowest immunization rate.\n\nThe other main manufacturers of mRNA vaccines for Covid-19, Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, announced a deal in July to start producing shots at a facility in Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nIn an interview, Moderna CEO Bancel said the aim was to build a factory comparable to the company\u2019s main U.S. production facility in Norwood, Massachusetts. It will be owned and operated by Moderna but staffed mostly with local workers.\n\nThe deal wouldn\u2019t involve transfer of intellectual property, Bancel said. He noted that the company has previously said it won\u2019t enforce its patents related to Covid vaccines during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring the mRNA technology to Africa and build a plant there,\u201d Bancel said.\n\nPfizer and BioNTech plan to start producing their Covid-19 vaccine at a Biovac Institute facility in Cape Town. Biovac is partly owned by the South African government.\n\nThe companies have said they plan to begin producing finished doses in 2022. Unlike the Moderna plant, which will produce the active mRNA ingredients for vaccines, the Biovac facility will be focused on the final stage of the manufacturing process, vial filling and packaging.",

          "text": "The leak of large swaths of documents revealing how 35 current and former world leaders, more than 330 politicians and public officials in 91 countries and territories try to shield their assets from public scrutiny has attracted widespread condemnation across the world.\n\nSince the files were released on Sunday, some leaders, civil society groups, opposition political parties across the world and lawmakers from Kenya to the United are calling for investigations and toughening the rules that allow rich people to evade taxes and warehouse their assets in lands with low tax jurisdiction.\n\nRead also: 77 oil firms owe FG N2.6trn from tax evasion, concession on rentals- NEITI\n\nSri Lanka President Gotabaya Rajapaksa ordered a probe on Wednesday into his niece\u2019s overseas wealth after she and her husband were named in the Pandora Papers to have stashed assets abroad.\n\nRajapaksa said he had \u201cInstructed the chairman of the Bribery Commission to initiate investigations and submit a report within a month on the recently released Pandora Papers which caused controversy around the world. Necessary actions will be taken based on the report,\u201d he said in a tweet on Wednesday.\n\nPosts on social media under the tag Pandora Papers revealed widespread outrage over the actions of individuals in several countries who decided to hide their assets abroad to evade scrutiny and taxes.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a story about countries on the periphery of the world economy,\u201d says the open society UK, \u201cIt is a story about how the British state drives a global system in which the richest extract wealth from the rest.\u201d\n\nThe International Consortium of Investigative Journalists obtained the trove of more than 11.9 million confidential files and led a team of more than 600 journalists from 150 news outlets that spent two years sifting through them, tracking down hard-to-find sources and digging into court records and other public documents from dozens of countries.\n\nThe leaked records come from 14 offshore services firms from around the world that set up shell companies and other offshore nooks for clients often seeking to keep their financial activities in the shadows. The records include information about the dealings of nearly three times as many current and former country leaders as any previous leak of documents from offshore havens, the ICIJ said.\n\nThe secret throve exposed offshore dealings of the King of Jordan, the presidents of Ukraine, Kenya and Ecuador, the prime minister of the Czech Republic and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nTransparency International UK urged the parliament to legislate to remove the influence of big money from UK politics.\n\nIn Nigeria, Premium Times, the only participating newspaper in the project from Nigeria, reports that the documents implicated some influential Nigerians including a former Chief Justice of Nigeria, current and former state governors, past and present lawmakers, businesspeople, a popular pastor, and many others. They set up shell companies, and sometimes warehouse huge financial assets, in notorious secrecy jurisdictions.\n\nThe first in the series published on Monday detailed how Peter Obi, former Anambra State governor shielded his assets from Nigeria\u2019s Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB). Obi had defended his action saying the assets were jointly owned by him and his relatives.\n\nThe paper also reported how Abubakar Bagudu, the current governor of Kebbi State, while a senator 11 years ago, sent a delegation to Singapore to find a new haven to shelter his controversial wealth, which is a target of ongoing forfeiture proceedings by the United States Department of Justice. The investigators say the huge funds, warehoused offshore, is part of billions of dollars Bagudu helped the Sani Abacha family to steal from Nigeria in the 1990s.\n\nAlso implicated in the leaks is Mohammed Bello-Koko, the acting Managing Director of Nigerian Ports Authority, who is said to be hiding behind two shell companies incorporated in a tax haven to anonymously invest in the United Kingdom property market, potentially violating Nigeria\u2019s public service code of conduct laws, the ongoing Pandora Papers reporting has revealed.\n\nThe leaks further revealed that 233 houses and apartments were bought by 166 offshore companies at the cost of about \u00a3350 million by some 137 wealthy and influential Nigerians. The bulk of these purchases occurred during the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nThe Pandora Papers is a sad commentary on how the rule of law has been bent and broken around the world by a system of financial secrecy enabled by the U.S. and other wealthy nations. It also shows a pattern of hypocrisy by rich nations who tag African leaders as corrupt but have no qualms hiding and enabling their crime.\n\nTaiwo Oyele, PwC Africa tax leader in a presentation with journalists on Wednesday said that while owning an offshore company is legal, the use it is put can raise moral and ethical concerns.\n\nWhen they are used to evade taxes or give cover to illicit money flows, enabling bribery, money laundering, tax evasion, terrorism financing and human trafficking and other human rights abuses, then it becomes criminal.\n\nPoor countries like Nigeria are disproportionately harmed by the stashing of wealth in tax havens, which starves treasuries of funds to pay for roads, schools and hospitals.\n\nThe Pandora Papers probe reveals that international leaders who could tackle offshore tax avoidance have themselves secretly moved money and assets beyond the reach of tax and law enforcement authorities as their citizens struggle.",

In enthroning a high-performance culture, an organizational performance scorecard has been developed for each ministry.\n\n\u201cThe scorecard will be deployed in tracking key performance targets and deliverables of each Ministry and reports will be demanded on a quarterly basis. A formal assessment of performance targets and results achieved by each Ministry shall be conducted. These shall form the basis of further review and linkages to other key human resource processes.\n\nHe continued: \u201cOn our part, we have articulated, in the MEGA Agenda, a vision of where we want Edo State to be before 2050. Making Edo Great Again and Edo becoming the best state to live and prosper in Nigeria are promises we have made to the good people of Edo State who massively turned out to vote for this Government in September 2020.\n\n\u201cAs Commissioners and Special Advisers, the height of people\u2019s expectations of you and the Government you represent are unprecedented. We have no choice but to meet and deliver on the expectations of the people. As we serve the people, we must become champions of high performance, disciplined in execution and results-oriented.\u201d\n\n\u201cTimely response to the needs and requests from our people must become rooted in our DNA. We must demonstrate and demand \u2018value for money\u2019, a commercial mindset not previously associated with the Public Service,\u201d he added.\n\nHe noted that the new members of the State Executive Council must embrace the Six Pillars of the MEGA Agenda and ensure it constitutes a rallying platform that shall generate an irreversible momentum that will industrialize, transform and build the capacity required to take advantage of the state natural endowments.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAs a sub-national, we have been impacted severely by these realities, and as Commissioners taking on the reign of governance at these times, riding the storm will not be easy. These are inauspicious times and as a government, we are today faced with dwindling revenue base, caused mainly by drop in FAAC allocation, while our Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) is not at the desired level. COVID-19 continues to be a major threat to the health and wellbeing of our people, with a segment of the society suffering severe casualties.\n\n\u201cThese are no ordinary times. We are today living in a world that has been ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the pandemic has been devastating across world economies, with adverse effects on healthcare systems. These have been worsened by insecurity, which has risen with civil strifes of different kinds, causing a failure of national and international institutions in a manner that was never anticipated.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to advise that the commissioners will be inheriting vastly improved Ministries, whose Organizational Structures and operating processes have been reviewed and brought in line with best practices in their respective areas.\n\n\u201cThe Public Service Transformation exercise has also focused on rebuilding human capacity within the ministries. We have thus commenced a structured recruitment of talented, young and experienced administrative and technical professionals to shore up the capacity gaps that exist in the public service.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur ICT capabilities have been strengthened and technology has been deployed to underpin many of our operating processes such that in the near future, the Edo State Government shall be so technology-enabled that manual processing shall gradually become a thing of the past.\u201d\n\n...",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) says it is recommending widespread use of the RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) malaria vaccine among children in sub-Saharan Africa and in other regions with moderate to high P. falciparum malaria transmission.\n\nThe recommendation, according to it, is based on results from an ongoing pilot programme in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi that has reached more than 800 000 children since 2019.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic moment. The long-awaited malaria vaccine for children is a breakthrough for science, child health and malaria control,\u201d said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \u201cUsing this vaccine on top of existing tools to prevent malaria could save tens of thousands of young lives each year.\u201d\n\nMalaria remains a primary cause of childhood illness and death in sub-Saharan Africa. More than 260 000 African children under the age of five die from malaria annually.\n\nIn recent years, WHO and its partners have been reporting a stagnation in progress against the deadly disease.\n\n\u201cFor centuries, malaria has stalked sub-Saharan Africa, causing immense personal suffering,\u201d said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. \u201cWe have long hoped for an effective malaria vaccine and now for the first time ever, we have such a vaccine recommended for widespread use. Today\u2019s recommendation offers a glimmer of hope for the continent which shoulders the heaviest burden of the disease and we expect many more African children to be protected from malaria and grow into healthy adults.\u201d\n\nWHO recommendation for the RTS,S malaria vaccine\n\nBased on the advice of two WHO global advisory bodies, one for immunization and the other for malaria, the Organization recommends that:\n\nWHO recommends that in the context of comprehensive malaria control the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine be used for the prevention of P. falciparum malaria in children living in regions with moderate to high transmission as defined by WHO. RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine should be provided in a schedule of 4 doses in children from 5 months of age for the reduction of malaria disease and burden.\n\nSummary of key findings of the malaria vaccine pilots\n\nKey findings of the pilots informed the recommendation based on data and insights generated from two years of vaccination in child health clinics in the three pilot countries, implemented under the leadership of the Ministries of Health of Ghana, Kenya and Malawi. Findings include:\n\nFeasible to deliver: Vaccine introduction is feasible, improves health and saves lives, with good and equitable coverage of RTS,S seen through routine immunization systems. This occurred even in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nReaching the unreached: RTS,S increases equity in access to malaria prevention.\n\nData from the pilot programme showed that more than two-thirds of children in the 3 countries who are not sleeping under a bednet are benefitting from the RTS,S vaccine.\n\nLayering the tools results in over 90% of children benefitting from at least one preventive intervention (insecticide treated bednets or the malaria vaccine).\n\nStrong safety profile: To date, more than 2.3 million doses of the vaccine have been administered in 3 African countries \u2013 the vaccine has a favorable safety profile.\n\nNo negative impact on uptake of bednets, other childhood vaccinations, or health seeking behavior for febrile illness. In areas where the vaccine has been introduced, there has been no decrease in the use of insecticide-treated nets, uptake of other childhood vaccinations or health seeking behavior for febrile illness.\n\nHigh impact in real-life childhood vaccination settings: Significant reduction (30%) in deadly severe malaria, even when introduced in areas where insecticide-treated nets are widely used and there is good access to diagnosis and treatment.\n\nHighly cost-effective: Modelling estimates that the vaccine is cost effective in areas of moderate to high malaria transmission.\n\nNext steps for the WHO-recommended malaria vaccine will include funding decisions from the global health community for broader rollout, and country decision-making on whether to adopt the vaccine as part of national malaria control strategies.\n\nFinancial support\n\nFinancing for the pilot programme has been mobilized through an unprecedented collaboration among three key global health funding bodies: Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; and Unitaid.",
          "summary": "The long-awaited malaria vaccine for children is a breakthrough for science, child health and malaria control,\u201d said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\n\u201cWe have long hoped for an effective malaria vaccine and now for the first time ever, we have such a vaccine recommended for widespread use.\nRTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine should be provided in a schedule of 4 doses in children from 5 months of age for the reduction of malaria disease and burden.\nLayering the tools results in over 90% of children benefitting from at least one preventive intervention (insecticide treated bednets or the malaria vaccine).\nNext steps for the WHO-recommended malaria vaccine will include funding decisions from the global health community for broader rollout, and country decision-making on whether to adopt the vaccine as part of national malaria control strategies.",

          "text": "No fewer than 18 people including women and children have been killed by a group of suspected bandits in a fresh attack at Kurya Madaro town of Kaura Namoda local government area of Zamfara state.\n\nA resident of the area, Malam Mohammed Lawali Kurya, who narrowly escaped the attack, told Blueprint in Gusau Wednesday that the hoodlums stormed the town Tuesday around 11:30pm.\n\nHe said the bandits comprising men and women, rode on camels and horses with dangerous weapons during the invasion of their town.\n\nKurya also said the bandits set ablaze police operational vehicle, one trailer, four other vehicles belonging to the community and many shops during the attack.\n\n\u201cImmediately they started the attack, even our district head informed the military and other security personnel but we didn\u2019t see them until the following early morning of today (Wednesday),\u201d he added\n\n\u201cI suspect that these people were not Nigerians but from Niger Republic because their mode of dressing and language intonation indicated that they are not Nigerians,\u201d he further said.\n\nWhile calling for the deployment of more troops, he said all those killed in the mayhem had been buried according to Islamic rites.\n\n\u201cWe have buried 18 of our people who were gruesomely killed by the bandits last night, in line with Islamic tenets today,\u201d the source added.\n\nHowever, all efforts to reach the image maker of the state Police Command, SP Muhammd Shehu on the development proved abortive.\n\nSimilar move to also reach the Commissioner of Police Ayuba N. Elkana by our reporter also failed as he was said to be holding a crucial security meeting as at the time of this report.\n\nKatsina\n\nAnd in yet another attack, bandits Tuesday morning killed 10 people and injured several others, burning shops and houses in Yasore community of Katsina state.\n\nYasore is less than two kilometres from Batsari, the headquarter of the local government area by the same name.\n\nBatsari is among the LGAs witnessing incessant bandits\u2019 attacks in Katsina.\n\nIt shares boundaries with Rugu forest, Jibia local government area in Katsina and Zurmi in Zamfara state.\n\nThe state government has cut mobile telecommunications network in Batsari and 13 other local government areas in the state as part of efforts to tackle insecurity.\n\nA resident of the area, Harisu Hamza, told Premium Times newspaper that the attackers came on motorcycles and started shooting sporadically.\n\n\u201cThey came around Magrib prayers. Some people had concluded prayers by then. They rode on more than 20 motorcycles. It was during the sporadically shooting that they killed 10 people and wounded others,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that they left some minutes after 10 a.m. when a combined team of the police, vigilantes and soldiers arrived at the community.\n\nHamza, who has been living in Katsina metropolis, said the bandits \u201ccarted away food commodities and other things they needed during the attack.\u201d\n\nIt was further gathered that some of the wounded have been admitted at the General Hospital in Katsina.\n\nThe police spokesperson in the state, Gambo Isa, said he was in a meeting when Premium Times reporter called him.\n\nHe, however, did not respond to SMS sent to him.\n\nVarsity student abducted\n\nIn a related development, a 23-year-old student of Bayero University Kano, Sakina Bello, has been kidnapped.\n\nFor some time now, Kano, a North-west state has remained unaffected by rising security challenges bedevilling the region.\n\nThe student, it was gathered, was kidnapped Tuesday along Janbulo and Rijiyar Zaki in the Kano metropolis.\n\nThe 300-level Botany student was reportedly abducted in a tricycle commonly called Adai Daita Sahu by her captors.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe left home around 3pm on Tuesday and could not come back until this moment. She was supposed to go to Janbulo from our house in Rjiyar Zaki.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey called her elder brother around 9pm and informed him that she is their den and that they will call back on Wednesday. And the next thing they did was to demand for N100 million ransom,\u201d said a family source.\n\n\n\nThe state Police command confirmed the development and said efforts were on to trace her whereabouts.\n\n\u201cWe received a report of a missing person from Rjiyar Zaki and we immediately swung into action to trace her whereabouts. The command is putting more effort to ensure she is traced and reunited with her family,\u201d he said.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday presented a total budget of N16.39 trillion for the year 2022 to the National Assembly.\n\nThe Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, said the National Assembly is committed to passing the budget before the end of year.\n\nHe also lauded the 2021 budget for being the first to be fully implemented.\n\nAccording to him, that feat helped the country recover from the 2020 economic recession.\n\nRead President Buhari\u2019s full speech here:\n\n2022 BUDGET SPEECH\n\nBudget of Economic Growth and Sustainability\n\nDelivered By:\n\nHis Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari\n\nPresident, Federal Republic of Nigeria\n\nAt the Joint Session of the National Assembly, Abuja\n\nThursday, October 7, 2021\n\nPROTOCOLS\n\n1. It is my great pleasure to be here once again to present the 2022 Federal Budget Proposals to this distinguished Joint Session of the National Assembly.\n\n2. Distinguished and Honourable leaders, and members of the National Assembly, let me start by commending you for the expeditious consideration and passage of the Supplementary Appropriation Bill 2021. This further underscores your commitment to our collective efforts to contain the COVID-19 Pandemic and address the various security challenges facing our country.\n\n3. I will also take this opportunity to thank you for the quick consideration and approval of the 2022-2024 Medium-term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper. Our hope is that National Assembly will continue to partner with the Executive by ensuring that deliberations on the 2022 Budget are completed before the end of this year so that the Appropriation Act can come into effect by the first of January 2022.\n\n4. The 2022 Budget will be the last full year budget to be implemented by this administration. We designed it to build on the achievements of previous budgets and to deliver on our goals and aspirations as will be reflected in our soon-to-be launched National Development Plan of 2021 to 2025.\n\n5. Distinguished Senators and Honourable Members, in normal times, I make use of this opportunity to provide an overview of global and domestic developments in the current year, a summary of our achievements, and our plans for the next fiscal year.\n\n6. However, these are exceptional times. The grim realities of COVID-19 and its lethal variants are still upon us. From President to Pauper, the virus does not discriminate.\n\n7. This is why our country still maintains its COVID -19 guidelines and protocols in place to protect its citizens and stop the spread of this disease.\n\n8. Over the past few days, we have consulted with the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 and the leadership of the National Assembly on how best to present the 2022 budget proposal keeping in mind the deep-rooted traditions in place and the guidelines for safe mass gatherings.\n\n9. We ultimately decided that the most responsible and respectful approach was to hold a shorter than usual gathering while allowing the Honourable Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning to provide fuller details of our proposals in a smaller event.\n\n10. I am sure many of you will be relieved as my last budget speech in October 2020 lasted over fifty minutes.\n\n11. Still, over the next few minutes, I will provide key highlights of our 2021 performance as well as our proposals for 2022.\n\nPERFORMANCE OF THE 2021 BUDGET\n\n12. The 2021 \u2018Budget of Economic Recovery and Resilience\u2019 is based on a benchmark oil price of 40 US Dollars per barrel, oil production of 1.6m b/d, and exchange rate of 379 Naira to US Dollar. Furthermore, a Supplementary budget of 982.73 billion Naira was recently enacted to address exigent issues in the Security and Health sectors.\n\n13. Based on the 2021 Fiscal Framework, total revenue of 8.12 trillion Naira was projected to fund aggregate federal expenditure of 14.57 trillion Naira (inclusive of the supplementary budget). The projected fiscal deficit of 6.45 trillion Naira, or 4.52 percent of GDP, is expected to be financed mainly by domestic and external borrowings.\n\n14. By July 2021, Nigeria\u2019s daily oil production averaged one 1.70million barrels (inclusive of condensates) and the market price of Bonny Light crude averaged 68.53 US Dollars per barrel.\n\n15. Accordingly, actual revenues were 34 percent below target as of July 2021, mainly due to the underperformance of oil and gas revenue sources. Federal Government\u2019s retained revenues (excluding Government Owned Enterprises) amounted to 2.61 trillion Naira against the proportionate target of 3.95 trillion Naira for the period.\n\n16. The Federal Government\u2019s share of Oil revenue totalled 570.23 billion Naira as of July 2021, which was 51 percent below target, while non-oil tax revenues totalled 964.13 billion Naira. The poor performance of oil revenue relative to the budget was largely due to the shortfall in production as well as significant cost recovery by NNPC to cover the shortfall between its cost of importing petrol and the pump price.\n\n17. The National Assembly will recall that in March 2020 the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency announced that the price of petrol would henceforth be determined by market forces.\n\n18. However, as the combination of rising crude oil prices and exchange rate combined to push the price above the hitherto regulated price of 145 Naira per litre, opposition against the policy of price deregulation hardened on the part of Labour Unions in particular.\n\n19. Government had to suspend further upward price adjustments while engaging Labour on the subject. This petrol subsidy significantly eroded revenues that should have been available to fund the budget.\n\n20. On a positive note, we surpassed the non-oil taxes target by eleven (11) percent in aggregate. The sustained improvement in non-oil taxes indicates that some of our revenue reforms are yielding positive results. We expect further improvement in revenue collections later in the year as more corporate entities file their tax returns and we accelerate the implementation of our revenue reforms.\n\nImproving Revenue Generation and Administration\n\n21. We have stepped up implementation of the strengthened framework for performance management of government owned enterprises (GOEs), with a view to improve their operational efficiencies, revenue generation and accountability. The 50% cost-to-income ratio imposed on the GOEs in the Finance Act 2020 has contributed significantly to rationalizing wasteful expenditures by several GOEs and enhanced the level of operating surpluses to be transferred to the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF). I solicit the cooperation of the National Assembly in enforcing the cost-to-income ratio and other prudential guidelines during your consideration of the budget proposals of the GOEs, which I am also laying before you today.\n\n22. On the expenditure side, as at end of July 2021, a total of six point seven-nine (6.79) trillion Naira had been spent as against the pro-rated expenditure of seven point nine-one (7.91) trillion Naira. Accordingly, a deficit of four point one-seven (4.17) trillion Naira was recorded as at end of July 2021. The deficit was financed through domestic borrowing.\n\n23. Despite our revenue challenges, we have consistently met our debt service commitments. We are also up to date on the payment of staff salaries, statutory transfers, and overhead costs. As at (4th of October 2021, a total of 1.732 trillion Naira had been released for capital expenditure.\n\n24. I am pleased to inform you that we expect to fund MDAs\u2019 capital budget fully by the end of the fiscal year 2021.\n\n25. Capital releases thus far have been prioritised in favour of critical ongoing infrastructural projects in the power, roads, rail, agriculture, health and education sectors.\n\n26. We have made progress on the railway projects connecting different parts of the country. I am glad to report that the Lagos-Ibadan Line is now completed and operational. The Abuja-Kaduna Line is running efficiently. The Itakpe-Ajaokuta rail Line was finally completed and commissioned over thirty (30) years after its initiation.\n\n27. Arrangements are underway to complete the Ibadan-Kano Line. Also, work will soon commence on the Port Harcourt-Maiduguri Line and Calabar-Lagos Coastal Line, which will connect the Southern and Eastern States to themselves and to the North.\n\n28. Progress is also being made on several power generation, transmission, and distribution projects, as well as off-grid solutions, all aimed towards achieving the national goal of optimizing power supply by 2025.\n\n29. I am again happy to report that we continue to make visible progress in our strategic road construction projects like the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan expressway, Apapa \u2013 Oworonsoki expressway, Abuja \u2013 Kano expressway, East-West Road and the second Niger bridge. We hope to commission most of these projects before the end of our tenure in 2023.\n\n30. The Pandemic revealed the urgent need to strengthen our health system. Towards this end, we constructed 52 Molecular labs, 520 bed intensive care units, 52 Isolation centres and provision of Personal Protective equipment across 52 Federal Medical Centres and Teaching Hospitals.\n\n31. We continue to push our expenditure rationalization initiatives which we commenced in 2016. For example, on personnel costs, the number of MDAs captured on the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System increased from 459 in 2017 to 711 to date.\n\n32. The recent passage of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021, and consequent incorporation of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation should also result in rationalisation of expenditure, as well as increased investments and improved output in the oil and gas industry.\n\n33. Distinguished Senators and Honourable Members, you will agree with me that a lot has been accomplished over the last year but there is still much to be done. I will now proceed with a review of the 2022 Budget proposal.\n\nTHEME AND PRIORITIES OF THE 2022 BUDGET\n\n34. The allocations to MDAs were guided by the strategic objectives of the National Development Plan of 2021 to 2025, which are:\n\na. Diversifying the economy, with robust MSME growth;\n\nb. Investing in critical infrastructure;\n\nc. Strengthening security and ensuring good governance;\n\nd. Enabling a vibrant, educated and healthy populace;\n\ne. Reducing poverty; and\n\nf. Minimizing regional, economic and social disparities.\n\n35. The 2022 Appropriation therefore is a Budget of Economic Growth and Sustainability.\n\n36. Defence and internal security will continue to be our top priority. We remain firmly committed to the security of life, property and investment nationwide. We will continue to ensure that our gallant men and women in the armed forces, police and paramilitary units are properly equipped, remunerated and well-motivated.\n\n37. The 2022 budget is also the first in our history, where MDAs were clearly advised on gender responsive budgeting. These are part of critical steps in our efforts to distribute resources fairly and reach vulnerable groups of our society.\n\nPARAMETERS AND FISCAL ASSUMPTIONS\n\n38. Distinguished Members of the National Assembly, the 2022 to 2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper sets out the parameters for the 2022 Budget as follows:\n\na. Conservative oil price benchmark of 57 US Dollars per barrel;\n\nb. Daily oil production estimate of 1.88 million barrels (inclusive of Condensates of 300,000 to 400,000 barrels per day);\n\nc. Exchange rate of four 410.15 per US Dollar; and\n\nd. Projected GDP growth rate of 4.2 percent and 13 percent inflation rate.\n\n2022 REVENUE ESTIMATES\n\n39. Based on these fiscal assumptions and parameters, total federally-collectible revenue is estimated at 17.70 trillion Naira in 2022.\n\n40. Total federally distributable revenue is estimated at 12.72 trillion Naira in 2022 while total revenue available to fund the 2022 Federal Budget is estimated at 10.13 trillion Naira. This includes Grants and Aid of 63.38 billion Naira, as well as the revenues of 63 Government-Owned Enterprises.\n\n41. Oil revenue is projected at 3.16 trillion, Non-oil taxes are estimated at 2.13 trillion Naira and FGN Independent revenues are projected to be 1.82 trillion Naira.\n\nPLANNED 2022 EXPENDITURE\n\n42. A total expenditure of sixteen point three-nine (16.39) trillion Naira is proposed for the Federal Government in 2022. The proposed expenditure comprises:\n\na. Statutory Transfers of 768.28 billion Naira;\n\nb. Non-debt Recurrent Costs of 6.83 trillion;\n\nc. Personnel Costs of 4.11 trillion Naira;\n\nd. Pensions, Gratuities and Retirees\u2019 Benefits 577.0 billion Naira;\n\ne. Overheads of 792.39 billion Naira;\n\nf. Capital Expenditure of 5.35 trillion Naira, including the capital component of Statutory Transfers;\n\ng. Debt Service of 3.61 trillion Naira; and\n\nh. Sinking Fund of 292.71 billion Naira to retire certain maturing bonds.\n\nFiscal Balance\n\n43. We expect the total fiscal operations of the Federal Government to result in a deficit of 6.26 trillion Naira. This represents 3.39 percent of estimated GDP, slightly above the 3 percent threshold set by the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2007. Countries around the world have to of necessity over-shoot their fiscal thresholds for the economies to survive and thrive\n\n44. We need to exceed this threshold considering our collective desire to continue tackling the existential security challenges facing our country.\n\n45. We plan to finance the deficit mainly by new borrowings totalling 5.01 trillion Naira, 90.73 billion Naira from Privatization Proceeds and 1.16 trillion Naira drawdowns on loans secured for specific development projects.\n\n46. Some have expressed concern over our resort to borrowing to finance our fiscal gaps. They are right to be concerned. However, we believe that the debt level of the Federal Government is still within sustainable limits. Borrowings are to specific strategic projects and can be verified publicly.\n\n47. As you are aware, we have witnessed two economic recessions within the period of this Administration. In both cases, we had to spend our way out of recession, which necessitated a resort to growing the public debt. It is unlikely that our recovery from each of the two recessions would have grown as fast without the sustained government expenditure funded by debt.\n\n48. Our target over the medium term is to grow our Revenue-to-GDP ratio from about 8 percent currently to 15 percent by 2025. At that level of revenues, the Debt-Service-to-Revenue ratio will cease to be worrying. Put simply, we do not have a debt sustainability problem, but a revenue challenge which we are determined to tackle to ensure our debts remain sustainable.\n\n49. Very importantly, we have endeavoured to use the loans to finance critical development projects and programmes aimed at improving our economic environment and ensuring effective delivery of public services to our people. We focused on;\n\na. the completion of major road and rail projects;\n\nb. the effective implementation of Power sector projects;\n\nc. the provision of potable water;\n\nd. construction of irrigation infrastructure and dams across the country; and\n\ne. critical health projects such as the strengthening of national emergency medical services and ambulance system, procurement of vaccines, polio eradication and upgrading Primary Health Care Centres across the six geopolitical zones.\n\nInnovations in Infrastructure Financing\n\n50. In 2022, Government will further strengthen the frameworks for concessions and public private partnerships (PPPs). Capital projects that are good candidates for PPP by their nature will be developed for private sector participation.\n\n51. We will also explore available opportunities in the existing ecosystem of green finance including the implementation of our Sovereign Green Bond Programme and leveraging debt-for-climate swap mechanisms.\n\nEnhancing Revenue Mobilisation\n\n52. Our strategies to improve revenue mobilisation will be sustained in 2022 with the goal of achieving the following objectives:\n\na. Enhance tax and excise revenues through policy reforms and tax administration measures;\n\nb. Review the policy effectiveness of tax waivers and concessions;\n\nc. Boost customs revenue through the e-Customs and Single Window initiatives; and\n\nd. Safeguard revenues from the oil and gas sector.\n\n53. Distinguished Senators and Honourable Members, I commend you for the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021. It is my hope that the implementation of the law will boost confidence in our economy and attract substantial investments in the sector.\n\nFinance Bill 2022\n\n54. In line with our plan to accompany annual budgets with Finance Bills, partly to support the realization of fiscal projections, current tax and fiscal laws are being reviewed to produce a draft Finance Bill 2022.\n\n55. It is our intention that once ongoing consultations are completed, the Finance Bill would be submitted to the National Assembly to be considered alongside the 2022 Appropriation Bill.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n56. Mr. Senate President, Mr. Speaker, Distinguished and Honourable Members of the National Assembly, this speech would be incomplete without commending the immense, patriotic, and collaborative support of the National Assembly in the effort to deliver socio-economic development and democracy dividends for our people.\n\n57. I wish to assure you of the strong commitment of the Executive to strengthen the relationship with the National Assembly.\n\n58.

We must continue to cooperate and ensure that our actions are aimed at accelerating the pace of economic recovery so that we can achieve economic prosperity and deliver on our promises to the Nigerian people.\n\n59. The fiscal year 2022 is very crucial in our efforts to ensure that critical projects are completed, put to use and improve the general living conditions of our people.\n\n60. It is with great pleasure therefore, that I lay before this distinguished Joint Session of the National Assembly, the 2022 Budget Proposals of the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\n61. I thank you most sincerely for your attention.\n\n62. May God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.",

          "text": "The World Bank Group has raised its 2021 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) projection for Nigeria to 2.4 per cent, higher than the 1. 8 per cent it had estimated for the country.\n\nThe multilateral institution also declared that Sub-Saharan Africa was set to emerge from the 2020 recession sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic with growth expected to expand by 3.3 per cent in 2021.\n\nIn its twice-yearly economic update, \u2018Pulse,\u2019 the Washington-based institution noted that current speeds of economic recovery in the region was varied, with the three largest economies\u2013Angola, Nigeria, and South Africa, expected to grow by 0.4 per cent, 2.4 per cent and 4.6 per cent respectively.\n\nExcluding South Africa and Nigeria, the rest of Sub-Saharan was rebounding faster at a growth rate of 3.6 per cent in 2021, with non-resource-rich countries like C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Kenya expected to recover strongly at 6.2 and 5.0 per cent, respectively, the report added.\n\nCaptioned, \u201cAfrica\u2019s Pulse: Climate Change Adaptation and Economic Transformation in Sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d the World Bank report observed that due to prudent monetary and fiscal policies, the region\u2019s fiscal deficit, at 5.4 per cent of GDP in 2021, was expected to narrow to 4.5 per cent of GDP in 2022 and 3 per cent of GDP in 2023\n\nAccording to the report, the rebound in the region was being fueled by elevated commodity prices, a relaxation of stringent pandemic measures, and recovery in global trade, but remains vulnerable given the low rates of vaccination on the continent, protracted economic damage, and a slow pace of recovery.\n\nIt stated that the growth for 2022 and 2023, would also remain just below four per cent, continuing to lag the recovery in advanced economies and emerging markets, and reflecting subdued investment in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe Chief Economist for Africa at the World Bank, Albert Zeufack explained: \u201cFair and broad access to effective and safe COVID 19 vaccines is key to saving lives and strengthening Africa\u2019s economic recovery.\n\n\u201cFaster vaccine deployment would accelerate the region\u2019s growth to 5.1 per cent in 2022 and 5.4 per cent in 2023\u2014as more containment measures are lifted, boosting consumption and investment.\u201d\n\nA positive trend, the report noted, was that African countries have seized the opportunity of the crisis to foster structural and macroeconomic reforms, adding that several countries had embarked on difficult but necessary structural reforms, including the unification of exchange rates in Sudan, fuel subsidy reform in Nigeria, and the opening of the telecommunications sector to the private sector in Ethiopia.\n\n\u201cHowever fiscal discipline, combined with limited fiscal space, has prevented African countries from injecting the level of resources required to launch a vigorous policy response to COVID-19.\n\n\u201cApart from mounting fiscal pressures and rising debt levels as they implement measures for a sustainable and inclusive economic recovery, Sub-Saharan African countries are also faced with worsening impacts of climate change,\u201d the World Bank report said.\n\nIt advised that just as the countries used the crisis to introduce reform measures, they should also harness this opportunity to make sustainable, resilient transitions toward low-carbon economies that can provide long-term benefits in the form of reduced environmental hazards as well as new economic development openings\n\nThe report highlighted Africa\u2019s unique context of low baseline development, pre-existing climate vulnerabilities, limited energy access, and high reliance on climate-sensitive sectors\u2014 as posing challenges but also providing opportunities to transform the economy and create jobs.\n\nIt pointed out that private firms and governments in Africa were providing training for jobs in solar energy (Togo and South Africa).\n\nAccording to the report, investments in climate-smart infrastructure could help cities create jobs, adding that decarbonisation was an opportunity to foster manufacturing activity in the region, including the production of components of the Internet of Things, value-addition to minerals that will power the green economy, and insertion into regional value chains.\n\nNdubuisi Francis in Abuja",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government may approach the Supreme Court to determine if the states have any constitutional right to collect the controversial Value Added Tax (VAT).\n\nThe Attorney General of the Federation and Minister for Justice, Abubakar Malami, who spoke to newsmen after the weekly virtual Federal Executive Council meeting at Abuja on Wednesday, emphasised that the federal government was contemplating heading straight to the Supreme Court to determine the rightful authority between the states and federal government to collect the contentious consumption tax.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThe issue of VAT, well, as you rightly know, there were certain judgments obtained by some state governors at their jurisdiction and localities before their respective state High Courts, and arising from that judgments and the laws that were passed by those state governments, the federal government filed an appeal against the judgement challenging the laws that were put in place, which I feel has been determined by the Court of Appeal.\n\n\u201cThe Court of Appeal has granted an order of stay of execution, directing these state governments to maintain status quo pending the determination of the main appeal and these matters are being considered for determination.\n\n\u201cAnd some other governors have filed in an application for joinder, seeking to be joined in the matter as interested parties. But again, there is pending, equally, an application and preliminary objection for that matter, challenging the competence of the action and indeed the judgement that was obtained.\n\n\u201cBut the federal government is still looking at other possibilities, all options open in terms of challenging the action, the action of the state government.\n\n\u201cBut one thing that is fundamental that you need to know as being the issue equally being considered for determination by the court is the federal government is challenging the powers of the state governments to legislate on the issues associated with collection of VAT.\n\n\u201cAnd the position of the federal government as canvassed which is being looked into by the judicial system is to the effect that by our laws, the powers to legislate on collection of VAT is statutorily vested in the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAnd with that in mind, it is not within the scope and powers of the state government to legislate on the issue of collection.\n\n\u201cSo, what I\u2019m saying in essence, is just to give an insight as to the multiple contention between the parties as being has been canvassed, presented for the determination of the court.\n\n\u201cAnd we are indeed litigating these issues before the court and the federal government is looking at all options at its disposal, inclusive of the possibility of invoking the jurisdiction, the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, taking into consideration that the dispute at hand is a dispute between the state government and the federal government, in respect of which only the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to entertain taking into consideration the constitutional provisions relating thereto.\n\n\u201cSo, this is the position we are as far as contention among the parties relating to the VAT is concerned.\u201d\n\nOn the position expressed by his office concerning Southern states/herders crisis and the ban on open grazing, which has attracted divergent views, Malami explained that his office had not taken any stance outside the scope of the constitution.\n\n\u201cThe position of the Office of the Attorney General, is about freedom and liberty of movement among others\u2026And what the Office of the Attorney General has simply succeeded in doing is making a reference to relevant constitutional provisions and established a position that each and every Nigerian is entitled to freedom of movement simpliciter.\n\n\u201cSo, the issue is whether that freedom of movement is constitutionally guaranteed, or is not. And my answer to it is, the freedom of movement is indeed, constitutionally guaranteed.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\n",

          "text": "Brazilian footballer is facing a charge of attempted murder after kicking a referee in the head and knocking him unconscious.\n\nIn a phone interview with CNN, Vinicius de Lourenco de Assuncao, who is the police chief of Venancio Aires and made the preventive detention of William Ribeiro, said the footballer had been released from jail on Tuesday.\n\nRibeiro was arrested after attacking referee Rodrigo Crivellaro in the head during a match on Monday in Venancio Aires, in Brazil\u00b4s southern Rio Grande do Sul state.\n\nThe match between Sport Club Sao Paulo and Guarani-RS was in the Rio Grande do Sul state\u2019s second tier.\n\nRibeiro, who was playing for Sport Club Sao Paulo, attacked Crivellaro at the beginning of the second half.\n\nReferee Crivellaro left the stadium unconscious in an ambulance and was taken to a hospital. After some examinations and observation, he was discharged on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really remember (what happened). My refereeing colleagues told me that I gave him a yellow card. He punched me in the face, I fell to the ground, got kicked, and passed out,\u201d Crivellaro told a local radio station.\n\n\u201cThis player needs treatment because he is totally out of control. He deserves to be arrested for a long time.\u201d\n\nRio Grande do Sul state released a statement on Monday saying it had opened an investigation into the incident, while Sport Club Sao Paulo said that its \u201cdeeply ashamed\u201d of the aggression and that Ribeiro\u00b4s contract had been ended.\n\n\u201cThe aggressor athlete\u2019s contract is summarily terminated. Furthermore, all possible and legal measures in relation to the fact will be taken,\u201d wrote the team in an official note.\n\nNo lawyer appeared to defend Ribeiro, according to Assuncao, and the case is now with state public defender.\n\nRibeiro has yet to publicly comment on his social media or in Brazilian media outlets.",
