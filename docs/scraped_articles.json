          "title": "Opposition mounts as N\u2019Assembly transmits PIB to Buhari next week",
          "text": "The National Assembly may transmit the Petroleum Industry Bill, passed by both chambers of the National Assembly, to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), for assent next week.\n\nA principal officer of the Senate, who spoke with one of our correspondents on condition of anonymity on Monday, confirmed that the Senate and the House of Representatives would harmonise their different positions on the bill latest by next Tuesday.\n\nThe senator said the conference committee of the two chambers, which would harmonise the two versions of the bill, would start sitting before the end of this week.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is just that people love to play politics with everything. This is not the first time that the Senate and the House of Representatives would pass different versions of a bill.\n\n\u201cThe usual conference committee will be constituted this week to harmonise the different versions and they are likely to submit their report early next week.\n\n\u201cWe are going on our annual recess on July 15 and we will transmit the bill to the President before we go on vacation. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives\u2019 leaderships have said so on a number of occasions.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, the spokesman for the Senate, Dr Ajibola Basiru, said, \u201cThe National Assembly will carry out necessary legislative actions on the bill,\u201d and declined further comments.\n\nMeanwhile, a coalition of Rivers State oil and gas host communities has rejected the Petroleum Industry Bill recently passed by the National Assembly, saying it fails to address the aspirations of the communities.\n\nThe coalition said the PIB, which offers the host communities three per cent equity participation, was unacceptable and described it as a mischievous piece of legislation.\n\nThe host communities advocated that rather than the PIB to stand alone, it should be merged with the solid mineral Act to better tackle their plights as they were denied the right to their natural resources.\n\nThe Chairman of the coalition, Barituka Loanyie, said in a statement issued in Port Harcourt that the PIB rather than solve the problems in the oil and gas sector, would end up compounding them.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cHaving critically studied the Petroleum Industry Bill, 2021 recently passed into law by the National Assembly, we, the Coalition of Rivers Oil and Gas Host Communities reject it for the reason that it fails to address the lingering issues of the oil and gas host communities.\n\n\u201cThe bill, rather than solve germane issues in the oil and gas sector, ends up compounding them.\n\n\u201cWe want to state without equivocation that the law is a mischievous piece of legislation and a far cry from the yearnings of oil and gas host communities, which only ends up providing a legal framework for corruption and portends a sinister ploy to continue with the unhealthy practice of denying host communities the right to their God-given resources.\u201d\n\nLoanyie added that the provisions of the PIB were surreptitiously making every community that had a pipeline underneath them oil and gas host community, stressing that the Solid Minerals Act, which governs the solid minerals sector, had better protection for the communities in extraction sites, hence would better serve the oil producing communities.\n\nSimilarly, the Ijaw nation has rejected the three and five per cent allocated to the host communities in the PIB.\n\nIt insisted that anything less than a minimum of 10 per cent, which the oil-bearing communities demanded during the public hearings on the PIB, would not be acceptable.\n\nThe President, Ijaw National Congress, Prof Benjamin Okaba, made the position of the Ijaw people known on Monday during a press conference in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State.\n\nOkaba described the proposed three and five per cent as a Greek gift, stressing that the slashing of host communities\u2019 percentage was ridiculous.\n\nHe contended that the Ijaw nation deserved fair treatment as it had suffered long years of environmental pollution and injustice despite producing the wealth that had sustained the health of Nigeria.\n\nHe also posited that increasing the percentage for more petroleum reserves in the \u201cfrontier basin\u201d to 30 per cent as well as redefining the meaning of host communities to include communities where oil pipelines pass through were disgusting and provocative.\n\nOkaba stated, \u201cWe reject in its entirety the three per cent and five per cent provisions as compensation; the redefinition of host communities and other provisions, including the allocation of 30 per cent of our oil resources to grope in the dark in the name of exploitation, a paradox of extreme kind that is not in symphony with common sense, equity and good conscience.\u201d\n\nHe therefore urged the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to refrain from appending his signature to the PIB until the National Assembly prescribed 10 per cent.\n\nSimilarly, the Pan-Niger Delta Forum has rejected the recently passed PIB, describing its provisions as unjust, satanic and provocative.\n\nThe National Leader of PANDEF, Chief Edwin Clark, said this at a media briefing in Abuja on Monday.\n\nHe said the bill as passed was part of a larger plot to continue the subjugation of the people of the Niger Delta by International Oil Companies and their northern collaborators.\n\nClark specifically noted that the provision of 30 per cent of profits for further frontier oil exploration in the North called to question claims by the current regime that it was working towards an economy away from oil.\n\nClark, who was represented at the press conference by PANDEF\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Ken Robinson, said the OICs would face a difficult operational environment if the bill was not revisited and the concerns of the people of the region properly addressed.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Order contractors to appear Thursday\n\nBy Tordue Salem\n\nThe Ecological Fund Committee of the House of Representatives has queried Ecological Fund Office over the lack of documents of the erosion and flood control project at Kuchiako 1 District, New Hope Avenue, Kuje, Abuja.\n\nThe Committee directed the Ecological Fund Office (EFO) to produce the contractor handling the project and also demanded that all the details concerning the project must be made available before Thursday.\n\nThis followed the committee\u2019s oversight function to projects carried out by the EFO in Abuja on Monday.\n\nThe Committee, led by Rep Ibrahim Isiaka, was piqued that the contractor was not on ground and no information about the project was made available to them.\n\nHe said they were not on a jamboree and directed that the commissioning of the project must be put on hold.\n\nREAD ALSO: 42 CSOs allege plot by NASS to manipulate key provisions of Electoral Act Amendment Bill\n\n\u201cThe committee members are feeling that the contractor treated them with disdain. We are just from Karshi and here we are here in Kuje in the spirit patriotism and nationalism and call to duty by the National Assembly and in line with the provision of the constitution of what we should do. We are now doing it and you see the frustration. It is so sad to come and meet nobody.\n\n\u201cThe only thing we are told is that they want to commission the work. We have see nothing to commission here and we are going to pass this to the EFO. The contractor is not responsible to us though. But the EFO is responsible to us and answer questions from us because we directly oversight them. They will in turn inform the contractor. We have nothing to commission here as far as the committee is concerned and until we resolve such, I am afraid there is nothing to commission.\n\n\u201cIf the contractor is recalcitrant, then we move to the next to stage and suspend the contractor from taking any job on any of the projects in the EFO. It is going to be a resolution. We would present it on the floor of the House. We are not threatening anybody but the right thing must be done,\u201d he said.\n\nThe committee had earlier visited the site of the construction of hydraulics structures and road improvement works on eroded Tudun Wada to Karshi Road (phase 1) and emergency surface protection works on the reclaimed earthwork along Tudun Wada Karshi Road, Abuja (phase 2).\n\nIsiaka said the project would improve the lives of the people in the area.\n\nHe said the EFO has done well under the current administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cOf course, the ecological office itself under the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, we have gone to several project sites and we are short of saying that the indicators are there that there is a paradigm shift totally away from what the ecological fund was known for,\u201d he said.\n\nHe called for oversight by various levels of government on projects carried out by the EFO.\n\n\u201cThe 36 states and the FCT benefit from this fund. The 776 local government areas benefit from this fund. I appeal to other levels of government, we cannot directly oversight the states and local governments, but if every level of government do their part, we will get there.

          "text": "The Chairman, Federal House Committee on FCT Judiciary, Hon. Barr. Ifeanyi Chudy Momah has called upon Nigerian Youths to develop more interest in Leadership and should get more involved in deciding who leads them.\n\n\n\nHon. Momah made this call at the Ground Breaking of the Nonso Nwaebili Foundation Headquarters and Grand Finale of the Nonso Nwaebili Foundation (NNF) Super Cup Tournament at Iyiowa Odekpe, Ogbaru LGA of Anambra State.\n\nThe Federal Legislator opined that the current state of our nation can largely be attributed to the docility of the Nigerian Youth towards politics and governance. He regretted that the youths fail to support their fellow youths who aspire for elected office, rather most opt to be pawns in the hands of the older political class.\n\nREAD ALSO:Reps\u2019 bill empowering State Assemblies to create LGAs passes second reading\n\nThis he described as regressive and urged that more interest be shown by the younger generation towards our future and collective interest by shunning the sidelines of politics and embracing more ambition in deciding the political future of our nation.\n\nThe Super Cup Football Tournament, an initiative of the Nonso Nwaebili Foundation (NNF) shut down Iyiowa Odekpe Community as it attracted the attendance of youths, elders, and leaders from the religious and political class, across Ogbaru and Anambra State at large.\n\nThe NNF Founder and Senior Special Assistant to the Governor of Anambra State on Protocol Matters, Chief (Hon.) Barr. Nonso Henry Nwaebili left no stone unturned in ensuring that he gave his people a tournament to remember.\n\nIn his speech, the Founder of \u201cOGA NDI OGA\u201d Foundation, Chief Godwin Agbasimalo congratulated the founder of NNF for the brilliant initiative. Describing Football as the most unifying sport in the world, encouraged the Foundation, its convener, and other leaders and organisations present, to continue to seek innovative ways of positively engaging the Nigerian youth one community at a time.\n\nIn her remarks, the mother of the Convener and Former Speaker, Anambra State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Princess Chinwe Claire Nwaebili, expressed pride and satisfaction in the doggedness of her son, Barr. Nonso Nwaebili, and congratulated him for the humanity in him which birthed the laudable tournament. She encouraged youths to continue to support themselves and stand to be counted in matters pertaining to our future as a nation.\n\nIn his closing remarks, Hon. Nonso Nwaebili returned all thanks to God Almighty for a successful tournament, in spite of the challenges experienced on his way. He reiterated that his commitment to building a community with a vibrant and productively engaged youth population received a new lease of life, owing to the outstanding turnout and support he received from youths of the community to make the tournament a reality.\n\nHe stressed that when it comes to the matters of the collective welfare of the Nigerian Youth, sentiments bordering on politics, party affiliations, personal ambitions, and vendettas need to take the back seat for all hands to come together if the nation of our dreams is to one day be a reality. He sincerely thanked all his benefactors and supporters, including His Excellency, Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra State, who gave him the platform to stand out as a leader in his community from a young age following his time as Special Assistant and subsequently, as Senior Special Assistant.\n\nIt was an extreme moment of Joy when Barr Nwaebili announced a football scholarship for the highest goal scorer and the best player of the tournament.\n\nHe affirmed that he will continue to unveil programmes that will be for the development of his community, to the delight of his people, and to the glory of God Almighty. Other dignitaries in attendances included: Rev Fr Eguoba (Episcopal Vicar), Hon. Afam Ogene, former Federal House Member, representing, Ogbaru Federal Constituency, Chief Obiora Agbasimalo (Labour Party Gubernatorial Candidate), Chief Ejor Richard (A former Gubernatorial Aspirant), Mr. Chimdi Enyi Nwokeukwu Esq, Senior Special Assistant to the Governor of Abia State on Sustainable Development Goals, Barr Onyekwelu Nwanosike (The President General of Odekpe), some members and benefactors of NNF, numerous grassroots political stakeholders were equally present including 8 out of 16 APGA Ward Chairmen in Ogbaru Local Government Area. It was indeed an evening of thorough entertainment and fun for attendees and the people of Ogbaru.",

Take Ibadan for instance, the invasion of the home of Igboho happened in the night and for all-day, everybody was wondering who did and that seven people were killed. People were arrested and abducted at 2am, the governor of the state wasn\u2019t aware. So, everybody was trying to find out, calling security agencies, only for the State Security Service to issue a very provocative statement after almost 12 hours to say, \u2018We did it, we killed two people, we raided a house\u2019. Somebody attempted to evade arrest and you killed two people? The governor of the state wasn\u2019t aware?\n\n\u201cIn these days of kidnappings, anybody can come to your house in the night and arrest you. And these are guys who don\u2019t wear uniforms.\u201d\n\nOpen grazing: Whoever gave Buhari wrong information must be questioned \u2013 Falana\n\n\u201cThere is no provision, unless a crime is being committed in the night; you cannot go there and arrest. In this case, you are required by law to bring a search warrant. In this case, there was no search warrant, nobody took an inventory.\n\n\u201cNow, Sunday Adeyemo has said I didn\u2019t have any gun in my house. Yet, the SSS paraded guns and other ammunition. All the controversies would have been unnecessary if the SSS had behaved like a modern, civilised agency.\n\n\u201cThese are very dangerous legacies of military dictatorship in our country.\u201d",

CHINAKA OKORO reports.\n\nAs early as 8:00 in the morning on Wednesday, June 30, 2021, high chiefs, women and community leaders of Ilara-Epe, the ancient kingdom situated in Eredo Local Council Development Area of Lagos State converged on the expansive palace of Oba Olufolarin Ogunsanwo, Telade 1V.\n\nOba Olufolarin Ogunsanwo is a highly educated, versatile, and innovative royal father whose tenure has attracted development to his domain less than one year as on his ancestor\u2019s throne.\n\nSupported by his amiable and beautiful Olori Bolanle, the traditional ruler welcomed his visitor and his entourage to his domain.\n\nThe event was the visit of the French Ambassador to Nigeria/ECOWAS, Mr Jerome Pasquier to the kingdom. It was historic as the French envoy was the first Ambassador to pay homage to the ancient town of Ilara-Epe.\n\nFeeling at home among those indigenous to Ilara, Ambassador Pasquier\u2019s visit to the ancient Ilara Kingdom is in two folds; to strengthen bilateral ties between both countries and to further develop the immense tourism potential of the division, particularly the ongoing project, Sungbo Eredo which is tailored at turning the famous United Nations Educational, Social and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) world heritage site into a world-class tourism hub.\n\nThe project is being carried out in conjunction with educational institutions such as Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), University of Ibadan (UI) and Augustine University, Ilara (AUI).\n\nThe Sungbo Eredo is a system of defensive walls and ditches built in 800 A.D. in honour of the Ijebu noblewoman, Oloye Bilikisu Sungbo. The location is on Nigeria\u2019s tentative list of potential UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\nDignitaries at the event included the Chairman, Eredo LCDA, Adeniyi Saliu, the Queen of Ilara Kingdom, Olori Bolanle Ogunsanwo, Prince Segun Osifeko, Dr Taiwo Olufemi Salaam, former Permanent Secretary, Lagos State Ministry of Transport, Local Government and Community Affairs.\n\nOthers were High Chief Badru, the Seriki of Epe Kingdom, and High Chief Charles Keshinro, the Odofin of Ilara, as well as members of the Alara-in-Council, Baales and Chiefs and other tourism enthusiasts.\n\nAddressing the gathering, Ambassador Jerome regretted that the COVID-19 pandemic had prevented him from visiting the area as planned a year ago. He expressed his fascination for the archaeological projects in Eredo LCDA, which, according to him informed his visit.\n\n\u201cI am very happy to be here. I came to see the archaeological project tagged Sugbon Eredo Heritage being supported by both the French and United States governments. It is a monument that is proof that this part of Nigeria has been in existence before the colonial era.\n\n\u201cMy President, Emmanuel Macron has a strong interest in Nigeria and he received several businessmen from Nigeria some days ago and he wants to push for more projects.\n\n\u201cAgriculture is one of the priorities. We know how important it is for Nigeria. We really consider agriculture as important and we the French people have a good knowledge of agriculture, even tropical agriculture. \u201cWe are ready to work with you on any project, any request, any demand. We shall be happy and proud to accommodate you,\u201d he said.\n\nThe top diplomat thanked Oba Ogunsanwo for the warm reception and hospitality, noting that his government has the utmost respect for a traditional institution, particularly in view of its role in preserving culture.\n\nOba Olufolarin Ogunsanwo appreciated the diplomat for creating time out of his busy schedule to visit the Ilara Ancient Kingdom, and for identifying with them which he said is \u201chistoric and unprecedented in the annals of our history.\u201d\n\nOba Ogunsanwo highlighted the long-standing relationship between Nigeria and France, noting that France has the largest trade relationship with Nigeria in Sub-Saharan Africa with over 100 successful industries in the country.\n\nThe monarch also praised the French Government, which, according to him, was the first country to invest in the Sungbo-Eredo Monument project as far back as 2015 before the United States (U.S.).\n\nThe traditional ruler commended the efforts of France and the United States in ensuring that the monument is preserved and accredited as one of the United Nations (UN) world heritage sites.\n\n\u201cFor us here, the significance of that is that we will have a world-class tourist centre that the monument would be the largest in Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa by extension. The pandemic has made it important for us to develop our tourist centres,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile thanking Prof. Gerard Chouin from the University of Virginia, United States and Director, National History Museum, Obafemi Awolowo University. Prof. Adisa Ogunfolakan and other members of the team working on the project for their dedication and resilience, Oba Ogunsanwo requested the French companies to invest in other sectors of the community\u2019s economy that include farming, fishing and hunting as well as cottage industries.\n\n\u201cOur tropical weather gives room for products and farm produce to thrive. The environment is serene,\u201d he noted. This, he believes, will bring economic development and job opportunities for the youth in the area.\n\nHe also enjoined the French Government to extend her hands of fellowship towards brilliant but indigent students for academic scholarship consideration.\n\nThrowing more light on the project, Oba Ogunsanwo said: \u201cThe Sungbo Eredo is a monument that has been in existence since the 13th Century. It is the wall that extends to Ijebu Ode is the footpath that people used in the olden days to move from one place to the other. Even within our own Eredo here, there are some toll gates, there are still some cowry shells that people used to pay for tolls when they are moving their goods and services from one place to another.\n\n\u201cIt has been a very important project that the French and the United States governments have been sponsoring the archaeological research and the excavation to expose what the monument looks like. The United Nations, through UNESCO, is also planning to name it as one of the world heritage centres.\n\n\u201cSo, all these activities that we have been doing are geared towards ensuring that the project is aligned.\n\n\u201cWe are planning, in conjunction with the Lagos State government, the National Commission for Museum and Monument, the National Tourism Development Corporation as well as the Ogun State government, the University of Ibadan and the National History Museum of the Obafemi Awolowo University, in conjunction with two Professors from Virginia in the United States and one of our own. They are all on this project and they have all been working together.\n\n\u201cSo, we are enthusiastic and we are looking forward to making it a world tourism centre where people can come and see for themselves.\n\n\u201cIt is even a monument for the whole of Africa, so that people can come and see the elaborate plans by the state government to provide all the basic amenities, and we plan to have a resort, hotel, and canteen. We will provide walkways, car parks, and so many other facilities that will attract people to the area. For us, we believe the coming of that project will sell Ilara Kingdom to the world about Eredo LCDA, where people will be coming for foreign investment. When people come as tourists, they can also appreciate some other things that can happen or that can take place within Ilara Kingdom such as farming, cottage industries, hospitality business, real estate, educational institutions, and so on and so forth.\n\n\u201cWe believe that will open the whole of this kingdom up so much so that we will be able to galvanise all these into economic prosperity.\n\n\u201cI feel highly elated and I want to thank God for making it possible during my own time that the French Ambassador had to come and see things for himself .\u201d\n\nEnumerating the benefits of the project to Ilara, Lagos and Nigeria in general, one of the Directors of the archaeological project and Director, National History Museum, Obafemi Awolowo University Prof. Adisa Ogunfolakan said the idea was muted by Prof. Gerard Chouin and they have been working on it since 2015.\n\n\u201cSugbon Eredo Heritage is a fantastic one. It is a classical one such that in West Africa or in Africa, the type is not seen. Because they span almost about 160 kilometres and we need to research into it, to let the world know about it so that it will become a world heritage site.\n\n\u201cBy the time we open it to the outside world, the tourists will be coming and then it is going to change the economic, social and political status of Ilara,\u201d he said\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCorroborating Oba Ogunsanwo\u2019s views, Adeniyi Saliu praised the French Government for its immense contributions towards the development of tourism and the agricultural potential in the kingdom, the significance of establishing robust ties among Eredo and other economically viable entities across the international community.\n\nHe implored the French emissary to intimate its government on the mutual benefits that could result from investing in hi-tech, robot-assisted farming.\u201d\n\nOba Ogunsanwo later presented a portrait artwork that symbolises the three occupations of the Ilara people-fishing, farming and hunting to the diplomat.",

          "title": "Will Press Council Bill enhance or kill the media?",
          "text": "The Nigeria Press Council amendment bill was supposed to strengthen the council to reposition the Nigerian Media. But a study of the bill reveals a lot of hidden clauses that will rather impact on media practice in the country negatively. TONY AKOWE and NICHOLAS KALU report.\n\nThe Nigeria Press Council was established as a regulatory agency for the profession. The body was championed by media owners before it was taken over by the government. An attempt to amend the Press Council bill is now generating controversy.\n\nThe bill titled \u201cA Bill for an Act to amend the Nigeria Press Council Act CAP N128, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 1992 to resolve bottlenecks affecting the performance and make the Council in tune with the current realities in regulating Press and for related matters\u201d is sponsored by the Chairman of the House Committee on Information, National Orientation, Ethics and Values, Segun Odebunmi, who incidentally presided over the public hearing on the bill.\n\nA close study of the bill reveals several contentious clauses. The law increases the fine placed on a journalist for publishing a false news from N2000 to N20,000 upon conviction by the court to N250,000 flat with an imprisonment of between 6 months and two years. It also increased the fine for media houses from between N30,000 and N100,000 to between N1 million to N10 million with an option of total closure of such media house. Other provisions include the fact that media houses will now be required to pay a percentage of their annual financial return to the Press Council as part of its funds, but however failed to specify the actual percentage, but vested the Council with the power to determine the percentage to be paid. Under the old law, such percentage of fees and levy were paid by the NUJ, NGE, NPAN and BON. This is in addition of license fees, fines and penalties to be charged by the council. Also, to publish newspapers, journals and magazine without first documenting same with the council will now be an offence under the law which will attract a fine of N5 million or a term of three years imprisonment. Newspaper vendors are not left out of the draconian clauses as they are forbidden to circulate any of such publications. The proposed section 33 (2) of states that \u201cany news agent who circulates for sale, any copy of a newspaper, magazine or journal that is not documented in accordance with the provisions of this Act commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine of N250,000 or to a term of one year or both\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Nigeria Press Organisation (NPO), at the public hearing on the bill, the Managing Director of Leadership, Azu Ishekwuene, said it was out of place to consider such a bill without the input of major stakeholders in the industry. Incidentally, apart from the Radio, Television and Theatre Workers Union (RATTAWU), all other stakeholders failed to present a memo before the committee. The Newspaper Proprietors Association of Nigeria (NPAN) said it was not invited to the event. The President of the NUJ, Chris Isiguzo, said the letter of invitation to the union got to the National Secretariat a day before the public hearing. The Committee gave them two additional weeks to make their presentation before the House Committee. The controversial bill and the National Broadcasting Commission amendment bill are sponsored by Hon. Olusegun Odebunmi, who is also chairman of the House Committee on Information.\n\nIshekwuene said: \u201cI am here to represent the Nigeria Press Organisation which represents three groups, the Nigeria Guild of Editors, the Newspaper Proprietors Association of Nigeria and the Nigeria Union of Journalists. Some of these groups are represented here as well, but the NPO is the umbrella organisation. There is a matter pending before the Supreme Court between the NPAN and some parties involved in this bill that is being amended. As stewards of the law, I am sure that you are constrained just as I am, to make any further conversation on this matter because it is a pending matter before the Supreme Court. The last time the matter came up in 2010, it is a matter that has been pending since 1999. When it last came up in 2010, 17 or the 39 clauses contained in the bill you are considering were ruled unconstitutional by the court at that time. Of course, the Federal Government has appealed the ruling, they won the appeal and the matter is currently before the Supreme Court. I would rest my case by appealing to the members of this Committee to refer to a conversation that was had on a similar matter in 2018 when this matter came up before the Senate and the pendency of this matter before the court was canvassed. The 8th Senate at that time agreed that the prudent thing to do was to step it down. I urge this House to also consider a similar step.\u201d\n\nBut Odebunmi said: \u201cConstitutionally, we are doing our own job and I am very sure that no court will restrain us from doing their job. We are not stopping anybody from continuing any process in court. But we have the right, the mandate of Nigerians to amend Nigerian laws and that is exactly what we are doing. It is not about the matter in court, but an act of the National Assembly which we deemed fit to amend and we are doing that. It does not stop you from pursuing whatever you have in court. But this is the position of the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nThe Executive Secretary of the Nigeria Press Council, Francis Nwosu, said the desirability of a Press Council should not be in dispute.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe principal Act also made provisions for conviction of offences and it was an area of contention. Stake holders opposed that provision, saying that the Council did not have the powers of the court. However, for purpose of clarity, Council suggests that the issue of prosecution should be clearly spelt out.\u201d\n\nRATTAWU is more concerned about and licensing of media practitioners and the code ethics. The union said: \u201cNo print media practitioner is licensed in Nigeria. They obtain registration as business venture from the CAC and not the Press Council. This section 1, therefore, is talking about a reality that does not exist and so, should be expunged. Approval of the code should come from the board and not the Minister.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Nigerians kick against proposed social media bill\n\nFormer NUJ President Mallam Sani Zorro said it was unfortunate that the amendment was coming at a very stormy time in the nation\u2019s history. He said: \u201cThis amendment is coming at a very stormy time in the history of Nigeria because of the policy of the government regarding twitter. I believe that dialogue between stakeholders in the media, the Executive arm of government and the legislature would be a better platform for negotiation before amendments are effected. It is also the way out of the litigation now before the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nOn the composition of the board of the council, Zorro, a former member of the House of Representatives, said: \u201cThe board of the Press Council ought to be a Professional Board and not a political board. We can actually copy from the Press Complaint Commission in Great Britain which is the model of the Journalism we practice in Nigeria or many sister African countries to enrich this conversation. In the past, the appointment into the Press Council of an Accountant and actually a dead person did not only truncate the operationalisation of the council, but ridiculed it and was a great embarrassment to all of us. The issue of licensing that the press council is supposed to undertake is one of the issues that are better negotiated because these organisations are primarily business organisations registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission. So, if the Press Council were to withdraw the licenses of newspapers, and other news organisations, I am sure you will agree with that it will be seen as a misnomer.\u201d\n\nA former Executive Secretary of the Nigeria Press Council, Bayo Atoyebi, believes that the provisions contained in the bill would make Nigeria a laughing stock before the international community as it will be seen as a way to muzzling the media.\n\nAtoyebi told the Committee that \u201cthe world over, wrongs by journalists are dealt with not be trial, but ethical review. That is why members of the Council are having experiences in journalism. If you have a wrong, the journalist will appear before their peer and they will tell him where he has gone wrong and the punishment is a warning, a suspension or at the highest level, the name is deleted from the register of members of the NUJ and not imprisonment which some others have described as criminalising Journalism. If you do that, the whole world will scream at you saying Nigeria is muzzling Journalist.\u201d He criticize provisions contained in section 28 of the proposed amendment which seek to collect a percentage of annual income of newspapers, payment of licensing fees and payment of penalties.\n\nHe aligned with the former President of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Mallam Sani Zorro that a negotiated settlement is the only way out with on the issue of code of professional of ethics. He said: \u201cThe contention has always been that those representing the government on the Council of the board should not be more than the stakeholders. Until you take are of this, you will continue to have rejection. Professional code is designed by members of that profession and not by a third party. The code we are talking about I supposed to be used in the context to regulate the industry. That is the code of the NUJ that was declared in 1988 at Ilorin. Incidentally, the NUJ championed a review of that code in 2013 and sponsored by the United Nations Development Fund. The NUJ has signed on to it and it has been passed onto the stakeholders to endorse it. If they do, it is an instrument that the Press Council can use to regulate the print media in Nigeria. Just as Journalists hold all of us accountable, so also can the Press council hold Journalists accountable with the code of ethics\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of a group of civil society groups working in the media space, Executive Director of International Press Centre (IPC), Lanre Arogundade, while regulations are needed especially in this era of fake news and hate speech, such regulations must not erode media independence or freedom and should not unduly punitive. The CSOs are International Press Centre (IPC), Media Rights Agenda (MRA), Centre for Media Law and Advocacy (CMLA) and Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt is in this regard that we are worried that the proposed amendment to the Nigeria Press Council Decree falls far short of these expectations and standards\u201d. He said further that \u201cthe provision of 3 (d) constitutes a potential threat to press freedom and media survival as it does not provide for judicial intervention before highly punitive measures are handed down by the council and indeed could be used as a political weapon against the media. Also, the provisions of section violates section 39 of the constitution, while the penalties for offences as stipulated in 3 (3) i & ii including fine of five million Naira or three years imprisonment are too punitive and will constitute threat to media independence and freedom. The provision of 21 subsection 5 (a) as proposed for amendment is such that a journalist can be punished by the Council even after he/she might have been found guilty by a court of law and without the Council going back to the court to report continued infringement.\u201d\n\nHe argued that the provisions of section 33 (3) and (4) of the law does not give room for retraction or apology where a fake news is mistakenly published but recommends a blanket sanction of up to ten million naira or closure for a period of one year or both.\u201d",

          "text": "By Aliyu Sulaiman\n\nSIR: The \u2018bromance\u2019 between Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara with his APC counterparts has been glaring over the past months and it was only a matter of time before he would decamp to APC. This same scenario goes for governors Ben Ayade and Dave Umahi of Cross-River and Ebonyi states respectively. Governor Umahi even claims that other governors are on their way to joining the ruling party. The ruling party is having the time of its life, it would seem. This also makes for a safe prediction that APC will be the party to beat in 2023.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut then, it is also obvious that there will be less available front row seats, and when push comes to shove, we would have ourselves another recipe for disaster. Some heavy-weights within the party would cease to be so, and as such would be yanked off the food cycle. It is only natural. This is not progress, certainly not in the nation\u2019s interest. This constant needless cycle has and will distract us from the task at hand ab initio, which is nation-building and all the fundamental issues therein.\n\nThe year 2021, like the previous years of 2017 and 2013 has one thing in common; Politicians, mostly state governors making calculations, forecasts, reviewing their allegiance and associations in time for the forthcoming electoral cycles. In Nigeria, it is always certain that there will be some form of block-buster decamping from one party to another. This is preceded usually by some \u2018in-party crises and rumblings. This is okay, obviously, because the law allows for freedom of association, and by extension, freedom to change political parties for whatever reason. But is this healthy for a relatively young democracy in a developing country? I remember reading somewhere and agreeing that many politicians in Nigeria do not see beyond the upcoming election cycle.\n\nOne could argue whether this administration is doing its best, and succeeding in its quest to secure the country, and navigate the economy from recession. But it is true, and even the administration itself would agree, that a lot still needs to be done, and all these idealess, seemingly selfish movements will in no way help the cause.\n\nPolitical commentators have noted several times that the top two parties, APC and PDP are birds of the same feather and I couldn\u2019t agree less. Apart from the difference in flags and acronyms, it is truly hard to point out any difference when you examine the membership structure, ideologies (not the ones written down), the nature of leadership received and so on. Oh hey, they even have the same national problems\n\nPolitics should be defined by ideology, and if cross-carpeting to another party can be done simply because of an intra-party upheaval, or because there is little or no chance of winning the forth-coming elections within that party, we can safely say that self-centeredness has trumped ideology.\n\nAliyu Sulaiman,\n\nSokoto.",

          "title": "Ndi Igbo stand for one Nigeria",
          "text": "By Fredrick Nwabufo\n\nSIR: The vocal minority will always have their say, but the silent majority will have their way. Nevertheless, it is capricious to let the pesky minority govern and dominate the narrative. A solitary story by a negligible decimal could be held as the belief and view of the bulk. This is why the silent Igbo majority who are opposed to the secession of the southeast from Nigeria need to speak up.\n\nWe cannot discount the perils, ills and concomitants of the civil war. But it has been 51 years since the end of the war, and the Igbo have built back better and stronger. We have people every corner of Nigeria and have made where we settled our home. It is customary to find an Igbo native who can speak Hausa and Yoruba fluently \u2013 even much better than their indigenous tongue.\n\nA united Nigeria remains a viable emporium for the enterprising Igbo.\n\nWith enduring resilience, we have made magic out of the ordinary and turned dust into gold in the places we have settled. Whether in the north or in the south, we dominate commerce. We have forged bonds and made families with host communities. We have crossed bloodlines and have nourished our gene-pool with the rich ancestry of other peoples of Nigeria. We have become aboriginal Nigerians.\n\nIt gladdened me when the Igbo Delegate Assembly said in June that they are opposed to the breakaway of the southeast from Nigeria. The Igbo leaders from the 19 northern states declared that there is a new tribe \u2013 The Northern Igbo. This m\u00e9lange of Igbo whose histories have become intertwined and many others with roots in the south-east and even resident there are in the majority.\n\nReally, there is a new and only tribe \u2013 the aboriginal Nigerian; a cross-genetic breed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThose crusading for the secession of the southeast today are deficient students of history and sociology. Even the late Odumegwu Ojukwu, the captain of the secessionist struggle during the war, regretted that devastating episode in our history. Ojukwu said: \u2018\u2019I don\u2019t think the second war is necessary. We should have learnt from the first one.\u201d\n\nThere is no victory in war; only pain, blood and death. Nobody should provoke another war in Igbo land. Ndi Igbo must not let the vocal minority drown them out. They must speak up and be heard.\n\nWhile the claims of marginalisation by Ndi Igbo cannot be brushed off, Nigeria has not been all grim for the Igbo. The Igbo are perhaps the most financially fortunate of all groups in Nigeria. I recall, under the Jonathan administration, the Igbo ruled the commanding heights of the economy. They peopled strategic places in the government. In fact, the Jonathan administration was passed off as an Igbo government, and rightly so. Indeed, Nigeria has not been all ash and sackcloth for Ndi Igbo.\n\nAnd who says we cannot seek justice and fairness within Nigeria? Operating in a democracy affords us several vehicles to realise whatever we seek \u2013 within the orbit of the constitution. But our pursuit of equity must not come with bloodshed. It must not be at the cost of precious human lives.\n\nI believe many are reluctant to speak up for fear of violence. I have been threatened many times for my views, but my belief in a united Nigeria is stronger than my fear. Should we remain reticent by fit of fear and watch our years of hard work tumble down?

          "text": "From Okey Sampson, Umuahia\n\nOne week after the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami announced the arrest and arraignment of leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), his community, Afara Ukwu, has broken its silence, saying it intends to send a delegation to the Federal Government to dialogue on the release of their son.\n\nThe President General of the community, Chief Ikechukwu Ndubueze who made this known in Umuahia said although the people of Afara Ukwu are sad over the development, but it would opt for dialogue in the matter because it has been a peaceful community.\n\n\u201cThere is no way the community will feel well or okay over the arrest of Nnamdi Kanu; in any case, he is our son. Afara Ukwu is a very peaceful place that has co-habited peacefully with heads of various government agencies in the state. Take for instance, from Nnamdi kanu\u2019s house to the official residence of the Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG) Zone 9, is about three poles.\n\n\u201cThe house of police commissioner of Abia Command is about three poles as well from Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s house. The quarters of the controller of Immigration in Abia is about five poles; the one of Prisons, is about five poles as well and the Abia Government House as about ten poles from his house. Even the Federal High Court Judge, the quarters is about four poles to Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s house and all of them can attest to how peace our community is\u201d, he said.\n\nNdubueze said the community will be meeting this weekend to discuss on the modalities for the dialogue, stressing that it is where that fails they will be looking at other lawful means to get their son out from detention.\n\n\u201cAs at now, inasmuch as I may not know what will be the outcome of the meeting, but I know that the community would like to use peaceful means to look for solution to everything that is happening. I believe the community will go for peaceful means because they have been a peaceful people all these while and they will not change now\u201d.\n\nThe President General did not however rule out the idea of the community going to court if all avenues of dialogue were exhausted.\n\n\u201cThere are some other means which I believe the community can use, like sending delegations to talk with government one on one and all that. The most important thing is that you will go to court when you have exhausted all other peaceful means, you can then resort to court. It is when all of these fail, that we can now think of heading to court. For now, no decision has been taken until we meet.\n\nDespite whatever the Federal Government is saying or anybody may think, Chief Ndubueze does not believe that Nnamdi Kanu has done anything wrong. \u201cCome to think of how the Igbo are being treated, how they are being marginalized in Nigeria, you will agree with me that Nnamdi is making a point. If he is not making a point, he would not have had followers\u201d.\n\nWhile advising the Federal Government to look for a way to dialogue with the various agitation groups in the country, the President General insisted Afara Ukwu community would never abandon their son at this point in time.\n\n\u201cWhat the Federal Government should do is to get all the agitating groups together, because it\u2019s not only Nnamdi Kanu and his group, and talk over some of these things. Now, there is no peace all over Nigeria, banditry, kidnapping and the menace of the Fulani herdsmen, people need to sit down and discuss\u201d.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "\u2022 demands reversal or block IOCs from region\n\nFrom Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe leader of the Pan-Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), Chief Edwin Clark, has described the newly passed Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), ready for harmonization as satanic, unjust, embarrassing, and has dashed the hope of the people of the Niger Delta.\n\nClark, who is also the leader of the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF), condemned the provision and allocation of 30% of profits for further frontier oil exploration in the north and that it was fraudulently added.\n\nClark who was represented at a press conference in Abuja by PANDEF\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Ken Robinson, declared that the region has had enough of the colonial oppression and will be resisting it.\n\nThe two chambers of the National Assembly last week Thursday passed the PIB, after about 13 years of legislative fireworks.\n\nThe bill was first sent to the National Assembly in 2008 by President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, now deceased, without translating into an Act.\n\nThe PIB, 2020 is seeks to introduce far-reaching reforms in the Nigerian oil and gas industry.\n\nClark, in an open letter addressed to the Senate President Ahmad Lawan and Speaker House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila condemned the provision and allocation of 30% of profits for further frontier oil exploration in the north, stressing that the PIB passed does not reflect the long clamour by the people of region for equity, fairness and justice.\n\nHe demanded that the bill as passed be reversed else the Niger Delta will take their destinies in their hands and deny International Oil Companies (IOCs), entry into the region.\n\nAccording to the elder statesman the entire people of the Niger Delta region, for and on behalf of the host communities, vehemently reject the 3% and 5% of operating expenditure granted to the host communities; the fraudulent and provocative 30% provision for the frontier exploration fund.\n\nHe said: \u201cGiven the depth of ingratitude expressed and delivered after decades of exploitation and neglect of the region, the entire people of the Niger Delta region, for and on behalf of the host communities, vehemently reject the following aspects of the bill:\n\n\u201cThe 3% and 5% of Operating Expenditure granted to the Host Communities;\n\nThe fraudulent and provocative 30% provision for the Frontier Exploration Fund.\n\n\u201cAnd now demand: The PIB must be reversed, reviewed and amended to ensure that the Oil-Bearing Communities must now receive not less than 10% of Operating Cost.\n\n\u201cIf this is not done, the Niger Delta people may be forced to take their destiny into their own hands and all IOCs may find themselves denied access to their oil activities in such communities.\u201d\n\nClark said people of the Niger Delta, at all levels both at home and abroad, have expressed their great displeasure over what he called satanic and obnoxious allocation of a paltry percentage of operating expenditure to oil producing communities by the national assembly.\n\n\u201cIt is important to state clearly here to all well-meaning Nigerians that the demand of the oil bearing communities of the Niger Delta Region was for a minimum of 10% equity participation.\n\n\u201cBut you Mr. Senate President, the Right Honourable Speaker and some of your colleagues in the National Assembly, have further shown your disdain to the Niger Delta people by redefining host communities to include pipeline-bearing pathway communities, in which case States where pipelines pass through to aid them with the privilege of cheap supplies of Niger Delta petroleum products could also be entitled to the ridiculous and unacceptable percentages that the legislators are willing to cede to oil-bearing Communities.\n\n\u201cWe want to warn seriously, that the people of the Niger Delta have had enough of this colonial and oppressive mentality of our Northern brothers and friends. Today, the north controls the Oil Sector, even though day-to-day operations are being handled by the International Oil Companies (IOCs) on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe full text of the open letter read thus:\n\nAN OPEN LETTER TO HIS EXCELLENCY, DR AHMAD LAWAN, PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE OF NIGERIA AND RT. HONOURABLE BARR FEMI GBAJABIAMILA, SPEAKER, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, ON THE DEMAND BY THE PEOPLE OF THE NIGER DELTA FOR 10% FOR THE HOST COMMUNITIES IN THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY BILL (PIB).\n\nDATE: 5th JULY, 2021\n\nMy Distinguished President of the Senate and The Rt. Honourable Speaker of the House of Representatives, we have noticed with dismay, anger, disappointment and embarrassment, the oppressive and domineering attitude of most members of the National Assembly (NASS) over the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), now due for imminent harmonization by the National Assembly.\n\nAt the Public Hearings in January 2021, representatives from the Niger Delta continued to insist on the principle of the 10% equity participation. However it seems as if this has continued to fall on deaf ears; from the Press Reports on 2nd July 2021, it seems as if the principle of the Host Communities Trust Fund being funded based upon Operating Expenditure is being proposed by both houses of the National Assembly, much to the disappointment of the Region. We have heard that the House of Representatives have seen fit to increase the percentage from 2.5% to 5% for Upstream Host Communities \u2013 those who are directly impacted by the exploration and production activities of the Oil & Gas operators \u2013 whilst a percentage of 2% would be applied to communities that are host to midstream and downstream infrastructure, such as refineries and pipelines; however, we have also heard that the Senate has only seen fit to set the percentage as 3%.\n\nThe people of the Niger Delta, at all levels both at home and abroad, have expressed their great displeasure over the satanic and obnoxious allocation of a paltry percentage of Operating Expenditure to Oil Producing Communities by the National Assembly. It is important to state clearly here to all well-meaning Nigerians that the demand of the oil bearing communities of the Niger Delta Region was for a minimum of 10% equity participation. But you Mr. Senate President, the Right Honourable Speaker and some of your colleagues in the National Assembly, have further shown your disdain to the Niger Delta people by redefining host communities to include pipeline-bearing pathway communities, in which case States where pipelines pass through to aid them with the privilege of cheap supplies of Niger Delta petroleum products could also be entitled to the ridiculous and unacceptable percentages that the legislators are willing to cede to oil-bearing Communities.\n\nThe long suffering and oppressed people of the oil-bearing communities of the Niger Delta are not surprised at the news that the National Assembly finally passed the PIB, albeit the lofty dreams and vaunted expectations of over two decades of legislative dilly-dally had been dashed. This unhealthy anti-climax is a predictable end as northern Legislators combined with the dilutional efforts of IOCs to pass an unjust piece of legislation to deny our people the benefits of the resources in their region. The kernel of the Bill passed is to deny our people commensurate benefits of the resources of our region while using our natural resources to earn profits for everyone other than the Oil-Bearing Communities in the value chain and increasingly fatten the profits of IOC investors who are miles away from our communities. This also brings to mind some of the assertions by some northerners that while the land belongs to the people of the Niger Delta Region who live on it, whatever is underneath it, belongs to everyone nationally. This negates the principle \u201cQuic quid plantatur solo, soso cedit\u201d which means that something affixed to the land is part of the land; therefore, whoever owns that piece of land will also own the things attached to the land. That is why in Zamfara State, where gold is mined, the land belongs to the State, as does the minerals underneath it. But in the Niger Delta, the same doesn\u2019t seem to apply; the Federal Government has maliciously laid claim to the oil minerals under the land. What double standard! Different rules and laws for different parts of the same country.\n\nThe issue of real local content, that is to say, for Niger Deltans in general and the Host Communities in particular to play a major part in the Oil Industry is something that we consider our inalienable right. In spite of assurances in the past that efforts would be made to prioritise Niger Deltan content, there is very little evidence of it happening in real terms. During the Government of the late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, it was agreed that when the Federal Government divests of its equity in its JVs with the IOCs, that 10% would be given to the Host Communities; however we see no sign of any commitment to this in any of the recent versions of the Petroleum Industry Bill, or any mention of it in any other Government Bill or Policy.\n\nAs part of the Pan Niger-Delta Forum\u2019s (PANDEF) 16 Point Agenda, we demanded inclusive participation in the Oil Industry, covering issues such as the ownership of oil blocks, marginal fields as well as the boards and personnel of parastatals and agencies such as NNPC and its subsidiaries. Sadly we are yet to see any real progress in any of these areas and the latest version of the Petroleum Industry Bill does nothing to address these issues. Instead, in spite of us as the owners of the land wanting to be real equity participants in the Oil Industry, that is to say to be owners, shareholders, directors and senior management in Local Oil Companies, International Oil Companies and Oil Contractors, the concept of Host Communities Trust Fund is being imposed upon us.\n\nOn good authority, we are aware that hours before the Bill was passed, the International Oil Companies (IOCs), convened the Nigerian co-conspirators in hotels that some of us as stakeholders monitored. And these IOCs were doing what they had done over the years to delay and deny host oil-bearing communities of the 10% minimum percentage that they had demanded.\n\nWe want to warn seriously, that the people of the Niger Delta have had enough of this colonial and oppressive mentality of our Northern brothers and friends. Today, the north controls the Oil Sector, even though day-to-day operations are being handled by the International Oil Companies (IOCs) on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\nThe ownership, control, marketing, maintenance, management and the accruable benefits from the operations of the IOCs are in the hands of some Northerners. Appointments to the top most positions in the Oil Companies owned by the Federal Government are in the hands of the North who have at least 25 Managerial appointments, up to the position of Group Managing Director (GMD). And only few of these positions are held by Southerners, and fewer still by the Niger Delta, the home of oil production, an area which produces over 91% of the total oil production, and who are the true owners of these God-given resources, contrary to the bogus and fraudulent claim by some uninformed persons that they own the oil because it was the revenue generated from groundnut that was used to develop the oil industry.\n\nWe emphasise that the Federal Government or the three Regional Governments, namely the Northern Region, the Western Region and the Eastern Region, did not participate in the production of oil when it was first discovered or first struck as far back as 1956, in Oloibiri, in the then Eastern Region, now part of Bayelsa State.\n\nIt will be recalled that in 2009, a member of the House of Representatives, on the floor of the House, arrogantly and provocatively demanded that our people of the Niger Delta who occupy the Oil producing areas, should be relocated by the Federal Government, in order to give free access for oil exploration. It is unimaginable how someone can think of such atrocities against fellow men. Either coincidentally or by design, the Military waged an all-out war on Gbaramatu, an Ijaw clan in Warri Division, where oil and gas are produced in large quantities. Several persons were killed, and villages and towns burnt down, including Oporoza, Okerenkoko and Kurutie, where the Nigeria Maritime University is now located.\n\nAgain, at the 2014 National Conference which was attended by 492 Delegates drawn from the entire federation, where it was earlier resolved to increase the 13% Derivation provided in Section 162 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, to a minimum of 18% instead of the 25% which we demanded for, the same Northern beneficiary raised objections. In order not to truncate the Conference, a committee was set up comprising 50 of us, named \u201cCommittee of 50 Wise men\u201d. That Committee recommended to the Conference that the matter should be referred to Mr. President to take a decision. The Conference took that recommendation.\n\nThe 13% which was entrenched in the Constitution since 1999 as the minimum percentage for derivation, has not been increased by even 1% for the past 22 years because of the oppressive nature and selfishness of those who believe that the country belongs to them, and so should be the only beneficiaries of the oil. Therefore, the status quo should remain.\n\nWe are aware of the lack luster and conservative attitude of Mr. Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan, who is indeed a great obstacle to the smooth running of the country, and to her unity and oneness. We wish to advise him strongly that no one can force other Nigerians to be in the so-called united Nigeria where the citizens are not equal, and where some people do not have opportunity to aspire to positions they are qualified to attain. And where Southern Nigerians who are already in Service are being replaced by Northerners, even when some of the Northerners are being called back from retirement.\n\nAt this juncture, I wish to reproduce some extracts from a letter, dated 9th September 2005; a letter I addressed to our revered former President and my friend, His Excellency, late Alhaji Shehu Shagari, in reply to a letter he wrote to me after we staged a walk-out from the National Conference in 2005, where he wanted to build bridges between the South-South and the North. In that letter, I categorized the contributions of each region to the economy of Nigeria:\n\nYour Excellency,\n\nRe: Bridge Building\n\nI received with great honour, your invitation letter requesting me to attend a meeting at your suite at Hilton, Abuja, on Tuesday, 20 September 2005. Your letter is indeed a clear demonstration of your statesmanship as a nation builder. I salute you.\n\nAfter due consultation with prominent leaders of the South South and some delegates to the National Political Reform Conference, NPRC, both at home and abroad, I have decided to reply to your invitation\u2026\u2026.\n\n\u2026It is true that the South South delegation under my leadership, made every attempt at the conference to see that the disagreements were settled amicably in the best interest of the nation\u2026.\n\n\u2026On our part, we have resolved that anything short of 25% in the interim and graduating to 50% in 5 years is unacceptable to us and we have therefore decided to take our destiny in our own hands and it is also our resolve that we believe in the unity of Nigeria based on equality, justice, fair play, and equity. At this juncture, it may be necessary to brief your Excellency or restate our position when we declared at the conference that \u201cwe are going home\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe wish to note that in the course of deliberations throughout the Conference, we have always bent over backwards to accommodate the fears expressed by opinions contrary to ours, no matter how unfounded, all in our quest to promote unity, peace, and stability, and in our resolve to continue to be our brothers\u2019 keeper. We came to the conference, believing it to be an opportunity to design a new federal paradigm, and to construct a viable democracy from the militarised wreckage of our well thought out federal system based on the wisdom of our founding fathers. Regrettably, that hope is forlorn. We came with mandate of our people to demand for 100% resource control. We conceded that demand to merely accepting 25% in the interim, which is being denied. Therefore, we can no longer participate in the proceedings of the conference.\n\nWe are going home,\n\nBut before leaving, we wish to restate our position for the avoidance of doubt the 1960 and 1963 constitutions of the Federal Republic of Nigeria made provisions for the Regions to retain 50% of all accruable income from their natural resources. The Regions contributed 20% to the Federal Government and 30% to the Distributed Pool. With the incursion of the military into politics in 1966, the Fedral Military Government unilaterally sliced the regional share of derivation, claiming that it needed funds to enabled it prosecute the Civil War successfully. Consequently, the derivation percentage was reduced to 45% in 1970. in 1971, soon after the Civil War, the Federal Government Introduced a dichotomy into the management of onshore/offshore oil revenue and appropriated to itself 100% from offshore earnings until 1992 when the dichotomy was abolished, only to be reintroduced in April, 2002, following the notorious Supreme Court judgment. Onshore earnings were progressively sliced to 20% in 1975, 0% (zero percent) in 1979, 2% in 1982, 1.5% in 1984. 3% in 1992. It was not until the 1994/95 Constitutional Conference that the derivation percentage was raised to 13%, the implementation of which commenced in 2001.\n\nApart from the above injustice from federal allocations, comparative revenue generation profile from the six zones is a demonstrative evidence of disequilibrium between contribution and allocation in which the people of the Niger Delta have been perpetual victims.

A plausible case could be made for the forfeiture of revenue which would otherwise have accrued to the Niger Delta states during those war years and immediately after. Definitely, the exigencies of the Civil War should not be a permanent feature in the organization of our political economy. This is why we have been resolute in pursuing the reorganization of our fiscal federalism, the aim being to diversify our national economic base thereby facilitating speedy national development.\n\nIt is on the basis of the foregoing that:\n\nWe maintain our irreducible minimum of 50% derivation;\n\nWe conceded in the interim, 25% derivation with a graduated Increase to 50% over a period of five years; and\u2026\u2026\n\n\u2026We wish to use this opportunity to salute all Delegates who share with us the urgent need to lay a new foundation for a viable federal political economy and democratic practice in our country. It is, however, unfortunate as it is embarrassing that some conservative and self-conceited Delegates in the Conference are determined to frustrate the laudable objectives of the Conference.\n\nConscious of our experience as an oppressed people within the Nigerian state, and having regard to the reckless pollution, degradation and desecration of our environment through four decades of oil and gas exploration and exploitation, we the Delegates from the South-South, irrevocably committed to the unity of a Nigeria founded on justice, equity and fair play and the pursuit of the collective welfare of our people, hereby reject any further internal colonial arrangements and declare as follows:\n\n1. That all-natural resources found in any territory belong to the owners of that territory including the continental shelf which is a natural prolongation of the coastal states as recognized by the Independence Constitution of 1960, the Republican Constitution, 1963 and in international law;\n\n2. Any law or policy that contradicts the above is unjust, inequitable, unfair, and unacceptable;\u2026\n\n\u2026You can therefore imagine my enthusiasm for such a meeting conveyed by you that we must be cautious and careful that proper arrangement and agenda is worked by both parties for the meeting to be successful since these issues of special relationship which we laboriously canvassed at the confab did not stop or prevent the misunderstanding at the confab\u2026.\n\n\u2026I deeply regret and apologise for the length of my letter.\n\nYours Sincerely\n\nChief Dr. E.K. Clark OFR Leader of the South-South delegation to the NPRC\n\nN.B. A copy of this letter will be sent to all the 6 Governors of the South South zone and the delegates and other leaders of the South-South.\u201d\n\nFunding of the Frontier Exploration Fund\n\nMeanwhile, an additional 30% has been awarded to the Funding of the Exploration of Frontier Basins (Frontier Exploration Fund). The newly proposed Upstream Regulator, the Commission, has a number of responsibilities with respect to what is referred to as \u201cFrontier Basins\u201d, especially with respect to their exploration. The proposed bill goes on to state that the Commission may request the services of the commercialised National Oil Company, NNPC Limited, to drill or test prospects and leads where no commercial entity has publicly expressed an intention to do the same. The bill puts the responsibility for the definition of frontier basins within the remit of regulation issued by the Commission and goes on to propose the establishment of a Frontier Exploration Fund as a means of funding the exploration of these Frontier Basins.\n\nIt is not clear to us where these Frontier Basins currently reside. We the people of the Niger Delta would be more than happy were all the regions of Nigeria to be oil producing; however, we must be careful to use the resources put at our disposal as judiciously as possible. Rather than using our Country\u2019s funds to exploit its existing resources, we are using our scarce funds on exploring for oil in the North, an exercise that many industry stakeholders have described as \u201cwasteful\u201d, others have labelled \u201ca wild goose chase\u201d and \u201ca purely political exploration\u201d.\n\nSo the recommendation made by the Ad-Hoc Committee that the funding to the Frontier Exploration Fund, which previously had been based upon 10% of rents on Petroleum Prospecting Licenses and Petroleum Mining Leases should be augmented by an additional 30% from the newly commercialised \u201cNNPC Limited\u2019s profit oil and profit gas as in the production sharing, profit sharing and Risk service contracts\u201d took us entirely by surprise. It is not clear where this recommendation came from; those of our representatives that attended the Public Hearings do not recall hearing any request for additional funding for the Frontier Exploration Fund from any industry stakeholder. Therefore we totally condemn it, not only the concept itself but also the means via which it was smuggled into the Bill.\n\nConclusion:\n\nGiven the depth of ingratitude expressed and delivered after decades of exploitation and neglect of the region, the entire people of the Niger Delta region, for and on behalf of the host communities, vehemently reject the following aspects of the bill:\n\nThe 3% and 5% of Operating Expenditure granted to the Host Communities;\n\nThe fraudulent and provocative 30% provision for the Frontier Exploration Fund\n\nAnd now demand:\n\nThe PIB must be reversed, reviewed and amended to ensure that the Oil-Bearing Communities must now receive not less than 10% of Operating Cost.\n\nIf this is not done, the Niger Delta people may be forced to take their destiny into their own hands and all IOCs may find themselves denied access to their oil activities in such communities.\n\nSigned\n\nChief (Dr) Edwin Kiagbodo Clark OFR, CON\n\nNational Leader PANDEF, National Leader South-South Region\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "*Draft electoral bill mandates INEC, security officials to take oaths of neutrality, loyalty\n\n*To swear not to accept bribe\n\n*Party member that seeks appointment into INEC risks jail term\n\n*Nomination of unqualified candidate attracts N10m fine\n\nChuks Okocha and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nConcerns mounted yesterday over what social critics called attempts by federal legislators to rig the 2023 general election ahead of time through the manipulation of the Electoral Amendment Bill 2021.\n\nMany critics who spoke to THISDAY pointed specifically at Section 50 (2) of the draft bill, whose consideration begins tomorrow at the National Assembly, which bars electronic transmission of results.\n\nIn fact, about 22 Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) have raised the alarm over the alleged plan by the National Assembly to pass the bill without the inclusion of the electronic collation of results in the bill.\n\nThe critics argued that since President Muhammadu Buhari would not be in contention, the lawmakers are working to the answer for their own selfish purpose, calling on Nigerians to resist them.\n\nThe CSOs in a statement yesterday said the manipulation of Section 50(2) undermined the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC)\u2019s efforts to improve the election results management regime.\n\nThe CSOs also expressed concern over the increase in spending limits for presidential candidates and others, saying it is an indication that the National Assembly is committed to entrenching a political system that is heavily monetised.\n\nThey called on the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, and House of Representatives Speaker, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, to speak up clearly that they are not aware of these amendments and are not part of any attempt to subvert the voices of Nigerians.\n\nThe CSOs urged Nigerians to stand up to resist the attempt by the National Assembly to manipulate the Electoral Act for self-perpetuation and self-interest, adding that they will continue to make the contact information of lawmakers available so that Nigerians can engage their representatives directly.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cEveryone may be aware that the National Assembly will pass the Electoral Amendment Bill (2021) this week. Barring any last-minute changes, the bill is expected to be passed by both chambers on Thursday. Some proposals canvassed by citizens were adopted in the bill e.g. electronic voting, financial independence of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and new timelines for submission of list of candidates.\n\n\u201cHowever, there are discrepancies between the approved version of the bill and the alleged final copy, where some key provisions have been manipulated.\n\n\u201cIn the alleged final copy, some key priority amendments were rejected by the leadership of the National Assembly, e.g. electronic transmission of results has been prohibited (S.50(2)) and the limits on campaign expenses have been increased (S.88).\n\n\u201cFollowing, the events of the 2019 general elections, we are convinced that INEC needs to have this power in order to prevent politicians from going through the backdoor to win the election and steal electoral mandate at gunpoint!\u201d\n\nThe CSOs include, Centres for Liberty, Electoral Hub, Yiaga Africa, Raising New Voices, Ready to Lead

provides that all officials of INEC and security agencies on election duties must swear oaths of neutrality and loyalty before they are sent out to carry out such assignments.\n\nAccording to the bill, any person who violates the provision commits an offence punishable under Section 120 of the bill.\n\nAlso, the harmonised bill specified that a member of a political party that presents himself for employment into the commission risks a two-year jail term or a fine of N5 million or both.\n\nAlso, the new draft bill provides that the deployment of security officials for election duties must be at the instance of INEC.\n\nAccording to Section 26 (1) of the harmonised draft bill sighted by THISDAY, \u201cAll staff, electoral officers, presiding officers, returning officers and security officials taking part in the conduct of an election shall affirm or swear to an oath of loyalty and neutrality as in the Second Schedule, indicating that they will not accept bribes or gratification from any person, and shall perform their functions and duties impartially and in the interest of the Federal Republic of Nigeria without fear or favour.\n\n\u201c(2) Any person who violates subsection (1), commits an offence and is punishable under Section 120 (dereliction of duty).\n\nAlso, Section 27 (1) states: \u201cThe commission shall for the purposes of an election or registration of voters under this bill, appoint and designate such officers as may be required provided that no person who is a member of a political party or who has openly expressed support for any candidate shall be so appointed.\u201d\n\nThe draft legislation also provides that the officers appointed under subsection (1) shall exercise such functions and duties as may be specified by the commission, in accordance with the provisions of this bill, and shall not be subject to the direction or control of any person or authority other than the commission in the performance of their functions and duties.\n\nAccording to the bill, the commission shall be responsible for requesting for the deployment of relevant security personnel necessary for elections or registration of voters and shall assign them in the manner determined by the commission in consultation with the relevant security agencies.\n\nThe bill also stipulates that the commission shall only request for the deployment of the Nigerian Armed Forces for securing the distribution and delivery of election materials and protection of election officials.\n\nThe draft bill said: \u201cA person who, being a member of a political party, misrepresents himself by not disclosing his membership, affiliation, or connection to any political party in order to secure an appointment with the commission in any capacity commits an offence and is liable on conviction, to a fine of N5, 000,000 or imprisonment for a term not more than two years or both.\u201d\n\nThe harmonised draft electoral bill also stipulates that the commission shall, within 60 days after each year, make available to every political party the names and addresses of each person registered during that year.\n\nIt said when a general election is notified by the commission under section 28 of the bill, the current official register of voters certified by the commission in accordance with the provisions of the law shall be the official voters\u2019 register for those elections.\n\nIn the case of every by-election conducted under the bill, it prescribes that the official voters\u2019 register for use at such elections shall be the current register relating to the senatorial district or the constituency concerned.\n\nThe draft bill said the results of all the elections should be announced by the (a)presiding officer at the polling unit; (b) ward collation officer at the registration area or ward collation centre; (c) local government or area council collation officer at the local government or area council collation centre; (d) state collation officer at the state collation centre.\n\nOn how to announce election results, the bill provides that \u201cthe returning officer shall announce the result and declare the winner of the election at (a) registration area or ward collation centre in the case of councillorship election in the Federal Capital Territory; (b) area council collation centre in the case of chairmanship and vice chairmanship election in the Federal Capital Territory; (c) state constituency collation centre in the case of State House of Assembly election;\n\n22(d) federal constituency collation centre in the case of election to the House of Representatives; (e) senatorial district collation centre in the case of election to the Senate; (f) state collation centre in the case of election of a governor of a state; (g) state collation centre in the case of a presidential election; and (h) national collation centre in the case of election of the president, (3) the chief electoral commissioner shall be the returning officer at the presidential election.\u201d\n\nOn the commencement of elections, the harmonised draft electoral bill also provides that \u201cthe commission shall not later than 360 days before the day appointed for holding of an election under the bill, publish a notice in each state of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory- stating the date of the election; and appointing the place at which nomination papers are to be delivered.\n\nIt said the notice shall be published in each constituency in respect of which an election is to be held, adding that in the case of a by-election, the commission shall, not later than 14 days before the date appointed for the election, publish a notice stating the date of the election.\n\n\u201cThere shall not be substitution of candidates in a by-election except where a candidate of a political party in a by-election dies, the party shall submit to the commission the name of its substitute candidate within seven days of the death of the candidate in the form prescribed by the commission,\u201d it says.\n\nThe new bill also provides that \u201cevery political party shall, not later than 180 days before the date appointed for the general election under the bill, submit to the commission, in the prescribed forms, the list of the candidates the party proposes to sponsor at the elections, who must have emerged from valid primaries conducted by the political party.\u201d\n\nIt adds: \u201cThe commission shall, within seven days of the receipt of the personal particulars of the candidate, publish same in the constituency where the candidate intends to contest the election.\n\n\u201cAny person may apply to the commission for a copy of the nomination form, affidavit and any other document submitted by a candidate at an election and the commission shall, upon payment of a prescribed fee, issue such person with a certified copy of the document within 14 days.\u201d\n\nIt further provides: \u201cAny aspirant who participated in the primaries of his political party who has reasonable grounds to believe that any information given by his political party\u2019s candidate in the affidavit or any document submitted by that candidate in relation to his constitutional requirements to contest the election is false, may file a suit at the Federal High Court against that candidate seeking a declaration that the information contained in the affidavit is false.\u201d\n\nThe draft electoral bill provides that \u201cwhere the court determines that any of the information contained in the affidavit is false only as it relates to constitutional requirements of eligibility, the court shall issue an order disqualifying the candidate and the sponsoring political party and then declare the candidate with the second-highest number notice of election.\u201d\n\nThe bill further provides that \u201ca political party which presents to the commission the name of a candidate who does not meet the qualification stipulated in this section, commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine of N10,000,000.\u201d\n\nThe bill says: \u201cA political party shall not be allowed to change or substitute its candidate whose name has been submitted pursuant to Section 29 of this bill, except in the case of death or withdrawal by the candidate, provided that in the case of such withdrawal or death of a candidate, the political party affected shall, within 14 days of the occurrence of the event, hold a fresh primary election to produce and submit a

          "text": "Adibe Emenyonu in Benin City, Okon Bassey in Uyo, Sylvester Idowu in Warri, Emmanuel Ugwu-Ogo in Umuahia, and James Sowole in Akure\n\nGroups from oil-bearing communities in Abia, Delta, Edo and Ondo states have demanded an upward review of the three per cent host communities\u2019 fund approved in the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), which was passed last Thursday by the National Assembly.\n\nClause 240 of the draft bill had proposed five per cent of the annual profit of the oil companies for host communities.\n\nBut shortly before passage, senators reduced the trust fund for host communities to three per cent.\n\nBut in an interview with THISDAY at the weekend, the President-General of Urhobo Progress Union (UPU), Worldwide, Chief Moses Taiga, called for an objective, realistic and patriotic review of the fund to 10 per cent.\n\nHe, however, stated that despite any shortcomings that may be observed, the PIB as passed is a good and practical starting point towards changing the administrative, regulatory and fiscal framework of the nation\u2019s oil and gas industry.\n\nTaiga commended senators and members of the House of Representatives from the Niger Delta for their roles in ensuring the passage of the PIB.\n\nSecretary of Warri Consultative Forum (WCF), Mr. Amaechi Ogbonna, warned that the three per cent equity approved by the National Assembly for host communities could instigate inter-communal crisis in the Niger Delta region.\n\nOgbonna, an Itsekiri stakeholder, told THISDAY that the three per cent was not the solution to the underdevelopment in the host communities.\n\nAlso, a retired Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) and community leader in Akwa Ibom State, Udom Udo Ekpoudom, told THISDAY that the National Assembly was not fair to the oil-rich Niger Delta region over the PIB.\n\nHe wondered what the National Assembly members from the region were doing to allow only three per cent of the 15 per cent originally allotted to host communities, adding that the National Assembly members from the area have failed their people.\n\nHe urged that the three per cent be reviewed upwards for the sake of peace and justice for the host communities.\n\nHe said: \u201dIf you are from the area affected, you can\u2019t be happy. If you go to a place like Rivers State, you can\u2019t wash your clothes and keep outside because within one hour, it becomes charcoal and they went and approved only three per cent.\n\n\u201dAs such, nobody from the Niger Delta, including myself is happy. The only solution is that the National Assembly should adjust it and make it meaningful. They shouldn\u2019t take us for a ride.\n\n\u201dThey can\u2019t take our oil resources and develop their places and give us a paltry three per cent. It is not fair.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Abia State Oil Producing Areas Development Commission (ASOPADEC) has condemned the approval of what it described as a mere three per cent in the PIB, saying that it has fallen short of expectations.\n\nThe Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the Commission, Mr. Ikechukwu Onwuegbu, said it was a sad development that PIB failed to meet the expectations of oil-bearing communities.\n\n\u201cIt is a bad omen for the oil communities that have been clamouring for a sense of belonging. We are not happy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe wondered why the lawmakers could not accept the 15 per cent increment recommended by the committee but rather settled for three per cent.\n\nAccording to him, the federal lawmakers were insensitive to the plight of oil communities by giving them three per cent while providing 30 per cent for frontier states whereas the reverse should have been the case.\n\nPresident of Benin Solidarity Movement (BSM), Mr. Curtis Ugbo, described the three per cent as grossly inadequate going by the sufferings host communities go through because of exploration and exploitation.\n\nHe said: \u201cHow can you be producing something and someone else who does not have such resources is the one sharing it for you?\u201d\n\nHe blamed Southern leaders for such abnormality, noting that they should instead be asking for the lion\u2019s share of their natural resources.\n\nCivil Rights Activist and President, One Love Foundation, Benin, Mr. Patrick Eholor, described the three per cent stake as unreasonable, adding that it is a ploy to shortchange the goose that lays the golden egg.\n\nEholor, from Ikpoba-Okha, one of the oil-bearing local government areas and host communities, blamed the representatives of the region in the National Assembly for the reduction in the percentage of the trust fund for the host communities.\n\nIn Ondo State, the stakeholders in the oil-producing areas described the three per cent as inadequate and unacceptable.\n\nThey said the approved percentage fell short of their expectations as discussed during stakeholders\u2019 meeting in Ilaje, Ondo State.\n\nA former Chairman of the Ilaje Regional Development Committee (IRDC) that is operating Global Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) of NNPC/Chevron Joint Venture, Prince Philemon Ebiessuwa, said the communities were disappointed by the approved percentage.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen the committee came to Ilaje for stakeholders\u2019 meeting, we unanimously presented our position that the host communities should be given five per cent and that was what we stood on.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed that the Senate passed the bill proposing three per cent to the host communities in spite of the degradation and lack of development in the oil-producing areas.\u201d\n\nImmediate past Chairman of the Ondo State Oil Producing Areas Development Commission (OSOPADEC), Mr. Gbenga Edema, described the three per cent as unfair.\n\n\u201cThey have given about 30 per cent to NNPC for oil exploration in the North, which is another venture nobody is sure of returns. So, the three per cent is inadequate,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A United States District Court in Maryland has ordered the founder of the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, Dr Daniel Olukoya, to pay $7,320 within 30 days as part of sanctions in the suit he entered against human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, alleging defamatory publications.\n\nThe court, in a ruling by US Magistrate Judge, Timothy Sullivan, and obtained by SaharaReporters, titled, \u201cDKT 75 Order re \u2013 Motion for Sanctions 18-cv-02922,\u201d added that Olukoya was also \u201cprohibited from (1) making any use of any documents related to the U.K. Charity Commission that he produced to the Defendants after January 2, 2021; and from (2) challenging the admissibility of these documents on any basis.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters had published stories involving Olukoya in September 2017 when some church members in Maryland accused him of importing religious books without paying customs duties.\n\nIt had been revealed that the church dragged some of its former pastors and members to court over monetary and property disputes.\n\nThe sued pastor and former church members had, in turn, accused the General Overseer of engaging in fraudulent activities in the US, including evasion of duties owed to US authorities.\n\nIn an action filed in the Circuit Court for Prince Georges\u2019 County of Maryland, U.S.A., (Case No. CAL16-26532) on behalf of Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries International, Lagos, and Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, USA, Nevada, the church had sought declaratory judgment and damages against Pastors Lawrence Adetunji, Ronke Adetunji, and 11 former members of Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, Bowie, Maryland. See Also Corruption Mountain Of Fire Ministries General Overseer, Olukoya, Threatens SaharaReporters With Fresh Lawsuits In Attempt To Stop Further Reports On UK Charity Commission Scandal\n\nAlso joined in the suit had been the Christ the Truth Ministry, the successor of MFM Bowie.\n\nAt issue are real property described as 5506 and 5503 Church Road in Bowie, Maryland, which were acquired by MFM Bowie in 2001 and 2004, respectively. Also in contention are funds for the MFM building in Bowie.\n\nIn October 2018, Olukoya and the church had instituted a court action at the US District Court for the District of Maryland against Sowore and Sahara Reporters Media Inc. in a suitcase number, 8:18-cv-02922, which Judge Theodore D. Chuang then heard.

During discovery, the Defendants sought information related to the U.K. Charity Commission\u2019s investigation of Olukoya\u2019s church. ECF No. 72 at 1-2. When Olukoya failed to provide the requested discovery, the Defendants filed a motion to compel (ECF No. 55). Among the discovery requests at issue was a request for \u201c[a]ll documents relating to proceedings before the U.K. Charity Commission related to Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries International.\u201d ECF No. 55-3 at 13.\n\n\u201cIn response to the motion to compel, Olukoya stated that he had responded to the discovery requests and that the motion to compel was therefore moot. ECF No. 59. Thereafter, the court held a telephone conference to address a related dispute (whether Olukoya would be required to produce discovery responses directed to a party whose claims had been dismissed), but otherwise treated the Defendants\u2019 motion to compel as moot.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Olukoya\u2019s response to the motion to compel contained a serious misrepresentation; he had not produced any \u201cdocuments relating to proceedings before the U.K. Charity Commission related to Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries International.\u201d See ECF No. 68 at 5 (noting that Olukoya produced no documents responsive to this request). And at 1 Judge Chuang referred this case to me for all discovery and related scheduling matters. ECF No. 57. 2 Other claims that Olukoya brought against the Defendants have been dismissed. ECF No. 26. Olukoya\u2019s deposition, which was held on April 23, 2021, Olukoya testified that there were \u201ctons and tons of documents in [his] possession\u201d that relate to the inquiry by the U.K. Charity Commission. ECF No. 72-8 at 34.\u201d\n\nThe magistrate added that the defendants, therefore, sought sanctions against Olukoya for his failure to produce the requested documents relating to proceedings before the U.K. Charity Commission.\n\nThe magistrate said, \u201cThe conclusion is that; for the reasons set forth above, the Defendants\u2019 Motion for Sanctions will be granted in part and denied in part. The court will enter the following sanctions against the Defendants: Olukoya is prohibited from (1) making any use of any documents related to the U.K. Charity Commission that he produced to the Defendants after January 2, 2021; and from (2) challenging the admissibility of these documents on any basis other than Fed. R. Evid. 401 and 403.\n\n\u201cOlukoya will also be required to pay the Defendants\u2019 reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred in connection with his discovery failures, which total $7,320.00, within 30 days of the date of this Order. Payment should be made directly to the Defendants\u2019 attorneys. These sanctions are entered against Olukoya pursuant to Rules 37(c) and 26(g).\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in the response of Olukoya\u2019s legal team to the court, it already admitted that the said online publications did not lead to any harm for the church.\n\nThe court papers obtained by SaharaReporters said, \u201cDefendant Omoyele Sowore\u2019s Request for Admissions.

Nyesom Wike of colluding with the enemies and facilitating the betrayal and abduction of our leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in Kenya.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, wish to dissociate from the fake statement being peddled by agents of confusion. Our Publicity Secretary never at any time linked Senator Ifeanyi Uba or Governor Wike with the wicked betrayal of our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. If they were involved in the dirty deal, our investigations into the matter will reveal it.\n\n\u201cBut for now, we have no evidence to link them with the atrocity. IPOB does not act based on speculation or rumour. Our assertions are evidence-based and products on credible intelligence,\u201d part of the statement said.\n\nThe group\u2019s spokesman, also insisted, that the \"treacherous acts\" that led to the arrest of his boss were facilitated by Kenyan government, adding that Uba\u2019s political enemies should not use Kanu\u2019s predicament against the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in Anambra State.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, warn unscrupulous elements and 'One chance politicians' using the name of IPOB's Media and Publicity Secretary to dish out a fake press statement to stop such criminality immediately.\n\n\u201cThose behind this evil should know that we will unravel their identity. They can't hide for too long. They will incur the unmitigated wrath of IPOB if they don't stop this nonsense.\n\n\u201cFor the benefit doubt, IPOB has only linked the betrayal and abduction of our leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu to President Uhuru Kenyetta of Kenya, Nigeria's Ambassador to Kenya, Kenyan's Ambassador to Nigeria, Willfred Machage and the Nigerian Government. Other collaborators in this heinous crime will be made public based on incontrovertible evidence.\n\n\u201cBut for now, we restate that Senator Ifeanyi Uba has not been found to have any hand in it. His political opponents should try other ways of settling scores with him and leave IPOB and our leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu out of it. We must trace those behind this and they will regret their action for dragging IPOB into the zoo's politics and for impersonation.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, urge members of the public to disregard the said fake press release and shun any purported statement from IPOB that is not from a credible source or our usual channels,\u201d Powerful added in the statement.",

          "title": "Tolu Michaels on how digital entrepreneurs create and sell intangible products online",
          "text": "In 2021, when you think of how best to serve people beyond physical borders, the internet comes to mind.\n\nBuilding a business on the internet could play out in two different ways. Your business can either deal with offering physical products for sale online or providing a service online. The former would be tangible while the latter would have no physical form whatsoever.\n\nTolu Michael chose to provide a service \u2013 a digital product \u2013 where she guides people on how to establish personal reputation using the internet. She\u2019s helping them gain visibility online. I had an interesting chat with her on what it\u2019s like creating services and selling to tens of thousands of people online from the comfort of her home in Lagos, Nigeria. But before we dive in, let\u2019s take a stroll through her career journey.\n\nA digital entrepreneur with an engineering background\n\nAfter studying mechanical engineering in Nigeria- something she did because of her love for cars \u2013 she took a detour into the world of investment banking. This happened after she interned at a Toyota after-sales franchise for a while and realised she didn\u2019t want to deal with the smell of petrol and engine oil every day.\n\nSomewhere in her career journey, marriage happened and she had to move cities but during that process, she lost her job so she had to rethink her career path. As a woman, changing jobs alongside starting a new family came with startling challenges.\n\nMichaels\u2019 initial obstacle being a newly wedded woman is not exactly a peculiar one. In a lot of family situations, prioritizing family over work is the number one barrier to a woman\u2019s career. This study by Harvard Business School says more than half of Gen X and Baby Boomer men expected that their careers would take priority over their partners. In the study, \u201c73 percent of men and 85 percent of women agreed that prioritizing family over work is the most difficult career decision women face.\n\nFor Michaels, being newly married came with lots of \u201cspecific rejections,\u201d where employers assume she might get carried away with building a family and leave her job to suffer. At this point, searching for new job opportunities proved abortive so she figured she could try out something on her own and that just happened to be digital entrepreneurship.\n\n\u201cInitially, I started to ask myself, what do I have to offer people, especially beyond borders, because I couldn\u2019t do something physical. I didn\u2019t have the capital to sell physical products so I needed something I could provide people in whatever location I am,\u201d she tells me on our Google Meet call.\n\nLeveraging knowledge commerce\n\nDigital products are basically online products that can\u2019t be held, touched, or tasted. They could be music, videos, ebooks, online courses or even this article you are reading. They are only created and delivered electronically.\n\nTo generate revenue, a digital entrepreneur builds their platform through personal branding, this is particularly pertinent to gain visibility and influence more sales\n\nPersonal branding is all about positioning, Michaels tells me. \u201cYou don\u2019t even need to have a very large audience, all you need is to position yourself as a valuable expert and leader. This will allow the right people and the right opportunities to be attracted to you.\u201d\n\nIn the initial stage of her digital career, Michaels picked up new skills including a degree on Disruptive Strategy from Harvard Business school. She had also helped a few friends build their personal brands so it was about time to enlarge her area of reach.\n\nFirst, she buffed up her social media presence, which she says is a major part of \u201cpositioning.\u201d Social media is free to use but to gain followers or reach a larger audience, one needs to put in the work. She got her \u201cfirst-ever client from outside her circle of friends\u201d from Instagram. One would think LinkedIn could have been at the forefront of this process but, she says, in selling digital products, entrepreneurs should have their profiles on all social media platforms and utilise each platform fully.\n\nFrom getting her first international client to building a personal platform that has trained over 20,000 people in over 12 countries of the world, what Michaels really does is teach modern entrepreneurs how \u201cto build purposeful and profitable personal brands, so that they can stand out of the crowd and sell impactful products.\u201d\n\nShe does this through branding, online courses, consultations, podcasting and through her book, Show Up. For her, work revolves around helping people get the clarity and confidence to show up online, communicate their values, and create a bigger impact with their work. How she sells is mostly by referrals from people she\u2019s worked with in the past.\n\nFor some digital entrepreneurs, online sales only provide supplementary income in addition to their main jobs but for people like her, it is a full-time job that is earning her a living.\n\nWhen Michaels made her first 1000 dollars just from putting her thoughts together and selling to her audience, she became an ardent digital product creator. What is even more important to her is positioning herself not as someone whose products are for an African audience alone but for an untapped global market.\n\nAs one who speaks candidly about juggling motherhood, selling digital products is not just helping her create impact and make money while at it, it is also enabling her to work mostly from the comfort of her home, close to her daughter.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Product partnership managers are obsessed with a product\u2019s life cycle",
          "text": "Product and partnership managers are a nascent breed of individuals who act as a bridge between external partners and their companies. While product managers are responsible for hand holding a product from conception to maturity, product and partnership managers go a step further by exposing the product to valuable collaborations.\n\nI am bringing Tide Ayeni to Centre Stage because he understands the fundamentals of building partnerships into existing products. In his role as product and partnership manager at Indicina, he is responsible for driving growth through setting up successful partnerships and working with them to launch consumer credit products.\n\nWhat is your favourite part of a product life cycle?\n\nFor people who don\u2019t know, the life cycle of a product is broken into four parts: introduction (birth), growth, maturity, and decline (or death). My favourite part has to be the growth of a product. I\u2019m obsessed with numbers \u2014 as should every product and partnership manager.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, the maturity part is great because you can kind of kick back and watch your product make money. But the growth stage keeps you on your toes.\n\nSay more, please\n\nOur tech ecosystem is designed to promote collaboration and partnership. Can you grow your product successfully without partnering with a bigger company, yes. Is that method sustainable? No. Why? Because you will end up putting you and your product into a box. If you want your product to go farther than its birthplace, you need to get creative with your partnerships. Some partners can help you figure out marketing strategies and campaigns; other collaborators can help you aggressively penetrate a new market.\n\nIn your years of experience working as a product partnership manager, have you ever experienced the death of a product?\n\nOh my goodness, yes! During my time at Interswitch, we had a product that was designed to work for a specific market. I mean we put everything we had into that product but over time, we realized that it wasn\u2019t a good fit for that market. When the product was in its ideation stage, it was built for prospective retail clients. But when we went back to the drawing board, we discovered that it would work better for government agencies and hospitals. Imagine that?\n\nHow did you handle the product\u2019s demise?\n\nMy team made an executive decision to bring the product to end of life and move into maintenance mode; which means we didn\u2019t make any code improvements or fix existing bugs. We also sent out an email to all the users letting them know our decision.\n\nCan you tell us why partnerships matter in product development?\n\nBecause you can\u2019t do everything yourself. If I want to build multiple features into one product, I have two options: I can either pressure my developers to figure out how to hack the infrastructure; or I can find a partner that has already done the work and just connect my product to their rails. Collaboration is a shorter route to making things happen for your product.\n\nHow can you tell when a product is on its way to becoming powerful?\n\nFirstly, you have to consider timing. A powerful product will enter the market at the right time. If the timing isn\u2019t right, your product will not scale and adoption rates will be low.\n\nSecondly, a powerful product is backed by a powerful team. I cannot stress enough that a good team plays an important role in a product\u2019s life cycle\u2013 particularly where growth and maturity are concerned.\n\nLastly, when your market accepts and adopts your product, it is well on its way to becoming powerful.\n\nHow do you develop yourself in your role? What are you reading, watching, or listening to?\n\nI do a lot of courses. I try my best to use that to fill whatever gaps I feel like I might have in my day to day. I\u2019m a big fan of product management and business analytics courses because they directly influence the work I do at Indicina. Prodpad is a great resource for aspiring product partnership managers \u2014 they have a great blog and also offer online courses.\n\nWhat kind of skills are required for your role?\n\nPatience. Product partnership managers have to be extremely patient people. You are dealing with different personalities, clients, departments, and stakeholders. You are constantly coordinating moving parts so you cannot afford to lose your head.\n\nThen you need to know how to articulate your thoughts and translate technical requirements into plain language. You need to be able to make your future partners understand the problem you are trying to solve with your product. Eloquence sells products.\n\nFinally you need an ownership mentality. When you successfully own a product you motivate people to step out of their comfort zones. And you know what\u2019s true? Real magic happens outside your comfort zone.\n\nWhat are some of the challenges product partnership managers face on the job?\n\nThe pricing is never right; that is something that you need to understand. Your prospective partners will negotiate pricing and terms and you have to be prepared to handle that conversation.\n\nYou might also run into challenges where value is concerned. You must ensure that you and your partner are aligned in your definition of value. This way you are forging a mutually beneficial relationship that could last for a long time.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s talk about leadership. How do you motivate your team?\n\nI listen to understand and I lead a place from understanding. That means understanding our goals, KPIs, mission, and strategies. We are working together to achieve a common goal so if we are all on the same page, we can really make magic happen.\n\nI also try my best to communicate effectively with my team and direct line managers. I leave room to receive feedback from my peers and team members. You can\u2019t just talk at people or dump information on them \u2013 you have to be open to hearing their opinions.\n\nTransparency is absolutely essential as well. When I have all the information I need then I am motivated to work hard and punch above my weight.\n\nWhat do you think about the future of technology? What are you excited about?\n\nI\u2019m really excited to see more African founders playing around with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning models. AI and machine learning will help African countries digitize their databases and information centres. When you have access to verified consumer information and data, you can offer crucial financial services like credit, debt financing, mortgages, etc.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this edition of Centre Stage, please consider sharing it in your Whatsapp, Telegram, and LinkedIn groups.\n\nShare this article",

Subscribe here to get it directly in your inbox every Sunday at 3 pm WAT. Hello, Hi everyone, it\u2019s Koromone. Africa\u2019s creator economy is booming and everyone \u2014 from investors to entrepreneurs to the creators themselves \u2014 are looking for ways to cash in, or cash out in the case of popular African comedians with epic followings. I won\u2019t go as far as to say that content creation is the new oil but there is something to be said for how platforms like TikTok, Instagram and Triller are providing hyper-creative African creators with the bells and whistles they need to entertain their fans and keep them glued to their phones like digital zombies. This edition of Next Wave will explore the current state of Africa\u2019s creator economy and speak into the future of video-creating and sharing platforms on the continent. PARTNER MESSAGE\n\nThe Flutterwave Mobile app, the app that turns any smartphone into a mobile POS is now redefining commerce. The Flutterwave Mobile App makes it super convenient for anyone to take their business with them anywhere, anytime. Learn how you can take your business anywhere, anytime here. Now, let\u2019s dive into the story. Entertaining Africans With the Twitter ban still waxing strong in Nigeria, popular skit makers like Oli Ekun, Koye \u201cK10\u201d and Switope (aka queen of impressions) are not losing their steam. These three are part of a new crop of talented comedians who have envious social wealth and are adding incredible value to Nigeria\u2019s creator economy.\n\nBeyond providing African creators with the tools they need to entertain their fans, video-sharing and creating platforms also connect influential creators to local and international brands who are willing to spend big bucks on customer acquisition and retention. Who else is impressed by the rise of Elsa Majimbo\u2019s success story? The well-loved Kenyan comedienne, who rose to fame after posting satirical monologues on Twitter, has hung out with Naomi Campbell, collaborated with Valentino, and posed on the cover of GQ South Africa. Boluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nIf you are African then you know how opposed African parents are to their children studying anything but science subjects. But the 2020 pandemic opened the floodgates of creative juices and it looks like gifted creators are finally getting the respect they deserve. Widening the creator\u2019s pool I first discovered Cameo after Feyikemi Abudu posted a video of Amir Arison (The Blacklist) shouting her out on camera. With Cameo anyone can hire a celebrity actor, athlete or musician to make a personalized shout-out video. Cameo gives its celebrity users the freedom to decline video requests that don\u2019t suit their tastes. While Cameo has a database of celebrities from mostly the US and Europe, the app hasn\u2019t onboarded any African celebrities. Imagine being able to pay Burna Boy or Yemi Alade to make a shout-out video for you or a loved one? In 2016, IrokoTV launched IrokoX \u2013 an online network designed to help indie (independent) creators hack monetisation and distribution. The platform has since gone quiet and all that is left is a paper trail of online press releases. But all hope isn\u2019t lost yet. Last week, Minly \u2013 an Egypt-based creator platform \u2013 announced that they raised $3.6 million in a seed round to enable stars in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) to create personalized videos for their fans. Like most startups with an eye for the creator economy, Minly launched late last year during the thick of the COVID pandemic. Since their entrance into the digital ecosystem, Minly has onboard over 50,000 users and have an impressive list of regional celebrities on their platforms. Now the question on my mind is: Will Minly expand to other countries on the continent or will we see African entrepreneurs build creator platforms to cater to their home country\u2019s entertainment needs? FROM THE CABAL TeamApt closes an undisclosed amount in its recently announced Series B round. According to the company\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Tosin Eniolorunda, they have their eyes set on Francophone Africa.

          "text": "Nigeria-based TeamApt, which offers agent banking services with plans to roll out consumer-focused digital banking features, has raised an undisclosed sum in a Series B round.\n\nIn a statement, co-founder and CEO Tosin Eniolorunda said the funding \u201callows us to extend our solutions to other parts of Africa.\u201d The company currently operates only in Nigeria but has its sights set on breaking ground in a francophone African country later this year.\n\nOfficially undisclosed \u201cfor business reasons\u201d according to a TeamApt representative in an email, Eniolorunda had indicated in June that it was \u201ca couple of tens of millions of dollars\u201d in size. Two people familiar with the company\u2019s fundraising process confirmed it is at least $20 million.\n\nNovastar Ventures, the Kenya-based firm, led the round with the participation of Global Ventures (a firm in the United Arab Emirates), CDC Group (the UK\u2019s development finance institution), Soma Capital, Kepple Africa Ventures and Oui Capital.\n\nDutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO also got in on the action with a $2 million punt, according to TechCrunch.\n\nTosin Eniolofunda, CEO TeamApt.\n\nThis recent funding announcement follows TeamApt\u2019s $5.5m Series A round closed in 2019 led by Quantum Capital Partners, a Lagos-based investment firm owned by Jim Ovia, the founder of Zenith Bank.\n\nThough under the radar for much of its six year existence, TeamApt boasts numbers that would place it among Nigeria\u2019s most active and best performing financial technology startups.\n\nTeamApt\u2019s pivotal business at the moment is Moniepoint, a software solution that powers agent banking in Nigeria. The company says that it processed $3.5bn in May and is the leading agent banking platform on volume of transactions, citing an April report from the Shared Agent Network Expansion Facility (SANEF) \u2013 the body authorised by the Central Bank of Nigeria to oversee agent banking in Nigeria.\n\nSANEF\u2019s reports are not public and it is not clear which other companies are captured in it. But the agent banking space is thought to include Firstmonie, Paga and OPay, the Opera-backed fintech.\n\nIn March 2021, TeamApt said it processed over \u20a61trillion ($2.4 bn) for the first time. The $3.5 bn processed in May was from a base of 68 million transactions. Underlying these transactions is a network of agents numbering about 100,000 across Nigeria\u2019s 36 states.\n\nIn the twelve months ended April 2021, the company said it had processed a total of $16bn across its platforms which includes Monnify, a service that provides virtual accounts to fintechs and other service providers to facilitate instant notification of bank transactions.\n\nBut the majority of the company\u2019s operations (and revenue) is from Moniepoint, forming the basis for plans to evolve the platform into the consumer digital banking space. While Moniepoint will continue to power agent banking, TeamApt plans to build a consumer app side of it for individuals as a digital bank.\n\nBesides geographical expansion and a product launch, what else does TeamApt have up its sleeves?\n\nLast week, the company\u2019s founders were announced as the newest members of the Endeavor Nigeria network, which means they qualified to receive investment from the network\u2019s Catalyst Fund (There\u2019s precedent: Endeavor\u2019s investment in Flutterwave\u2018s Series B in January 2020).\n\nPlans for more funding are already underway.\n\nA TeamApt representative said \u201ca series C conversation is ongoing [and] should be completed in the coming months and we\u2019ll be happy to announce at that time.\u201d\n\nEniolorunda, the CEO, anticipates that they could soon rise to become a billion-dollar startup. \u201cWe expect the company to reach unicorn-type valuations soon,\u201d he told TechCabal in June.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

According to a study by CDC Group \u2014 UK owned development finance institution for Africa and Asia \u2014 in 2020, 9% of people in DRC use the internet, with the high cost of connectivity cited as the most significant reason.\n\nHowever, this isn\u2019t Facebook\u2019s first project aimed at bringing faster Internet connectivity to Africa.

          "text": "After its seed round in September 2019, Egyptian MaxAB has raised $40 million in Series A round to accelerate expansion. This round brings investments in the company to $45 million.\n\nThis round was led by RMBV, a prominent impact investor in North Africa. IFC, Flourish Ventures, Crystal Stream Capital, Rise Capital, Endeavour Catalyst, Beco Capital, and 4DX Ventures also participated in the round.\n\nFounded by Belal El-Megharbel (CEO and Co-founder) and Mohamed Ben Halim (Co-founder), MaxAB is a business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce platform that connects food and grocery retailers in Egypt\u2019s underserved regions with suppliers via its mobile app.\n\nMaxAB\u2019s platform delivers supplies to stores in Egypt. Store owners can use the platform to purchase goods, arrange for delivery or logistics, and communicate with a customer support team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company harnessed technology to create a transformational supply chain model and a product that empowers traditional retailers and suppliers.\n\nThe B2B eCommerce platform serves traditional retailers, providing simple processes, transparent pricing, on-demand delivery, and a variety of value-added services.\n\nMaxAB\u2019s supply chain solutions and business intelligence tools help suppliers accurately forecast, monitor, and control the impact of their strategies in real-time.\n\nSince its launch in 2018, the startup claims to have aided over 55,000 retailers in Egypt, fulfilling over 1 million orders, and directly employing 1,600 people.\n\nThe fund will be used to expand its physical footprint across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, following its expansion to every major city in Egypt by the end of 2021.\n\nMaxAB also plans on adding supply chain and embedded finance solutions to newly launched business verticals.\n\nThe company will extend its talent pool by bringing in some of the world\u2019s brightest minds to join the dynamic team, further strengthening Egypt\u2019s position as a regional technological hub.\n\nEl-Megharbel stated that MaxAB saw a significant role in optimising the supply chain through technology to ensure that the right amount of products is delivered to the correct location at the right time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTherefore, they operate their warehouses and fleet to assist small merchants in Egypt in procuring inventory, as manufacturers suffer tremendously and incur high costs to serve markets like Egypt.\n\nMaxAB had created a B2B eCommerce platform for conventional retailers in Egypt, but now they are up against competition from a few other businesses that started in the last two years, including Fatura, Capiter.\n\nEl-Megharbel believes that MaxAB will be supported by prominent investors to effectively scale its operations across the MENA region and developing markets.\n\nAnd with the fund, MaxAB can provide additional scale to retailers while also providing additional economies of scale to customers.",

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of SME Clinic newsletter, a weekly newsletter that provides tips and recommendations to help you position your small business for success. Register to attend SME Clinic 2021 here.\n\nFor the most part, people sign up for Instagram to connect with friends and enjoy content while simultaneously growing their followers and improving engagements.\n\nHowever, as a business owner, your focus should be on turning these followers into clients \u2014 people who pay for your products and services.\n\nIf only a handful of your Instagram followers have ever patronised your business, or you do not even know how to start advertising on the platform, here are a few ways to convert your followers into paying, repeat customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Have a clear idea of your target audience\n\nOften, it\u2019s so easy to think that your products/services are solutions to all problems. But that\u2019s not true. As a business owner, you\u2019re not for everybody.\n\nYour product/service has a specific problem it\u2019s proffering solutions to. Find out what problems your followers have that can be solved with your product/service.\n\n2. Post persistently, but more importantly strategically\n\nIf nobody knows what you\u2019re selling, you won\u2019t get buyers. Be loud about what you do! Own your brand and promote it relentlessly and strategically.\n\nCreate content around your product/service offering and share consistently. Pick specific days in the week that you post, and let the content always emphasise what you\u2019re offering and what makes it unique.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to take a break, but communicate with your followers beforehand.\n\n3. Engage your audience regularly\n\nThis cannot be overemphasised. Building a good relationship with your followers is very important. It\u2019s as easy as constantly leaving kind and witty comments on their posts, sending them wishes on their birthdays etc.\n\nAs an entrepreneur, it\u2019s important to go first! You could personalise it and go a step further to send DMs, know what they care about, and engage their interests as observed from their posts. This will create a leeway to introduce your products/services. Outstanding customer relationships are key.\n\n4. Customer feedback is a pot of gold\n\nSo, you\u2019ve completed an order for one or two followers; don\u2019t let it end there. Ask for feedback. What was their experience like using your products? What did they wish was better? Without the interactions, it\u2019s not social; it\u2019s just media!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd share this feedback. Let your service do the talking. Word of mouth is a fast selling medium. There are products you\u2019ve used today because you know someone who knows someone that knows someone.\n\n5. Invest in paid advertisement\n\nPaid advertisement prices on Instagram depend on what package you and for how long you want the ads to run.\n\nBut even when you do this, you still have to engage with your customers to keep them. Reply DMs; it shows trust. Research shows that the longest a customer on social media is willing to wait for a reply is 4 hours. After this, they might no longer trust you.\n\n6. Give often\n\nGiving in a world that keeps taking is rare, and this is good for a change.\n\nPick a time \u2014 maybe once or twice a month \u2014 when you let your followers apply for a giveaway. This helps to get and publicly share feedback on your product/service.\n\nIt\u2019s never been easier to promote oneself and build in public; however, it\u2019s never been so easy to be open to the unexpected. But at the end of the day, a great deal of the shots we miss are the ones we don\u2019t take!\n\nJoin us at SME Clinic 2021 to learn more about how to market and grow your business online.\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Early Bird Offer!

          "text": "For developers of luxury residential real estate, good times are underway as market dynamics have changed demand in that sub-market with growing investment interest coming from ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNWIs).\n\nFrom student accommodation to residential care homes, investing in the places people call home is a growing phenomenon. Residential real estate investment is establishing itself as a global real estate asset class, according to this year\u2019s Attitudes Survey conducted by Knight Frank.\n\nBusinessDay findings show that, increasingly, the rich in society are realigning their priorities to spend more on real estate to provide their families a sense of security, health, safety, and privacy, meaning that work, socialising and entertainment now take place in their homes.\n\nRead Also: Residential real estate offers investment opportunities amid weak Q2\u201921 outlook\n\nThis is coming as an aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had significant lifestyle changes in work, home and play.\n\nThe survey shows 59 percent of respondents saying UHNWIs are becoming more interested in investing in purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA); 60 percent cited more interest in the private rented sector (PRS), and 60 percent in senior living.\n\nJames Mannix, head of Residential Investment and Development at Knight Frank, says, \u201cInvestors are looking for assets that provide an income in a world where interest rates and bond yields are low or negative.\n\n\u201cThis sector, where performance is tied to fundamentals such as education, rising employment and the ageing population, provides an investment linked to a demographic rather than an economic cycle.\u201d\n\nIn the Nigerian market, recent property transactions have shown an impressive turnout in the luxury segment. Currently, projects undergoing construction in the Ikoyi axis of Lagos are making progress to meet completion dates.\n\nThis is evidenced in a few recently completed luxury projects like Sisi Paris and 4 Bourdillon, which are nearing full occupancy. Others in the pipeline have already recorded half uptake and may achieve full occupancy upon completion.\n\nFrank Okosun, senior partner/CEO, Knight Frank Nigeria, says the future of luxury market remains bright, explaining, \u201cAs remote working becomes the norm, the need for large-sized houses will grow in demand, necessitating developers reviving previous designs.\n\n\u201cThe high-end luxury property market in Nigeria has, however, experienced a glut, with vacancy rate averaging 40 percent at highbrow locations in Lagos and Abuja. This is largely due to the general decline in purchasing power and the continued exit of expatriates from the country, especially in the wake of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is still demand from the country\u2019s upper class and political elites, which has kept the segment partially active. The high residential vacancy recorded in prime areas is largely attributed to the luxury segment, as supply continues to outstrip demand.\n\nBefore now, Nigeria had a very conducive climate for investment, which attracted expatriates, foreign investors into the country. These became major occupiers of luxury market in the country, but economic sentiment and unfavourable policies have largely affected that market in recent times.\n\n\u201cStricter government regulations have resulted in eliminating economic bottlenecks like money laundering. This has further led to a slow-down of luxury transactions, as more prospective buyers take a more cautious approach,\u201d Okosun notes.\n\nBut the current state and level of demand for smaller apartments have inspired developers to redesign luxury projects to meet current emphasis.\n\nObi Nwogugu, principal at African Capital Alliance (ACA), confirms to BusinessDay that demand level for smaller unit apartments is rising because, \u201cThat is what the market wants; as investors, we offer what the market demands.\u201d\n\nThe demand for smaller-unit luxury homes is such that, according to MKO Balogun, CEO, Global PFI, about 60 percent of people looking for homes to buy or rent in the property market presently are those looking for small units such as studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments.\n\nPart of the market dynamics that will drive demand for luxury real estate, especially for those that offer larger footprints and provide more amenities, are private outdoor space, touchless technology, numerous home offices, and health perks, including air and water filtration.\n\nIt is expected that buyer-demand will also be driven by lower interest rates, low inventory levels, new wealth from sectors that benefitted from the pandemic, a millennial population that is ready to find a safe haven, and significant increase in second home buying as well as upsizing and new properties offering higher wellness standards.\n\nFor investors with patient capital and appetite for off-shore markets, James Pullan, head of Student Property at Knight Frank, says London, UK, is a good destination. He notes that while new development has been constrained by planning considerations, the number of students coming to study in the capital continues to rise.\n\nThis, according Pullan, is creating opportunities for investors in PBSA. \u201cInvestment continues to flow into the London market, with established assets in great demand,\u201d he states.",

          "text": "Mele Kolo Kyari, the NNPC boss may have incurred the wrath of oil communities by asking the National Assembly to peg at 2.5 percent oil profit payable to host communities, according to the Petroleum Industry Bill.\n\nWhile the House of Representatives in the version of the bill passed provides 5 percent to the communities, the Senate put it at 3 percent.\n\nBoth chambers are scheduled to meet this week to harmonise the two bills before it is passed for President Buhari\u2019s signature.\n\nBut Kyari at a forum in Abuja on Monday, urged the National Assembly to lower the share of oil producing communities to 2.5 percent.\n\n\u201cIt was a very, very considered proposal from the executive that we should make it 2.5%,\u201d Kyari told an oil summit in Abuja, adding that it makes business sense and would be \u201csufficient to deliver value to these communities\u201d.\n\nHe warned that too large a stake would drive big oil companies out of Nigeria, leaving a gap that local producers would struggle to fill.\n\n\u201cWe are at the verge of losing them. That is the truth,\u201d he said of the oil majors.\n\nSenator Sabi Abdullahi, speaking on behalf of the Senate president, said the two chambers would agree on a finalised package before recess this month.\n\n\u201cIt is not possible for us to abandon this before we go on vacation,\u201d Abdullahi said.\n\nBut Kyari spoke on a day that the umbrella political group for the oil producing region of Niger Delta, PANDEF, demanded 10 percent.\n\nChief Edwin Clark, leader of the group, whose speech was delivered in Abuja, described the PIB, satanic, unjust and embarrassing to Niger Delta.\n\nHe said it has dashed the hope of the people of the Niger Delta region.\n\nClark said the provision that allocated a huge 30% of profits for further frontier oil exploration in the north was a source of concern.\n\nHe said it is an absurd provision especially in a fast changing world as investment shifts away from fossil fuel.\n\nClark declared that the region has had enough of the post-colonial oppression and will be resisting it.\n\nHe said the bill does not reflect the long clamour by the people of the region for equity, fairness and justice.\n\nHe warned that Niger Delta will take their destinies in their hands and deny International Oil Companies (IOCs) entry into the region should the National Assembly fail to reverse the passed bill.\n\n\u201cGiven the depth of ingratitude expressed and delivered after decades of exploitation and neglect of the region, the entire people of the Niger Delta region, for and on behalf of the host communities, vehemently reject the following aspects of the bill: the 3% and 5% of Operating Expenditure granted to the Host Communities; the fraudulent and provocative 30% provision for the Frontier Exploration Fund.\n\n\u201cAnd now demand: the PIB must be reversed, reviewed and amended to ensure that the Oil-Bearing Communities must now receive not less than 10% of Operating Cost.\n\n\u201cIf this is not done, the Niger Delta people may be forced to take their destiny into their own hands and all IOCs may find themselves denied access to their oil activities in such communities.\u201d\n\nGovernors of Southern states at a Forum in Lagos on Monday supported 5 percent share for oil communities.\n\n\u201cThe Forum rejects the proposed 3% and support the 5% share of the oil revenue to the host community as recommended by the House of Representatives;\n\n\u201cThe forum also rejects the proposed 30% share of profit for the exploration of oil and gas in the basins\u201d, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of oil producing Ondo state said.",

          "title": "Herdsmen: Gov Ortom Says Buhari Apologists Are Sponsoring Attacks Against Him",
          "text": "On Monday, Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State said that some supporters of President Muhammadu Buhari are funding media attacks against him.\n\nOrtom made the accusation while claiming that the President\u2019s defenders were funding attacks against him because he refused to remain silent about the massacres carried out by armed herders in the State.\n\nThe Governor indicated that remaining silent while people in the state were being slain would be perilous, so he would continue to tell the truth to those in authority.\n\nDespite media attacks sponsored by enemies of the state, the Governor, speaking through his Principal Special Assistant on Media, Nathaniel Ikyur, insisted that he would never stay silent.\n\nKiller herders have attacked, killed, and raped people in the State, according to Ortom.\n\nA statement by Ikyur reads: \u201cThe Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr is quoted to have made this profound statement: \u201cOur lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.\u201d This has been the mindset of Samuel Ortom since he was elected the 5th democratic Governor of Benue State in 2015. Till date, he has maintained that position: seeking to do only that which is for the good of the people of the state who elected him. That\u2019s why he speaks truth to power. He believes keeping mute when scores of Benue people are hacked to death will be too dangerous. Understandably, his position on any issue has never been popular from the onset. But with time, it gains ascendancy and acceptance.\n\n\u201cBenue has been badly hit by herdsmen attacks. Scores have been killed and many wounded irredeemably while others have their ancestral lands taken away. Some of our mothers and daughters have been raped and maimed by the gang of killers. Governor Ortom has made several representations to the Presidency for the arrest of the leadership of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore who have vowed to ensure that blood flows in Benue because the state enacted a law against open grazing.\n\n\u201cSadly, there is an upsurge now among willing Benue State indigenes who are ready to lead a smear campaign against Governor Samuel Ortom and get paid for discrediting him for standing by his people. These are the recruits into the antagonist camp against the Ortom administration. They are promised handouts from the centre so they don\u2019t care whether their state burns. I call them the sons of Iscariot. They would rather swim in the blood of their hapless relations who are being slaughtered by agents of death, the Fulani herdsmen. They are now concocting all manner of tales to sell their wares for the peanuts they\u2019ve been promised.\n\n\u201cThe other day, it was the one-man \u2018Benue Patriotic Front\u2019 of Dan Morgan-Ihomun. This time, one Comrade Timothy Tor, whose real identity seems to be hidden behind some political weaklings whose past and present records are in shambles. They come under the faceless \u2018Benue Proactive Coalition for Good Governance.\u2019 Their voices are only heard now just to please their paymasters. If I may ask, where were they when Fulani herdsmen attacked and killed thousands of Benue people and destroyed communities? Why were their voices not heard then?\n\n\u201cGovernor Ortom was elected to lead the people of the state. He speaks to clear doubts about where his allegiance lies. And so why is \u2018Comrade Tor\u2019 so bothered about what the Governor has been saying to the President? For goodness\u2019 sake, President Buhari is the Commander in Chief of the Nigerian Armed Forces? The President appoints all the service chiefs. As such, they are his appointees and not those of the Governors. No wonder, President Muhammadu Buhari singled Governor Ortom out during his interview with Arise Television. Or could this fictional groups be said to be the handiwork of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore?\n\n\u201cIf the faceless group is convinced that Governor Ortom does not speak the minds of Benue people who elected him, let the group come to the state and address the people. The reaction they will get from the people will clear their doubts. Why do they sit in Abuja to criticize the Benue State Governor?\n\n\u201cIn any case, is there any true Benue citizen who does not appreciate the positive impact of the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law on the state of insecurity in Benue? If there is such a man, then surely, the man or woman is not worth his salt. It is therefore surprising that someone could deliberately evade the truth just to foster mischief and earn crumbs while his people are been killed and displaced from their ancestral lands. As we speak, the Nigerian diasporan communities applauds the Governor as a pacesetter. They\u2019re not blinded by the political nuances around here.\n\n\u201cIt is a fact that the instrumentality of the law and personal commitment to the safety of the people and peace in the state by the Governor have entrenched relative stability and tranquility. If any Benue man or woman discountenances this, such a person is living in self denial.\n\n\u201cComrade Tor\u2019, the self-styled \u2018Benue Proactive Coalition for Good Governance\u2019 advocate and his masters are dumb on the realities of what is threatening the foundation of this country. They talk loosely from one end to the other on issues they\u2019re lacking in understanding.\n\n\u201cFor instance, this hireling and those behind him do not understand that the Benue Amnesty Programme under Governor Ortom that made late Terwase Akwaza, aka Gana and his group to surrender in the first place was tailored along the template of what late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua did to the Niger Delta militants in 2009. Yar\u2019Adua offered unconditional pardon to the militants and cash payments to the rebels who agreed to lay down their arms because it also restored oil production in the zone which had witnessed sabotage, oil siphoning rackets and kidnappings by criminal gangs. So, engaging Gana in the first place wasn\u2019t a strange decision.\n\n\u201cFrom January 2018 to date, Benue State has no issues in payment of salaries. Arrears are owed to civil servants at the end of 2017 as a result of the recession Nigeria went into. Benue with a wage bill of over N3 billion at that time, received less than N1.5 billion from the federation\u2019s account for some months. This made the full payment of salaries impossible. Interestingly, in Benue State, all segments of the labour unions are part of the joint account committees that sit over these funds. Indeed, pensions are being owed but efforts are ongoing to clear the backlog. The PENCOM Act has been domesticated to create the legal framework to address this issue.\n\n\u201cGovernor Zulum of Borno State may be doing well in his own right but so too, is Governor Ortom. Much has been accomplished in various sectors like education where reconstruction, rehabilitation of classroom blocks in primary and secondary schools has taken place. Tertiary institutions have also received a boost. The health sector, rural infrastructures, works, housing security and many more have received tremendous attention by the Ortom administration. It is therefore, cheap blackmail and outright falsehood when political jobbers indulge in flippancy and shameless lies that the Governor has not developed the state.\n\n\u201cIt is more important that the sponsors of these malicious publications in the media who are clearly political apologists to the President, advise the Presidency to fulfil its numerous campaign promises of tackling insecurity, corruption and the economy. Using Governor Samuel Ortom as a scapegoat can not wish away the burden of performance regarding the promises made.\n\n\u201cLastly, we want to throw this challenge once more to the group and others like it. They should come to Benue and test their popularity against Governor Ortom. Let\u2019s see if what they were told is real or imagined. For now, the Governor has work to do and he is diligently pursuing the mandate with vigour.

Femi Gbajabiamila, on Monday evening met with the Minister of Finance, Hajiya Zainab Ahmed, over the 2022-2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper.\n\nThe meeting which started at 5:11pm lasted till about 7:45pm and had in attendance the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, the Deputy Speaker, Ahmed Idris Wase and some other principal officers of both chambers, as well as Senators and Members of the House of Representatives.\n\nAccording to the Senate President, the meeting was convened at the instance of the leadership of the National Assembly to deliberate on projections in the 2022-2024 MTEF/FSP needed to facilitate the early presentation of the 2022 budget by President Muhammadu Buhari in September this year.\n\nLawan in his welcome address recalled the commitment of the Ninth National Assembly towards the early passage of the nation\u2019s annual budget.\n\nHe explained that the development was responsible for the 100 percent implementation of the 2020 Appropriations Act which, according to him, would be achieved also in 2021.\n\nThe Senate President added that the interaction between the National Assembly and the Ministry of Finance on the 2022-2024 Medium Term Expenditure Framework would facilitate the early presentation of the 2022 Appropriations Bill in September this year.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe all recall how this Ninth National Assembly committed itself Ab initio to ensuring the passage of the Appropriations before the end of December of every year, to enable the implementation of the Appropriations Act to start January of every year.\n\n\u201cSo far, we have achieved that in the 2020 budget and 2021 budget as well. This has significantly improved the implementation of the Appropriations Act, culminating in the 100 percent implementation of the 2020 budget, and we are optimistic that the implementation of the 2021 budget would also achieve 100 percent.\n\n\u201cThe 2022 Appropriations Bill would be predicated on the MTEF/FSP 2022-2024. [And] it is very important that this interaction takes place so that the National Assembly is able to consider the MTEF in very good time to allow the Executive arm of government prepare the Appropriations Bill for 2022.\u201d\n\nSpeaking, the Minister of Finance, Hajiya Zainab Ahmed, recalled that Nigeria was able to make a quick exit from recession in the third quarter of 2020 despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy.\n\nAccording to her, this had an attendant \u201cnegative growth\u201d on the Nigerian economy as a result of the significant and sudden drop in crude oil price in the international market.\n\nThe Finance Minister disclosed that although the Nigerian economy experienced more revenue earnings in 2020 from non-oil sectors, other sectors such as transport still remain in the negative.\n\n\u201cThe economy since then has sustained a tepid growth in the first quarter of 2021, with a growth of 0.51 percent consolidating our exit from recession in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cThe growth of the Nigeria economy, we are pleased to say, is driven largely by the non-oil sector, which has risen to 0.79 percent, masking the deterioration in the oil sector.\n\n\u201cThe sectoral growth in the non-oil sector was primarily driven by telecoms and agriculture sectors as well as other sectors of the Nigerian economy.\n\n\u201cSignificant concerns still exist in the performance of trade, as well as transport sector which are still in a very strong negative growth,\u201d she said.\n\nRelated\n\nNo tags for this post.",

          "text": "Two persons are said to have lost their lives after bandits invaded Bethel Baptist School, a private college in Kaduna State, kidnapping an unspecified number of students.\n\nThe kidnappers in the early hours of Monday attacked the private school located at Maraban Rido within the Chikun Local Government Area of the state.\n\nSources say the marauders came in gun blazing, shooting sporadically into the air before whisking the students away.\n\nFour of the students are said to have escaped while the rest were taken away by the gunmen to an unknown destination.\n\nThis latest kidnap incident comes barely one day after gunmen suspected to be kidnappers attacked the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Centre in Zaria, Kaduna state, abducting no fewer than seven people including nursing mothers.\n\nThe incident was said to have happened in the early hours of Sunday when the bandits invaded the centre and started shooting sporadically.\n\nAmong those kidnapped were seven staff of the centre (two male and five female) and two others who are non-staff.\n\nThe gunmen also attacked the Saye Divisional Police Headquarters also in Zaria and damaged a patrol vehicle with bullets.\n\nAlthough the police authorities are yet to confirm the incident, sources from the area told Channels Television that the gunmen in large numbers had invaded Saye village, blocked the bridge leading to the Leprosy centre, while some others attacked the Saye Divisional police Headquarters, in an attempt to prevent the operatives from foiling the operation.\n\nA plethora of kidnappings\n\nCriminal groups, known as \u201cbandits\u201d by the authorities, have for quite some time been terrorizing parts of the northwest and centre of the nation, attacking villages, stealing cattle, and kidnapping people for ransom.\n\nZamfara, Katsina, Niger, and Kaduna have been the most attacked by the bandits, with the situation in the latter state deteriorating at an exponential rate.\n\nMost disheartening about the attack in Kaduna is the fact that most of the kidnappings are focused on citadels of learning, leading to the mass abductions of students for ransom.\n\nA prior warning\n\nFour days ago, Governor Nasir El-Rufai told newsmen that he has withdrawn his children from a public school in Kaduna after getting wind of a plot to kidnap his son.\n\nThe governor had in September 2019, enrolled his six-year-old son, Abubakar-Sadiq into Kaduna Capital School, a public school located in the Kaduna State capital, in order to show leadership to revamp public education in the state and make it more competitive.\n\nBut in an interview with the BBC, El-Rufai noted that available security reports revealed that three bandit groups were planning to abduct his son from the school, a situation which he also notes will expose other children to grave danger.\n\nThe Governor also disclosed that he had enrolled Sadiq\u2019s younger sister, Nasrine in the same school after turning six years, before the security development, thereby forcing the family to withdraw the two children from the public school temporarily.\n\n\u201cMy son is registered in the school because his sister also became six years of age and we registered her in the school but we\u2019ve had to temporarily withdraw them for the security of the school because we got intercept from at least two groups that are planning to attack the school to kidnap my son,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they will succeed because there will be enough security there to prevent it but other children may be placed in danger. We have no idea what weapons they will come with.\u201d\n\nHe however said that his two children are currently homeschooling, and are only going to Capital School to write exams, with the hope of returning to Kaduna Capital School when security improves.\n\nThe governor further explained that his family took the decision to withdraw his son and daughter based on the advice of security agents, and in order not to put the school at risk of being attacked by bandits.\n\nRansom For Bandits?\n\nAs Kaduna State and other parts of the north-western region continue to experience the scourge of banditry, El-Rufai has been one of those few governors that have repeatedly kicked against the payment of ransom to kidnappers.\n\nHe also reiterated his administration\u2019s stance, explaining that three groups intercepted had vowed to abduct his children to see if he would make a U-turn on the payment of ransom.\n\nThe Kaduna Governor has insisted that the state government has no money to pay bandits amid the renewed attacks by armed groups in the state.\n\nHe stated that the recent bandits\u2019 attacks on communities in the state were a result of the government\u2019s decision that it would not negotiate with them.\n\n\u201cWe have a feeling that the renewed attacks in Kaduna are not unconnected to the position that we have taken as a government that we will not negotiate with criminals,\u201d said the governor who was a guest on Channels Television\u2019s Sunday Politics.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe will not give them any money and they will not make any profit from Kaduna; anyone that comes to Kaduna will not get a penny from the state government, except he will get a bullet instead.\u201d\n\nAccording to Governor El-Rufai, the security challenges being witnessed in the northwest region of the country have been existing for some years and gradually evolving and getting worse with time.\n\nHe was confident that while the state government does not have any reason to change his position, the military would wipe out the bandits from the region.",

Today, the north controls the Oil Sector, even though day-to-day operations are being handled by the International Oil Companies (IOCs) on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nClarke said the entire people of the Niger Delta region, for and on behalf of the host communities, vehemently reject the 3% and 5% of operating expenditure granted to the host communities; the fraudulent and provocative 30% provision for the frontier exploration fund.\n\nHe demanded that the PIB be reversed, reviewed and amended to ensure that the oil-bearing communities receive not less than 10% of operating cost.\n\n\u201cIf this is not done, the Niger Delta people may be forced to take their destiny into their own hands and all IOCs may find themselves denied access to their oil activities in such communities,\u201d he added.\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
