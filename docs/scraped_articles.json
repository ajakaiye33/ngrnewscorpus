          "text": "Residents of the Umugama village, Ukwulu, in the Dunukofia Local Government Area of Anambra State, have called on the security agents and the government to save them from the activities of land grabbers.\n\nAddressing journalists in Awka on Saturday, the Chairman of the Umugama Progressive Union, Peter Okoye, said the land grabbers, allegedly led by one Philip Dilibe, had been terrorising the community despite several reports and complaints to relevant security agencies, including the Nigeria Police Force Headquarters, Abuja.\n\nOkoye, who led some members of the community to register their grievances at the Anambra State Police Command headquarters, Awka, lamented the high level of intimidation, harassment, extortion and threat to life by the suspected land grabbers.\n\nHe alleged that the land grabbers were selling the community\u2019s land at will and daring anybody who challenged them by engaging gunmen to destroy the villagers\u2019 farmlands and crops.\n\nHe lamented that his life and that of his people were being threatened on a daily basis.\n\nOkoye recalled that on February 25, 2022, some gunmen shot and wounded two persons from the community, but for the quick intervention of the police, more harm would have been inflicted on the people.\n\nHe also accused Dilibe of collaborating with others outside the community to sell the community\u2019s land to prospective buyers without the consent and approval of the leaders of the village.\n\nHe accused Dilibe of hiring thugs from neighbouring communities such as Enugwu-Agidi, Nawgu and Awkuzu to stage violent protests against the traditional ruler of Ukwulu Kingdom, Igwe Peter Uyanwa, who stood by the village against the activities of the land grabbers.\n\nOkoye advised Dilibe to desist from his action, noting that \u201cthe ancestors of the land are currently against him; I believe in the ability of the police to restore peace to this community.\u201d\n\nThe women leader in the village, Mrs Nonye Okeke, appealed to the police to sanction Dilibe in order for peace to return to the village.\n\nDilibe\u2019s group had earlier on protested at the state police command headquarters, Amawbia, by blocking the gate.\n\nMembers of the group, who were dressed in black, accused the monarch, Uyanwa, of land grabbing and using the police to arrest and lock up members of the community, who opposed his decision.\n\nDilibe accused the monarch of selling off the land and asked him to leave the land for them.\n\nThe state police spokesman, DSP Ikenga Tochukwu, advised the aggrieved parties to get an attorney to articulate their grievances in the form of a petition and the Commissioner of Police would work on it to ensure peace in the community.\n\n\u201cWe are happy that you are protesting peacefully and we want to assure you that the commissioner will look into your petition once you write him formally, and he will ensure that investigation is carried out and your grievances will be addressed,\u201d Ikenga told the protesters.\n\nIgwe Uyanwa, on his part, denied having anything to do with the Umugama village land.\n\nHe said, \u201cThat village is having their own crisis, and I\u2019m not from that village, and I have nothing to do with their land even though I\u2019m their traditional ruler\n\n\u201cThey even told me that they wanted to protest at my palace today for me to settle the dispute they have, but I said I didn\u2019t want to receive visitors. What you must know is that more than 80 per cent of the protesters led by the man called Dilibe are not my subjects; they were just hired for the protest. I don\u2019t have even one plot of land in the affected village.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has urged women to use the 2022 International Women\u2019s Day coming up on Tuesday to protest against the gender policy of the All Progressives Congress controlled Federal Government.\n\nWike gave the charge at the civic reception organised in his honour by the Ekpeye ethnic nation at St Peter Catholic School field, Ahoada, in Ahoada East Local Government Area of the state on Saturday.\n\nThe governor said it was an APC controlled National Assembly that actually rejected the five gender bills that would have give women more opportunities in the political landscape.\n\nAccording to him, the APC members, who are in majority in the National Assembly, are unwilling to amend the country\u2019s constitution in order to give women requisite political opportunities.\n\nWike urged women to keep pace with their demand for legislative rights and used the occasion of the International Women\u2019s Day to further demand for roles they should play in political administration in the country.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI hear that on Tuesday there will be a celebration of the International Women\u2019s Day. I ask Nigerian women, what are you celebrating? Other countries can celebrate their women, Nigeria cannot celebrate her women.\n\n\u201cTake that particular day and demonstrate against the APC, which has refused to recognise women in this country. Don\u2019t go there and begin to dance; there is nothing to dance about until they recognise you. It is only when Nigeria recognises you that you can dance.\u201d\n\nWike said presently in Rivers State, all the vice-chairmen of the 23 local government councils were women and every local government had at least five women councillors.\n\nThe governor explained that he considered himself as part of Ekpeye land and could not ignore its development needs.\n\nHe stated that though Ekpeye kingdom was long forgotten, God\u2019s appointed time had come and now six traditional stools had been upgraded to first class status.\n\nThe governor said his administration had fulfilled every promise made to Ekpeye people in terms of project delivery, because he was determined to transform Ahoada into a city.\n\nWike announced the award for reconstruction of the Ochigba/Ogbologbolo/Ozochi Road and the upgrade of the Ugbobi traditional stool to first class status.\n\nConcerning governorship of the state, he said he did not believe in gifting power and urged any Ekpeye person, who thinks he had the capacity, to be ready to jostle for the office with others across the state.\n\nIn his welcome address, Chief E. C. Okorji said Ekpeye people were celebrating Wike because of the development projects he delivered in the kingdom.\n\nAlso speaking, Chibudom Nwuche said the governor was an illustrious son, who puts Rivers State on the national spotlight always with evidence of good governance.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "AANI raises alarm over noticeable divisive tendencies threatening Nigeria\u2019s democracy",
          "text": ".\n\n**To hold a national dialogue on national unity.\n\nBy: Kingsley Omonobi \u2013 Abuja.\n\nThe Alumni Association of the National Institute (AANI) has raised alarm and deep concern over what it called the noticeable divisive tendencies among the components of Nigerian society saying \u201carmed violence, economic difficulties, and heated political space, have created social tension, loss of lives and widespread fear over the future of our dear country, as a united and democratic society\u201d.\n\nPresident of the Alumni Association and former Inspector General of Police, IGP MD Abubakar (rtd) who raised the alarm, noted that \u201cEfforts by Governments at various levels to tackle these challenges achieved only a marginal success because the challenges are deep-rooted and require comprehensive, participatory, and proactive solution\u2019s.\n\nSpeaking during a briefing to herald its 42 AGM and Conference at the NAF Conference Centre in Abuja, Abubakar said, \u201cIn response to this AANI as a Think Tank is going to hold a national dialogue on national unity.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, as we approach the 2023 general elections, we are calling on\n\nthe political class to uphold global best practices and focus on the security, welfare, and economic prosperity of Nigerians over and above their personal ambitions and pecuniary interests.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the recent assent to the Electoral Act by Mr President provides a new opportunity for a free and fair election in Nigeria. We call on the Independent National Electoral Commission to activate all the provisions of the law towards the conduct of free and fair general elections in 2023.\n\nFurthermore, the former IGP said, \u201cThe challenges facing our country highlighted earlier cannot be properly addressed unless broad-minded and selfless individuals with capacity and courage seek and get elected to elective positions.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, urge Nigerians with these qualities including members of the National Institute to participate actively in the political process as part of efforts to rescue Nigeria. We must de-emphasise money politics and come together to sponsor candidates that can pursue an agenda for the common good.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, AANI intends to convene a stakeholder meeting ahead of the 2023 election, to sensitize both politicians and electorates on the need to focus on issues that affect the lives of the people and the candidates with the capacity and pedigree to address them rather than selfish interests and material inducements.\n\nHe added, \u201cOur association is always available to partner with government and all stakeholders to tackle challenges through promoting a comprehensive strategy that would stabilize the polity and promote a proactive agenda for the overall development of the country.\n\n\u201cWe believe that adequate focus on qualitative and functional education for our teeming population and agriculture and agro-allied processing as our area of comparative advantage would increase employment, reduce poverty and crimes, and promote overall growth and development in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThese require a comprehensive programme of action that is objective, participatory and implemented on a continuous basis in an integrated and strategic manner. We must rededicate ourselves to the Nigerian project and provide durable solutions to the prevailing situation in the country\n\nThe AANI is an association of eminent Nigerians that attended the Senior Executive Course (SEC) at the prestigious National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS), Kuru, Plateau State, since the establishment of the Institution in 1979 to date. Its members are spread across the various fields of endeavours in Nigeria.\n\nAbubakar said, \u201cWe also serve as a think-tank to all tiers of government on matters of national development, peace, and security. AANI also establish schemes for the promotion of the welfare, security, and economic advancement of its members in addition to the creation and maintaining an endowment fund for the proper observance and discharge of any of the objectives of the association.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting (AGM) is a yearly gathering of all members to discuss critical national issues and the welfare of members and how to reposition the association further to contribute more to national development. It is in line with this and the critical role of our association in national development, that the theme for this year\u2019s AGM is \u201cRepositioning AANI for greater effectiveness.\u201d\n\nActivities lined up for the AGM include a Peace Walk at the Central part of Abuja on Friday 4th March 2022 from 6am -7 am in the realization of the importance of peaceful and harmonious co-existence among Nigerians. The starting and ending point is the Old Parade Ground, Garki, Abuja.\n\nThere will be a Cocktail Party later in the evening for all members at the Swimming Poolside of Nigerian Air Force Conference Centre, Abuja, from 7 pm \u2013 8 pm.\n\nOn Saturday 5th March 2022, the association will conduct its AGM for 2022 at the Main Conference Hall of the Nigerian Air Force Conference Centre, Abuja, starting from 9 am.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Peter Okutu, Abakaliki\n\nEbonyi State Government, Saturday described the statement credited to the Ebonyi State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP over the court ruling on Governor David Umahi\u2019s defection from the PDP to the All Progressives Congress, APC, as irresponsible, without foundation and mischievously woven to attack the credibility of a well decided matter.\n\n\u201cWe discountenance with utmost responsibility, the press release of Mr. Tochukwu Okorie as absolutely irresponsible, without foundation and mischievously woven to attack the credibility of a robustly contested and well decided matter instituted by legally recognized entities and personalities who are invested with unfettered right under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) to sue and be sued; \u201c\n\nThe State High Court sitting in Abakaliki had on Monday struck out the suit challenging the defection of Governor David Nweze Umahi of Ebonyi State from the PDP to the APC in the State.\n\nThe Commissioner for Information and State Orientation, Ebonyi State, Barr. Orji Uchenna Orji who stated this in Abakaliki further explained that the \u201cdisparaging press release is politics taken too far and it goes with legal consequences.\u201d\n\nThe PDP had in a statementt expressed surprise that the Judge of the High Court of Ebonyi State failed to question the non joinder of PDP, or order the joinder of the PDP, as a party in the said matter.\n\nAccording to the Commissioner\u2019s statement: \u201cWe have noted the understandable expressions of frustration and confusion that engulfed the spirit and letters of the press release of the Chairman of People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) Ebonyi State Chapter, Mr. Tochukwu Okorie.\n\n\u201cWe view the press release as a substanceless piece calculated to sully the hard earned reputation of the Judge of the State High Court that heard and judicially and judiciously disposed of a matter properly brought before him, and that of the lawyers for both parties who diligently discharged their constitutional duties of legal representation It will be noted that the Judge never acted utra vires and that his court never acted outside the jurisdiction conferred to it by the grundnum itself.\n\n\u201cThe verbose and clumsy press release of Ebonyi State PDP Chairman gave indication that his Party, PDP had filed a suit at Federal High Court Abuja to challenge the defection of our dear Governor His Excellency, Engr. Chief David Nweze Umahi FNSE, FNATE (Akubaraoha) and his Deputy, His Excellency, Barr. Eric Kelechi Igwe PhD, from Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to All Progressives Congress (APC), Next Level. In other words, they sought to determine whether by their defection to APC, the \u2018PDP\u2019 ought not be sworn-in as the Governor.\n\n\u201cIn all of this lengthy press release, the only grouse by Mr. Tochukwu Okorie and his frustrated Party is that the People\u2019s Democratic Party was not joined in a suit filed by a candidate that came second in an election that produced our dear Governor in 2019,; the grouse of Mr. Tochukwu Okorie and his party is that the candidate who came second ought to have folded his hands and wait for PDP to be through in the Federal High Court when the law stipulates that should the winner of election cease to hold office as a result of pre- electon or electon issues, that the candidate who came second will be declared winner.\n\n\u201cWhile we intend to allow the author of the press release and his half backed advisers to swim in the ocean of ignorance of the law, especially on the jurisprudential values of originating summons and the principles of Green Vs Green on who is a necessary party, we assert that for the sake of the public, the author of the press release and his co-travelers must know that the essence of originating summons is to interpret the constructions of the law or the Constitution which is the grundnum or any other document and to make declarations thereto.\n\n\u201cWe assert further that locus standi is a condition precedent for eligibility to sue in this regard and no more. It is further averred that the necessary party or proper party is the party that will be affected by outcome of the decision in a matter having regard to the relief sought by the party(ies) before it.\n\n\u201cIn this case, the candidate recognized by the constitution as a proper party ot probable contender for the Governorship position in the pre-election or election matter is the candidate that came second. Section 188 provides the conditions and circumstances when a duly elected and sworn -in Governor and Deputy shall vacate office and it does not apply to issue of defection to another Party.\n\n\u201cWe have a plethora of authorities of superior courts which affirmed that no political Party (except Candidates) can be declared the winner of an election. It is a common knowledge that under the constitution, a candidate is declared winner of an election not a political party.\n\n\u201cWe therefore use this medium to prepare the mind of Mr. Tochukwu Okorie of PDP on the legal consequences of attempting to damage the hard earned reputation of an erudite Judge and that of the legal practitioners who are ministers in the temple of Justice. Our happiness is that the learned personalities whom the author of the press release is prosecuting on the pages of social media are legal giants that will shock him with the substance of the law.\n\n\u201cPDP has finally sold Mr. Tochukwu Okorie cheap to legal embarrassment. The Ministry of Information and State Orientation therefore views the publication of Mr. Tochukwu Okorie as the last straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back. The outcome will send a red signal to the rest of the political nonconformists in PDP on the gravity of publication of falsehood in the eyes of the law .\u201d\n\n\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Between 40,000 to 50,000 women die from pregnancy delivery causes yearly. Also, over one million children die from maternal-related deaths. If a mother dies of childbirth complications, the chance of the child surviving is slim.\n\n\u201cTo this end, the Federal Government launched the Nigeria Reproductive, Maternal, Neonatal, Child, Adolescent & Elderly Health Plus Nutrition (RMNCAEH+ N) Multi-stakeholder partnership Coordination Platform on October 9, 2020.\n\n\u201cFamily planning is not to control the number of people but for a better life and economic development. More than 90 percent of maternal deaths are preventable if we do the right thing. Contraception is one of the best ways to prevent maternal mortality because it prevents conception.\n\n\u201cAlso, because about 60 per cent of Nigerians pay out of pocket to access health, while about 70 percent live below the poverty line. We must make sure our primary health care facilities are functional. Our National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) is also there as a safety net, especially for the vulnerable.\u201d\n\nThe National Coordinator of the RMCH, Prof Emmanuel Lufadeju, decried the low uptake of modern contraception, which currently stands at 12 percent. He stated that there exists a huge unmet contraception need among women; 48 per cent for unmarried women, and 19 percent for married women.\n\n\u201cWe need to manage our population such that life will be comfortable for all. We are about 200 million now, and it is projected that in 50 years, Nigeria\u2019s population will be over 400 million. We have to take more serious efforts into managing our population. The major causes of maternal deaths in the country are preventable through family planning,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Nigerian Ambassador to Benin Republic, Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai (rtd), has said that President Muhammadu Buhari has laid a foundation for a new Nigeria, despite myriads of challenges.\n\nBuratai who is a former Chief of Army Chief Staff (COAS), made this assertion in a message to Nigerian youths, titled: \u201cDynamism in Politics and Nigeria\u2019s Founding Fathers\u201d, posted on his verified Facebook page.\n\nAccording to him, the Electoral Bill that President Buhari recently assented to, will improve the transparency and acceptability of the country\u2019s future elections and promote democratic governance\n\nHe insisted that Buhari has kept faith in his vision and principles, adding that the youths must carry these visions and principles beyond this administration.\n\nHe advised Nigerian youths not let themselves be used as willing tools by do-or-die politicians who want to stir up trouble in their communities.\n\nHe however challenged young people to embrace the tenets of political dynamism and root out every factor contributing to democratic deficit in Nigeria, such as voter apathy, ballot snatching, looting, arson, and the likes.\n\nDefining political dynamism as a vigorous political activity that is geared towards progress, the former Chief of Army, said youths can be a creative force, a dynamic source of innovations, as they have undoubtedly, throughout history, participated, contributed, and even catalysed important changes in political systems, power-sharing dynamics, and economic opportunities.\n\nBuratai said: \u201cIn countries emerging from or facing conflicts, young people can engage in peace-building by leading non-violent movements and using innovative solutions to mobilise societies to bring about the needed transformation.\n\n\u201cYoung people have demonstrated the potential to build bridges across communities, working together to help manage conflict and promote peace.\n\n\u201cYoung people play a big role in conflict and peace-building, and they can be agents of peaceful change and help rebuild lives and communities, making the world a better place.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari has laid a foundation for a new Nigeria. Despite the myriad of challenges, he has kept faith in his vision and principles. The youths must carry these visions and principles beyond this administration.\n\n\u201cThe legacies must be protected for a greater Nigeria and formidable future generations. My message to young people today is that they must not let themselves be used as willing tools by do-or-die politicians who want to stir up trouble in their communities.\n\n\u201cInstead, you must embrace the tenets of political dynamism and root out every factor that contributes to the democracy deficit in Nigeria, namely voter apathy, ballot snatching, looting, arson, and the likes.\u201d\n\nOn the Electoral Act recently assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari, Buratai said the law will undoubtedly improve the transparency and acceptability of future elections and promote democratic governance.\n\nHe said that elections devoid of integrity could not bring legitimacy to the winners, security to the losers, or public confidence in their leaders and institutions.\n\nThis, according to him, weakens polities by encouraging disaffected groups to seek out less constructive outlets for their discontent.\n\nHe said that President Buhari had laid a foundation for a new Nigeria, adding that he had kept faith with his vision and principles in spite the myriad of challenges.\n\n\u201cI respectfully disagree. We are evolving, and as you can see, the system is improving daily as a result of our leaders\u2019 periodic enhancements to the democratic system.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the 2022 Electoral Act which the President, Commander-in-Chief, President Muhammadu Buhari just signed into law, is a factor that will undoubtedly improve the transparency and acceptability of the country\u2019s future elections and promote democratic governance. Democracy remains a universal aspiration because it actually delivers.\n\n\u201cFor example, of the 20 countries with highest levels of human development as measured by the UN\u2019s human development index, 19 are liberal democracies. Among the top 40, 36 are liberal democracies.\n\n\u201cAnd even the citizens of poorer democracies live, on average, nine years longer than citizens of poor autocracies, because they have better access to health and education. Democracies are also less vulnerable to famines and conflicts,\u201d he added",

          "text": "By Chika Abanobi, Kate Halim, Chioma Okezie-Okeh, Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, And Vera Wisdom Bassey\n\nNigerians living in Ukraine have described life under the Russian invasion as hellish. The condition is heightened by a lack of basic amenities like food, water, and clothes under the harsh winter weather, and racism. Their accounts were corroborated by a Ukrainian as well as Poland-based Nigerian who is helping to take care of his trapped fellow countrymen and women.\n\nTheir revelations came as the first batch of the flights from Poland, Romania, and Hungary carrying refugee Nigerians aboard Air Peace and Max Air, arrived yesterday, at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. Though the Federal Government has budgeted $8.5m for the airlifting which is expected to bring home about 2,000 stranded Nigerians, some of the people that Saturday Sun spoke to, including a medical student and one of the parents of about 4,000 Nigerian students said to be studying in that country, criticized the government for taking the decision a bit late. All the same, they remain grateful for their efforts.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nWhat it means to be trapped in Ukraine\n\nThe Nigerian medical student, Dennis Otumudia, stranded in Kharkiv told the story of how he woke up to the sound of bombs going off around him. The young man who claimed that a lot of African students, mostly from Nigeria and Morocco, are trapped in Ukraine, stated that the major means of transportation over there are trains and metro services. But the services they provide were shut down, making it difficult for foreigners like him to leave the country.\n\nOtumudia who criticised the Nigerian government for not being proactive added that since there had been signals that something like this would happen, they should have acted fast. His words: \u201cWe were told that they would evacuate us when the airports are open. I was in Kharkiv and tried to reach the embassy for a while but the contact number I had was not connecting.\u201d\n\nNigerian students in Ukraine, he said, needed somebody to tell them what was going on but regretted that there was nobody to do that. \u201cThey needed somebody in a position of authority to give them reliable information as to what to do because they were scared of their lives but we couldn\u2019t see anybody until much later.\u201d Another medical student, Fehintola Moses, 22, told the BBC about his unsuccessful attempts to leave Sumy, in northeast Ukraine, where there had been fighting between the Ukrainian Defence Forces and the Russian troops. Sumy is also near another frontline in Kharkiv.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\nThrough WhatsApp messages and voice notes, he spoke of how his efforts to leave the city were aborted after his university told him that the train lines nearby were being controlled by Russian forces. He said he was told to stay at the campus. He added that there is no public transport in the city as some roads have been damaged. \u201cWe had a good supply of food; grocery shops are still open \u2013 which I fear may not last long,\u201d he said. \u201cThe school is providing foodstuff for people who need it. We have water. We are still trying to sleep and wake up. What we need is someone who can remove the Russian soldiers from the streets, someone who can repair the bridges, someone who can make sure the railroads are safe. That\u2019s what we honestly need right now.\u201d\n\nJohanna, a 17-year-old Nigerian who also found herself trapped in Ukraine is seriously praying to return to the country alive. \u201cI am a Nigerian studying at V.N Karazin National University, Kharkiv, Ukraine,\u201d she told an international electronic medium. \u201cI am studying medicine and I am a first-year student. Initially, I did not see the need to leave till Putin gave a date for the war. It got so serious, there were bombings in Kharkiv, my city. We had to hide in underground bunkers for our safety. We could hear the sound of the bomb; we were not sure of the next minute and there was chaos everywhere. So, I just had to leave. I have never gone through something like that before. I booked a taxi to take me to the Poland border. The driver collected a lot of money from me. He was supposed to drop me in Medyka. He did not but just said, \u2018walk down a bit and you will see Poland\u2019s border.\u2019 I met a lot of people heading to the border.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cWe were not close to the Poland border and we had to walk the whole day and throughout the night. I was very cold, very hungry, and couldn\u2019t sleep. Even if I wanted to sleep, it was too cold; I was shivering. On getting to the border, I didn\u2019t like the experience there. They just kept us waiting there for no reason. They were letting Ukrainians go. We were there for more than five hours. If you are a Ukrainian, there is no need to seek clearance. They would even push you aside to make way for their people. The fact that we are not in our country does not mean that we are not human.\u201d The young woman said she eventually managed to cross the border with a group of Ukrainian women.\n\nAnother Nigerian, Queen Alita Peter, claimed that she was forced out of a train because of her skin colour. \u201cWhen we heard about the attack, we knew that it was time to leave,\u201d she said. \u201cMeanwhile, it was already too late because some of us had flights to catch that day. In the train, a lady just told me to get out of the train for no reason. The train we boarded together. I asked her why. She said they only let children and women go. I asked her if I was a man and she said, I had to leave because I am not a Ukrainian. I told her \u2018this train does not belong to you, it belongs to the government and they want people to enter and get to the border.\u2019 She insisted that she is a Ukrainian, it is her government and she has the right to decide who enters the train and ordered me to get down.\u201d\n\nEberechukwu a 300 level student in one of the Ukrainian universities, said before the closure of the airport, he had the premonition. He thereafter alerted his parents about his uncomfortable feeling. The young man, the only child of his parents, said that not too long after he did so, his parents sent him some money to leave for the UK. But as soon as he left the country, the airport was shut down indefinitely. Another student, Damilare Toyin who finished his degree programme together with his niece who is now a medical doctor at Ile-Ife said he could not return immediately because of his intention to continue with his master\u2019s degree. But as the crisis deteriorated he took a train to Hungary. It was from there he was flown home.\n\nFrom Kiev, Ukrainian lady speaks to Saturday Sun\n\nA Ukrainian national, Kathryn Verbina, who corroborated most of the reports said that the Ukrainian military needs technical support. The woman, who, in a chat with Saturday Sun, said there was no time to talk, because \u201cmy country is at war,\u201d sent pictures and videos of the war situation to Saturday Sun, with sounds of bomb-blasts and gunfire rending the air. The pictures depict desolation, disbelief, horror, with many soldiers and civilians, including women and children, being consumed in the attacks.\n\nOne of the videos showed dead bodies of soldiers lying on the ground, with Russian soldiers closely monitored and walked around them. Also in the pictures were houses wrecked by Russian shelling. Dead bodies of children were strewn everywhere. Explaining the situation, Verbina said: \u201cI woke up at 5am because of the explosions. Men go in self-defence while women and children run into the bunkers.\u201d\n\nShe further told Saturday Sun: \u201cRight now, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Krerson and other cities are being attacked.\u201d Asked if she wished to run away to safety or stay back in Ukraine, she said: \u201cI want to remain at home.\u201d But she, however, added that she was not feeling safe. She called on the international community, especially the United Nations to tell the truth about what is going on in Ukraine.",

Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nAfenifere, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, MBF and AYCF hailed some of the amendment bills, including granting autonomy to the 774 local governments councils Nigeria as well as their rejection of life pension for Senate presidents and Speakers of the House of Representatives. But they claimed the amendments, overall, fell short of the restructuring and true federalism Nigerians wanted.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Jare Ajayi, said while certain aspects of the amendments passed by the National Assembly appeared nice on paper, they fell short of the desired restructuring to true federalism that Nigerians had been clamouring for.\n\nFor instance, he noted that the proposal to reduce the items on the Exclusive Legislative List in favour of states is commendable, but that the amendment only touched on peripheral items rather than on core subjects of true federalism.\n\nAfenifere knocked the National Assembly for not allowing state and local government police, despite the level of insecurity in the country and the failure of a centrally commanded police structure to stem the insecurity. It also condemned the attempt to remove the power to conduct local government elections from the State Independent Electoral Commissions (SIEC).\n\nHe admitted that some state governments do manipulate the SIEC to subvert electoral choices in their areas, but said the solution was not in transferring the power to conduct local government elections to the central government.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution...

In the said elections partly conducted electronically, the opposition PDP won some council areas against the ruling APC candidates.\u201d He noted that autonomy to local governments and the judiciary is a good development as some state governors fiddle with local government funds.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nPresident of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr. Pogu Bitrus, said the autonomy for local governments is a good development, and noted that the new amendment will free the local governments from the stranglehold of the state government.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt will bring the government closer to the people. It will also bring about enjoyable facilities to the grassroots, more so now that we have so much insecurity in the land. The local government with their autonomy can play a role in stabilizing their areas of control. So, it is a good and welcome development.\u201d National Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Chief Alex Ogbonnia, said autonomy for local government will mark the beginning of democratic governance in Nigeria. He noted that the cancellation of state/local government joint account will help the local governments work better as a tier of government.\n\nHe also commended the lawmakers for turning down the proposal for pension to be paid to former Senate presidents and former Speakers of the House of Representatives.\n\nPresident of the Arewa Youths Consultative Forum (AYCF), Alhaji Yerima Shettima also commended the passing of local government autonomy. He noted that autonomy for local government councils would allow the \u2018commonest\u2019 people be part and parcel of government.\n\n\u201cAgain in terms of security, people will feel that they have a stake in it government with autonomy to the local governments because people come from the community,\u201d Shetimma said.\n\nA lawyer and former President of Aka Ikenga, Chief Goddy Uwazurike, believed that a perfect document would one day be attained. He noted that there is the need for arms of government that need to be independent to be truly independent \u201cin word and deed.\u201d He also supported the listing of the power generation, distribution and transmission.\n\n\u201cLet states take care of their energy needs.

          "text": "But oil multinational sold all its shares, not JV assets to Seplat\n\nNOC\u2019s action opens up possible legal tussle\n\nBy Emmanuel Addeh\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited may have created a wedge in the highly acclaimed transaction that would have seen Seplat Energy, an indigenous oil firm, buy over oil shares belonging to ExxonMobil, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nThe deal between ExxonMobil\u2019s Nigerian unit, Mobil Oil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (MPNU), the first since the signing of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) in August last year, had attracted plaudits from industry leaders.\n\nThe Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) to acquire the entire share capital of MPNU, THISDAY had reported, was for a purchase price of $1.283 billion, plus up to $300 million contingent consideration.\n\nHowever, THISDAY learnt from officials NNPC, that the state-owned oil giant has opted to exercise its Right of First Refusal (RFR) on the sale of the assets.\n\nThe RFR is reportedly contained in the Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) of the Joint Venture (JV), which represents NNPC\u2019s position on the planned sale of the shares to Seplat Energy Plc.\n\nEfforts to get NNPC to speak on the matter were not immediately fruitful, but a top source in the oil firm told THISDAY, \u201cWe will address it at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nBut an industry source who preferred to remain anonymous said last night that NNPC\u2019s action could lead to legal tussle between Seplat and the national oil company. The source stressed that NNPC did not have the power to halt the acquisition of the multinational oil company\u2019s shares by Seplat.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cSeplat bought ExxonMobil\u2019s shares, not assets. Whereas NNPC has right of pre-emption over the sale of assets, it does not have right over sale of shares.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the source explained that with its present structure, NNPC was now a commercial entity and no longer a regulator, as it used to be in the past, \u201cso, it is the regulator that can interfere in the matter.\u201d\n\nThe source added, \u201cHowever, they have to check the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) because if they say they are taking over ExxonMobil, that means they are taking over staff, pensions and liabilities and not assets.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that NNPC had already notified Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited of its intention to exercise the right of pre-emption on ExxonMobil\u2019s planned sale of its entire asset in Nigeria\u2019s onshore and shallow waters.\n\nHowever, a reliable source told THISDAY that the politics underlying the stoppage of the deal could markedly derail the new verve the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) was expected to bring to the industry.\n\nIt was learnt that NNPC was intending to have a special arrangement with a company belonging to a northerner operating in the oil and gas industry, under a \u201cstrategic management contract.\u201d\n\nIndustry sources said that the state-owned oil firm, which is the major shareholder in the JV with ExxonMobil, might have exercised its right of first refusal on the assets as part of a new era, which will focus solely on building the long-term profitability of the NNPC Limited.\n\nThe Mele Kyari-led company had previously conveyed its decision to exercise its rights and match any offer by interested parties for the assets following ExxonMobil\u2019s decision to receive bids for their share of the JV, the platform reported.\n\nSeplat Energy subsequently put forward a winning bid for the assets and reached an agreement with ExxonMobil.\n\nRight of pre-emption is a legal right to parties in a joint venture to be the first to be considered for any planned sale or takeover of assets in the JVs if either party choose to trade them off.\n\nA letter signed by the Group Managing Director, Kyari, and addressed to ExxonMobil, quoted NNPC as reiterating its resolve to take over the company\u2019s share of the assets.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that you reached an agreement to divest from onshore and shallow waters JVs,\u201d the letter read, adding, \u201cClearly we are interested.\u201d\n\nAnnouncing the agreement, ExxonMobil had earlier said that the deals were subject to approval and the new position of NNPC, meaning that the whole process of sale and purchase agreement between ExxonMobil and Seplat Energy has to be discontinued.\n\nSeplat Energy, the company that made the winning bid, had staked over $1.2 billion for the deal to acquire the entire share capital of MPNU plus contingent consideration and was waiting for the minister\u2019s consent before the latest development.\n\nThis meant that the state-owned oil firm must not, based on its exercise of right of first refusal, pay below the $1.2 billion mark.\n\nAccording to the letter, NNPC also reiterated that it had already transformed from being a corporation to being a profit driven company and it now had the capacity to buy over the share of ExxonMobil in the Joint venture.\n\nThe NNPC had recently announced a funding agreement with Afreximbank for up to $5 billion to grow its investment in new and existing upstream assets.\n\nRecently, the publishers of Africa Oil and Gas Report raised the alarm over the attempt by the national oil company to crowd out private investors, saying that enough space should be created for some level of diversity in investment. That alarm has now proved to be a wakeup call on increasingly seemingly grab all posture.\n\nCommenting on the pre-emption rights as expressed by NNPC, Publisher of the magazine, Toyin Akinosho, who had spoken on Arise News Channel, urged NNPC to free the space for entrepreneurs to come in, insisting that the company already has a lot in its basket and was even finding it difficult to cope.\n\nAkinosho maintained, \u201cNNPC is in JV with companies that produce at least 45 per cent of our crude. That\u2019s a lot of material for them already. The assets they operate are the least optimised of all the assets in the industry.\u201d\n\nWhile accusing NNPC of grabbing assets all over the country, he wondered why the national oil company was allegedly stifling investment in the sector. According to him, the kind of partners that NNPC may hand over the assets to are always not the most experienced in the space, adding that the whole idea is \u201cgift\u201d it to a third party.\n\n\u201cIt would not manage the assets, so any excuse about \u2018this being taken over in the interest of the state\u2019 is untrue. In the last three years, it has implemented Finance and Technical Service Agreements (FTSAs), with companies that it chooses to work the assets,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*NDLEA to arraign suspended \u2018super cop,\u2019 four IRT members on eight counts of drug trafficking\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe federal government has commenced moves to extradite the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Abba Kyari, to the United States of America to face fraud allegations.\n\nFew hours after the extradition process commenced, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), which currently has Kyari in its custody following his arrest for alleged illicit drug dealing, also initiated a court process against him. By this development, Kyari, four of his colleagues in the Inspector General of Police Special Intelligence Response Team (IRT), and two others would be arraigned any moment on drug-related charges.\n\nNDLEA filed an eight-count criminal charge against the defendants at the Federal High Court, Abuja.\n\nThe implication of the NDLEA court action against Kyari is that he cannot be extradited to the US, even though the federal government has commenced the extradition process.\n\nSection 3 (f) of the Extradition Act says, \u201cA fugitive criminal- (a) who has been charged with an offence under the law of Nigeria or any part thereof, not being the offence for which his surrender is sought; or (b) who is serving a sentence imposed in respect of any such offence by a court in Nigeria, shall not be surrendered until such a time as he has been discharged whether by acquittal or on the expiration of his sentence or otherwise.\u201d\n\nKyari, a once celebrated officer of the Nigeria Police, is currently enmeshed in various criminal allegations in connection with cases for which the \u201csuper cop\u201d had previously won accolades for fighting.\n\nFollowing the arrest and imprisonment of Abass Ramon, a.k.a Hushpuppi, over a $1.1 million wire fraud and Ramon\u2019s alleged implication of Kyari, who was then Commander of the Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT), the United States had requested the extradition of Kyari to explain his alleged involvement in the crime.\n\nMonths after the extradition request, yesterday, the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), disclosed that the federal government had filed an application for the extradition of Kyari before the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Abuja. Malami stated that the application, which followed a request by the diplomatic representative of the American embassy in Abuja, was filed under the Extradition Act and marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/249/2022.\n\nOnly recently, the AGF, while speaking during a television programme, assured that the President Muhammadu Buhari administration would extradite Kyari to the US to answer to the fraud charge filed against him, Hushpuppi, and four others if the government felt convinced to do so.\n\nSpeaking on the extradition application, the minister said it was \u201cfor the surrender of Abba Kyari, who is a subject in a superseding three counts indictment.\u201d He said the offence for which Kyari\u2019s extradition was being made was not political or trivial.\n\nMalami added that the request for the surrender of Kyari was not made to persecute or punish him on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinions, but in good faith and the interest of justice.\n\nThe minister stated that if surrendered, Kyari would not be victimised at his trial and will not be punished, detained or have his personal liberty restricted due to race, nationality or political opinions.\u201d\n\nMalami explained that having regard to all the circumstances in which the offence was committed, it would not be unjust or oppressive, or too severe a punishment, to surrender him. He noted that there was no criminal proceeding pending against Kyari in Nigeria for the same offence.\n\nNDLEA to Arraign Kyari, Four IRT Members on Eight-count Drug Charge\n\nThe federal government would any time from now arraign Kyari, four of his colleagues in the IRT, and two others on drug related offences.\n\nKyari and his co-accused were arrested on February 14 and handed over to the police for investigation over allegations bordering on illicit drug dealing.\n\nThe charge, filed yesterday and marked FHC/ABJ/CR/57/2022, was signed by NDLEA\u2019s Director, Prosecution and Legal Services, Mr. Joseph Sunday.\n\nBefore yesterday\u2019s suit, the anti-drug agency had obtained a court order to detain Kyari and others for another 14 days to enable it conclude its investigation and then charge them to court.\n\nOthers listed in the charge included Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Sunday Ubua; Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), Bawa James; Inspector Simon Agirigba; Inspector John Nuhu; Chibuinna Patrick Umeibe; and Emeka Alphonsus Ezenwanne.\n\nIn count one, Kyari, ACP Ubua, ASP James, Inspector Agirigba, and Inspector Nuhu, all of Intelligence Response Team were said to have between January 19 and 25, dealt in 17. 55 kilogrammes of cocaine and committed and offence contrary to and punishable under section 14 (b) of the Natural Drug Law Enforcement Agency Act, CAP 30, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004.\n\nCount one read, \u201cThat you DCP Abba Kyari, ACP Sunday J.

          "text": "*EU observer mission meets parties, stakeholders ahead of next year\u2019s polls\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), yesterday, dashed the hope and plans of many people, when it declared it would not register any new political parties, because they would not be able to participate in the 2023 general election by law.\n\nINEC, which claimed that the reason was because the new Electoral Act barred the registration of new political parties to participate in any general election twelve months before, added also that the same new electoral law, allowed for the merger of political parties, only nine months to the general elections.\n\nThere are currently 18 registered political parties in the country.\n\nHowever, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, called on INEC to be truly independent in the conduct of subsequent elections and not allow itself to be manipulated as was the case in 2019, which its National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, claimed the opposition party won but was denied.\n\nThe PDP also called on all security agencies not to allow themselves to be used to subvert electoral processes as was done during the Federal Capital Territory and other elections in Imo and Plateau States recently.\n\nAt the same time, the European Union (EU) Election Observation Follow-up Mission, led by the Head of EU Observation Mission, Mrs Maria Arena, yesterday, hinted that it has held talks with political parties and other stakeholders ahead of next elections and would give a report of its meetings soon.\n\nSpeaking at a town hall meeting organised by the Nigeria Guild of Editors, INEC national commissioner in charge of Publicity and Chairman Voters Education, Festus Okoye, reiterated that, \u201cThe Act also provides that new political association must apply for registration not later than 12 months before a general election while applications for merger must be filed not later than 9 months before election.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that registration and their participation were already time barred, Okoye said, INEC has already released the timetable and schedule of activities for the conduct of the 2023 general election, fixing Presidential and National Assembly elections to hold on the 25th of February 2023 and Governorship and State Assembly Elections to hold on the 11th of March 2023.\n\nHe said the law provided that the election funds due to the Commission for any general elections were to be released to the Commission not later than one year before the election.\n\nOkoye explained that Nigeria was entering a critical and challenging phase in its electoral process as there were new, creative and progressive provisions and innovations in the new law, adding: \u201cThe law has tight timelines that must be carefully managed.\n\nUnder the new law, the Commission shall issue the Notice of Election not later than 360 days before the date fixed for the conduct of elections. Political parties must submit the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates not later than 180 days before the election.\u201d\n\nThe INEC national commissioner said the new law contained such new provisions relating to ballot boxes and voting devices, accreditation of voters, determination of over-voting, visually impaired and incapacitated voters, post-election procedure and collation of election results.\n\nAccording to Okoye, \u201cIt also contains power of the Commission to review declared results, nomination of candidates, limitation of election expenses and the jurisdiction of courts in pre-election matters among other provisions.\u201d\n\nHe called on the media to isolate and analyse these provisions and thereafter treat the entire law as a compound package for the conduct of elections in Nigeria.\n\nAccordingly, he said a good knowledge of the law and its provisions would assist in crafting good editorials and holding the Commission and the Political Parties accountable to their implementation.\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe 2023 general election will come with challenges and the Commission is determined to surmount these challenges and conduct free, fair, credible and inclusive election. Growing insecurity in several parts of the country and the increasing number of internally displaced persons will pose challenges to the conduct of the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cSo many of the internally displaced persons are in the houses of friends and relatives and have lost their Permanent Voters Cards and it is next to impossibility to recreate their constituencies and polling units.\n\n\u201cThis is because section 47(1) of the Electoral Act clearly provides that a person intending to vote in an election shall present himself with his voter\u2019s card to a Presiding Officer for accreditation at the polling unit in the constituency in which his name is registered.\n\n\u201cSome of these persons are no longer in their constituencies and can no longer access their polling units and so many of them have lost their Permanent Voters Cards. While it is easy to recreate constituencies and polling units in clustered camps of Internally Displaced Persons (IDP camps), it is next to impossibility to do so for persons staying in scattered locations,\u201d he stated\n\nIn view of this, Okoye said, \u201cFor the internally displaced, the Commission will print new Permanent Voters Cards for them and recreate their polling units in their camps and they will be eligible to vote in some of the elections depending on their location and their proximity to their State and Federal Constituencies.\n\n\u201cThis is in accord with section 24(1) of the Electoral Act, which provides that, \u2018In the event of an emergency affecting an election, the Commission shall, as far as practicable, ensure that persons displaced as a result of the emergency are not disenfranchised.\n\n\u201cBased on this, the Commission developed regulations and guidelines on IDP voting and will implement the intendment of the law and the Regulations and Guidelines,\u201d he disclosed\n\nOkoye hinted that the Commission was currently at the terminal phase of its Continuous Voters Registration Exercise (CVR), as there were so many communities that were still inaccessible to INEC registration officers.\n\nHis words: \u201cIn the next few weeks, the Commission will roll out modalities for the further devolution and rotation of the CVR to our registration areas and the security of our personnel and the registrants are fundamental to the success of the exercise.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to register all eligible registrants but will not expose our staff to unnecessary danger. We will roll out and roll back depending on the security situation in different parts of the country.\u201d\n\nHe stated said that it was important for the media to continue to highlight and analyse the causes and possible solutions to the security challenges in the country and continue to hold government accountable.\n\nHe equally explained that the various security agencies must try as much as possible to degrade if not neutralise the security threats and challenges in different parts of the country, adding that voting and the exercise of democratic mandate might not be the priority of persons enveloped in a climate and atmosphere of fear and anxiety.\n\nOn the innovations in the Commission, he said. \u201cAs some of you are aware, the Commission has introduced new and creative changes in the enumeration of voters, the party nomination processes and the conduct of elections. The Commission is currently conducting the Continuous Voters Registration Exercise (CVR) both physically and online using the new INEC Voter Enrolment Device (IVED).\n\n\u201cThe Commission has introduced an online nomination portal through which Political Parties upload the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates. The Commission has also introduced an online portal through which international and domestic observers and the media apply for accreditation.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has also introduced the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) for voter accreditation and authentication. The Commission introduced the INEC Result Viewing Portal (iRev) through which polling unit level results are uploaded to a result-viewing portal in real time.\n\n\u201cThe Commission is firmly of the view that greater use of technology in the electoral process will, to a large extent, reduce human interference in the voting, counting and collation process.\u201d\n\nHowever, Okoye said the Commission was conscious of the fact that technology did not operate itself and that the human element is ever present, but added, that the Commission would continue to learn from issues and challenges that arise from the deployment of technology as well as innovate and improve on them.\n\nMeanwhile, Ayu, who spoke yesterday when the EU Observation Mission visited, maintained that the party had evidence that security agencies were used to subvert the electoral processes in the recent bye-election in some states, while charging its members to henceforth rise up and defend their votes.\n\nSpeaking at the PDP national secretariat, Ayu charged INEC to be genuinely independent to enable democracy to thrive in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, the PDP was not making flimsy excuses of the security agencies being used to subvert the electoral processes, adding, \u201cWe have the hard core evidence and we have submitted same to INEC.\u201d\n\nHe said the PDP would mobilise and sensitise the voters as well as asked them to defend their votes when the need arises\n\n\u201cWe have seen a decline in those things, which were promoted as a political party, including the establishments or creating of certain institutions that will strengthen democracy in this country. And, therefore, we are very worried that those, instead of strengthening the democratic process, which will see democracy sustained, we see a sustained decline in those democratic practices,\u201d he said.\n\nHe identified such things like the conduct of elections, use of security services to attack judges, to attack citizens, instead of protecting them to survive the electoral process.\n\n\u201cWe have evidence; I will stand by our position. We are happy that these are not just empty pronouncements, even you. You have shown to me in 2019 report, which you have read \u2013 shows clearly some of those problems that we\u2019re complaining \u2013 we\u2019ll keep complaining as long as these practices are sustained,\u201d Ayu stated .\n\nThe PDP National Chairman explained that the party had evidence that it won the 2019 general election, and lamented that justice was not done.\n\nAccording to him, it would not be good to allow such injustice to continue as was the case in the last FCT elections, where it was awarded three local governments of Abuja Municipal Area, Kuje and Bwari area councils, whereas it won 44 councillors and the APC won only 18 councillors.\n\nHe insisted that the electoral processes were subverted, because Abaji, Kwali and Gwagwalada area councils were in the rural areas of the FCT\n\nThe Head, EU Observation Mission, Arena, said the mission had been in the country meeting political parties, stakeholders and media in the last five days and would make its findings known to the public soon.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Evacuation of Nigerians Delayed After Flight Exceeded Allotted Duty Hours",
          "text": "*First batch expected to arrive today\n\n*Ukraine says talks with Russia agreed on humanitarian corridors\n\nChinedu Eze and Dike Onwuamaeze\n\nThe authorities of Chopin Airport, Warsaw, yesterday cancelled the evacuation flight that was expected to bring in from Poland the first batch of Nigerians that escaped the on-going conflict between Ukraine and Russia. The plane was to take off from that airport.\n\nIn continuing reactions to the conflict, particularly by Western countries and institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group yesterday declared support for the people of Ukraine and decried the war raging in the country that has caused devastating human and economic consequences.\n\nThe US White House yesterday announced new sanctions on Russian oligarchs in President Joe Biden\u2019s latest attempt to squeeze Russian President Vladimir Putin as the invasion of Ukraine advanced.\n\nThe flight meant to evacuate stranded Nigerians was cancelled because the aircraft overstayed its allotted duty hours. The crew that operated the Air Peace flight from Nigeria to Poland had spent their allotted hours of duty and, according to international standards, they could not exceed the allotted hours.\n\nFlight and Duty Time Limitations (FTL) recognised by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is the rule, which ensures that aircrew fatigue does not decrease flight safety.\n\nSince most aviation incidents and accidents are result of human factors, fatigue is taken into account as a major factor, which also contributes to the human error. Therefore, fatigue of crewmembers has been an issue in civil aviation since the 1944 Chicago Convention.\n\nThe Nigerian evacuation flight was shifted to early today morning and it was expected to arrive the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, later today.\n\nAmbassador Bolaji Akinremi, who arrived Poland with the Air Peace flight, disclosed this.\n\nAkinremi explained to Arise TV, \u201cThe reality is that the flight has been rescheduled to tomorrow (Friday). The main reason is because of the delay during the check in because they have to gather them together from different hotels and by the time we would be ready after the check in, the crew that had been waiting since 9:00 am overshot their duty hour, which is allocated to them.\n\n\u201cThey have waited from 9am to 2pm. It means they have already waited five hours and they are going to have nine hours flight. That is already more than the standard allowed. So the authorities of the airport said they won\u2019t allow us to go.\n\n\u201cSo we have to come down. But arrangement has been made to ensure that we all stay together in the same hotel and we will leave very early tomorrow, 4am with the bus so that we can join the flight early.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Ambassador to Poland, Christian Ugwu, who was visibly worried over the postponement of the flight, attributed the delay to the unruly behaviour of some Nigerians who could not prepare quickly to board the flight, but also expressed optimism that the flight would take off today.\n\n\u201cI am very sure by tomorrow morning the flight will take off,\u201d Ugwu said.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that before the flight was cancelled, passengers had been allowed to board and they had all been stamped after passing through security. They were already in the aircraft before the airport authorities announced the cancellation, so the evacuees had to de-board.\n\nHowever, about 1,500 Nigerians may be missing as out of the 2,222 that were received only about 600 could be accounted for.\n\nArise News reported, \u201cNigerian authorities, the Nigerian embassy here in Poland, said they only had a count of 600. But it seems at this point, there are more than 1,500 Nigerians, who are missing.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, President Muhammed Buhari announced the approval of $8.5 million for the evacuation of about 5, 000 Nigerians who had moved from Ukraine to neighbouring countries where they were expected to be evacuated from.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs had arranged the evacuation of Nigerians from Ukraine\u2019s neighbouring countries.\n\nThe chartered flights were initially arranged to depart on Wednesday, to bring the first batch of Nigerians home on Thursday.\n\nThe following Nigerians, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs records indicated that evacuees received by Nigerian embassies at Hungary were 650 persons, Poland 350 persons, Romania 940 persons and Slovakia 150 persons.\n\nThe Ministry arranged that Max Air would airlift Nigerians from Romania (560 persons), Air Peace to Poland (364 persons), and Air Peace to Poland (360) persons.\n\nThe first batch of evacuees was expected to arrive Nigeria on Thursday, March 3, 2022.\n\nIMF, World Bank Declare Support for Ukraine, Mobilise $5.2bn\n\nThe IMF and the World Bank Group declared support for the people of Ukraine and decried the war raging in the country that has caused devastating human and economic toll.\n\nThe Brent Wood institutions made their views known about the war that was provoked by Russia\u2019s recent invasion of Ukraine in a joint statement signed by Managing Director of IMF, Ms. Kristalina Georgieva, and the President of World Bank Group, Mr. David Malpass.\n\nThe statement reads in part, \u201cWe are deeply shocked and saddened by the devastating human and economic toll brought by the war in Ukraine. People are being killed, injured, and forced to flee, and massive damage is caused to the country\u2019s physical infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe stand with the Ukrainian people through these horrifying developments.\u201d\n\nGeorgieva and Malpass noted that the war was also creating significant spill overs to other countries while commodity prices were being driven higher at the risk of further fuelling inflation that hit the poor the hardest.\n\nThey said, \u201cDisruptions in financial markets will continue to worsen should the conflict persist. The sanctions announced over the last few days will also have a significant economic impact. We are assessing the situation and discussing appropriate policy responses with our international partners.\n\n\u201cOur institutions are working together to support Ukraine on the financing and policy fronts and are urgently increasing that support. We have been in daily contact with the authorities on crisis measures.\n\n\u201cAt the IMF, we are responding to Ukraine\u2019s request for emergency financing through the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI), which our board could consider as early as next week.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we continue to work on Ukraine\u2019s Stand-By Arrangement program, under which an additional $2.2 billion is available between now and the end of June.\u201d\n\nThe statement also said the World Bank Group was \u201cpreparing a $3 billion package of support in the coming months, starting with a fast-disbursing budget support operation for at least $350 million that will be submitted to the board for approval this week, followed by $200 million in fast-disbursing support for health and education.\u201d\n\nIt explained that this package would include the mobilisation of financing from several development partners, and welcomed the already-announced support from many bilateral partners.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe World Bank and the IMF are also working together to assess the economic and financial impact of the conflict and refugees on other countries in the region and the world. We stand ready to provide enhanced policy, technical, and financial support to neighboring countries as needed. Coordinated international action will be crucial to mitigate risks and navigate the treacherous period ahead. This crisis affects the lives and livelihoods of people around the world, and we offer them our full support.\u201d\n\nWhite House Announces New Sanctions on Russian Oligarchs\n\nThe White House has announced new sanctions on Russian oligarchs, in Biden\u2019s latest attempt to squeeze Putin.\n\nThe new list of individuals described as \u201cPutin\u2019s cronies and their family members\u201d would be cut off from the US financial system, their assets in the US would be frozen, and their property would be blocked from use, according to a fact sheet from the White House.\n\nAccording to the CNN, there would be full blocking sanctions on eight Russian elites, plus their family members and associates.\n\nIt included a move to target Putin ally Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov, \u201cone of Russia\u2019s wealthiest individuals,\u201d according to the White House, and will include his super-yacht and private jet.\n\nThe US is also sanctioning Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, whom the White House described as \u201ca top purveyor of Putin\u2019s propaganda.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States and governments all over the world will work to identify and freeze the assets Russian elites and their family members hold in our respective jurisdictions \u2014 their yachts, luxury apartments, money, and other ill-gotten gains,\u201d the fact sheet said.\n\nOther individuals who would be subject to full blocking sanctions are: Nikolai Tokarev (along with his wife Galina, daughter Mayya and his two luxury real estate companies); Boris Rotenberg (along with his wife Karina, and his sons Roman and Boris); Arkady Rotenberg (along with his sons Pavel and Igor and daughter Liliya); and Sergei Chemezov (along with his wife Yekaterina, his son Stanislav and stepdaughter Anastasiya).\n\nThe list also included Igor Shuvalov (along with his five companies, his wife Olga, his son Evgeny and his company and jet, and his daughter Maria and her company), and Yevgeniy Prigozhin (along with his three companies, his wife, Polina, his daughter Lyubov, and his son Pavel).\n\nThe US disclosed that it would also impose visa restrictions on 19 oligarchs and 47 of their family members and close associates.\n\nThat would target oligarchs, \u201cknown to direct, authorise, fund, significantly support, or carry out malign activities in support of Russia\u2019s destabilising foreign policy.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Treasury will also issue sanctions on disinformation targets. That includes SDN Strategic Culture Foundation and associated outlets Odna Rodyna, Rhythm of Eurasia, and Journal Kamerton; SouthFront; SDN InfoRos; New Eastern Outlook; Oriental Review; United World International; and Geopolitical.\n\nIt will also designate \u201c26 Russia and Ukraine-based individuals who play central roles in these organisations, enabling the Government of the Russian Federation\u2019s efforts to spread disinformation and influence perceptions as a part of their invasion of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe US and its allies have taken a wide range of actions in recent weeks intended to punish Moscow for the invasion, including harsh new sanctions and export controls aimed at imposing severe costs on the Russian economy.\n\nBiden announced on Tuesday the US would ban Russian aircraft from US airspace, joining a growing number of countries who have closed their skies to Russia. The US and its allies have also agreed to release 60 million barrels of oil from their reserves.\n\nUkraine Says Talks with Russia Agreed on Humanitarian Corridors\n\nA Ukrainian negotiator said yesterday that a second round of ceasefire talks with Russia had not yielded the results Kyiv hoped for, but the sides had reached an understanding on creating humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians.\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the two sides envisaged a possible temporary ceasefire to allow for the evacuation of civilians.\n\n\u201cThat is, not everywhere, but only in those places where the humanitarian corridors themselves will be located, it will be possible to cease fire for the duration of the evacuation,\u201d Reuters quoted him to have said.\n\nThey had also reached an understanding on the delivery of medicines and food to the places where the fiercest fighting was taking place. It was the first time the two sides had agreed any form of progress on any issue since Russia invaded Ukraine a week ago.\n\nPodolyak said the outcome had fallen short of Kyiv\u2019s hopes, however.\n\n\u201cTo our great regret, we did not get the results we were counting on,\u201d he said, without elaborating.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I can say is that we discussed the humanitarian aspect in sufficient detail, because quite a lot of cities are now surrounded. There is a dramatic situation with medicines, food, and evacuation,\u201d Podolyak said\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

These are conversations we never had before and of course, in Nigeria and in Africa they still tell you \u2018can you imagine, men are talking and women are talking\u2019 which is that it is not acceptable that a man should be talking and a woman is talking,\u201d Kukah said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned, people like myself or my small ethnic group that is marginalised even at local government level, I am asking if we are going to create a space for women, and I think we should, but we must agree on the kind of women who are going to benefit from that quota.\n\n\u201cBecause if it is just the same big boys who are coming with their mistresses and their extra wives, it is not acceptable.\n\n\u201cUnless you are going to say that we create a quota for women but in creating that quota we must listen to 70, 80 percent of Nigerians who are not Igbos, who are not Hausas, who are not Fulanis, who are not those of us who have the right to be here.\n\n\u201cSo I would suggest, yes grant the quota, but the quota cannot be benefitted\u2026 nobody who was already benefiting should benefit from that quota.\u201d",

          "title": "Vault Hill is building a human-centric metaverse. What about it?",
          "text": "Jimi Daodu has always been entrepreneurial. Back at Babcock University, he had established an entertainment business that organised parties in the school. After Daodu completed his master\u2019s programme in Advanced Computing at the University of Bristol, he wanted to stay back in the UK for a couple of years to work and earn back his master\u2019s fees. At the time, Daodu recalled, the British government allowed international students to apply for a post-work-study visa, which grants one a two-year stay in the UK. Daodu got the post-work-study visa, but things started to look grim when, for months, he couldn\u2019t get a job. Frustrated from his job search, Daodu contemplated booking a return ticket to Nigeria and returning to his shoe selling business.\n\nHe eventually got a job that sustained him until he got yet another which secured a visa for him and got him to stay. In the past decade, Daodu has worked in project management, hospitality, financial services, and the telecommunications industries all in the UK.\n\nDaodu was born in Lagos, Nigeria, and lived most of his years in the bustling city. He had studied Computer Science at Babcock University before going to the UK for a master\u2019s degree in Advanced Computing at the University of Bristol.\n\nIn 2017, Daodu got into the crypto space, Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin (BTC) were buzzy, so, he bought a couple. He then stumbled on virtual lands and saw them as an opportunity to diversify his digital assets and, as a Nigerian accustomed to the notion that land is the best investment, he bought some, even though he knew nothing about virtual lands. He got 8 plots of land in virtual spaces: 2 plots in Decentraland and 6 in Somnium Space for $200 each.\n\nThe idea for what would become a blockchain-based metaverse company, Vault Hill, started to form last February when he got an email stating that there was an offer on his land. He accepted the offer and sold a plot of land in Somnium Space for $10,000. He was stunned because he hadn\u2019t gotten such a high return from the stocks and shares he had purchased.\n\nHe realised that the only reason the buyer paid that much was because of the value associated with the virtual land, so, he realised that there was a market there. When he shared his idea with his friends, they said, \u201dJimi, you have come with your ideas again!\u201d But Daodu assured them: \u201cThis is the one.\u201d\n\nFounder and CEO of Vault Hill, Jimi Daodu\n\nIn May 2021, Daodu started bootstrapping Vault Hill by selling a few investments as well as plots of land in Somnium Space, for amounts ranging from $9,000 to $12,000. To differentiate itself from other virtual spaces and metaverse, Vault Hill City (Vault Hill\u2019s Metaverse) has four different islands and each island has 7 human-themed districts: Play, Romance, Curiosity, Community, Idealism, Vitality, and Imagination. \u201cEach district is human-themed to ensure the metaverse is open to everybody. This space is infinite; it is hard to choose a target audience, so we want to build an ecosystem where anyone can come in.\u201d Currently, the cost of a plot of land in a district in Vault Hill City range between $2,000 and $2,600.\n\nDaodu describing a metaverse, said, \u201cMetaverse is a shared virtual space. It\u2019s like Twitter, but in a gamified perspective\u2014the use of augmented reality and virtual reality. In a metaverse, you have to create a digital representation of yourself called an avatar, which allows you to navigate the digital world since you can\u2019t go into the digital world with your physical body.\u201d Daodu\u2019s definition of a metaverse involves a connection to the blockchain, decentralised finance, and freedom from control by the government, or even private individuals.\n\nIt is in respect to this vision that Vault Hill is building through 3 phases and at the end of the third phase, Vault Hill is handed over to a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO)\u2014the community of token and landowners\u2014which will be responsible for decision making on its metaverse.\n\nVault Hill is building a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace to allow NFT artists to list their art on the metaverse and display it to potential buyers through a gamified experience. Vault Hill is also encouraging companies to build edifices in their metaverse. The two plots of land Daodu bought on Decentraland were merged together to build Vault Hill\u2019s sales office.\n\nVault Hill is also partnering with Ready Player Me to build out avatars and incorporate digital wearables and limited-edition accessories. It is also partnering with Nigerian brands including Crivel Watches and Looks Like a Good Man for corporate and traditional wear. \u201cAdditionally, we are currently working to have interoperability of avatars. That is, using one avatar across multiple metaverses instead of having to create one for Vault Hill, and another for Decentraland,\u201d Vault Hill said. Vault Hill Part is also partnering with Lingua54 to use machine learning to translate the speeches of avatars across different languages in real time.\n\nAs funding was a constant headache for the team, Vault Hills started talking to traditional venture capitalists to raise funds, but a lot of them didn\u2019t understand what they were building. A senior colleague, at the time, had said \u201cIf you\u2019re talking to VCs, and they don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re building, you\u2019re doing something right.\u201d\n\nTo meet its funding needs, Vault Hill created a token called VHC token\u2014which is currently going for $0.003697 on Coin Market Cap, as of the time of writing. With it, Vault Hill raised $2.1 million in pre-pre-seed and private equity rounds, selling 25% of its total supply of tokens of 340 million. The majority of the fund will go into product development and hiring, Daodu said.\n\nMajority holders of the VHC token or majority landowners in the Vault Hill City will have voting power in the DAO. The VHC token will serve as a medium of a transaction within the metaverse, give majority token holders voting power in Vault Hill\u2019s proposed DAO and reward content creators when they get to sell or get traction for their artworks and content.\n\nDaodu speaks about the challenges of building a metaverse company: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a book on how to build a metaverse, so there isn\u2019t anything like what a good one looks like.\u201d But one challenge stands out: getting talent. \u201cYou need a host of developers\u2014extended reality developers, a mix of augmented and virtual reality developers, blockchain developers, full-stack developers, etc, but because it is an emerging technology and these skills are not taught in most traditional schools yet, they can be difficult to find.\u201d\n\nBut Daodu is optimistic, especially about the increase in VR adoption in recent years, which he said is both the cost and effect of the cost of the tech. \u201cAs adoption grows, the cost of technology always drops. The Oculus quest is retailing for $300, would that get to $50- $100 at some point in time? Absolutely. People are already spending $1,000 on an iPhone every year.\u201d\n\nDaodu noted that Vault Hill is not building an escapism platform, but intentionally thinking about how humans do things in the real world and then creating a way to augment it virtually\u2014with an ultimate aim of fostering human interaction. For example, in its Vitality district, it will collaborate with physiotherapists to help people with mental health challenges and create an augmented reality (AR) consultation service for London Bridge sports medicine, which will allow patients that can\u2019t come in physically for consultation in the hospital to get consultation services through augmented reality.\n\nThe first glance of Vault Hill City will be up by Q2 2022 and by the end of the year, it will be fully running. \u201cUsers will be able to design their own unique experiences, explore their fantasies, and also enjoy activities they do in the physical world such as interacting with other users, attending events, playing games, curating arts, exercising, host shows, visiting a library, build a music studio, and so much more,\u201d Vault Hill said. \u201cUsers will be able to access the metaverse using a virtual reality headset for a fully immersive experience. But they will also be able to explore the metaverse through laptops.\u201d\n\n\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Two years and 3 million rides later, can SafeBoda keep its lead in Nigeria?",
          "text": "On Wednesday, Ibadan-based Ugandan bike hailing startup SafeBoda clocked two years of operating in the Nigerian market.\n\nSafeBoda launched in Nigeria in December 2019 but started operations in January 2020. The startup had initially set to launch in May 2019 but months of deliberations\u2014including that of the best city market entry\u2014delayed its launch.\n\nThen, finally, in a surprising move which immediately created an outlier reputation for the company, SafeBoda skipped Lagos, the Nigerian commercial hub, to launch in Ibadan, a decision that continues to pay off\u2014especially considering that the Lagos government shutdown bike hailing businesses a month after it launched.\n\nSafeBoda\u2019s growth since its launch has been groundbreaking. In June 2020, about 6 months after its operation started, it reached a milestone of 100,000 rides. Also, in August 2020, it grew 150% and recorded 250,000 rides. And by the end of the year, while it was pausing its Kenyan operation, it celebrated half a million rides in Nigeria.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHowever, its defining growth started when in April 2021, the startup reached the 1 million rides milestone; that\u2019s a 150% growth in a month. Prior to that, it had done the same rate quarterly, and since then to date, it\u2019s been bumping up the numbers.\n\nAs anyone would expect, an increase in the number of rides must have been the result of an increase in other proportional metrics. By June 2021, 100,000 passengers had signed up on the platform, and 3 months after that, its 8,000th rider was onboarded. And in November it was doing 20,000 rides daily.\n\nFast forward to today, SafeBoda claims to have recorded over 3 million rides, more than 10,000 riders, over 100,000 users, and completed 50,000 deliveries.\n\nThe startup currently offers 3 services in Nigeria: rides, deliveries, and airtime purchase. The payment vertical which has already launched in Uganda, will launch in Nigeria soon.\n\nThe end and the beginning of an era\n\nSafeBoda is endearing to people for many reasons. One of them is its first Nigeria Country Director Babajide Duroshola, who led the startup from launching till June last year when he exited for another East African startup that had just expanded into Nigeria.\n\nSafeBoda Nigeria\u2019s new Country Director Olaoluwa Arokoyu\n\nChanging leadership always comes with challenges and SafeBoda faced its fair share. But it quickly made an internal replacement when it appointed its Head of Operation Olaoluwa Arokoyu as CEO. Arokoyu had previously worked in operations with Opay and Jumia and joined SafeBoda 5 months prior to Duroshola\u2019s exit.\n\nEver since his appointment, Arokoyu has achieved some laudable milestones including taking the company from 2 million rides to over 3 million rides, optimising the app for address verification during the onboarding process to reduce fraudulent activities, and improving how riders are being paid to increase brand loyalty among riders.\n\nCreating a better experience for all\n\nSafeBoda says it\u2019s as compassionate with its riders the same way it is with passengers. It says in a statement that it\u2019s constantly looking for a better way to increase the earning power of its riders while giving passengers a good experience. \u201cAs a result of this increased earning power, SafeBoda riders and their families have access to a more quality lifestyle.\u201d\n\n\u201cSafeBoda\u2019s primary mission is to provide a better standard of living for drivers and customers. Everything we do is aligned with this goal,\u201d Arokoyu told TechCabal.\n\nSafeBoda\u2019s riders in Ibadan\n\nFor SafeBoda riders like Ghazali Saheed, who\u2019s the 5964th rider that joined the bike-hailing startup, the best thing about SafeBoda is the respect they [the riders] get from customers that other riders don\u2019t get. \u201cSafeBoda also makes it easy to set targets and reach them. It\u2019s easy for us to know where to get a lot of orders so that we can easily reach our targets,\u201d he said.\n\nLike many bike-hailing startups, SafeBoda is also destigmatising bike [okada] riding in Ibadan and Nigeria as a whole. The way it looks, it\u2019s like these bike-hailing companies are formalising a sector that\u2019s been informal for a long time.\n\n\u201cThe okada or boda business isn\u2019t categorised to be prestigious within African communities. But with a touch of orange, the story is different. SafeBoda riders are highly regarded and respected, not just because of the colour but because of their conduct,\u201d said Clement Obaro, Growth Manager at SafeBoda.\n\nCompetition is stronger than ever\n\nDue to SafeBoda\u2019s success in Ibadan, it has become apparent that the city is the new juicy spot for the bike-hailing market and, as a result of that, it has also become a battleground. Everybody wants a piece of the pie. Uber last month launched its bike-hailing arm in Ibadan and joined the host of others like MaxNG, ORide, and Gokada to snag more market share from SafeBoda.\n\n\u201cWe have been expecting this to happen and now that it has, we are not worried. Our focus is to keep giving the best experience to our customers and keeping our riders happy and willing to complete more rides daily,\u201d said Arokoyu. \u201cThe sky is wide enough for all birds to fly; healthy competition is always good for business.\u201d\n\nSafeBoda is one of the most active bike-hailing companies in sub-Saharan Africa as it holds more than 80% market share in Uganda and Nigeria. Uber and Bolt had first launched their bike-hailing product in Uganda but couldn\u2019t beat SafeBoda.\n\nIf combining the popularity and capital war chest of Uber and Bolt, the two most powerful mobility startups in the world, couldn\u2019t beat SafeBoda in Uganda, there\u2019s no saying that only Uber can pull it off in Nigeria. But it\u2019s a different market, however, with the level of loyalty SafeBoda has built among riders and customers, it won\u2019t be an easy call to dominate over it in Ibadan.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Facebook content moderators in Kenya will receive a 30-50% pay rise. This announcement comes two weeks after an investigation report by TIME revealed that content moderators in Nairobi were subject to poor pay and working conditions by Sama, a company responsible for Facebook\u2019s sub-Saharan Africa content moderation since 2019.\n\nEvery content moderator will receive an extra 20,000 Kenyan shillings ($176) per month, Sama told employees in a meeting on Tuesday, sources revealed to TIME.\n\n\u201cThe raise means that the lowest-paid Facebook content moderators at Sama will now take home around 50,000 Kenyan shillings ($439) each month after-tax, or around $2.20 per hour for a 9-hour working day. This is up from around $1.50 per hour previously.\u201d\n\nAll content moderators were also promised yearly bonuses worth one month of their salary, as an incentive to remain at the company, according to the sources.\n\nDespite the obvious correlation, Habel Kamau, a human resources director at Sama\u2019s Nairobi office, said that the salary increase wasn\u2019t a result of the release of the investigation by TIME. He claimed that the conversations about a salary increase had been ongoing for a while now, adding that the pay raise was made possible due to budget cuts from other places and not as a result of Sama receiving additional money from Facebook.\n\nAlthough the pay raise is welcomed by many of the content moderators, some still say it\u2019s not enough. Sama employees remain some of Facebook\u2019s lowest-paid workers anywhere in the world. While the lowest starting salary of a Facebook content moderator at Sama is $2.20 per hour, outsourced content moderators for Facebook in the U.S. are paid a typical starting salary of $18 per hour.\n\nSouth African Daniel Motaung, a former employee of Sama who was fired after trying to lead a union, noted that in 2019 employees had requested for their pay to be doubled. \u201cThis increase will make a difference but it won\u2019t change their lives,\u201d Motaung said in the statement. \u201cThey still won\u2019t be able to buy a house or feed their families in line with the \u2018lifting the poor out of poverty\u2019 narrative that Sama continuously boasts about.\u201d\n\nSama didn\u2019t comment on allegations that its managers suppressed a unionization effort in 2019, which led to Motaung losing his Job. Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company also declined to comment on the announcement of the pay raise.\n\nThe announcement of the pay raise is seen as a win for the content moderators and validation of the power in employees speaking up.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

I asked because it has become a catchword in a country with over 56 million unbanked adults.\n\nFinancially included individuals have access to basic financial services like a savings account, credit, and insurance. Also, a higher exclusion rate in Nigeria could result in a poorer population because a lack of access to credit and insurance places them at a competitive economic disadvantage.\n\nThe Enhancing Financial Innovation Access\u2019 (EFInA), Access to Financial Services in Nigeria 2020 Survey (a2f) (PDF), shows that Nigeria has one of the highest rates of financial exclusion in Africa at 35.9%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsequently, given the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) goal to increase that figure to 94% by 2024, there is still much work to be done. And recently, the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) has joined the fray.\n\nNIPOST unveiled its new agency banking platform at a ceremony in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja, in January 2022. The platform includes a free debit card that can be used both offline and online, and it is available at all NIPOST locations in Nigeria\u2019s 774 local governments.\n\nThe agency banking platform, according to Isa Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, would conform to the Universal Postal Union\u2019s (UPU) financial inclusion standards. He also stated that this is a part of the government\u2019s plan to digitise postal services and increase financial inclusion in the country.\n\nWhat is the plan? How do they intend to achieve this? You can catch up with this here.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nHow to improve customer experience\n\nMTN in the metaverse\n\nSudo Africa\u2019s $3.7 million pre-seed\n\nChari\u2019s new acquisition\n\nImproving customer experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the most memorable customer service experience you\u2019ve had? It could be a good or a bad one, but trust me when I say that the bad ones outnumber the good ones, at least for me.\n\nThe most recent experience I had was on Wednesday. I wanted to buy plantain, so I inquired about the price due to its size. \u201cOmo,\u201d I said after hearing the price. \u201cThese plantains aren\u2019t good for this price\u2026\u201d I wasn\u2019t even done when the vendor cut me short, saying, \u201cGo and buy it elsewhere if it\u2019s too small.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not surprised, right? What exactly did I say to deserve that? I was indirectly expressing my dismay about the country\u2019s economic situation, and she responded in that manner? I didn\u2019t even think twice; I left for somewhere else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou might not have experienced this with roadside vendors, but you may have had similar dealings with telcos, retailers, or big corporations, ranging from a long wait time to being treated rudely or simply haven\u2019t been shown empathy.\n\nCustomer experience \u2013 the feeling or memory that a customer or prospective customer has whenever they come in contact with a business \u2013 is dependent on a company\u2019s customer service.\n\nSo, how can customer experience be enhanced? Apart from demonstrating empathy or helping employees understand customers aren\u2019t angry or frustrated with them, but with the product or service, you can use tools to help improve this experience. And that is exactly what MyServiceAgent does for businesses.\n\nMyServiceAgent is a technology company offering a variety of tools to businesses to improve the customer experience. Chimgozirim walks us through what they do and how the company uses AI to help companies to improve their customer experience.\n\nPlease read it here: Built in response to COVID-19, MyServiceAgent now helps businesses improve customer experience with AI\n\nMTN in the metaverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s no news that African telecom, MTN, has joined the likes of Google, Microsoft, and Shopify in betting big on the metaverse by purchasing 144 plots of land in Africarare, South Africa\u2019s first metaverse.\n\nWhat exactly is the Metaverse? The concept of a metaverse is not new. It was first described in the novel Snow Crash, published in 1992. Several companies later created online communities based on the concept, the most notable was Second Life, which debuted in 2003.\n\nAccording to Investopedia, it is a digital reality that combines aspects of social media, online gaming, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and cryptocurrencies to allow users to interact virtually.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means the metaverse is a shared virtual world that people can access via the Internet. In other words, it is a virtual world in which people can live, work, shop, and interact with others from the comfort of their room in the real world.\n\nIn the metaverse, technologies VR and AR are combined to create a sense of \u201cvirtual presence.\u201d\n\nAlso, the term \u201cmetaverse\u201d did not become popular until Facebook changed its corporate name to Meta in October 2021. At the time, the company announced plans to invest $10 billion over the next year to realise its vision of the metaverse.\n\nThe big question is, why did MTN decide to join the Metaverse? Is it to follow a trend, improve customers\u2019 digital experiences, or what?

Approximately 50,000 merchants use the platform for credit and bookkeeping services. It allows these businesses to manage the credit they extend to their customers.\n\nYesterday, the company announced that it had acquired Axa Credit, the credit branch of Axa Assurance Maroc, for $22 million.\n\nWhat does Chari do? Chari is a mobile app that allows small retailers in Morocco and Tunisia to order products from Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) multinationals and local manufacturers and receive them in less than 24 hours. It was founded in 2020 by Ismael Belkhayat (CEO) and Sophia Alj (Co-founder).\n\nThe acquisition of Axa Credit will provide Chari with the credit licence required to begin lending to its FMCG B2B clients, who will then lend money to their consumer clients.\n\nChari believes that shop owners understand their customers\u2019 spending habits, where they live, and when and how they are paid, and thus can perform the credit risk assessment that a traditional bank cannot.\n\nThe company intends to charge merchants a setup fee and low-interest rates as it gains more users.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nHow to Make \u2018Friends\u2019 with Anxiety: A Simple Technique to Gain Perspective.

Sometimes, it appears that a fintech startup claiming to be the latest saviour is born every second.\n\nThis is hardly surprising considering the proliferation of fintech startups in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem and the largely unsolved problem of the unbanked. According to the Enhancing Financial Innovation Access\u2019 (EFInA), Access to Financial Services in Nigeria 2020 Survey (a2f) (PDF), the country\u2019s financial exclusion rate is 35.9% \u2014 one of the highest in Africa.\n\nThat leaves almost 54% unbanked. Considering the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) plan to increase that number to 94% by 2024, there\u2019s still quite a bit to be done. And the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) has recently thrown its hat in this ring.\n\nIn January 2022, NIPOST unveiled its new agency banking platform at a ceremony in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja. The platform comes with a free debit card that works offline and online and is available at all NIPOST outlets in Nigeria\u2019s 774 local governments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Isa Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, the agency banking platform would follow the Universal Postal Union\u2019s (UPU) standards on financial inclusion. He also said that this is part of the government\u2019s plan to digitise the postal services and improve financial inclusion in the country.\n\nHow would this work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy UPU standards, NIPOST\u2019s agency banking platform should provide essential services like savings, payments, money transfers, insurance, and credit. However, it appears the platform would work much like a multi-teller PoS-based service, so the exact mechanics of how NIPOST hopes to serve its customers are a bit sketchy.\n\nTechpoint Africa sent a mail to the Postmaster General\u2019s office but received no reply and a visit to the NIPOST headquarters in Ile-Ife, Osun State, revealed that not much is known about the platform yet other than its March expected launch date.\n\nHowever, NIPOST is licensed by the CBN as a super agent and, by CBN guidelines, cannot provide insurance or credit facilities.\n\nAccording to Pantami, the free debit card would use biometric authentication.\n\nIn Africa, South Africa-based fintech, Paycode, provides biometric debit cards, which the company says are operational in several countries, including Namibia, Botswana, Nigeria, and Mozambique. In Namibia, Paycode works with the Namibia Post Ltd (NamPost).\n\nA biometric debit card uses the owner\u2019s fingerprints to authenticate transactions, ensuring additional security and ease of use by the uneducated, thus making it suitable for financial inclusion, especially in rural areas.\n\nThis also means the card can be used offline. For example, Paycode says anyone with access to its API can verify users biometrically without connecting to the Internet. ExtoLabs, a California-based software company with plans to launch in Africa, uses a Bluetooth connection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn unknown player\n\nInterestingly, NIPOST did not mention a partnership with any fintech company to deliver this card. However, pictures of the ceremony in Abuja reveal a name \u2014 GingrPay \u2014 etched on the demo cards.\n\nA Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) search uncovered a company named GingrPay Nigeria Limited incorporated on May 18, 2021. A Google search led to a third party website with more info like directors, shareholders, persons with significant control, and companies where GingrPay company officers show up as directors or shareholders.\n\nThe website cites GingrPay\u2019s activity description as \u201cTo facilitate electronic circulation of money as well as the exchange of value between individuals and organisations on a timely and consistent basis using technological softwares.\u201d\n\nA search on the CBN website does not turn up any licence registered to the company name.\n\nVisiting other nations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, postal services are no strangers to providing financial services. In Brazil, Correios, the state-owned postal company, operates the Banco Postal in partnership with Banco do Brasil, providing banking services to the unbanked.\n\nIn India, the India Post Payments Bank is a subsidiary of the India Post and has been in operation since September 2018, serving over four crore \u2014 40 million \u2014 customers. Initially, because the India Post appeared to be haemorrhaging money, there was some resistance to the initiative.\n\nOn the continent, in Ghana, the Ghana Post provides various financial services like agency banking in partnership with banks, insurance, and GhPostPay, which enables users to make online transactions. Remittance services are currently suspended.\n\nIn the Benin Republic, government-owned Le poste du B\u00e9nin enables customers to have both savings and current accounts, and provides credit facilities, insurance, and remittance.\n\nNamibia\u2019s NamPost gives customers access to a funeral cover and a savings bank that provides investment products, and save-as-you-earn accounts, among other things.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, postal services are used by significantly poorer persons, older, less educated, and people less likely to be employed than those who have an account at a financial institution or both a financial institution and the post office.\n\nLogically, it follows that postal institutions are essential to fostering financial inclusion.\n\nThe financial inclusion play\n\nNIPOST has made several attempts in this arena.\n\nIn 2017, it signed a partnership agreement with Nigerian fintech startup, Paga, to improve financial inclusion.\n\nOn a call with Techpoint Africa, Arike Okunowo, General Manager, Sales and Distribution, explained that the partnership broke down after a few months because there were some issues surrounding the staffing needed to successfully run the business.\n\nThe partnership saw Paga provide the platform, which NIPOST\u2019s workers manned. But Okunowo explained that the staff already had primary assignments and this created conflict.\n\nAs she told Techpoint Africa, \u201cIf you want to run financial services, you need some level of focus so that if the customer comes in, you are always available to attend to them.\u201d\n\nShe also said that NIPOST was very keen on having its staff man the platform with no third-party interference. However, she also said that they would be open to a possible partnership with the postal company in the future.\n\nOn its financial services page, the postal service company says it provides domestic transfers, international remittance, agency banking \u2013 this appears to have been on the page since April 23, 2021 \u2013 and mobile money services.\n\nNIPOST owns an International Money Transfer Operators (IMTO) licence and says it has partnered with companies like Western Union.\n\nA visit to the NIPOST headquarters in Ile-Ife, Osun State, revealed that the agency no longer carries out any of these services and doesn\u2019t seem to have done so for a while, an offshoot of Pantami\u2019s decision in 2019, which saw the agency adopt a cashless policy. All cash transactions, including remittance, are to be done in a banking hall.\n\nThere are also plans to create a microfinance bank.\n\nWhat industry players are saying\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkunowo believed NIPOST\u2019s infrastructure makes it a good centrepoint as a shared resource.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say NIPOST should actually be a shared resource for all the providers because of its infrastructure, and because it\u2019s such a major part of the Nigerian state.\u201d\n\nWhile Edidiong Uwemakpan, Director, Brand and Corporate Communications, TeamApt, believed the decision is commendable, she worried about fraud.\n\n\u201cWhere I begin to find challenges is that you were trying to eliminate cash. Now, part of agency banking is, of course, bill payments, and that makes sense. But then the cash in, cash out part of things, that\u2019s where I don\u2019t really see how they plan to do it.\n\n\u201cBecause, are you going to be giving your NIPOST workers a float so that they can give people cash? And you were already trying to eliminate cash in the past because of fraud.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that NIPOST appears not to have partnered with well-known fintechs. And while Okunowo could not confirm if NIPOST had approached Paga, Uwemakpan said TeamApt did not receive any communication from the postal agency.\n\nHowever, though Uwemakpan believed that the market is big enough to contain everyone, she raises concerns regarding the number of outlets NIPOST has \u2013 3,000 \u2013 and whether this would be enough to serve customers. She said NIPOST might need to expand its reach to compete.\n\nOne thing Okunowo and Uwemakpan agreed on is that this endeavour requires quite a lot of investment by NIPOST.\n\nA digital economy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, the Federal Government of Nigeria announced a three-year modernisation plan for NIPOST. By 2020, the postal agency was to have been unbundled into six subsidiaries: NIPOST Banking and Insurance Company; NIPOST Property and Development Company; NIPOST Transport and Logistics Services Company; NIPOST E-government Services Company; and NIPOST E-commerce Services Company.\n\nIn January 2022, speaking at a media parley held in Abuja, Dr Ismail Adewusi, Postmaster General and CEO of NIPOST, said that NIPOST was to be unbundled once more, this time, in three places: NIPOST Properties and Development Company; NIPOST Transport and Logistics Company; and NIPOST Microfinance Bank Limited.\n\nHe also said the unbundling would be done before the end of January 2022. However, there has been no announcement to that effect.\n\nThe NIPOST Act is still in the process of being repealed, and the Nigerian Postal Service (Repeal and Reenactment) Act 2021, passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives in 2021, is currently awaiting assent by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nWhen assented to, this means that NIPOST can be unbundled into whatever subsidiaries it sees fit and would hold regulatory powers, making the Postal Agency a Commission.\n\nNIPOST has also partnered with several private companies on its path to full digitisation. In December 2021, it announced an agreement with Egyptian startup, eGATE to create an app that automates last-mile delivery. Customers will be able to track communication with drivers and monitor their delivery.\n\nIn 2018, NIPOST introduced its Address Verification System and Digital Address System. Both were done in collaboration with identity verification startup, Youverify, to improve mail delivery and resolve addressing issues, but the link to the website leads to a dummy page.\n\nHowever, interestingly, there are plans to launch a digital postal code system that is expected to solve the same problem before the end of the first quarter of 2022.\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the surface level, NIPOST does seem to have a lot planned that should benefit the average citizen, but implementation and consistency appear to be lacking.\n\nTo pull off its latest scheme, it might require an overhaul of its entire processes \u2013 like its unbundling, for instance. But these are still early days, and there is much that can still happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Former President Olusegun Obassnjo says Nigeria is tottering and adds that for as long as the people fail to do the right thing it will not be well with the country.\n\nSpeaking at a well attended symposium to mark his 85th birthday, the retired General who is well-respected around the world, lamented, \u201cNigeria is tottering and for as long as we continue to put the cart before the horse, it cannot be well.\n\n\u201cOr put another way, for as long as we continue to do the same thing over and over again, the result will not be different. If the drift is not halted, the remaining twenty-five per cent of Nigerian nation will be dissipated in no time and Nigeria will not be a country but countries and will never be possible to be a nation again. That will be a monumental tragedy for Nigeria, Africa, the black race and humanity.\u201d\n\nAccording to him \u201csince 1999, we have changed from one political party or another, we have manoeuvred and manipulated to the point that election results are no longer reflections of the will of the people and we seemed to be progressively going back rather than going forward politically, economically and socially.\n\n\u201cWe have activities without requite actions and personnel to move us forward. If we continue in the same pattern of recycling, sweet-word campaigning, manoeuvring without substance of integrity, honesty, patriotism, commitment, outreach, courage, understanding of what make a nation and what make for development, we will soon have to say goodbye to Nigeria as a nation.\u201d\n\nHere is the full text of Obasanjo\u2019s statement\u2026\n\nLet me start by appreciating each one of you for your presence today to join me in thanking God as I mark my 85th birthday and for making it a grand event.\n\nI should name you all one, by one, but in view of the limited time that we have, I am sure you will give thumbs down to the idea. In this case, please permit my special mention of some persons and groups.\n\nI thank President Paul Kagame for his insightful keynote address. President Kagame planned to personally and physically deliver the address but for exigencies of office which inhibited his not being in Abeokuta today.\n\nImmense appreciation to President Nic\u00e9phore Soglo for chairing the symposium. President Soglo arrived on Thursday and he plans to spend a few more days after the birthday celebrations to enjoy the Abeokuta environment with me. What a great brother he is!\n\nWorth singling out for mention is Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. On receiving my invitation, Ngozi, as I fondly call her, struck out all entries in her crowded calendar as Director-General, World Trade Organization (WTO) to ensure that she is with us today. The speech which she just delivered is one of the finest I have listened to in recent times. Thank you, Ngozi, for honouring me.\n\nI cannot thank enough, all our presenters who gave their speeches in person and virtually. Professor Goski Alabi (Ghana); Ambassador Barry Desker (Singapore); Professor Juma Shabani (Burundi); Dr. Mary Khimulu (Kenya); Dr. Moussa Kondo (Mali); Professor Sarah Agbor (Cameroon); Professor Chukwuma Soludo (in-coming Governor of Anambra State, Nigeria; and Sanusi Lamido Sanusi (Muhammad Sanusi II, the 14th Emir of Kano and Khalifa of Tijjaniyya in Nigeria), you were unanimous in your message \u2013 it is about time the Africa narrative got louder, more resolute and globally respected and regarded.\n\nMy appreciation goes to Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State for being part of the celebrations and for leading the football team of the Ogun State Government in a novelty football match yesterday, against the OOPL team which I captained. I want to thank other Governors that are here.\n\nI thank the Co-Chairs and members of the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library Foundation especially Co-Chair Carl Masters who arrived from the US yesterday to be part of the celebrations and chair the reception which comes up immediately after this symposium.\n\nLet me also thank my past colleagues who had worked with me at different times. Some of them are here and without them I would not have achieved what we achieved together. They with the front soldiers implementing plans we drew up together.\n\nHuge thanks to our Kabiyesis, religious and political leaders who are here with us today.\n\nExcellencies, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, I believe you want to hear \u201cmy narrative\u201d on the theme of this symposium. I take you back several months.\n\nAbout the middle of last year while on mission in the north of Africa with some former African heads of state and government, I shared my thoughts which had lingered for decades on the matter of Africa narrative and proposed our setting up what I call Our Africa Narrative Club or society. The organ is yet to be formally established and this symposium provides a sounding board for the viability of the idea. Quite clearly, from what I have heard today, we all seem to be saying that it may be a good idea endorse the proposition.\n\nMy thoughts on the establishment of Our Africa Narrative Club or society aggregate around the following six assertions:\n\n1. Truth must be known and propagated for the purpose of authentic history of the past, to prevent repeat of mistakes of the past, to ensure that as a people and a race, we make our own people appreciate the contribution to human civilisation and development and to be aware of inhumanity, indignity, cruelty and destruction that we have suffered and to learn the right lessons from local, national, regional, continental and global events that have impacted us.\n\n2. We must stop to live by and on received ideas, ideologies, beliefs and standards foreign to our culture, cherished beliefs, our philosophy and our worldview and understanding.\n\n3. We must understand the world we live in and which may not feel it owes us anything except what we can wrest from the abundance of God on earth for ourselves, essentially by ourselves to be preserved and used for and in the best interest of ourselves.\n\n4. We must continually make ourselves essential contributors to the world civilisation, world ethos, world development and world preservation, sustenance and wholesome world recreation.\n\n5. We must ensure governance and system of administration that makes use of all available human resources and talents inclusively for rapid development and transformation for the preservation of seeking, utilising, sustaining, preserving and keeping the best to continue to do the best, wholesomely and inclusively.\n\n6. To appreciate, cherish and uphold our past and present in the way that will enhance our future and strengthen our participation in the global decision-making process and enhance our share of the world\u2019s division of labour and resources.\n\nExcellencies, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, within the Africa narrative framework, this symposium focuses on leadership. As previous speakers have highlighted, the narrative from the non-African lens is that leadership in Africa is jaundiced and hence cannot lead us far on the path of development and progress.\n\nThe narrative which I assert is that every village, town, nation or region has its socio-cultural peculiarities that are best suited for the emergence of its leader and the colour of its governance.\n\nTherefore, it is erroneous to put all communities on the planet into a basket, judge and narrate their leadership, governance and development, strictly from the point of view of people from a particular section of the world.\n\nIf we dig down to the taproot of the recent turmoil and political and developmental upheavals in the world today, we will find that this skewed narrative is one of its major causes.\n\nDo not get me wrong. Regardless of the angle of the narrative whether from Africa or outside of it, there are some irreducible minima on leadership.\n\nThese include people-centredness, inclusiveness, ability to manage diversity, abhorrence of corruption and ethnic jingoism. Our Africa narrative must assume that these irreducible minima are in place after which we can now confidently tell the world, our story of how we in Africa, are contextualising leadership to foster development and progress.\n\nThis now takes me to the important matter of leadership and nation building. In the course of this \u201cnarrative\u201d, I will provide glimpses from Nigeria.\n\nMy past, present and future positions on Nigeria are governed by several publicly available parameters.\n\nRead also: PDP\u2019s Obasanjo cancelled debts, but APC\u2019s Buhari puts Nigerians in bondage \u2013 Ayu\n\nFirst is the role providence conferred on me in bringing the tragedy of the civil war to an end. It ended on the noble and brotherhood evocative note of \u201cno victor no vanquished.\u201d If it pleases God to enable me to play an important role in this defining chapter in the history of Nigeria, the least I can do in reciprocation is to keep vigil over the peace and stability of this nation in whatever position of leadership I find myself.\n\nAs I remarked at the recent occasion of the visit of the leadership of Peoples Democratic Party to me, I have been, for quite a while now and for the rest of my life, my response to the solicitations of the delegation in this respect.\n\nBut if I retired from partisan politics, if politics is the welfare of the people, I must not retire from the welfare and well-being of people whether in my own community, in my own state, in my own country, anywhere in Africa or indeed anywhere in the world and that is why I have the type of responsibility that I have now.\n\nAs the quadrennial madness builds a head of steam and the runners and riders crisscross the nation in the quest for nomination as the party flag bearer to the highest office in the land, I read and hear about endorsement and statements in support of candidates that I frankly have not made and forming next political parties that I can never get involved in. I was told that social media credited to me names of three people from the south that I am sponsoring for Presidency in 2023.\n\nMy friend, Professor Ango Abdullah, who brought this to my knowledge remarked that he did not believe that I made such a statement because it was out of my character. I have neither named names nor stated my position. In situation like the one we are in, I will not rush into naming names without necessary consultations and well-defined principles and criteria. We need to be clear about what Nigeria needs today and why Nigeria needs it. Only then can we answer the question of how that will inform us of the criteria and characteristics for determining who.\n\nI believe in principles before personalities and taking personalities before principles is putting the cart before the horse. And for me, the major issue is how to progress Nigeria from a country to a nation. If in 2015 Nigeria was seventy-five per cent a country and fifty per cent a nation, today, Nigeria will not be more than fifty per cent a country and twenty-five per cent a nation. The task of reversing the trend is beyond one personality, one political party or all political parties; it is beyond professional and commercial politicians alone. It demands and requires all hands on deck. I mean Nigerians in all walks of life \u2013 politicians, community leaders, traditional leaders, religious leaders, diplomatic leaders, leaders in the academia, leaders in all aspects of government life, and leaders in other aspects of the civil society.\n\nNigeria is tottering and for as long as we continue to put the cart before the horse, it cannot be well.\n\nOr put another way, for as long as we continue to do the same thing over and over again, the result will not be different. If the drift is not halted, the remaining twenty-five per cent of Nigerian nation will be dissipated in no time and Nigeria will not be a country but countries and will never be possible to be a nation again. That will be a monumental tragedy for Nigeria, Africa, the black race and humanity.\n\nSince 1999, we have changed from one political party or another, we have manoeuvred and manipulated to the point that election results are no longer reflections of the will of the people and we seemed to be progressively going back rather than going forward politically, economically and socially. We have activities without requite actions and personnel to move us forward.\n\nIf we continue in the same pattern of recycling, sweet-word campaigning, manoeuvring without substance of integrity, honesty, patriotism, commitment, outreach, courage, understanding of what make a nation and what make for development, we will soon have to say goodbye to Nigeria as a nation.\n\nI cast a cursory look at some of the people running around and those for whom people are running around. If EFCC and ICPC will have done their jobs properly and supported adequately by the judiciary, most of them would be in jail.\n\nAny person who has no integrity in small things cannot have integrity in big things. Fixing Nigeria must begin on the principles of nation building, not necessarily on emotion, sentiments, euphoria, ignorance, incompetence, ethnicity, nepotism, bigotry, sectionalism, regionalism, religion or class.\n\nThe issues of security, stability, development, economy and our relationship within Africa and with the rest of the world can only be taken care of if we get the issue of the nation building right.\n\nWe have a lot to learn from the events of the last almost twenty-four years and God is not to blame if we fail.\n\nIt would appear that we are not getting our priorities right and that can spell doom on our country if we fail to do what we should do for nation-building in terms of fundamentals of equity, justice, common ideals, popular education, shared values, mutual respect and equality of opportunity anchored and propelled by leaders across the board that are persons of integrity, honour, morality, competence, great virtue, courage to do what is right, humility and ability to put a team together and work with them in selfless devotion and service with the fear of God.\n\nFederal character, rotation and such other measures are meant to help our nation-building process and more sure-footedly, move Nigeria forward, but riding over these measures rudely, shoddily and roughly cannot augur well for our nation-building process and progress. From personal experience and clinical observation, there is no substitute for steady and uncompromised process of nation-building as we have had in some notable examples in the past that have stood us in good stead.\n\nVoting Shehu Shagari into power in 1979 with Alex Ekwueme from \u201cBiafra\u201d as No. 2 in 1979 less than ten years after attempted cessation by \u2018Biafra\u201d was in the process of nation-building.\n\nIt took the United States of America, USA and other countries that had gone through such wars decades before they could achieve that feat after their civil wars. Sustaining the declaration of the victory of Shagari by the National Electoral Commission when Shagari had majority of votes and clear one-third of votes cast in twelve States as against six States by Obafemi Awolowo which was also sustained and certified by the court and endorsed foe implementation by our military administration was also part of the process of our nation- building.\n\nVoting for me by other Nigerians in 1999, when Afenifere and the Yorubas substantially voted against me strengthened our nation-building process.\n\nAs continuation of that process, PDP adopted rotation and sharing formula for six key party political offices and government offices among the six geopolitical zones which stood the country and the party in good stead. It was the PDP policy that made it inadvisable to have candidate from the South to succeed me after my eight years in office as President.\n\nI was succeeded by Umaru Yar\u2019Adua from the North. When Yar\u2019Adua died in office, the nation-building process made us to follow the Constitution and for Jonathan to step in contrary to the desire of some people from the North who agitated otherwise.\n\nI have been at the giving end and at the receiving end of contribution to the nation-building process and I know that if we derail from nation-building process with solid principles, Nigeria will be shipwrecked. I will, at this juncture, leave it to fair-minded Nigerians, who believe in the continuation of the process of nation-building, to decide which way Nigeria should go.\n\nI have always maintained that if we look hard widely and fairly and we bring objectivity, national interest and patriotism to bear and which must be spiced with equity, integrity, performance, then no region or zone should claim to have monopoly of Nigerians that can lead us along the path of nation-building on the basis of justice, fast economic development, inclusive growth, shared value and our rightful place in the global division of labour and decision making process.\n\nIf we are going fault finding, zonally or regionally, no region or zone can claim absolute innocence. And federal character is a very important and perfect instrument of nation-building in our Constitution.\n\nWhen we have adequately taken care of nation-building measures especially management of our unity and taken care of every anomalous situation and performance or lack of it, that have put us in political, security, economic and solid quagmire situations that we find ourselves, then we must zero on personalities.\n\nEach contender must be properly x-rayed and profiled from birth and Nigerians must be educated to be able to make a choice that will be in the national interest and propel Nigeria forward.\n\nSuch a person will have to lead what remains of the nation to courageously continue on the path of nation-building as a national team leader, no matter on what platform he or she assumes leadership. No one can do it alone.\n\nWe must, however, stop sacrificing character, track records and performance on the altar of ethnic, regional or religious jingoism.\n\nAs the watchman counts on daybreak, so too do I count on Nigerians and Nigeria to bring forth that person.\n\nI do not, cannot and will not at this point suggest the how and to what, I can only count on the patriotic commitment and desires of well- meaning Nigerians to start the process of forging a path out of darkness into the light of salvation and a new glorious dawn.\n\nIt is time to reach into the ability of Nigeria to always snatch victory from the jaws of defeat as we start this collective search on how we can climb out of this hole in which we find our country, Nigeria.\n\nGod bless Nigeria and make it into a nation.\n\nMay God bless Africa too and make it a great continent as we continue to stoke the embers of the Africa narrative.\n\nThank you for your attention and for honouring me.",

It has formally constituted its Board. As soon as we leave this meeting, I will be calling on Infraco to begin engagement. I will also be involved. We will be engaging the Lagos State government as well as the Federal Government to see what can be done, not just about evacuating, but evacuation out of Lagos,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\n\u201cThe entire idea is that with this Lagos free zone port, we should be able to see a total decongestion of Apapa and Tin Can port purely from the standpoint that it would take the traffic away from Apapa. And we are also afraid that the only single road that we have, which is the Lagos-Epe-Lekki road, is already congested with traffic, and is going to worsen even with Dangote\u2019s refinery.\n\n\u201cHow do we make sure that we decongest the traffic for those who live within the Lekk\u00ec Epe? We will work with Lagos State and we will work with the federal government, I am assuring you that this is something we are going to do.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said N100 billion from CBN intervention under the Differentiated Cash Reserves Requirement (D-CRR) or through the Commercial Agriculture Credit Guarantee loan has been injected to the Tolaram group, a holding company headquartered in Singapore with diversified business interests in consumer goods, fintech, infrastructure and industrials.\n\nRead also: CBN pegs dollar sales spread at 10kobo on I&E window\n\n\u201cThis is a project of about $2 billion, about N1 trillion and we have done about N100 billion, which is 10 percent. You can see we have sown a seed and we have also given support through making foreign exchange available for them to bring in the equipment to get this port operation to work well,\u201d the CBN governor said.\n\n\u201cWe will support any entrepreneurs who wishes to do business in Nigeria, we will provide Naira funding and also advise that if your revenue is in Naira you go and take cheap Naira loan instead of dollar, 10 years loan, two years moratorium and single digits interest rate maximum 9 percent.\n\n\u201cThis is the good one we have always encouraged people to take advantage of, because it is available. It is what will help drive industrialisation for Nigeria. It will help bring our manufacturing sector back to life again,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\nHe noted that the Toleram group has made immediate plans to evacuate their products through the port to Ikorodu, Festac and Warri.\n\n\u201cI believe with this port we are going to be engaging them. I\u2019m happy the customs and the Nigerian ports authority are involved. We would seek to also work with the Lagos free Zone by having a dedicated export desk that would make it easy for goods to be exported out of this port. That is a very essential thing that we need to deal with, because again talking in a very selfish mode, we need a foreign exchange. If we export, we earn foreign exchange, and I am going to start working with them to ensure that we designate the Lagos Free Zone as an export zone,\u201d Emefiele said.",

We will make sure that we expand the law beyond forestry assets to also cover the natural assets found around the forest.\n\n\u201cWe want to collaborate with the National Park Service. I will visit the Minister of Environment to offer her a certain proposal to allow the Edo State Government to jointly manage the park with the federal government because this is our resource.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cWith that collaboration, it means that we would put in more resources. We would like to increase the number of rangers and park officers to protect not only this park but some other reserves that are around us here, particularly the Okumo Reserve and the Gelegele Reserve.\n\n\u201cWe will pay for the new hires under such an arrangement. We will upgrade your training, as well as provide more facilities and amenities for the park.\n\n\u201cNobody will come here if they don\u2019t feel secure and safe. This does not apply only to the park and the resources around this area, but it is important for people to know that they are secured when they come in to enjoy nature.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will make sure that we improve the security of this park and expose the beauty and ecotourism opportunities of the park,\u201d he added.\n\nObaseki further stated, \u201cWe have been hearing of nefarious activities of criminal elements, both in the park and the forest reserve, and also the Okomu Oil Palm Company. Today, we are on a fact finding visit to examine what exactly is going on in the park.\n\n\u201cWe have to find out the number of attacks, where the attacks are coming from and see how the state government can come in and collaborate effectively with the park using the full security system in the state to deal with the security challenges that we have here.\n\n\u201cGovernment will not just sit back and allow the kind of criminality that we are seeing in this area. Our worry is that if we don\u2019t confront them now, it will get out of hand.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping to get the full report from you and to understand clearly how the criminals are operating. We saw a truck outside the premises which I believe was recently seized with high quality wood.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know how expensive these items are. Our concern is that these criminals come in, log illegally and take the logs out, sell them and procure more arms and come in to occupy the territory,\u201d Obaseki noted.\n\nIn his remarks, the Conservator of the Okomu National Park said the park is home to white-throated monkeys, Buffalo and Elephants, noting that farming, hunting and illegal logging was affecting the natural habitats of the animals.\n\nObekpa appealed to the governor for logistics support to enable them to effectively protect the forest assets.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

(It allows Nigerian men\u2019s foreign-born wives to be awarded automatic citizenship); Deny Nigerian women indigeneity through marriage; Deny 35 per cent appointed positions for women and settling for 20 per cent; Deny women affirmative action in party administration and leadership; and Deny specific seats for women in the National Assembly, among others.\u201d\n\nHe noted: \u201cIn Edo State, we have a healthy mix of women in our cabinet, as they occupy more than 30 percent of positions of commissioners and Special Advisers in government.

Goodluck Egwu Ibem, Terrence Kuanum, Shittu Waheed, and Tito Zokumor for the body.\n\nThey regretted that the donation was coming when Nigeria \u201ccan barely execute any single project or pay mere salaries and pensions without borrowing to do so.\u201d\n\nAccording to the youths, this is gross insensitivity and financial recklessness on the part of the Federal Government to make such donations at a time like this. We are totally disappointed, to say the least.\n\n\u201cIt is common knowledge that Nigeria is currently on financial oxygen to survive and we cannot be pretending about it because the information is already in public domain,\u201d the youths said.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government openly told Nigerians that there is no money in our purse to fulfill the financial promises it made to Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU. We now ask the FG, where did the money donated to Afghanistan emanate from?\n\n\u201cThe donation as we were told by the Secretary-General of the Organization of Islamic cooperation, OIC Hissein Ibrahim Taha, was for easing the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan and to help in catering for the needs of millions of Afghan people including women and children.\n\n\u201cWe then ask the federal government how much has it donated to the Nigerian Internally Displaced Persons in Benue State. The answer is none.\n\n\u201cWe call on the National Assembly to immediately make a law that will bring on board eminent financial advisors and experts that will scrutinize and approve every financial donation or commitment of the federal government to other nations to avoid a situation where the commonwealth of our country will be donated to other nations on the altar of religious affiliation or friendship.\u201d",

Oladiti Aluko, the Board of Trustees Chairman, Hon. Lukman Afolabi and the State Secretary, Hon. Shola Akinleye.\n\nThe group said it is first concerned with the emergence of Senator Ademola Adeleke in the party\u2019s primaries coming up on Tuesday, 8th of March, 2022.\n\nThe group whose aimed is to lift, support, canvass and rigorously work for Senator Adeleke, who was also the party\u2019s flagbearer in the 2018 Osun State governorship election said, they will not rest on their oars to ensure that he coasts to victory in the coming party primary and subsequently, the main election in July 16th, 2022.\n\nThe group Chief Coordinator Hon.

          "text": "Idowu Olakunle, Abeokuta\n\nChief Olusegun Obasanjo, Nigeria\u2019s former president, has opined that some aspirants currently moving freely around the country on consultations ahead of the 2023 presidential election should have been jailed, what seems to be an apparent dig at the likes former Lagos governor, Bola Tinubu, former vice president, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, among others currently aspiring for president.\n\nThe former President made the observation today in Abeokuta when he presented a paper at the international symposium marking his 85th birthday anniversary.\n\nObasanjo who spoke on the theme, \u201cAfrica Narrative with Nigeria Situation,\u201d explained that if the anti-graft agencies and the judiciary had lived up to their responsibilities some politicians criss-crossing the country presently should have been cooling their feet in the prison.\n\nHe observed that Nigeria had continued to drift and had failed to evolve from a country to a nation, because all those qualities and factors needed for good leadership were not there.\n\nObasanjo expressed dismay that leadership in Africa was jaundiced, calling for the formation of what he termed \u2018Our Africa Narrative Club or society,\u2019 even as he listed some irreducible qualities of leadership, whether within Africa or outside it to include \u2018people-centredness\u2019, inclusiveness, ability to manage diversity, abhorrence of corruption and ethnic jingoism.\n\n\u201cNigeria has not witnessed any remarkable development because the leadership has continued to do things the same way, which has continued to produce the same results.\u201d Obasanjo added.\n\nObasanjo debunked news on social media that he had endorsed three presidential aspirants from the South, stating that he would never rush into naming names without necessary consultations and arriving at well-defined principles and criteria.\n\n\u201cMy friend, Professor Ango Abdullahi, who brought this to my knowledge remarked that he did not believe that I made such a statement because it was out of my character,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI have neither named names nor stated my position. In situation like the one we are in, I will not rush into naming names without necessary consultations and well-defined principles and criteria.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to be clear about what Nigeria needs today and why Nigeria needs it. Only then can we answer the question of how that will inform us of the criteria and characteristics for determining who.\n\n\u201cI believe in principles before personalities and taking personalities before principles is putting the cart before the horse. And for me, the major issue is how to progress Nigeria from a country to a nation.\n\n\u201cIf in 2015 Nigeria was seventy-five per cent a country and fifty per cent a nation, today, Nigeria will not be more than fifty per cent a country and twenty-five per cent a nation.\n\n\u201cThe task of reversing the trend is beyond one personality, one political party or all political parties; it is beyond professional and commercial politicians alone.\n\n\u201cIt demands and requires all hands on deck. I mean Nigerians in all walks of life \u2013 politicians, community leaders, traditional leaders, religious leaders, diplomatic leaders, leaders in the academia, leaders in all aspects of government life, and leaders in other aspects of the civil society.\u201d\n\nHe said further, \u201cNigeria is tottering and for as long as we continue to put the cart before the horse, it cannot be well. Or put another way, for as long as we continue to do the same thing over and over again, the result will not be different.\n\n\u201cIf the drift is not halted, the remaining twenty-five per cent of Nigerian nation will be dissipated in no time and Nigeria will not be a country but countries and will never be possible to be a nation again. That will be a monumental tragedy for Nigeria, Africa, the black race and humanity.\u201d\n\nObasanjo observed that since 1999, \u201cwe have changed from one political party or another we have manoeuvred and manipulated to the point that election results are no longer reflections of the will of the people and we seemed to be progressively going back rather than going forward politically, economically and socially.\n\n\u201cWe have activities without requite actions and personnel to move us forward. If we continue in the same pattern of recycling, sweet-word campaigning, manoeuvring without substance of integrity, honesty, patriotism, commitment, outreach, courage, understanding of what make a nation and what make for development, we will soon have to say goodbye to Nigeria as a nation.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI cast a cursory look at some of the people running around and those for whom people are running around. If EFCC and ICPC will have done their jobs properly and supported adequately by the judiciary, most of them would be in jail.\n\n\u201cAny person who has no integrity in small things cannot have integrity in big things. Fixing Nigeria must begin on the principles of nation building, not necessarily on emotion, sentiments, euphoria, ignorance, incompetence, ethnicity, nepotism, bigotry, sectionalism, regionalism, religion or class.\n\n\u201cThe issues of security, stability, development, economy and our relationship within Africa and with the rest of the world can only be taken care of if we get the issue of the nation building right,\u201d he posited further.",

          "text": "Former President Olusegun Obasanjo, on Saturday, declared that many politicians jostling to hold sensitive elective positions in Nigeria come year 2023 general election are supposed to be serving various jail terms, should the anti-graft agencies in the country had functioned well.\n\nObasanjo, who spoke while delivering his speech at the international symposium organised to mark his 85th birthday celebrations, held virtually and physically in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, also charged Nigerians to prioritise the tasks of building a Nigeria nation rather than building personalities that are capable of further disintegrating the country.\n\nObasanjo said his declaration was premised on a cursory examination and analysis of some politicians running around consulting, as well as those for whom some foot soldiers were running around to enable them occupy the exalted number one political office of the country, and not just a carefree talk.\n\n\u201cI cast a cursory look at some of the people running around and those for whom people are running around. If EFCC and ICPC will have done their jobs properly and supported adequately by the judiciary, most of them would be in jail.\n\n\u201cAny person who has no integrity in small things cannot have integrity in big things. Fixing Nigeria must begin on the principles of nation building, not necessarily on emotion, sentiments, euphoria, ignorance, incompetence, ethnicity, nepotism, bigotry, sectionalism, regionalism, religion or class,\u201d the elder statesman said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis is coming just as the former president dissociated himself from the rumour being circulated that he had endorsed about three politicians from the Southern part of the country to take over from President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.\n\n\u201cAs the quadrennial madness builds a head of steam and the runners and riders crisscross the nation in the quest for nomination as the party flag bearer to the highest office in the land, I read and hear about endorsement and statements in support of candidates that I frankly have not made and forming next political parties that I can never get involved in.\n\n\u201cI was told that social media credited to me, names of three people from the south that I am sponsoring for Presidency in 2023. My friend, Professor Ango Abdullah, who brought this to my knowledge remarked that he did not believe that I made such a statement because it was out of my character.\n\n\u201cI have neither named names, nor stated my position. In situation like the one we are in, I will not rush into naming names without necessary consultations and well-defined principles and criteria,\u201d Obasanjo added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe former president, however, maintained that policy makers as well as every other citizen needed to clearly distinguish between \u201cwhat Nigeria needs today and why Nigeria needs it.\u201d\n\nHe asserted that all the challenges of insecurity, corruption, ethnic jingoism, which have militated against the country and prevented her from attaining the desired height of nationhood will naturally disappear \u201cif we get the issue of the nation building right.\u201d\n\nSuggesting the way forward for the country, Obasanjo recommended that political office seekers, particularly all presidential aspirants must be \u201cproperly x-rayed and profiled from birth\u201d so as to make Nigerians be better informed about who is going to lead the country.\n\nHe further recommended that Nigerians, through the appropriate agencies of government, must be educated to be able to make a choice that will be in the national interest and propel Nigeria forward.\n\n\u201cWhen we have adequately taken care of nation-building measures especially management of our unity and taken care of every anomalous situation and performance or lack of it, that have put us in political, security, economic and solid quagmire situations that we find ourselves, then we must zero on personalities.\n\n\u201cEach contender must be properly x-rayed and profiled from birth and Nigerians must be educated to be able to make a choice that will be in the national interest and propel Nigeria forward. Such a person will have to lead what remains of the nation to courageously continue on the path of nation-building as a national team leader, no matter on what platform he or she assumes leadership.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cNo one can do it alone. We must, however, stop sacrificing character, track records and performance on the altar of ethnic, regional or religious jingoism. As the watchman counts on daybreak, so too do I count on Nigerians and Nigeria to bring forth that person.\n\n\u201cI do not, cannot and will not at this point suggest how and to what, I can only count on the patriotic commitment and desires of well-meaning Nigerians to start the process of forging a path out of darkness into the light of salvation and a new glorious dawn.\n\n\u201cIt is time to reach into the ability of Nigeria to always snatch victory from the jaws of defeat as we start this collective search on how we can climb out of this hole in which we find our country, Nigeria,\u201d Obasanjo explained.\n\nSome of the dignitaries that graced the occasion included the Director-General, World Trade Organization (WTO), Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and President of the Republic of Benin, Nic\u00e9phore Soglo.\n\nOthers, who also spoke physically and virtually at the event included: Professor Goski Alabi (Ghana); Ambassador Barry Desker (Singapore); Professor Juma Shabani (Burundi); Dr. Mary Khimulu (Kenya); Dr. Moussa Kondo (Mali); Professor Sarah Agbor (Cameroon); Professor Chukwuma Soludo (Governor-elect of Anambra State, Nigeria), and HRH Muhammadu Sanusi II (14th Emir of Kano and Khalifa of Tijjaniyya in Nigeria,) to mention just but few.",

          "text": "Nigerians who escaped Russia\u2019s ongoing military offensive in Ukraine arrived in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital, on Friday, narrating how they escaped the intense bombings and missiles fired by Russia\u2019s military forces.\n\nThe war, which has led to the death of hundreds of civilians and troops, leaving thousands injured and many more displaced, has seen millions of foreign nationals fleeing Ukraine for neighbouring countries.\n\nAs of Friday night, no fewer than 775 Nigerians had been flown back to the country. The first batch comprising 415 persons arrived from Romania in the morning while the second batch, comprising 180, arrived from Poland at about 6:30 pm. Another 180 arrived in the third batch. They were all received at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. One more batch was being expected from Hungary and Poland as of the time of filing this report.\n\nSome of the returnees who fled Ukraine to Romania told Saturday PUNCH how they were able to escape the invasion. Despite appeals for diplomacy and the heavy sanctions imposed by other countries, the European Union and other allies, the Russian forces, under the strict orders of President Vladimir Putin, have continued to launch bombs and missiles into different parts of Ukraine, the second largest city in Europe.\n\nAnuoluwakintan Olawoye, a 300-level medical student at the University of Ternopil, said apart from the racial discrimination, she starved, trekked and stood for long hours. She noted that the reports of the invasion and bombs going off in different parts of the country were enough to plant fears in anybody, but that she was happy she was able to escape.\n\nShe said, \u201cI do not wish my enemy what I went through, even though mine was not as bad as others\u2019. There was a curfew, we starved because there was nothing to buy, no store opened and sirens blared every time! No taxis to move from one place to another. We had to trek for hours. The city was becoming vacant. We couldn\u2019t sleep knowing that the country was at war.\n\n\u201cOn Thursday morning, there was a bombing in Kyiv but thankfully I was in Ternopil so I escaped. Again on Friday, some parts of Lviv were bombed; Lviv is two hours journey away from Ternopil.\u201d\n\nOlawoye said she made for the Romanian border after trekking for hours but on getting there, she found that preference was given to Ukrainian citizens.\n\nShe added, \u201cWe got to the border around 4 pm and we were told to wait. We waited till 8 pm and they didn\u2019t allow us (blacks) to go inside. We attempted to make a move when they called on women and children and they turned us back. They only allowed their citizens to go. It was two hours after they left that they said they would come back to us.\n\n\u201cWe pleaded with the officers that the snow was much outside, I was shivering as a result but they did nothing. I crossed about 2 am and it was by luck. Some were not that lucky. The racism that I encountered at the Ukrainian border was not for the weak. They were pushing us aside just to allow their trucks to move. They shouted at us, pushed us and did all sorts.\u201d\n\nOlawoye, however, said she was treated very well in Romania, noting that she would be proceeding to meet her parents. She added that she would love to return to Ukraine to complete her studies once the war ends.\n\nAlso, Abraham Praise said she never believed she could experience such in her lifetime, especially with the bombs and missiles that had killed both troops and civilians in different parts of the country.\n\nShe said, \u201cI trekked for three hours non-stop. I had friends who trekked for more hours. You just had to forget you have legs while you keep going. The thought of you keeping yourself alive would keep you going. Some people fainted along the road. The stronger ones among us had to give them support. I never thought I would have to experience something like this.\u201d\n\nAbraham called on the government to assist evacuees with therapy to get over the experience, saying people who survived war, no matter how distant, needed some counselling.\n\nShe said, \u201cEveryone who has gone through this experience needs therapy. Although we are a strong people, to have made it out alive and be able to see your friends and families is exciting. For some of us, the future is still uncertain because of the disruption in our academics. I am in my third year while some others are in their final year and are meant to graduate in June.\u201d\n\nPraise added, \u201cAlthough I am happy I would be seeing my family, this is not just the way I wanted it. But there is still life and there\u2019s hope. If this is where we would have to start from to move ahead, we are ready.\u201d\n\nRabia Zalka who was in Ukraine with her sister said she didn\u2019t know if she would survive, but that to have made it back to Nigeria alive despite the invasion, rising tension, the bombing of cities and even the capture of the Nuclear plant by the Russians, meant a lot to them.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was really serious until my sister and I walked a long distance to the Romanian border. I trekked for hours. It was not easy. We were keeping an eye on each other and helping each other,\u201d said Zalka.\n\nAnother returnee, Peter Ajuwon, said the Ukraine war should serve as a lesson to Nigerians on the importance of peace.\n\nHe said, \u201cWar is not a favourable situation. Every aspect of life gets affected. I encourage people to embrace peace in Nigeria. Our experiences crossing the border to Romania were not pleasant. Getting to Romania was hell, but we had a pleasant experience in Romania. We got a lot of support from the Romanian government and the Nigerian Ambassador there. Some Romanian NGOs showed us love too; they didn\u2019t discriminate.\u201d\n\nSome of the parents and relatives who came to receive them were visibly elated seeing their children alive. Some of them had kept vigil at the airport, awaiting the return of their children.\n\nOther parents whose children had yet to arrive were seen lurking around and anxiously waiting for their children\u2019s return.\n\nMrs Zalka whose two daughters were among the first batch said she was happy to have her daughters back in the country. She told our correspondent she could not eat, she cried almost every day and prayed for the safe return of her daughters who were schooling in Ukraine.\n\nZalka said, \u201cWe thank God they are back with us. I was not eating, I cried almost every day and prayed fervently while they were away. I don\u2019t have anything to say but to thank God.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the next plans for her daughters, she told our correspondent that she would enrol them in another school in Nigeria.\n\nShe said, \u201cI have secured admission for them in the country, so by next month they should be back in school. There are a lot of universities looking for students, particularly those from Ukraine.\u201d",

          "text": "Ukraine on Saturday urged the West to amp up military assistance to the besieged country, including warplanes, as Russian President Vladimir Putin escalated warnings against NATO.\n\n\u201cThe highest demand that we have is in fighter jets, attack aircraft, and air-defense systems,\u201d Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a small group of journalists on the Poland-Ukraine border.\n\n\u201cIf we lose the skies, there will be much more blood on the ground,\u201d he said after a meeting with his US counterpart, Antony Blinken.\n\nSeparately, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cmade a desperate plea for Eastern European countries to provide Russian-made planes\u201d that Ukrainians are trained to fly, US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said following a video call between legislators and the Ukrainian leader.\n\nREAD ALSO: Russia Resumes \u2018Offensive\u2019 After Mariupol Ceasefire\n\nAs the conflict moved into its 10th day, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the West of a wider war if a no-fly zone is set up, as his forces resumed an offensive against a key Ukrainian city where security fears stalled a planned evacuation.\n\nWhile Zelensky criticized NATO for ruling out a no-fly zone \u2014 amid worries it could spark a wider war \u2014 Putin spoke of \u201ccolossal and catastrophic consequences not only for Europe but also the whole world\u201d if such a zone were established.\n\n\u201cAny movement in this direction will be considered by us as participation in an armed conflict by that country,\u201d Putin said.\n\nAn intense round of shuttle diplomacy continued as Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett made a surprise visit to the Kremlin for three hours of talks with Putin, Bennett\u2019s office said.\n\nIt was Putin\u2019s first face-to-face meeting with a foreign leader since the invasion began.\n\nThe Israeli leader later spoke with Zelensky.\n\nKyiv had asked Israel \u2014 which has strong relations with both Russia and Ukraine \u2014 to launch a dialogue with Moscow.\n\nFor Zelensky, under an escalating bombardment that has flattened more and more infrastructure and sent nearly 1.4 million civilians fleeing, the Western military alliance\u2019s \u201cno\u201d to a no-fly zone essentially gave \u201cthe green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages\u201d.\n\nThe strategic city of Mariupol, on the Azoz Sea, has for days been under attack and without electricity, food and water.\n\nAfter Russia declared a ceasefire to open a humanitarian corridor, city officials said the population of 450,000 could begin to leave by bus and private cars.\n\nBut the officials then delayed the evacuation, saying, \u201cThe Russian side does not adhere to the ceasefire and has continued shelling both Mariupol itself and its environs.\u201d\n\nA Russian Defence Ministry spokesman later announced the assault was back on, citing \u201cthe unwillingness of the Ukrainian side to \u2026 extend the ceasefire\u201d.\n\nThe siege came as Russian forces inched closer to the capital, Kyiv, in an assault that has become ever more indiscriminate \u2014 and deadly.\n\nWorking-class towns such as Bucha and Irpin are in the line of fire, and air raids Friday broke many people\u2019s resolve to stay.\n\n\u201cThey are bombing residential areas \u2014 schools, churches, big buildings, everything,\u201d said accountant Natalia Dydenko, glancing back at the destruction she was leaving behind.\n\nDozens of civilians have been killed in the northern town of Chernihiv. Those remaining live in craters or among ruins.\n\nScenes of devastation\n\n\u201cThere were corpses all over the ground,\u201d a man who gave his name only as Sergei told AFP, as air raid sirens wailed. \u201cThey were queueing here for the pharmacy that\u2019s just there, and they\u2019re all dead.\u201d\n\nAFP reporters saw scenes of devastation \u2014 despite Moscow\u2019s insistence it is not targeting civilian areas.\n\nA defiant Zelensky said Saturday that Ukrainian forces were counterattacking around Kharkiv, the country\u2019s second largest city, inflicting \u201csuch losses on the invaders that they have not seen even in their worst dream\u201d.\n\nKuleba was equally defiant, saying, \u201cUkraine is bleeding, but Ukraine has not fallen, and stands both feet on the ground.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe myth of the unbeatable and almighty Russian army is already ruined.\u201d\n\nSince Putin\u2019s army invaded on February 24, Russia has pummeled Ukrainian cities, with officials reporting hundreds of civilians killed.\n\nBut Moscow has so far seized only two key cities \u2014 Berdiansk and Kherson on Ukraine\u2019s southern Black Sea coast.\n\nCapturing Mariupol, however, would severely limit Ukraine\u2019s maritime access and allow Russian forces to connect by land with troops from annexed Crimea and the Donbas.\n\nThe Kremlin said it was waiting for a third round of talks with Ukraine in Belarus.\n\nThe new talks would take place Monday, the Ukrainian side said.\n\nThe war has had serious global economic impacts, and the IMF warned on Saturday that its effects would be \u201call the more devastating\u201d should the conflict escalate.\n\nRussia\u2019s business and other contacts with the West have been steadily cut. Moscow has suspended all flights by flagship carrier Aeroflot, effective Tuesday.\n\nAnd the list of major companies suspending operations in Russia has grown steadily, now including Spanish clothing giant Zara and fashion chain owner Inditex.\n\nIn Washington, some lawmakers have urged President Joe Biden to take tougher measures, including banning Russia\u2019s oil imports \u2014 though the administration is wary of seeing high fuel prices rise further.\n\nWith fears growing of direct conflict between NATO and Russia \u2014 both nuclear-armed \u2014 the US and Moscow have set up a new direct phone line to reduce the risks of \u201cmiscalculation\u201d, the Pentagon said Friday.\n\nUS General Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, became the latest Western figure to rule out a no-fly zone, saying it would mean taking on Russian air forces \u2014 something, he said in Riga, that neither NATO nor member state leaders are interested in.\n\nMedia exodus\n\nRussian authorities have imposed a news blackout and multiple media outlets have halted operations. Twitter was restricted and Facebook blocked in Russia.\n\nA host of news outlets including the BBC and Bloomberg News said they were suspending work in Russia after a new law there imposes fines and jail terms of up to 15 years for publishing \u201cfake news\u201d about the army.\n\nCNN said it would halt broadcasting in Russia, while independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta said it would remove Ukraine content.\n\nThe Kremlin on Saturday defended the new law, saying it was necessary as the country was facing \u201can unprecedented information war\u201d.\n\nPutin has been unmoved as Russia has become isolated in economic, sporting and cultural fields.\n\nBut that did not stop tens of thousands of people from taking to the streets of Western cities from London to New York to Prague to protest against the invasion.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "Ukraine\u2019s president has attacked Nato leaders in a fiery speech over their refusal to implement a no-fly zone around the country.\n\nSpeaking from Kyiv, Volodymyr Zelensky said the West\u2019s reluctance to intervene has given Russia \u201ca green light\u201d to continue bombarding towns and villages.\n\nNato has argued that a no-fly zone will result in confrontation with Moscow.\n\nBut Mr Zelensky said he disagrees that direct action could \u201cprovoke Russia\u2019s direct aggression against Nato\u201d.\n\nIn angry comments, he said the argument reflects the \u201cself-hypnosis of those who are weak, under-confident inside\u201d and that Western reservations indicated that \u201cnot everyone considers the struggle for freedom to be Europe\u2019s number one goal\u201d.\n\n\u201cAll the people who will die starting from this day will also die because of you. Because of your weakness, because of your disunity,\u201d a furious Mr Zelensky added.\n\nOn Friday, Nato\u2019s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, warned that the introduction of a no-fly zone could lead to a \u201cfull-fledged war in Europe involving many more countries and causing much more human suffering\u201d.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken also ruled out the introduction of a no-fly zone, but told the BBC he is convinced Ukraine can win its war with Russia.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how long this will go on,\u201d America\u2019s top diplomat said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how long it will take. But the idea that Russia can subjugate to its will 45 million people who are ardently fighting for their future and their freedom, that does not involve Russia having its thumb on Ukraine, that tells you a lot.\u201d\n\nAs Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine enters tenth day Moscow\u2019s forces continue to heavily shell many cities.\n\nIn the south-eastern port city of Mariupol, the city\u2019s mayor has said that residents are under a \u201cblockade\u201d after days of \u201cruthless\u201d attacks from Russian forces which has seen power and water shut off to the city\u2019s 450,00 strong population.\n\nVadim Boychenko wrote on the Telegram messaging app that the city is \u201csimply being destroyed\u201d and said officials are prioritising \u201cthe establishment of a ceasefire so that we can restore vital infrastructure and set up a humanitarian corridor to bring food and medicine into the city\u201d.\n\nIn Kyiv, a massive convoy stretching out over 40 miles (64km) remains stalled outside the city, but the Ukrainian capital has come under renewed assault, with explosions caused by intense shelling audible in the city centre.\n\nThere have also been unconfirmed reports of fresh fighting on Saturday in the north-eastern city of Sumy and of rocket attacks on the train station in Ukraine\u2019s second city, Kharkiv, above a metro station where city residents are sheltering from shelling, and in the northern city of Chernihiv.\n\nAnd the US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, has warned that Russian troops have advanced within 20 miles (32km) of Ukraine\u2019s second biggest nuclear facility.\n\nHer comments follow Friday\u2019s attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which she said reflected a \u201cdangerous new escalation\u201d in Russia\u2019s invasion. Moscow\u2019s ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, dismissed reports that Russian troops attacked the plant as \u201clies\u201d and \u201cdisinformation\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile in Russia, a new law signed by President Vladimir Putin that would impose prison terms of up to 15 years on people charged with spreading \u201cfake news\u201d about the war in Ukraine has seen several western media outlets, including the BBC, suspend operations in the country.\n\nTim Davie, the BBC\u2019s director-general, said the legislation \u201cappears to criminalise the process of independent journalism\u201d in Russia, while the Washington Post said it will remove by-lines from pieces written by its reporters in Russia.\n\nIt comes as Sky News released dramatic footage of their correspondent Stuart Ramsey coming under fire outside Kyiv.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Zelensky addressed massive rallies in support of Ukraine in several cities across Europe, including the Czech capital Prague and the Georgian capital Tbilisi.\n\nHe warned demonstrators: \u201cIf Ukraine does not survive, the whole of Europe will not survive.\u201d\n\nBut in the Serbian capital of Belgrade, some 4,000 people have taken part in a pro-Russian rally that marched from a monument of Russian Tsar Nicholas II to the Russian embassy.\n\nDemonstrators sang the Serbian and Russian national anthems and carried Russian flags and pictures of President Vladimir Putin.\n\nElsewhere, in a sign that Western sanctions are starting to have a tangible impact, Italian police have seized the yachts of two of Russia\u2019s wealthiest oligarchs.\n\nOfficers seized a 213ft (65 metre) yacht worth $27m (\u00a320m) owned by Alexey Mordashov, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin and Russia\u2019s richest man, in the northern port of Imperia, officials told local media.\n\nAnother yacht, owned by Gennady Timchenko, another oligarch with close ties to Putin, has been impounded in Imperia, officials said.\n\nMordashov is worth an estimated $29bn and built his wealth around the Russian steel producer Severstal, while Timchenko is said to hold around $17bn of assets and made his fortune in oil trading.\n\nBBC",
          "summary": "Ukraine\u2019s president has attacked Nato leaders in a fiery speech over their refusal to implement a no-fly zone around the country.\nNato has argued that a no-fly zone will result in confrontation with Moscow.\nBut Mr Zelensky said he disagrees that direct action could \u201cprovoke Russia\u2019s direct aggression against Nato\u201d.\nOn Friday, Nato\u2019s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, warned that the introduction of a no-fly zone could lead to a \u201cfull-fledged war in Europe involving many more countries and causing much more human suffering\u201d.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken also ruled out the introduction of a no-fly zone, but told the BBC he is convinced Ukraine can win its war with Russia.",

It would be the first breakthrough in allowing civilians to escape the war.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry statement said it has agreed on evacuation routes with Ukrainian forces to allow civilians to leave the strategic port of Mariupol in the southeast and the eastern town of Volnovakha \u201cfrom 10 a.m. Moscow time.\u201d It was not immediately clear from the vaguely worded statement how long the routes would remain open.\n\nThe head of Ukraine\u2019s security council, Oleksiy Danilov, had called on Russia to create humanitarian corridors to allow children, women and the elderly to escape the fighting, calling such corridors \u201cquestion No. 1.\u201d\n\nAs Russian forces batter strategic locations, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has lashed out at NATO for refusing to impose a no-fly zone over his country, warning that \u201call the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you.\u201d\n\nNATO says a no-fly zone could provoke widespread war in Europe with nuclear-armed Russia.

          "text": "Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, who served as Nigeria\u2019s head of state from 1976 to 1979, and later as its president from 1999 to 2007, turns 85 on Saturday, amid goodwill messages from eminent Nigerians wishing him good health and long life.\n\nFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar congratulated his former boss while praying to God to continue to bless \u201cthis giant of Africa\u201d with good health and that his legacies of good governance should continue to manifest in many parts of Africa.\n\nIn a statement he personally signed, Atiku, who served as Vice President during the Obasanjo presidency said, \u201cThe celebration of Obasanjo is parallel to celebrating vision of good leadership and pan-Africanism.\u201d\n\nAtiku adds: \u201cThe vision which Obasanjo brought into governance either as a military head of government or as a democratically elected president continues to set the pace for progressive ideals in governments across Africa.\n\n\u201cIn the decades of the late \u201870s when almost all of Africa was covered in military dictatorships, Obasanjo set the pace for a transfer of power to civilian government in Nigeria and that singular effort began the process of democratisation across the continent.\u201d\n\nFormer Senate President, Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki described Obasanjo as a man who at 85 years remains the pride of Nigeria and Africa.\n\nSaraki in his goodwill message to mark the birthday of his former boss under whom he served as Special Assistant (Budget Matters) between 2000 and 2002, stated that Obasanjo laid the solid foundation that ensured the survival of democracy in the country.\n\nHe noted that in the same vein, the former President continued to play a key role in achieving peace, unity, and development of the continent as he still serves in different capacities to entrench stability across Africa.\n\nSaraki said: \u201cBaba, you have continued to bring honour to our country, Nigeria, and her over 200 million citizens. For decades, you have been the pride of our dear nation and its flagbearer in striving for the maintenance of peace not only in Africa but also across the globe.\u201d\n\nIn his message, Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, described Obasanjo as a quintessential leader not only in Nigeria but globally.\n\nHe said the retired military general and elder statesman, \u201cis worth celebrating at 85, having served Nigeria in many capacities, especially for unity, peaceful coexistence and socio-economic growth and development of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu, in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary Mr. Gboyega Akosile, Friday, said Obasanjo is one of the few Nigerian leaders who had contributed immensely to the growth and development of the country both as military and civilian leader, and left with impeccable records.\n\nHe said Obasanjo at the global level \u201cis a leader to be reckoned with\u201d due to his passionate involvement on African affairs and other global issues.\n\nSanwo-Olu said: \u201cObasanjo has made lots of positive impacts in the country as a military officer and political leader, fighting along with several other patriots for a united Nigeria during his days in the Nigerian Army.\n\n\u201cHe has written his name in gold as the first Nigerian to serve as Head of State and later Civilian President. He also administered the country with focus on improving the lives of the citizens and the country\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nGovernor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State also felicitated with Olusegun. In a brief statement posted on his Instagram page, Abiodun showered praises on the former president, describing him as a \u201cliving legend\u201d.\n\nHe also prayed that the former president continues to age gracefully in excellent health.\n\nA message released by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin in Abeokuta yesterday read: \u201cNot many can boast of your profile \u2013 civil war hero, federal commissioner, former chief of staff, supreme headquarters, two-term president of Nigeria, retired military general, peace maker, farmer, family man, politician, author, traditional titles\u2019 holder, global statesman and with an earned Doctor of philosophy (Ph.D) obtained at age 80.\n\n\u201cYou remain, for us, an inspiration as a living legend and symbol of Ogun Standard of Excellence. As you clock 85 today, you still spend every moment, not just for yourself, but for the successor generations and the rest of humanity. Even at your advanced age, you keep sacrificing for security, stability, development and co-operation across Africa and the rest of the world. Your footprints remain indelible in the sands of time. Our prayer is that you keep trudging in excellent health on the global plain and may every stage of your life be more exciting than the previous.\u201d\n\nThe Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello described Obasanjo as an \u201cexceptional and patriotic leader who used \u201cThe best of his life to work for the unity and stability of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBello said that the former president also worked tirelessly to achieve peace on the African continent\n\nIn a message to mark the 85th birthday of the elder statesman, the governor said Obasanjo had also become \u201ca living legend and a strong voice within and outside the shores of the country, considering the outstanding and commendable sacrifices he made for Nigeria and many African countries.\n\n\u201cChief Obasanjo is one leader that has had a very rare opportunity to serve the country both as a Military Head of State and democratically elected president and did so exceptionally well.\n\n\u201cHis democratic finger prints on the African continent are indelible. He is a beacon of democracy and stands tall in the hall of fame of the greatest African leaders,\u201d Bello said.\n\nThe governor on behalf of the government and people of Niger State joined millions of well-wishers of the former President, within and outside Nigeria to pray for more strength, good health and wisdom to the celebrant.\n\nFormer Senate President, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim described Obasanjo as a foremost statesman and citizen of the world.\n\nIn a birthday message to the former President who clocked 85 today, Anyim, a frontline presidential aspirant for next year\u2019s election said Obasanjo had demonstrated unwavering commitment to the unity, peace and progress of Nigeria.\n\nThe former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) and staunch member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) also recalled that OBJ, as the former President is popularly called, played key roles at various stages of Nigeria and Africa\u2019s political history.\n\nThe congratulatory message, which Anyim personally signed read: \u201cBaba! You are a true citizen of the world, an outstanding leader in Africa and our nation\u2019s pre-eminent statesman. You have demonstrated unwavering commitment to the unity, peace and progress of our dear country, Africa and the world at large.\n\n\u201cYou stand out as a true patriot. You have continued to give your all to see Nigeria take her place among the comity of nations, as a richly endowed country.\n\n\u201cYou have played key roles at various stages of Nigeria\u2019s and Africa\u2019s political history. At all those stages, you provided visionary and principled leadership guided by deep love for and commitment to the well-being of Nigerians and the black man.\n\n\u201cYou have remained a voice of reason, cautioning and proffering solutions as Nigeria wades through the many challenges of nation building. You have written letters, books, given lectures at home and abroad, all in the effort to communicate your thoughts and ideas on how to make Nigeria work. As a result, your stature towers on the world stage.\n\n\u201cBaba, I want to assure you that Nigerians appreciate you and your noble contributions to the peace, unity, progress and development of our dear country.\n\n\u201cGod has blessed you with good health, strength and a sharp mind. May He continue to uphold you as you continue your worthy service to our dear country, Africa and the world at large.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government on Friday evacuated 804 Nigerians fleeing the devastation caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThis came on a day a coalition of 165 Nobel laureates, including Nigeria\u2019s Wole Soyinka, openly condemned the Russian Federation led by Vladimir Putin, for its \u201cunprovoked military aggression towards Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe evacuees arrived on three flights to Abuja with the first batch of 450 from Romania landing at the private jet terminal of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja at 7:10 am via Max Air.\n\nThe second batch of 180 Nigerians, including four children arrived on board Air Peace from Poland at 6.55 pm.\n\nThe third batch arrived at around midnight from Hungary on board Air Peace.\n\nThe evacuees were mostly students who fled Ukraine to Romania, Hungary and Poland following Russia\u2019s invasion of the Eastern European country.\n\nThe arrival of the Nigerians is a welcome relief after initial reports that they and other Africans were being ill-treated and prevented from leaving Ukraine through the Polish border.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, who condemned the ugly development, said there were about 4,000 Nigerians in Ukraine, mostly students.\n\nHe said one group had repeatedly been refused entry to Poland so they travelled back into Ukraine to head for Hungary instead.\n\nAccording to President Buhari in a tweet, \u201cAll who flee a conflict situation have the same right to safe passage under the UN Convention, and the colour of their passport or their skin should make no difference.\u201d\n\nSome of the evacuees who spoke to journalists on arrival yesterday appreciated the federal government for its efforts in ensuring they were safely evacuated but narrated the pains they had to go through to get out of Ukraine.\n\nWegwu Kella, a female Nigerian from Rivers State and student said it was a bitter/sweet feeling leaving Ukraine back to Nigeria.\n\nShe said: \u201cI feel Ukraine has been home and since my arrival in that country, things have been working out well but I feel I am safe and returning to Nigeria to meet loved ones. I was really in another city when the bombing started. The social media was awash with news of the impending attack so I had left the capital city. When I was leaving for the border, I was in the cold and had to walk for six hours straight to get to the gate and on getting to the gate they were allowing only Ukrainians to pass and I had to leave and get a bus to another border point. This took another 24 hours to get to but this time around I was in a bus.\n\n\u201cI cannot explain how I got here because I was going to miss the flight, I went to the embassy yesterday to register and I got to the airport and was told the plane was full. I waited to see if any opportunity arises and today because I was in front of the line I was able to make the flight.\u201d\n\nAnother evacuee, Eniola Badejo, also a student appreciated the government\u2019s efforts, but appealed for more information and better coordination as the exercise continued.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe thank our government because it has been really tiring, we went through a lot of stress, many of us travelled all the way and we barely slept. I am just happy going back to my family.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s Ambassador to Poland, Christian Ugwu appreciated President Buhari for his swift intervention and release of funds to get all stranded Nigerians in Ukraine back home.\n\nUgwu said the embassy in Poland was on top of the situation and had successfully coordinated the first batch that was being evacuated already.\n\nThe ambassador, however, urged all Nigerians who had made it to Poland to ensure they got ready to be evacuated home rather than remain in Poland.\n\nAmb. Bolaji Akinremi, leader of the evacuation exercise from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, explained that the March 3 flight was cancelled due to delay in getting all the intending evacuees together from their respective hotels.\n\nAkinremi explained that as at when they were ready, the International law did not allow for the crew members to continue with the journey as they had overshot their duty time.\n\nWole Soyinka, 164 other Nobel Laureates Condemn Invasion\n\nA coalition of 165 Nobel laureates, including Wole Soyinka, Friday openly condemned the Russian Federation, led by Putin, for its \u201cunprovoked military aggression\u201d towards Ukraine.\n\nThis was stated in an open letter jointly signed by the Nobel laureates, who stated that there were other peaceful ways to solve disputes.\n\nThe scholars also noted that the invasion \u201cwill stain\u201d the international reputation of the Russian state for decades to come.\n\nA copy of the letter made available on Vox Ukraine partly read: \u201cIn a move that recalls the infamous attack of Nazi Germany on Poland in 1939 (using similar tricks of feigned provocation) and on the Soviet Union in 1941, the government of the Russian Federation, led by President Putin, has launched an unprovoked military aggression \u2014 nothing else but a war \u2013 against its neighbour, Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe choose our words carefully here, for we do not believe the Russian people have a role in this aggression.\n\n\u201cWe join in condemning these military actions and President Putin\u2019s essential denial of the legitimacy of Ukraine\u2019s existence.\n\n\u201cThere is always a peaceful way to resolve disputes. The Russian invasion blatantly violates the United Nations Charter, which says all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.\n\n\u201cIt ignores the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, which obligated Russia and others to respect the sovereignty, independence, and existing borders of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe Russian invasion will stain the international reputation of the Russian state for decades to come. It will pose barriers to its economy and inflict hardships on its population. The sanctions imposed will restrict the ease of movement of its talented and hardworking people in the world. Why raise this fence between Russia and the world now?\n\n\u201cHundreds of Ukrainian soldiers, Russian soldiers, and Ukrainian civilians, including children, have died already. It\u2019s so sad, so unnecessary. We gather in this appeal to call upon the Russian government to stop its invasion of Ukraine and withdraw its military forces from Ukraine.\u201d\n\nReinstating their support for Ukraine, the scholars said, \u201cWe respect the calm and the strength of the Ukrainian people. We are with you.\n\n\u201cOur hearts go out to the families and friends of all, Ukrainians and Russians, who have died and been injured already. May peace come to this piece of our beautiful world.\u201d\n\nRussian Forces Seize Europe\u2019s Largest Nuclear Power Plant\n\nRussian forces seized control of Europe\u2019s largest nuclear power plant yesterday after a battle with Ukrainian troops that caused a fire and fears of a catastrophic accident.\n\nThe Ukrainian nuclear regulator said that the fire had been extinguished and no radiation leak had been detected, with site staff still able to work at the Zaporizhzhia site.\n\n\u201cThe Zaporizhzhia NPP site has been seized by the military forces of the Russian Federation. The fire was extinguished by the Ukrainian State Emergency Service units,\u201d the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine said in a statement.\n\nEarlier, fighting had erupted between Russian invasion forces pushing towards the city of Zaporizhzhia and Ukrainian defenders, causing a blaze at the plant and global alarm.\n\nThe power station is located in southern Ukraine on the Dnipro River and produces a fifth of Ukraine\u2019e electricity.\n\nAny fire in a nuclear plant revives memories of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, also in Ukraine, which left hundreds dead and spread radioactive contamination west across Europe.\n\nOf the six reactors at Zaporizhzhia, the agency said, one is in operation and producing power, one has been turned off and four are being cooled to prevent overheating.\n\nThe regulator did not say, however, what each reactor\u2019s status had been before the fire.\n\nAn on-site inspection is being carried out by Ukrainian staff.\n\nUkraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow of resorting to \u201cnuclear terror\u201d by risking a repeat of the Chernobyl disaster and begged world leaders to back Kyiv.\n\nHe said: \u201cNo country other than Russia has ever fired on nuclear power units,\u201d he said in a video message released by his office. This is the first time in our history; in the history of mankind. The terrorist state now resorted to nuclear terror.\u201d\n\nZelensky alleged that the Russian troops had knowingly fired on the nuclear facility.\n\n\u201cThese are tanks equipped with thermal imagers, so they know where they are shooting,\u201d said Zelensky.\n\nUkraine\u2019s nuclear facilities have been a major point of concern since Russia\u2019s military invaded the country last week and began bombarding cities with shells and missiles.",
