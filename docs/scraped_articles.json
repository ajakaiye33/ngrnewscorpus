          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nResidents of Oriba community in the Epe Local Government Area of Lagos State are facing a tough time with the complete absence of basic health facilities. LARA ADEJORO reports how residents of this off-grid community across the river are surviving with a century-old abandoned health centre.\n\nJourneying through the waters from Itokin to Oriba can be a perilous trip, especially for first-time visitors. It usually takes a couple of men to push a canoe off the shoreline to the deep river to launch a 45-minute ride to the community.\n\nBeside the river is the Flight 086 Memorial Arcade that the Lagos State Government built in 1996, in memory of the victims of the ill-fated ADC aircraft Boeing 727-231.\n\nWhen our correspondent paid a visit to the community, the stark realities of a locality without a health facility was witnessed right from the beginning of the journey.\n\nInside the canoe boarded by our correspondent was a shrouded corpse, accompanied by family members on their way to Oriba. The corpse was a male.\n\nThe corpse was their brother \u2013 ShamsudeenYinusa \u2013 who had died early that morning, after being rushed in a canoe from Oriba to Agbowa General Hospital, Agbowa, Lagos.\n\nAccording to the family members, Yinusa started vomiting in the night, and because Oriba has no doctor or nurse or a functional health centre, he was rushed to Agbowa but eventually died.\n\nHealth is no wealth for residents of the Oriba community. Same goes for more than 25 other villages depending on Oriba, such as Lamodi, Ibon, Oko-Abe, Ito-Omu, Orepete, Ladeba, Ipesu, Gadangba, Aba Itun, among others.\n\nThese communities, reeling under deprivation, poverty and hunger, only have their fishing and farming enterprise to cling on to.\n\nAside from a public primary and secondary school, they are disconnected from basic life amenities such as potable water, electricity and a functional primary health centre.\n\nThe late Yinusa, in his 50s, happens to be one of the victims of the non-existence healthcare infrastructure in Oriba.\n\nLife is uncertain\n\nAs narrated to PUNCH Healthwise, on June 13, 2021, Yinusa had retired to his house around 11 pm, after spending some time with his friends. He had hoped he would hand over the canoe he was constructing to his customer the next day when he suddenly fell ill.\n\nHe had rolled from his bed to the floor while gasping for breath, PUNCH HealthWise learnt. His family members and neighbours rallied around to save him but they could do nothing in the absence of a public health facility.\n\nThey had all stayed awake until 5 am the next day before they sailed him with a canoe to Agbowa General Hospital.\n\nIt takes over an hour to travel from Oriba to Agbowa. Yinusa died that evening.\n\n\u201cHe was not sick; he was working on a canoe that day before he came back and was chatting with us before he went to sleep,\u201d his relative, OwodeAkeem, said.\n\n\u201cBut when his room partner went home around 3 am, he found him on the floor and he had vomited on the floor.\n\n\u201cThat was when he screamed and alerted us. We did our best to revive him but nothing more could be done.\n\n\u201cIf there had been a hospital here, he wouldn\u2019t have died. We would have taken him to the hospital.\n\n\u201cIt was not until yesterday morning around 5 am that we took him to Agbowa General Hospital but unfortunately, he died,\u201d said Akeem.\n\nYinusa\u2019s tragic death is an insight into how residents of Oriba die from treatable health conditions, as they are unable to get the medical attention they need.\n\nAccording to PUNCH Healthwise findings, two weeks before Yinusa\u2019s death, the community had lost another man, Mr. Lawal Ashamu.\n\nOlatunji Olorunsanya, who is Ashamu\u2019s grandson, said he had been at a meeting inEpe on that fateful day when he was called that Baba was feverish.\n\n\u201cIt was on a Sunday and I was about to come to see him when I was called. I learnt he passed on 30 minutes after the call.\n\n\u201cHad it been that the primary health centre we have here was functional, they might have saved his life,\u201d said Olorunsanya.\n\nBabies born in canoes\n\nIf the situation is bad for those who suddenly fell ill, it is most times worse for pregnant women who need ante-natal and post-natal care. They are left with no option than to seek help from traditional birth attendants or give birth to their babies while being sailed in a canoe to the nearest health centre.\n\nAsisat Rasaq, 25, is one of such women, as she recently birthed her twins in a canoe.\n\nAsisat said she started having contractions about 10 am on February 12, 2021, but had to wait for an available canoe to take her out of the community for delivery.\n\nA canoe finally arrived around 4 pm, and six women assisted her into the canoe. But halfway into the journey, she gave birth to her twin boys.\n\nRasaq, who is a mother of four said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a good experience. It was the women there that took care of my delivery and we didn\u2019t bother going to the hospital again.\n\n\u201cEver since I gave birth to them, I have not visited the hospital, I use local herbs (agbo) for them, as prescribed by the elders among us and my children are doing fine.\n\n\u201cNone of my children has taken immunization; I give them agbo. I gave birth to the first two children in ile alagbo (herbal home),\u201d she said.\n\nNo potable water, toilet, electricity\n\n\u201cYou see, the shore where you alighted is where we bend to defecate. That is where we take our bath and we drink from the same water,\u201d the 72-year-old baale of the community, Nurudeen Olowolayemo Ilufemiloye, said while pointing at the river.\n\nOur correspondent observed some cheery children bathing and swimming by the shore of the river, while others were defecating at the same time.\n\nSpeaking in the Yoruba language, the baale said the community has been in existence since the 19th century.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have always supported the ruling party in the state but we are suffering; we are really suffering.\n\n\u201cWe move anywhere the party is moving but despite that, we are suffering in this community. The government does not even think of the community,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe call on the state government to save us, for God\u2019s sake. The community has no water, no light.\u201d\n\nIlufemiloye also believes a functional health centre might have saved Yinusa that died.\n\n\u201cSometimes, when our women are due for delivery and we want to take them to a health facility, the hyacinths obstruct the canoes, and they end up giving birth along the way.\u201d\n\nHe added that an electric pole was installed in the community in 2015 but it has not been connected to the grid.\n\n\u201cWe are suffering, yet we claim we are in Lagos state,\u201d he lamented.\n\nDecade-long abandoned PHC\n\nWhile the World Health Organisation says the fundamental premise of primary health care is for people everywhere to access the right care in their community, the health centre in Oriba falls short of this.\n\nThe PHC in the community is now in a state of total disrepair, due to many years of neglect.\n\nThe facility has been overtaken by weeds, while a small signboard on the wall shows that the structure was renovated in 2012.\n\nThe baale forced the locked rusted gate open while urging for caution so as not to step on a harmful object.\n\nOn entering the facility, mouse and goat dung littered the corridor of the building.\n\n\u201cSomeone comes here to sweep it once a while, but I heard they pay her N10,000 monthly. The other person who is meant to cut the weeds has not been coming,\u201d the baale said.\n\nHe drew the attention of our correspondent to the two blue empty water tanks and a big sound-proof white Kipor generator abandoned in the facility.\n\nThe baale said the health centre was built over 100 years ago but has never been functional.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control has given reasons why it has not approved any herbal medicine for the treatment of COVID-19.\n\nThis is contained in a statement signed by the agency resident Media Consultant, Mr. Olusayo Akintola, and issued to newsmen on Sunday, in Abuja.\n\nThe statement quoted Prof Moji Adeyeye, NAFDAC Director-General, as saying that \u201cno single drug has been found yet to cure COVID -19.\u201d\n\nAdeyeye also warned Nigerians against excessive consumption of onions and garlic with a view to curing COVID-19, saying, \u2018\u2019If you eat too much your breath will be smelling and nobody will want to stay by you.\u201d\n\nShe said that medicinal products available now could only help ease symptoms and up the odds of survival.\n\nShe warned Nigerian researchers and other herbal medicine practitioners to desist from parading unverified medicine for the virus.\n\nShe said that any product without NAFDAC approval for the cure of COVID-19 is null and void, adding that such an act was a violation of the national regulatory authorities and a breach of protocols.\n\nShe admitted that onions or garlic or any of the natural fruits that we take have antioxidants and nutrients that can help us feel better, adding that people might have been using it and they get better.\n\n\u201cIf it is not documented, it cannot be recognised by NAFDAC for COVID \u2013 19. They work on our cells to keep people healthier, but not to cure COVID \u2013 19. They help our body to function better. There is no cure for COVID -19 yet,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that they may boost the immunity and the person may not be easily susceptible to infection, adding that \u2018\u2019even with that, you still have to protect yourself.\n\n\u201cIf you eat garlic and onion and you don\u2019t use a face mask, you will get COVID -19. If you are in a bad environment; If you don\u2019t wash your hands, you will get COVID -19.\n\n\u201cEverything has to be put together. The University of Jos said that there was herbal medicine, whether it is tea or whatever, that can cure COVID-19, they linked it with the treatment of COVID -19, they did the packaging.\n\n\u2018\u2019We did a letter to warn them that they cannot claim something unless it has gone through our listing process. They were trying to sell it to their staff. That is a violation of our own regulatory policies.\n\n\u201cNobody should say that this one can cure this or that without going through NAFDAC listing process, the research into herbal medicine by the academia is normal.\n\n\u2018\u2019It is now for the academia to also recognise the national regulatory authority established to safeguard the safety of the Nigerian populace, by ensuring that the product that they are working on has to go through NAFDAC,\u201d Adeyeye said.\n\nAccording to her, there have been one or two cases where the University of Jos product was being encouraged to be used by people without going through NAFDAC.\n\nShe said that the university was supposed to go through the national regulatory authority and pave the way for NAFDAC to declare it safe for consumption.\n\nThe DG insisted that her agency must approve the clinical trial protocol, stressing that \u2018\u2019If they don\u2019t do that but go ahead to market and sell their product, such act would be a violation of regulatory procedures.\n\nAccording to her, some people might have been using it and they got better, but without being approved scientifically and documented, we may not be able to guarantee its safety for human consumption.\n\nShe recalled that NAFDAC set up a herbal medicine product committee in March 2019 before the pandemic broke out, to advance research in herbal medicine.\n\nAdeyeye said that the goal for such an idea was to make sure that the herbalist and the researcher were collaborating, so that whatever the herbalist knows from ancestral history that the research will back it up.\n\nShe explained further that collaboration with the researcher would enable such herbal medicine to be advanced and to be listed by NAFDAC if found safe for consumption.\n\nAccording to her, during the pandemic there were lots of assertions that there were herbal medicines, that could be used to treat symptoms of COVID -19, pointing out that there was no single medicine that has been identified yet.\n\n\u201cBut there are herbal medicines that could alleviate symptoms of COVID -19. However, NAFDAC has not granted registration of approval for any medicine for that.\n\n\u201cNAFDAC approves such medicines for listing, it means that it\u2019s been tested and was deemed safe to use. NAFDAC cannot say herbal medicine can treat COVID -19 until a clinical trial is done.\n\n\u201cRight now, there is no single herbal medicine that has gone through the full clinical trial the way a clinical trial is supposed to be done,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to her, to do an official clinical trial, you must write a protocol, you must pass it through the National Health Research Ethical Committee (NHREC), and you must pass it through NAFDAC.\u201d\n\nShe said that the agency has not given any pass mark as regards COVID-19 herbal medicine, but that the agency has approved some herbal medicines that they claim can alleviate some of the symptoms of COVID -19.\n\nShe said that some of the approved herbal medicine which they claim can alleviate COVID-19 symptoms only work as immune boosters.\n\nAdeyeye pointed out that such herbal medicine may prevent one from getting the disease, adding that, as far as NAFDAC was concerned, it has not approved any medicine to treat COVID -19.\n\n\u201cWe have approved medicines that they said can alleviate symptoms and relieve people of some symptoms of COVID \u2013 19, when the product is listed then the clinical trial may start.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of money to do a clinical trial. The University of Jos has been given the approval to commence clinical trials of their products which is yet to commence.\n\nThe DG further disclosed that many herbal products have been submitted for federal government grants because most of the herbal practitioners lack the required wherewithal to do a clinical trial.\n\nShe said that many of these herbal products were being subjected to review by different agencies of government in the country.\n\n\u201cIn terms of going through clinical trial and official protocols, none has come through yet.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, such herbal products can be used during the clinical trial to investigate whether it could be effective for COVID -19.\n\n(NAN)",

          "text": "The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control has given reasons why it has not approved any herbal medicine for the treatment of COVID-19.\n\nThis is contained in a statement signed by the agency resident Media Consultant, Mr. Olusayo Akintola, and issued to newsmen on Sunday, in Abuja.\n\nThe statement quoted Prof Moji Adeyeye, NAFDAC Director-General, as saying that \u201cno single drug has been found yet to cure COVID -19.\u201d\n\nAdeyeye also warned Nigerians against excessive consumption of onions and garlic with a view to curing COVID-19, saying, \u2018\u2019If you eat too much your breath will be smelling and nobody will want to stay by you.\u201d\n\nShe said that medicinal products available now could only help ease symptoms and up the odds of survival.\n\nShe warned Nigerian researchers and other herbal medicine practitioners to desist from parading unverified medicine for the virus.\n\nShe said that any product without NAFDAC approval for the cure of COVID-19 is null and void, adding that such an act was a violation of the national regulatory authorities and a breach of protocols.\n\nShe admitted that onions or garlic or any of the natural fruits that we take have antioxidants and nutrients that can help us feel better, adding that people might have been using it and they get better.\n\n\u201cIf it is not documented, it cannot be recognised by NAFDAC for COVID \u2013 19. They work on our cells to keep people healthier, but not to cure COVID \u2013 19. They help our body to function better. There is no cure for COVID -19 yet,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that they may boost the immunity and the person may not be easily susceptible to infection, adding that \u2018\u2019even with that, you still have to protect yourself.\n\n\u201cIf you eat garlic and onion and you don\u2019t use a face mask, you will get COVID -19. If you are in a bad environment; If you don\u2019t wash your hands, you will get COVID -19.\n\n\u201cEverything has to be put together. The University of Jos said that there was herbal medicine, whether it is tea or whatever, that can cure COVID-19, they linked it with the treatment of COVID -19, they did the packaging.\n\n\u2018\u2019We did a letter to warn them that they cannot claim something unless it has gone through our listing process. They were trying to sell it to their staff. That is a violation of our own regulatory policies.\n\n\u201cNobody should say that this one can cure this or that without going through NAFDAC listing process, the research into herbal medicine by the academia is normal.\n\n\u2018\u2019It is now for the academia to also recognise the national regulatory authority established to safeguard the safety of the Nigerian populace, by ensuring that the product that they are working on has to go through NAFDAC,\u201d Adeyeye said.\n\nAccording to her, there have been one or two cases where the University of Jos product was being encouraged to be used by people without going through NAFDAC.\n\nShe said that the university was supposed to go through the national regulatory authority and pave the way for NAFDAC to declare it safe for consumption.\n\nThe DG insisted that her agency must approve the clinical trial protocol, stressing that \u2018\u2019If they don\u2019t do that but go ahead to market and sell their product, such act would be a violation of regulatory procedures.\n\nAccording to her, some people might have been using it and they got better, but without being approved scientifically and documented, we may not be able to guarantee its safety for human consumption.\n\nShe recalled that NAFDAC set up a herbal medicine product committee in March 2019 before the pandemic broke out, to advance research in herbal medicine.\n\nAdeyeye said that the goal for such an idea was to make sure that the herbalist and the researcher were collaborating, so that whatever the herbalist knows from ancestral history that the research will back it up.\n\nShe explained further that collaboration with the researcher would enable such herbal medicine to be advanced and to be listed by NAFDAC if found safe for consumption.\n\nAccording to her, during the pandemic there were lots of assertions that there were herbal medicines, that could be used to treat symptoms of COVID -19, pointing out that there was no single medicine that has been identified yet.\n\n\u201cBut there are herbal medicines that could alleviate symptoms of COVID -19. However, NAFDAC has not granted registration of approval for any medicine for that.\n\n\u201cNAFDAC approves such medicines for listing, it means that it\u2019s been tested and was deemed safe to use. NAFDAC cannot say herbal medicine can treat COVID -19 until a clinical trial is done.\n\n\u201cRight now, there is no single herbal medicine that has gone through the full clinical trial the way a clinical trial is supposed to be done,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to her, to do an official clinical trial, you must write a protocol, you must pass it through the National Health Research Ethical Committee (NHREC), and you must pass it through NAFDAC.\u201d\n\nShe said that the agency has not given any pass mark as regards COVID-19 herbal medicine, but that the agency has approved some herbal medicines that they claim can alleviate some of the symptoms of COVID -19.\n\nShe said that some of the approved herbal medicine which they claim can alleviate COVID-19 symptoms only work as immune boosters.\n\nAdeyeye pointed out that such herbal medicine may prevent one from getting the disease, adding that, as far as NAFDAC was concerned, it has not approved any medicine to treat COVID -19.\n\n\u201cWe have approved medicines that they said can alleviate symptoms and relieve people of some symptoms of COVID \u2013 19, when the product is listed then the clinical trial may start.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of money to do a clinical trial. The University of Jos has been given the approval to commence clinical trials of their products which is yet to commence.\n\nThe DG further disclosed that many herbal products have been submitted for federal government grants because most of the herbal practitioners lack the required wherewithal to do a clinical trial.\n\nShe said that many of these herbal products were being subjected to review by different agencies of government in the country.\n\n\u201cIn terms of going through clinical trial and official protocols, none has come through yet.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, such herbal products can be used during the clinical trial to investigate whether it could be effective for COVID -19.\n\n(NAN)",

          "title": "Katung helps vulnerable Kaduna students to pay school fees",
          "text": ".\n\n\u2026Calls on Kaduna Government to reduce school fees\n\nBy Ibrahim Wuyo,Kaduna\n\nThe Marshall Katung Foundation has declared willingness to assist Kaduna students by giving them scholarships to study in Kaduna State higher institutions where tuition fees were hiked recently by the State government.\n\nThe Foundation said students from 10 out of the 23 local government areas of the State will benefit from the scholarship in the first phase, while 13 local government areas will follow suit.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Kaduna on Sunday, the Founder of the scholarship project, Mr Sunday Marshal Katung who is a former member of the House of Representatives and running mate to PDP governorship candidate, Isah Ashiru in the 2019 Kaduna gubernatorial election, said he decided to compliment the efforts of people of goodwill that are interested in improving the educational standard of vulnerable students to pay their school fees\n\n\u201cI stand before you today with so much happiness to inform you about some of the humble interventions we have done and are planning to do in the educational sector, in response to the difficulties some students of our tertiary institutions are facing in paying their school fees.\n\n\u201cConscious of this, we have decided to compliment the efforts of people of goodwill that are interested in improving the educational standard of the country by initiating a strategy to help the vulnerable students to pay their school fees.\n\n\u201cIn the first phase of our intervention, we are going to give scholarships to vulnerable students from 10 LGAs comprising of Chikun, Kajuru, Kachia, Zango kataf, Jaba, kauru, Kaura, Jemaa, Sanga and kagarko, studying in Kaduna State University, College of Education Gidan Waya, Nuhu Bamali Polytechnic and College of Nursing, Kafanchan.\u201d\n\nHe said they have created a dedicated website with a portal that eligible students from these institutions would apply through, adding that In the second, phase they would look at students studying in other institutions so as to see how they could help.\n\n\u201cBut the Marshall Katung foundation isn\u2019t restricted to only intervening in the tertiary institutions because we have done intervention on a lot of pupils in some secondary schools. We have also distributed aid to the displaced ones among us while feeding more than 1000 households during the COVID-19 lockdown in particular,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhy are we preparing to give scholarships to tertiary students now? The general insecurity in Kaduna state has resulted in the temporary closure or relocation of about two tertiary institutions and about 18 boarding secondary schools. This has resulted in some students staying at home \u2013 idle. And we know that from the state of idleness comes the possibility of indulging in crimes with its negative implication. That\u2019s why Victor Hugo said whoever opens a school door closes a prison door. And for us, we are not only concerned with opening school opportunities for our students but also giving them hope for the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all know that the life-changing significance of education is reflected in the serious attention that countries with foresight pay to it. This is anchored on the verifiable fact that a country develops only about its achievement in the educational sector. And nothing stresses the importance of education for a developing country like Nigeria like the more than Nigeria\u2019s 10 million out of school children, according to the Minister of state for education, Mr Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba when he spoke in March at the launching of Better Education Service Delivery for All (BESDA) in Jigawa state.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis high number means Nigeria has the highest in sub-Saharan Africa. But more depressing for us is the fact that 69 per cent of the total out of school children in Nigeria is located in the north. Add factors like general insecurity, poverty and school kidnapping in the north and you would agree with me that everything needed to secure and advance the educational growth of the north in general and Kaduna in particular, shouldn\u2019t be toyed with. Like Benjamin Franklin said, \u201cIf a man empties his purse into his head, no man can take it away from him. An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also want to call on the Kaduna State Government to reduce the school fees being demanded from students of its educational institutions. This increment is coming amid a global economic contraction due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was buttressed by the International Monetary Fund which noted that the global economy shrunk by 3.5 per cent in 2020. This represents the deepest global recession since the Second World War. The World Bank also estimates that COVID-19 has pushed an additional 88 to 115 million people into extreme poverty last year. And low-income families are the worst hit. Nigeria isn\u2019t excluded from this.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo this and the pervasive insecurity in our state forms the biggest basis upon which we are appealing to the Kaduna state government to reduce the school fees so the children of the poor can have the opportunity of getting an education. Moreover, access to affordable education should be seen as the welfare responsibility of a state to its citizens and not be turned into a profit-making venture. Leaders who got educated for free in the past have a moral obligation of currently ensuring that school fees stop no one from being educated.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernance to me must aim at producing happiness at the highest level for all. The marshal katung foundation is now inviting potential students to apply through the foundation\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cWith the belief that we shall soon get out of these economic and security challenges facing us as a people, I want to thank you very much for listening,\u201d he said.\n\nIt could be recalled that the State government had announced an increase in tuition fees of the State-owned tertiary institutions in Kaduna State University, College of Education Gidan Waya, Nuhu Bamali Polytechnic and College of Nursing, Kafanchan.",

          "text": ".\n\n\u2026Say we can\u2019t go to school, farm\n\nBy Ibrahim Wuyo Kaduna\n\nDisturbed by the conflicts in Zango Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna state, the Atyap Community Development Association ( ACDA) has called on the government of Kaduna state to without fear or favour, come alive to its responsibility and put an end to the killings of its citizens.\n\nComrade Samuel T. Achie, President of the ACDA, said at a press conference in Kaduna on Saturday, that the government should ensure that the perpetrators are fished out and brought to face the wrath of the law.\n\n\u201cWe say enough is enough looking at the casualties.In all the attacks in the 12 different villages as at today , a total of 42 people were killed and 338 houses burnt with 7 people wounded. Several other valuables were not left out as 8 Cars, 13 motorcycles, generators, food and domestic items were either looted or consumed by fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur revered places of Worship were not spared as 7 churches and their pastoriums razed down by fire in various locations.\n\nAmong the Houses razed down by the activities of these Fulani Militia are the family compound of our paramount Ruler, His Royal Highness Sir Dominic Yahaya in Magamiya and also the Family Compound of Retired Major General Shekari Biliyock in Abuyab a former commandant of the Nigeria-African Peace Keeping Arm, the ECOMOG.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe entire Atyap Nation seems to be at loss to these senseless killings by the Fulani Militia, as we have bend over to implement the decisions of the peace accord reached with the parties involved.\n\nThe question is what else were we supposed to do that was not done? It seems apparent that these attacks are being sponsored with larger motives than meet the eye.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith all these being said, Gentlemen of the press, in concrete terms we can submit that the resolve of our desire for peace is under threat by this Fulani Militia. We felt that we will be better off if we stay in peace as brothers as was the case in time past. It is a well-known fact world over that all crises are not won at the battlefield, but at the round table through discussions that could lead to amicable resolution of the crisis with the parties determined to bring an end to it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said they were compelled to make this statement in order to bring to the attention of the world and Nigeria in particular on the attacks and the assuming genocide on their land.\n\n\u201cThe attacks spanned across the Atyap dominated districts in the Chiefdom as if it was a deliberate act. These attacks are not mere herders or Banditry, but premeditated attempts to wipe out the Atyap race. We have made efforts to be at peace with all the people in the chiefdom thus the importance of this briefing. The Atyap people were defenceless for the whole time the carnage took place with no protection.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no any place in all the areas attacked that has a distance of more than 10 to 15 minutes drive from one security checkpoint to the other. It is not only lives and houses that were destroyed, but crops and places of worship inclusive. Our people are known to be purely peasant farmers, but at this season of farming have to abandon their farms for fear of being killed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll schools in the area are closed down hence our children can no longer go to school, therefore, creating a humanitarian crisis for all the displaced people in the land, which in turns create an urgent need for Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) Camp to cater for those that have been left at the mercy of the weather both in rain and sunshine without any roof on their heads since the renewed persistent attacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese whole things look like the Fulani Militia wants to grab and occupy our land. The Atyap people are law-abiding citizens that have been loyal to all successive governments to date and wonder why we should be left alone to carry our cross now. Based on these, we ask that government provide more troops, humanitarian relief materials and a peaceful atmosphere for all, else we will be left with no other option than to protect ourselves using all legal means,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Garba Shehu\n\nThe Presidency has described as unfortunate and disappointing the way and manner Bishop Matthew Kukah castigated his country, Nigeria, before the United States Congress.\n\nA statement by the President\u2019s spokesman, Malam Garba Shehu, on Sunday in Abuja, advised Kukah to desist from sowing discord and strife among Nigerians.\n\nThe presidential aide believed that the opinions expressed by Kukah before the US Congress were personal, and not opinions held by majority of Nigerians.\n\nAccording to him, religious leaders who preach respect for truth have a duty to practice it, and it is a moral and practical responsibility to stand up publicly for the truth.\n\nHe said: \u201dThere is no place in mainstream civil discourse for those who actively, negatively, and publicly label an individual ethnic group, especially before a foreign audience.\n\n\u201dThese are not the views expressed or opinions held by the vast majority of the citizens of Nigeria.\n\n\u201dFor all our challenges as a nation, nearly all of us seek to live together in harmony, celebrating differences, and finding a common ground as Nigerians above all.\n\n\u201dBut people like Kukah are doing their best to sow discord and strife among Nigerians.\n\n\u201dMore than any other set of people, leaders \u2013 in politics or religion who preach respect for truth have a duty to practice it. It is a moral and practical responsibility.\n\n\u201dGoing by the history of the Church as is well known, it will stand up publicly for the truth.\n\n\u201dIt is time others did the same.\u201d\n\nALSO READ: COVID-19 red alert: Sanwo-Olu pleads residence over adherence to protocols\n\nThe presidential aide quoted some sections of the Holy Bible to justify his condemnation of those using ethnic and religious sentiments to promote social discontent among Nigerians.\n\nHe said: \u201dTo be clear, The Bible is definitive on matters of ethnicity and racialism:\n\n\u201dIn Romans 2:9-10, it says: \u2018There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile; but glory, honour and peace for everyone who does good\u2019.\n\n\u201dAnd in Galatians 3:28: \u2018There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe added that: \u201cWhether Christian or Muslim, we stand by these beliefs and are steadfastly committed to them in governance.\u201d\n\nShehu described Kukah\u2019s mission statement in the US as a familiar \u201doverseas political tours that opposition politicians take \u2013 visiting foreign leaders and legislators in the United States, United Kingdom and Europe.\u201d\n\nHe said such \u2018tours\u2019 were meant to attract maximum media attention back home to score cheap political goals.\n\n\u201dSo, the argument goes, if they are heard seriously abroad, then Nigerian citizens back home should surely listen to them too.\n\n\u201dBut in order to be heard at all, and to maximise media coverage back home for their activities, inevitably these visits involve painting the worst possible picture of our country before their chosen foreign audience.\n\n\u201dSoon enough we inescapably hear an identical list of racist tropes against northerners, how one religion dominates governance above all others, and how the government is doing nothing to address herder-farmer disturbances.\n\n\u201dAnd how the government spends money on infrastructure to benefit everyone but the group and religion of the speaker.\n\n\u201dOf course, in order not to disappoint their western audience, regardless of fact, the list is always the same-and always slanted for whoever wishes to cross-check,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Shehu, Nigerians expect this from their unimaginative opposition.\n\nHe, however, maintained that \u201dit is troubling when a so-called man of the Church copies the worst excesses of those seeking personal advancement in public office.\u201d\n\nHe noted that it was only the Buhari administration that had so far put forward the first and singular plan in nearly a century to address herder-farmer challenges \u2013 a fact recognised by international NGOs, including the International Crisis Group.\n\n\u201dTo declare to a foreign audience that this government does nothing is an incredible falsehood.\n\n\u201dTo suggest that investment in infrastructure between Nigeria and Niger is wasteful and biased \u2013 when a similar infrastructure project between Lagos and Benin has revolutionised the two neighbouring economies to the advantage of both our countries \u2013 is quite disturbing,\u201d he further maintained.\n\nThe presidential spokesman also frowned at Kukah\u2019s attempt to accuse the Buhari administration of promoting ethnic and religious sentiments in the country.\n\nREAD ALSO: Lawmakers against electronic transfer of results won elections through rigging, protecting own interest \u2013 Middle Belt Forum\n\n\u201dThere is no bias in this government when the president is northern and Muslim, the vice president southern and Christian, and the cabinet equally balanced between the two religions.\n\n\u201dBut neither is there anything in our Constitution to state that political posts must be apportioned according to ethnicity or faith.\n\n\u201dIt takes a warped frame of mind for a critic to believe ethnicity is of primary importance in public appointments.\n\nIt is yet more troubling to hear a Churchman isolating one group for criticism purely on ethnic lines,\u201d he added.\n\nShehu also condemned Kukah\u2019s position that only Christian students were largely being targeted or kidnapped by bandits in the Northern part of the country.\n\nHe said: \u201dWith due respect to the esteemed position he holds, the Bishop\u2019s assertion that only Christian schools are being targeted by bandits or terrorists is not supported by the facts on the ground.\n\n\u201dIt is sad to say but also true that victims of crime, kidnapping, banditry and terrorism cut across all strata of the society.\n\n\u201dSad but true that Kankara students in Katsina State were kidnapped by bandits of the same Islamic faith as those they took away.\n\n\u201dThe same may be true of those who are still holding the 134 students of the Islamic School at Tegina in Niger State.\n\n\u201dThe nation witnessed the sad incident of the female students abducted by bandits at Jangebe in Zamfara State and the over 100 predominantly Muslim students of the Federal Government Girls College Birnin Yauri in Kebbi State.\u201d\n\nThe Birnin Yauri students are still in captivity as the nation\u2019s security agencies are hard at work to release them unharmed.\n\nHe added: \u201dThe attack on Christian students is sad and unacceptable; so also is the abduction of students of other faiths.\n\n\u201dThe claim that only Christian schools are being targeted is totally untrue.\n\n\u201dAs a nation and a people, we must together define evil as evil. We must not allow our religious differences to divide us.\n\n\u201dNo one gains but the evildoers when we divide our ranks according to ethnicity and religion in confronting them.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the bandits, kidnappers and terrorists are the enemies of the people who should be confronted in unison.\n\n(NAN)\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

This is where the need for quick passage of the National Water Resources Bill that made provision for the National WASH Fund, as well as regulatory environment for private sector involvement in the sector, become relevant.\n\nThe president observed that access to adequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene were part of the indices for the economic development of any country.",

FCT/HC/CV/1544/2021 Mr. Danladi Umar vs Clement Sargwak) and the issue as to whether or not Clement Sargwak had discontinued and/or withdrawn his petition before your Honourable Committee is equally subjudice.\n\n\u201cWe trust that Senate, as the Upper Chamber of the National Assembly, will respect due process and refrain from delving into a matter that is before a court of competent jurisdiction,\u201d the letter reads.\n\nThe CCT chairman had as widely reported in print and electronic media physically assaulted Sagwak at the Bannex Plaza in Wuse 2, Abuja on March 29, 2021.\n\nIn seeking redress, the assaultee filed a petition against Umar to the Senate which it gave its Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petitions to investigate.\n\nThough the embattled CCT chairman had on invitation, appeared before the committee once, he shunned several other invitations thereafter.\n\nHe informed the committee through his attorneys during last Tuesday\u2019s sitting by members, that he was already in court against the investigation, which the committee kicked against and ordered him to appear before it unfailingly on Tuesday, July 27, 2021, or risk issuance of an arrest warrant on him.\n\nBut after receiving the originating summons slammed on the committee and suit filed against Sargwak by Umar, Senator Akinyelure cried out to journalists on how the hunted is turning to be the hunter\n\nAkinyelure at a press briefing in his office said with the court summons, it is clear that the CCT chairman will not appear before his committee tomorrow, adding that his action will be challenged in the court by the legal department of the National Assembly since no arm of government is empowered to stop another from carrying out its constitutional duties or functions.\n\n\u201cInvestigation on the assault meted out to a fellow Nigerian by the CCT chairman had already commenced before he ran to court but his move will also be challenged by the legal department of the Senate.\n\n\u201cHe may not come, but the committee will still have a session on the matter and other petitions before it.\n\nCCT chairman Danladi Umar assaults Abuja mall security staff [Video]",

          "text": "By Vincent Kalu\n\nPromoters of Bayelsa Oil Company Limited alongside its Joint Ventures Partners, Hardy Oil Nigeria Limited and Century Exploration/ Production Limited, have appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene in their effort to restore Alata Oil Field in (OML 46) belonging to them.\n\nThis came after reports said Minister of State for Petroleum Resources and the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) awarded the field to Halkin Exploration and Production Limited without knowledge of the true facts surrounding the development of the Field by the Joint Venture Partners.\n\nIn a press statement signed by the management of Bayelsa Oil Company Ltd, and its Joint Venture Partners, debunked newspapers publications that the said oil field was awarded to Halkin Exploration and Production Ltd on grounds of its investment in reviving the Field and transfer of 41 per cent interest of BOCL in the Field to Halkin Exploration and Production Ltd.\n\nThe statement said \u201cWe restate that the Joint Venture Partners of BOCL \u2013 Hardy Oil Nigeria Limited and Century Exploration and Production Limited are indigenous companies owned by Nigerian entrepreneurs through 20 percent and 29 per cent stakes, respectively, in the said Marginal Field with a State Enterprise-Bayelsa Oil Company Limited (a company wholly owned by the Bayelsa State Government) as Operator, holding a controlling 51 per cent stake on behalf of the Bayelsa State Government.\n\nThe JV Partners further stressed that: \u201cIt is pertinent to state here that Atala Marginal Oil field (OML 46) has been developed, crude oil produced and sold from the same field at different stages of test crude production. Royalties on crude oil sold from the field had been paid to the Federal Government severally before the field was revoked under very strange and suspicious circumstances.\n\n\u201cAt present, the Joint Venture Partners have invested massively in bringing the Field into production of Test Crude preparatory to commencement of commercial production. The revocation of the asset has put into jeopardy the entire efforts and resources pumped into the development of the Field by the JV Partners. Most of these funds were secured through loans from banks in respect of which Atala Field (OML 46) Joint Venture Partners are still repaying with huge interest.\n\nIt was against the significant milestones achieved regarding the joint operations at the Alata oil field that full Production Permit was awarded to them by DPR in August, 2018.\u201d\n\nThe statement further added: \u201cCurrently, there are about 20,700 barrels of unevaluated crude oil at Atala Field. Consequently, Atala JV Partners executed Crude Handling Agreement (CHA) with Excel Exploration and Production Limited to handle Atala crude, as well as use their pipeline for transporting Atala crude to Shell Petroleum Trans Forcados pipeline.

          "text": "By Agatha Emeadi\n\nBig Brother Naija star, Mercy Eke, has continued to shine as a sought-after brand ambassador after winning the BBNaija Reality Show (Pepper Them edition) in 2019.\n\nIn a recent chat with Sunday Sun at Mega Plaza, Victoria Island, she stated why she turned down some brand offers.\n\nShe also opened up on her new ambition to empower young girls who have genuine business ideas, but lacked the financial capacity to start up, how to complete her Lambo Homes, and M&M clothing line.\n\nFollowing your activities since 2019 when you won the BBNaija reality show, how has life been?\n\nI thank God for all these. Life has not been easy, but also easy at the same time. I would not thread this jackpot lifestyle for anything. God has been great. I have been working hard, working on myself. I have also been trying to work on the stereotype of being forgotten after one year. That is putting me on my toe that I have to do extra things to remain very relevant in the industry. I just need to work extra hard to keep the tempo going. I am not taking anything for granted. I have had my worst times in this journey, but I give God all the glory.\n\nWhat sort of bad moments did you have?\n\nBad moments could come in form of health challenges, family, relationship and mental crisis. These could be bad moments for someone. Most times, it is also for us to know that money cannot guarantee happiness. When I say, I had my worst times, don\u2019t forget I am also human, I would have had a fair share of my personal challenges.\n\nAs a sought-after brand ambassador, have you rejected any endorsement since you came out of the House?\n\nYes, I have rejected a few brands. Some who would want to sign me on, but not willing to come to terms with my conditions. I like brands that do not want conflicts and work with all the ambassadors. Since brands pay millions to take their products to the next level, I have a responsibility to bring value to such works, but when someone likes to trade off conflicts, I do not like such. If brands do not agree to my terms, I might not work with them because I really want my peace as you can see that I am a work in progress. I would not want to work where peaceful atmosphere does not exist. I would not like to come to a shoot where people are all frowning, and that creates a bitter aura among the people who should collaborate. I would not want to be labeled a difficult ambassador to work with; so, if I see that from the onset, I might turn the offer down. But recently, Payporte unveiled me as their brand ambassador because we agreed on terms and conditions and I promise to represent them well. I dropped a lot of brands that could not meet up with my terms.\n\nApart from the millions you are paid as a brand ambassador, what are the other attractions?\n\nNow, Payporte which is my latest offer is a big fashion brand, I went to their page and love what they deal with, I buy from them a lot even before we started the ambassadorial journey. When the offer came two years ago, I had my background check and felt it is what I can relate with. I like to work with such brands because they have a lot of beautiful and affordable outfits for all. Their brand relates with mine and we agreed on certain visions that we can work together on and that is it.\n\nSo, what new thing do you bring to the table when you are signed on?\n\nThe partnership is what I normally take to the next level. I like bringing values to the brands I work with. I am shooting a season two reality show that will go worldwide with time. It will air on African Magic 198.\n\nIs the reality show personal or is it for Payporte?\n\nI am shooting the Season 2 of Mercy Ekeh reality show which centres on my lifestyle, how I live, the things I do, the brands I work with. A reality show that is about my life, Mercy Eke, what next?\n\nIs it a show modelling around Oprah Winfrey show?\n\nIt is a personal show that centres around me, myself and I alone, just like the Kardashian show?\n\nWhat about your romantic life?\n\nRight now, I am single, but not searching.\n\nTake us into your lifestyle, who was Mercy Ekeh, where are you coming from?\n\nMercy Ekeh was born and raised in Owerri, Imo State. We lived as a family especially with my mum and sisters. All my schooling was in Owerri, Imo State. I graduated from Imo State University where I studied Psychology.\n\nAs a fashion brand ambassador, tell us about the things you like to wear?\n\nMy style in fashion is comfort, and not the price. The outfit on me today is from Payporte, which is comfortable, classy, sexy and beautiful. I love confidence in my style, it does not matter what brand I wore, it must be comfortable. Again, being sexy in what one is wearing is what fashion means to me.\n\nWhat about our Nigerian designers, how would you access them?\n\nI wear a lot of Nigerian brands when I attend events; they amaze me a lot; but I am here today for another business.\n\nDo you regret your love in the house?\n\nNo, I do not regret my love with my ex-boyfriend. Love is a beautiful thing and that was a beautiful experience for me. I enjoyed it while it lasted, but life will always move on.\n\nWhat did you do with the lockdown last year during COVID-19?\n\nIt was really hard, because I was indoors likewise everyone. I created content at the comfort of my home and put it out there. I was at home too working with the brands on social media.\n\nNengi is also a brand ambassador of Payporte, some people claim that both of you are not friends; how true is that and how do you intend to work with her?\n\nWell, like we discussed this morning, we are having a photo shoot in Paris together. If we are not together, how would such hold? Most times, the social media create these stuffs.\n\nTalk about the memorable times for you in Big Brother House?\n\nI liked the tasks I got involved with, relationships, and the amazing people I met in the house that up till today we have built it into another bigger family. Some people came to the house for the fame, some came to do things to better our lives.\n\nWhat drives you because you are multi-talented. Actress, model and entrepreneur?\n\nWhat drives me is the hunger to help my family, people around me and be independent as a woman.\n\nNow that you are here, are you in touch with the home to encourage much younger girls to be where you are today?\n\nI just launched my Mercy Eke Foundation here in Lagos. I want to give out N5 million to young girl-entrepreneurs. It is basically for young girls who have genuine business idea, but do not have the money to facilitate their dreams. That will be my own contribution in my own little way.\n\nWhere would you want to be in the next five-10 years?\n\nMaybe in my husband\u2019s house\u2026(Laughter). I want to have my real estate business \u2018Lambo Homes\u2019 completed. My fashion brand, M&M Luxury, which is a fashion brand that everyone can afford to be up there. My brand is all about making women beautiful. One does not need to break the bank before she looks good.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From George Onyejiuwa, Owerri\n\nLeader of BIM-MASSOB, Chief Ralph Uwazuruike has told the United Nations that there would be no peace in Nigeria until the sovereign state of Biafra is duly recognised by the world body.\n\nUwazuruike also accused the Federal Government led by President Muhammadu Buhari of promoting the activities of armed Fulani herdsmen who he claimed have been attacking Nigerians.\n\nThe BIM-MASSOB leader stated this at the weekend during a virtual conference organized by the Harvard Law Students under the auspices of Unrepresented Nations and People\u2019s Organizations, (UNPO) and United Nations (UN) International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, convened to determine the Land Use/Border Rights and Extra-Territorial Obligations of nations in quest for self-determination.\n\nThe founder of MASSOB in a statement made available to newsmen in Owerri, the Imo State capital, by his Personal Assistant on Media Matters, Elder Chris Mocha, said that the main purpose of the conference was to gather members\u2019 challenges to their lands, as well as share general perspectives, recommendations, and/or good practices regarding land rights.\n\nUwazuruike, who accused President Buhari of promoting the activities of armed Fulani herdsmen, pointed out that the president nullified the decision of the 17 Southern governors on anti-open grazing by insisting on reclaiming grazing routes across the country.\n\nHe claimed that the \u201carmed Fulani herdsmen came to our lands to graze their cattle, they came with their Ak-47 riffles and killed our people, raped our women and the Federal Government simply because they are promoting these people or feeling incapable of arresting or stopping the atrocities these people commit against our people.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cas usual I represent the state of Biafra. In Nigeria right from time immemorial, lands belong to individuals and families. But in 1976, immediately after the Biafra-Nigeria civil war, the military government of Nigeria promulgated the Decree of 1976 which invested all lands in Nigeria to the state governors.\n\n\u201cThere are 36 states in Nigeria and the federal capital territory, Abuja. So, all the 36 governors are owners of the lands in Nigeria and the Federal Government owns the capital territory, Abuja. But the Federal Government does not respect this Decree of 1976.\n\n\u201cJust recently, the 17 Southern governors came together and banned open grazing in the entire Southern region, the president of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari nullified the action of the 17 Southern governors and said that there was a grazing route that must be established to enable the armed Fulani herdsmen to come to our lands in the South to graze their cattle.\n\n\u201cThis grazing route is against the provisions of the Constitution of Nigeria because it is not contained in the 1999 Constitution as amended. But because of his position as the president of Nigeria and a Hausa/Fulani man, he wants to enforce it against our will.\n\n\u201cIn Biafra land, which is in the Southern Nigeria, our lands are blessed with crude oil deposits, and fertile. Because of the fertility of our lands, the Fulani forced themselves into our lands to graze their cattle.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, the atrocities we are having today in Nigeria emanated from the Land Use Act of 1976.\n\nBecause these people came to our land to commit all these atrocities because they have the protection of the Federal Government of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nUwazuruike pointed out that the Nigeria-Biafra war was as a result of the injustices perpetrated against the people of Biafra.\n\n\u201cAnd that is why it is very essential that Biafra must be given recognition by the United Nations. Because if Biafra is not given recognition as a sovereign state, these atrocities will not stop because our land is rich with mineral resources as against the North that is a desert area,\u201d he claimed.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "For The Records: Igbo still surrounded by lingering pain of defeat \u2013Bianca Ojukwu",
          "text": "Being the text of a paper delivered by Ambassador Bianca Odumegwu Ojukwu on the occasion of the International Research Conference on 50 years post-Nigeria civil war on July 6, 2021 at Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Anambra State.\n\nThe Nigeria/Biafra war ended on January 15, 1970 and Biafra was re-integrated into the Nigeria polity with the official policy of \u2018No victor, No vanquished\u2019 with the planned implementation of the three Rs: Reconciliation, Reconstruction and Rehabilitation.\n\nThe essence of this discourse is to delve into the rudiments and practical applications of this policy, as well as interventions that were propagated as formulas for healing the wounds created by the war, but in effect exposed the complexities and hypocrisy of policy formulations which have consistently failed to deal successfully with the intricacies and challenges of the post conflict scenario. It is also my intention to undertake a cursory analysis of these initiatives in order to determine to what extent each policy has achieved the desired success in addressing the critical national issues of integration and reconciliation.\n\nWhat has become glaringly obvious is that the much touted three Rs, far from being agents of re-integration ended up as a cover under which the Igbo, with other southern minorities that comprised the breakaway Republic of Biafra, right after the war were subjected to unimaginable punitive monetary measures with the payment of a paltry twenty pounds to Igbo depositors irrespective of whatever amount of money they had saved in the banks; a veiled process by which they were subjected to the harshest set of realities starting with the predicaments of Biafran soldiers and Ex-servicemen who were rendered destitute at the end of that war, to the calculated economic emasculation of the Igbos who were to all intents and purposes excluded from the formal economic sector by the Indigenization Decree whilst reeling from the abandoned property saga.\n\nLittle wonder, then that the late legal luminary and human rights icon, Chief Gani Fawehinmi in an interview published in the News Magazine of August 10, 1998 was prompted to state that\u2026\n\n\u2018the Igbo still bear the scars of the Biafran crisis, and they are still being treated as if the war is still nascent; which is wrong. They have been kept out of security forces of this country at strategic levels. I don\u2019t know how many senior police officers are Igbo, and the Army \u2026 it is not fair if you want to establish one country, to marginalize a majority of that magnitude and importance and innovative leadership\u2019.\n\nThe manifest challenges of a genuine re-integration of the Igbo into mainstream Nigeria and the lip service approach to the Gen. Yakubu Gowon post war pronouncement of \u2018No Victor and no Vanquished\u2019 compelled Gen. Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, Biafra\u2019s wartime leader, in his welcome address to the members of the National Reconciliation Committee at a summit held in Enugu on March 13, 1997 to declare that,\n\n\u2018The conduct of the war and the manner of its end were no less enlightened. How could a people already inundated with superior arms and endless supplies call for hunger as an (additional) instrument of war against their brothers and sisters? How could one imagine, how much less implement, a policy depriving every Igbo man of his life-long savings and money \u2013 leveling everyone far below a poverty line of twenty pounds each, regardless of their wealth? How could a people turn around to evolve a certain indigenization policy intended to make some people buy over the economy after ensuring that their brothers and sisters had no kobo to participate in doing so? How could you march forward and deprive a section of its properties \u2013 their only remaining source of sustenance \u2013 merely by unilaterally labeling the property abandoned? Abandoned in a foreign land, Jack? We are yet to touch the cases of Igbos who after rendering meritorious services in the Armed Forces and the police, as well as the civil service, were rendered non-persons by both official and unofficial policies of those in power. These do not include a multitude of decrees, edicts, court rulings, infrastructural policies, administrative measures, socio-cultural schemes, and other countless designs intended to achieve the same objective of impoverishing, humiliating, and marginalizing a whole race. No one remembered that these Igbos were the same that played and would continue to play a pivotal role in Nigerian politics, in its economic construction and development, and its unity. All the above were in the context of a certain policy called \u201cRehabilitation, Reconciliation, and Reconstruction\u201d in whatever order. The only sense in which we can value rehabilitation is when the Igbos are fully rehabilitated into full Nigerian citizens. Instead of any of the above policies and practices abating, they have found expression in some other ways \u2026in quota school admissions, capricious designation of educationally disadvantaged states, haphazard application of federal character, whimsical boundary adjustments, provocative promotions in the services and so on and so forth, none of which \u2013 as bad as the policy and concept are \u2013 mean what it says, and all of which are carefully crafted and targeted mainly against a section of the Nigerian population, NDIGBO. These are all central issues of justice, democracy and human rights which some of our compatriots in Nigeria would either enjoy violating or watch being violated, of course, to the detriment of Ndigbo\u2019\n\nIt remains an incontrovertible fact that the Federal Government of Nigeria has confronted grave difficulties in her efforts to work out a workable engagement between the nationalities- most especially the Igbo within its union, and the nation-state to which they are said to belong, so many decades after the war. How could a government which never deemed it necessary to institute any mechanism or platform for reconciliatory justice in the mould of a truth and justice commission to address the war atrocities be said to be sincerely committed to reconciling its ethnicities? The major considerations in the aftermath of the war should not just have focused on the issue of who would control political power at the center but more importantly, how that political power would be shared in such a way that the states, which are the federating units can act as a moderating influence on the center as the case should be, in a true federation; greater attention should also have been given to how the interests of the various nationalities could be balanced in such a way as to guarantee equality, freedom and equity for all its citizens, and most prominently, how to engender in every Nigerian, that national consciousness which would make him not only proud to be identified as a Nigerian, but also to give that citizen a stake in the nation, such that he or she would be prepared to die for it.\n\nEven the Guardian of London at the end of that war stated that \u2018Nigeria\u2019s independence has so far been vitiated by the chronic power struggles of its three major tribes. Nigerians now want to ensure that a workable balance of power is struck between the states and the center, and above all, that no one group dominates the center. The federal victory has not remade Nigeria\u2026 it has only provided a chance to do so\u2019.\n\nTo what extent successive federal governments have been able to utilize this opportunity effectively remains a matter of debate. Some of the initiatives that have been put in place to assuage the competition (and to what extent they may be considered positive or adverse) among the various nationalities- for wealth, political power, political positions, social services, education, allocation of resources, the composition and control of the Armed Forces and the police, the bureaucracy and the corporations, will be briefly highlighted here, with special emphasis on the Igbo experience of the practical application of such policies.\n\nThe Nigeria/Biafra war most commonly referred to as the Civil War (although I am quite sure that most people here today will agree with me, that there is absolutely nothing that is civil about any war, let alone a war between \u2018brothers\u2019) has taught us that whatever happens to, or in the Armed Forces of Nigeria can affect the peace and stability in the country. Did it not become inexorable that Nigeria would be subjugated to military rule midway into its First Republic which in turn would result in a civil war, and would subsequently be subjected, even post war, to a series of military and ex-military rulers?\n\nFollowing the secession of Biafra in 1967, the Nigerian government had ordered all its officers and men who were training at facilities all over the world to return home for the war. They were instructed to return to their bases in their respective regions. Most of these officers and men who returned to their bases which fell under the Biafran areas were compelled to join the Biafran side. At the end of the war, however, the reintegration policy of the Federal Government after amnesty was granted to ex-Biafran soldiers, was limited in its application and many Nigerian officers and men of South Eastern extraction who fought on the side of Biafra discovered that their names were either removed from the list of officers and men of the Nigerian Army, Navy or Air Force as the case may be or that they were not entitled to either pension or gratuities.\n\nFurthermore, in the same process of reintegrating ex-Biafran soldiers into the Nigerian military, a board of officers was set up to investigate the war activities and roles of officers on the secessionist side. When this exercise was concluded, the Adebayo Commission recommended that combatant officers above the rank of Captain were either to be dismissed, discharged or retired without benefits and only Lieutenants and junior officers were to be re-absorbed. Even at that these officers were to face challenges in terms of benefits and promotion. This decision was so craftly implemented to neutralize an entire generation of Igbo officers and edge out the Igbo from ever rising within the Army. It took forty years after the Biafra war for an Igbo man, Lieutenant General Azubuike Ihejirika to be appointed the Chief of Army Staff, under the President Goodluck Jonathan administration in 2010. In view of the foregoing, to what effect, then, was General Gowon\u2019s post war speech of reintegration when considered in basic human terms? Moreover, over five thousand police officers who fought on the Biafra side were granted general amnesty only in 2003 by President Olusegun Obasanjo but had to wait till 2007 to receive their entitlements, a whole 37 years after the end of the war.\n\nFifty years on, the Igbo remain structurally disadvantaged in the Nigeria Armed Forces as well as inadequately represented. As at today no Igbo is a serving Service Chief in the Armed Forces and surviving ex-Biafran soldiers have continued to ask for genuine reintegration and assimilation into the nation\u2019s Armed Forces, if only to facilitate the payment of their pensions.\n\nSince the end of the Nigeria/Biafra war there have been an assortment of government programs or policies designed essentially to promote, as has been claimed, the integration and reintegration of the various ethnic nationalities. I have briefly discussed the federal military government\u2019s own notion of reintegration as was applied to officers and men of the Biafra Armed Forces. It was anything but equitable.\n\nOne of the better known initiatives set out by the Federal Government after the Biafra war aimed at reintegrating citizens and reuniting the country is the National Youth Service Corps program (NYSC) which came into existence by decree number 24 of 22nd May 1973. The program is a mandatory one-year service to the country after completion of a first degree for youth under 30 years of age, participation being a pre-requisite for employment and holding public office in Nigeria. The scheme is designed to aid social integration by deploying youths to states outside their states of origin or primary residence to unfamiliar locations on assignment to work in areas or fields relevant to their academic pursuit. It was projected that this exercise will provide youth with an opportunity for cross-cultural interactions which would in turn help to reduce inter-ethnic stereotypes, as well as suspicion and distrust which were prevalent among the various ethnic groups after the war. It was also anticipated that the exercise would inculcate a strong sense of patriotism among Nigeria youth and enhance the levels of social tolerance required to dismantle cultural barriers and fuel harmonious relationships, even promoting inter-tribal marriages.\n\nWhether this program has achieved its lofty objectives in terms of integration of ethnic groupings or not, has been subject to controversy. The commission itself continues to be plagued by mismanagement, corruption, and most significantly, the inability to guarantee the security of the lives of the corpers themselves in their location of service. There have been numerous tragic incidents where corpers have been caught up in sectarian conflicts or killed just simply for belonging to a different ethnic group and in post-election violence. A case in point occurred during the 2011 general elections where many corps members of southern descent were butchered by some irate northern youths. With the prevailing security situation in the country caused by Boko Haram, rampaging herdsmen and the scourge of the unknown gunmen, and with serial reprisal attacks it goes without saying that intending youth corpers are no longer at ease with engaging in service in crisis-prone areas. It is also given that youths of Igbo extraction would consider their lives at greater risk if deployed for service in certain states of North eastern Nigeria and also vice versa in the case of northern youths who are deployed for service in South eastern states. This places a question mark on the issue whether this initiative can justifiably be considered a veritable tool of integration in today\u2019s Nigeria. There have also been accusations of ethnic bias as well as favouritism in the posting of corps members. The reality is that many of these corpers, after concluding national service have been routinely denied employment in their states of assignment and invariably end up being discriminated against and tagged as \u201cnon-indigenes\u201d. More often than not they are forced to return to their states of origin for employment. It would appear, then, that the scheme is yet far from the realization of its goal of fostering national integration and this has led to recent calls to scrap the program.\n\nAnother much publicized initiative of integration is the federal character principle. This principle was outlined in the 1979 Constitution and was conceived to tackle the problem facing the practice of true federalism, taking into cognizance the diverse and plural nature of the Nigerian society. It was equally projected to address what has been described as the \u201cparochialism of ignorance\u201d which breeds distrust and suspicion among the various ethnic groups in Nigeria. The federal character principle, it was claimed, \u2018would promote unity, peace, equal access to state resources whilst also accommodating the diverse ethnic, religious and geographic groups in the economic, socio-cultural and decision-making apparatus of the state, with special consideration for less advantaged states for overall improvement in the lives of the citizenry\u2019. In practice, however, this initiative has ended up eclipsing meritocracy and introducing patent mediocrity, cronyism, nepotism and corruption into the Nigerian bureaucracy and public service and by extension perpetuating the ethnic bias it was intended to combat.\n\nThe federal character commission, it would seem, has invariably capitulated to the seemingly intractable malaise which affects public institutions in Nigeria today, employing levels of favouritism and nepotism which seem blatantly to ignore Nigeria\u2019s cultural, ethnic and religious diversities as well as its historic sensitivities. The Igbos as well as other ethnic minorities within the defunct Biafra enclave have been subjected to decades of official discrimination with the proverbial glass ceiling which continues to hover their heads in most facets of their existence within the Nigerian nation. The federal character principle today continues to be jettisoned in the appointment of Service Chiefs, judges, heads of ministries and parastatals, federal boards and other government agencies. Igbos have also not fared better as regards their share in federal infrastructure, industries and the like. From the foregoing it can also be deduced that the federal character principle has not been fully utilized as a policy of integration most particularly as a policy to address the injustices of the indigenization decree.\n\nThe quota system is yet another initiative for integration. The introduction of this model for admission into the Nigerian educational sector came about in 1975 during the military regime of General Murtala Mohammed. It was borne out of a need to ensure that those areas of Nigeria considered as being educationally disadvantaged are assisted to achieve similar socio-economic development as their counterparts in other parts of the country through education. It was also promoted as an initiative that would pacify violent agitations, and ensure that various disuniting forces like the perceived lopsided educational advancement which seemed to have placed some regions of Nigeria at vantage position for socio-economic development and which could continue to propel the fear of domination of one ethnic group over another are arrested. The reality, however, is that 45 years after the introduction of this system in the country\u2019s educational sector the same problems continue to linger. As a result, other ethnic groups which are non-beneficiaries of the quota system of admission now have cause to question the justification for the continued implementation of this system. The system was designed to address disparities in educational attainments of different sections of the country in order to ensure that a certain number of candidates from each state of the country are admitted into schools in each academic year. Admissions were based not on merit, but state of origin considerations supposedly to ensure a balanced representation of the various states of the federation in the distribution of opportunities. The admission guidelines in unity secondary schools and tertiary institutions prescribed certain cutoff marks state to state. However, the quota system rather than being an instrument of national integration has become the very opposite, with its implementation constituting a continual violation of the principle of equal rights. The provision of adequate educational opportunities for every citizen at all levels devoid of ethnic considerations as provided for in Section 18 (1) and Section 42 (1) of the 1999 constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria continues to be breached under this policy. It is certainly improper for any policy of the government like the quota system to be seen to violate the constitutional rights of some of its citizens on account of their state of origin. As such this policy cannot be seen as a viable option for promoting sustainable national integration. Rather, it portrays the sad reality of a government\u2019s methodical violation of the constitutional rights of some of its own citizens while conversely upholding those of others and indirectly encouraging social discrimination of one group against the other. How does one justify, for example, the admission guideline as currently implemented in unity secondary school which prescribes cutoff marks in Anambra State to be 139, Ogun State is 131 while Bauchi State is 35, Yobe State is 2 for the male, 27 for the female and Zamfara State is 4 for the male and 2 for the female? It then follows that any situation wherein over 70% of Nigerians who apply for admission into schools every year are denied admission opportunities not because they are not qualified but because certain factors like their state of origin as prescribed by the quota system militate against their prospects of admission cannot be said to promote integration and national unity. More pointedly, utilizing the collective resources of a country to run educational institution only to turn around and deny some qualified applicants of admission opportunities into schools on the bases of state of origin cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be perceived as a uniting exercise. The quota system has continued to provoke deep resentment on the part of many Nigerians, particularly those from areas of the country that have been labeled as educationally advantaged such as states within the Southeast and Southwest of Nigeria. At present, Anambra State in South Eastern Nigeria has the highest cut off mark within the Quota System in the whole federation. Citizens in the adversely affected regions remain convinced that the quota system of admission as a policy is designed purely as an instrument of marginalization and subjugation. What has become patently clear is that rather than enhancing national integration, the quota system continues to pose a grave threat to the sustainability of the unity of this country as sectional resentments continue to fester, most especially among the youth.\n\nNigeria continues to be plagued by political, religious, and socio-cultural dichotomies, and this is hardly surprising in view of the complex issues bedeviling the country, issues of self-indulgent political leadership, corruption, weak institutions and most significantly, the use of ethnic and religious differences as a means of solidifying political solidarity by competing power blocs. The resurgence of separatist groups like the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) in the Southeast, other separatist groups in the Southwest and South-south, as well as the Boko Haram crisis have fueled the spate of protests which have turned violent in recent times further escalating the state of insecurity and tension in the country. This remains a serious indictment on the various reintegration policies embarked upon by successive Federal Governments and continues to cast a spotlight on the deteriorating material conditions of the people of the Southeast and the feelings of collective victimization which have continued to reinforce and sustain these agitations.\n\nThe major difficulty facing the Nigerian government today is its apparent incapacity to concretely address the challenges of nation-building and by extension, peacebuilding and its perceived inability to strike a balance of economic development along its ethnic divisions. In the meantime the debate on whether restructuring is the silver bullet or whether referendum is the key continues to rage on.\n\nIt, therefore, becomes imperative that to achieve national integration in Nigeria, the government at the center has, first of all, to demonstrate a genuine and sincere commitment to giving all ethnic nationalities that make up the federation an equal sense of belonging as well as an equitable share in the Nigeria project. There is also need for the different ethnic groups to discuss and agree on thorny national issues such as zoning of political posts, boundary adjustments, indigene vs settler disagreements, militancy and youth restiveness, resource control, religious fundamentalism and intolerance, amongst others.\n\nIn conclusion, it is an unimpeachable proposition that citizenship rights in any republic is at the very heart of any sincere and sustainable integration or re-integration agenda, and for people of the Southeast, fifty years after the Biafra War, citizenship is so ill defined and ill protected that the itinerant Igbo is still made not to know when and how he is a citizen anywhere in Nigeria. The Igbo have become a people denied the cure for the ravages of a war which ended with a \u2018No victor, No vanquished\u2019 slogan, but yet a people surrounded by the lingering pain of defeat\u2026. A sincere commitment to post war reintegration does not create a continuous state of occupation and siege where police and soldiers have taken over roads in the South in pole to pole vindictive checkpoints, and Customs officers continue to mount roadblocks with the attendant extortions especially along Igbo trade routes; reintegration should not translate to a multiplicity of taxes levied upon Igbo traders and the patently unfair patterns of their assessment, the constant shifting and relocation of markets by some state governments as part of the ploy to compel Igbo traders to develop new hamlets; reintegration should neither involve the systematic de-industrialization and the lack of investment in commercial industries in the Southeast nor a subterranean re-echoing of the post-war Indigenization policy that ostensibly excluded Igbos from a share in private companies \u2026.Reintegration is not attainable by the reinforcement of a system that denies them employment on an equal basis in the federal bureaucracy and government-owned commercial institutions; reintegration should not connote a blatant lopsidedness both in state and local government creations; it does not involve the neglect and systematic decay of federal roads in the Southeast and the downgrading of its airports or its non-inclusion in the national railway plan; reintegration as a policy should not advance a broad daylight and brutal annexation agenda of Igbo ancestral lands by sheer force of arms under the guise of \u2018open grazing\u2019, neither should it subject helpless villagers to mindless massacres by Fulani herdsmen in southern farmlands; reintegration does not translate to subjecting unarmed protesters who make legitimate demands for their rights to brutal clampdowns whilst treating armed bandits in the North and killer herdsmen that have invaded the South with executive indulgence; reintegration does not involve reminding the Igbo at every turn and opportunity, that they lost a war, and therefore must continue to be held down by state sanctioned shackles which preclude them from aspiring to high public office, and most importantly, from aspiring to lead a country within which they are assured presumably to enjoy full citizenship rights\u2026 and no reintegration gestures are not exhibited by, or tantamount to adding salt atop the injuries of a race that has experienced firsthand the horrors of war by making inflammatory remarks or threats to communicate to them in a language they will understand\u2026.Ladies and gentlemen, these are the hallmarks of victimization, persecution and marginalization, not reintegration, and any honest and sincere intention to integrate and reconcile Nigerians must begin, not with artificial policy constructs such as those highlighted in this presentation but with these seemingly mundane matters which fundamentally affect the lives, existence and the pursuit of happiness for all citizens irrespective of tribe and creed.\n\nThank you for listening.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "Presidency Accuses Kukah of Portraying Nigeria in Bad Light Before Foreign Audience",
          "text": "*Accuses Catholic bishop of portraying Nigeria in bad light before foreign audience\n\n*Faults Catholic bishop\u2019s position on state of the nation\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe Presidency on Sunday formally responded to the recent position of the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto, Father Matthew Kukah, before the United States Congress that nothing really works in Nigeria saying the cleric\u2019s position is an incredible falsehood.\n\nIt also described as unfortunate and disappointing the position of the \u201cso-called\u201d man of God painting his country in bad light before a foreign parliament.\n\nPresidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, in a release, stated that it was unfortunate, and disappointing, for citizens of Nigeria to bear witness to one of their Churchmen castigating their country in front of representatives of a foreign parliament.\n\nThe Presidency said it was familiar with overseas political tours that opposition politicians take \u2013 visiting foreign leaders and legislators in the United States, United Kingdom and Europe saying the argument goes that if they are heard seriously abroad, then Nigerian citizens back home should surely listen to them too.\n\nIt said: \u201cBut in order to be heard at all, and to maximise media coverage back home for their activities, inevitably these visits involve painting the worst possible picture of our country before their chosen foreign audience.\n\n\u201cSoon enough we inescapably hear an identical list of racist tropes against Northerners, how one religion dominates governance above all others, how the government is doing nothing to address herder-farmer disturbances, and how the government spends money on infrastructure to benefit everyone but the group and religion of the speaker. Of course, in order not to disappoint their western audience, regardless of fact, the list is always the same-and always slanted for whoever wishes to cross-check.\u201d\n\nThe release added that Nigerians expect such position from their unimaginative opposition stressing that it is troubling when a \u201cso-called\u201d man of the Church copies the worst excesses of those seeking personal advancement in public office.\n\nThe Presidency also explained steps taken so far by the present administration to tackle the issue of herder-farmer disturbances saying \u201conly this government has put forward the first and singular plan in nearly a century to address herder-farmer challenges \u2013 a fact recognised by international NGOs, including the International Crisis Group\u201d.\n\nIt further punctured Kukah\u2019s position that the Buhari-led government had done nothing in six years.\n\n\u201cTo declare to a foreign audience that this government does nothing is an incredible falsehood\u201d.\n\nRather than the investment in infrastructure between Nigeria and Niger being wasteful and biased as erroneously said by Kukah, the Presidency stressed that a similar infrastructure project between Lagos and Benin has revolutionised the two neighbouring economies to the advantage of both countries.\n\nIt emphasised that there is religious balancing in government appointments notwithstanding that the 1999 Constitution never stipulated ethnic or religious leaning in appointments into public office\n\n\u201cThere is no bias in this government when the president is northern and Muslim, the vice president southern and Christian, and the cabinet equally balanced between the two religions. But neither is there anything in our Constitution to state that political posts must be apportioned according to ethnicity or faith. It takes a warped frame of mind for a critic to believe ethnicity is of primary importance in public appointments. It is yet more troubling to hear a Churchman isolating one group for criticism purely on ethnic lines\u201d.\n\nThe Presidency further punctured Kukah\u2019s position that only Christian schools were being attacked by bandits and terrorists saying it is untrue as both Christian and Muslim schools had suffered in the past in the hands of the terrorists and bandits.\n\nIt said: \u201cWith due respect to the esteemed position he holds, the Bishop\u2019s assertion that only Christian schools are being targeted by bandits or terrorists is not supported by the facts on the ground. It is sad to say but also true that victims of crime, kidnapping, banditry and terrorism cut across all strata of the society. Sad but true that Kankara students in Katsina State were stolen by bandits of the same Islamic faith as those they took away. The same may be true of those who are still holding the 134 students of the Islamic School at Tegina in Niger State. The nation witnessed the sad incident of the female students abducted by bandits at Jangebe in Zamfara State and the over 100 predominantly Muslim students of the Federal Government Girls College Birnin Yauri in Kebbi State who are currently in captivity- and the nation\u2019s security agencies are hard at work to release them unharmed.\n\n\u201cThe attack on Christian students is sad and unacceptable; so also is the abduction of students of other faiths. The claim that only Christian schools are being targeted is totally untrue.\n\n\u201cAs a nation and a people, we must together define evil as evil. We must not allow our religious differences to divide us. No one gains but the evil doers when we divide our ranks according to ethnicity and religion in confronting them. The bandit, kidnapper and terrorist are the enemies of the people who should be confronted in unison.\u201d\n\nThe statement also quoted copiously from the Bible to support its claim on ethnicity and racialism\n\n\u201cTo be clear, The Bible is definitive on matters of ethnicity and racialism: In Romans 2:9-10, it says: \u201cThere will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile; but glory, honour and peace for everyone who does good\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd in Galatians 3:28: \u201cThere is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\u201d Whether Christian or Muslim, we stand by these beliefs and are steadfastly committed to them in governance\u201d.\n\nThe Presidency used the forum to be hard on the cleric for disparaging Nigeria before a foreign audience saying \u201cthere is no place in mainstream civil discourse for those who actively, negatively, and publicly label an individual ethnic group, especially before a foreign audience.\n\n\u201cThese are not the views expressed or opinions held by the vast majority of the citizens of Nigeria. For all our challenges as a nation, nearly all of us seek to live together in harmony, celebrating differences, and finding common ground as Nigerians above all.

          "text": "\u2022With 27% female CEOs, banks make great leap in sustainable principles\n\nBy Obinna Chima\n\nThe banking industry has made a dramatic leap in its Nigerian Sustainable Banking Principles (NSBP) with the recent appointments of two females as Chief Executive Officers (CEOs). The coming on board of the CEOs, Mrs. Miriam Olusanya for Guaranty Trust Bank (GTBank) and Mrs. Yemisi Edun for First City Monument Bank (FCMB) Limited, marks an important paradigm shift in the approach to decision-making and management with regard to gender at the highest levels of the Nigerian banking industry.\n\nThe NSBP states that as part of a wider sustainable banking commitment, the industry should work towards 40 per cent female representation at top management and boards levels.\n\nCurrently, there are seven female CEOs of 23 banks in the country.\n\nThe other five banks headed by females are: FSDH Merchant Bank Limited (Mrs. Bukola Smith); Fidelity Bank Plc (Mrs. Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe); Suntrust Bank (Mrs. Halima Buba); Citibank Nigeria (Mrs. Ireti Samuel-Ogbu) and Unity Bank Plc (Mrs. Oluwatomi Somefun).\n\nThe appointments of the seven women (except Smith) marked the first time ladies would lead the respective financial institutions.\n\nNSBP, which was introduced in 2012, requires banks to develop clear short and long term objectives on their business activities and provide products and services aimed at promoting gender equality for women and financial inclusion. It also advises banks to promote a gender-inclusive culture and female talent-management schemes, establish internal committees that comprise senior leaders from across the business to oversee accountability for gender diversity and steer gender inclusive strategies consistent with their core business activities, among others.\n\nThe goals of the NSBP are in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which states that encouraging more women leaders would help achieve greater gender equality.\n\nMany believe providing more opportunities for women to progress to senior roles in an industry that remains a male bastion is a step in the right direction.\n\nBelow are the profiles of the seven female bank CEOs in the country.\n\nMiriam Olusanya, GTBank\n\nMiriam Olusanya has over 23 years banking experience that cuts across Transaction Services, Asset and Liability Management, Financial Markets, Investment Banking, and Investor Relations.

          "text": "\u2022Says joint effort needed to pull Nigeria from the brink\n\n\u2022Urges donor agencies to review strategy\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nBishop of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah, has written to the United States House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on Religious Freedom and alleged the persecution of Christians in Nigeria based on their faith and not crimes.\n\nKukah said the faith-based harassment of Christians posed one of the greatest threats to the country\u2019s existence and common humanity. He said the challenge of rebuilding the country and moving it away from the brink required the collective effort of all Nigerians.\n\nThe Catholic priest has come under threat and verbal attack from Muslims and other non-Christians lately for his views on the state of the nation.\n\nIn the statement to the US House Committee, Kukah urged International Aid Organisations to reset the templates of their engagements with countries in conflict. He stated that Nigeria currently needed support for education, orphans, widows, and other victims of violence.\n\nSpeaking to the conscience of Muslims, Kukah said good Muslims must rise in defence of their religion by reversing the rising perception of Islam as inhuman.\n\nHe said Nigeria had remained volatile since independence, stressing that with over 500 languages, the country is one of the most perplexing works of Creation.\n\nKukah accused President Muhammadu Buhari of running a nepotic administration, saying, \u201cThe challenge of rebuilding our country, moving it away from the brink requires collective efforts on our part. However, the policy choices of this government have reversed the gains we made in the area of peaceful coexistence and dialogue. We cannot give up. We must renew our commitment to creating a just society.\u201d\n\nKukah alleged the stifling of religious freedoms under the Buhari government. He said the experience of the Christian community in Nigeria had been that of a tragic culture of persecution and death, recounting an incident in January last year, when four Seminarians were kidnapped inside the Good Shepherd Major Seminary, Kaduna.\n\nAccording to Kukah, \u201cAfter prolonged negotiations and the payment of ransom, three of them were released while one, Michael Nnadi, from the Diocese of Sokoto, was brutally murdered.\n\n\u201cThere have been dastardly actions directed at Christians, because of their faith. We have cases of Pastoral agents, such as Priests and Nuns, who have been kidnapped, released after the payment of ransom or brutally murdered. Churches, medical facilities, presbyteries have been razed to the ground with no provocations from the communities.\u201d\n\nHe urged the international community to rise in defence of the freedom of Christians everywhere in the world to live and practise their faith without persecution.\n\nThe priest lamented the inability of the government to harness and maximise the rich diversity of the country for national progress.\n\nHe said, \u201cWith over 500 tongues, Nigeria remains one of the most enigmatic pieces of God\u2019s real estate on earth. Running, stumbling but never fatally falling, except for a brief civil war. She is home to one out of five black people on earth.\n\n\u201cHighly resourced, but endemically corrupt, a combination of serious governance missteps, series of military coups, years of maladministration, a culture of violence have seriously slowed down what should have been one of the greatest nations on earth. It has left its people vulnerable to poverty, disease, violence and death.\u201d\n\nKukah further told the public hearing that the most critical needs of many Nigerian victims of violence were education for orphans as well as support for widows and other victims of violence. He said bringing succour to these suffering citizens required not only huge financing but also a better approach to meeting such needs.\n\n\u201cMy appeal, therefore, is that Aid Agencies consider more practical ways of engaging Church structures to alleviate the sufferings of the victims of persecution by way of granting scholarships to vulnerable children,\u201d Kukah stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

He refused to answer any question and only responded in syllables. He told them he was not going to do anymore of their interviews. The DSS panel in turn said this will be their last interrogation,\u201d a top source revealed.\n\nSaharaReporters had last Wednesday reported that Kanu, for the first time, was interviewed by the DSS officers in Abuja, in the presence of his lawyer, Ejimakor.\n\nIt had been reported that it was during that interview that the revelations of what happened to Kanu in Kenya came out.\n\n\u201cKanu was interviewed by DSS agents today in the presence of his lawyers. He had injuries on his neck and wrist from torture. They said they didn\u2019t know who he was. They chained him to floor for six days but they became nice to him once they found out who he was,\u201d a top source had revealed.\n\nSaharaReporters had on July 7 reported that Kanu told his lawyer that he was \u201cmercilessly beaten and tortured\u201d in the East African country before his extradition to Nigeria.\n\nOne of the IPOB leader\u2019s lawyers had revealed this in an interview, noting that the Kenya authorities would be dragged to the International Criminal Court to answer for the brutality.\n\nThe lawyer had said, \u201cThere was a clear collaboration between the Kenya government and the Nigerian government and I am happy that they are now denying the fact that Kanu was arrested in there.\n\n\u201cBut by the time we finish with them at the International Criminal Court, they will never remain the same. He was arrested at the airport there and he was taken to an unknown residence. He was subjected to inhuman treatment.\n\n\u201cKanu was tortured, maltreated and mercilessly beaten, as confirmed by him to us. After spending eight days in their illegal custody, they now beckoned to the Nigerian government. Kanu was lifeless and unconscious by the time they were bringing him to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTo tell you the level of their conspiracy and the desperation to get him, they brought him here on a Sunday and the federal government is fully aware that I am his legal counsel.\n\n\u201cHe was brought into the country and inflicted with several injuries and a he is having a number of medical issues today. It was at the behest of the Federal government that Kenya was doing those things. This is against all international laws. We are going to address an international court at that level.\u201d",

          "title": "Did Nnamdi Kanu Actually Jump Bail? By Aloy Ejimakor",
          "text": "The intention of this piece is to examine the long-running notion that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu had jumped bail back in 2017 and thus deserved the extraordinary rendition that recently saw him to Nigeria.\n\nWhether you like Kanu or not, everyone would agree that the only logical way of determining whether he jumped bail or not is to pedal back to the state of affairs before the military invasion of his homestead in September 2017. Here we go:\n\nAs of September 2017, Kanu was free on bail on a subsisting court order; his bail was not on personal recognizance but on a bond posted by three sureties; Kanu was neither judicially, nor administratively ordered to be re-arrested for breaching his bail or on account of any new charges filed; and his next hearing date was set for the next month, October 2017.\n\nIt is beyond argument that the invasion achieved a complete military routing of Kanu's home and caused fatalities of twenty-eight people and injuries to many, including to Kanu and his parents, who were present and trapped at the premises during the invasion.\n\nThe invading forces also 'captured' an undetermined number of occupants of the premises, some of whom are now presumed dead as they have not been accounted for to date. Most significantly, Kanu himself was also unaccounted for until he emerged in Israel several months later.\n\nThe inevitable question that arises from the foregoing facts is this: What are the natural or foreseeable consequences of such a lethal military action against a defendant who was free on bail?\n\nThe following analysis will provide some answers:\n\nAt common law, a bail is simply a binding promise by an obligor/surety to produce a defendant in court whenever required to do so. The money paid by the surety to back up his promise becomes the bond that he stands to lose should he fail to produce the accused when required to do so by the State.\n\nIn other words, a bail is a written contract in which the State is the promisee, and the surety is the promisor. The defendant is merely the subject matter (or the res) of the contract. And the fundamental purpose or consideration is to have the accused appear in court by compulsion of the bond posted by the surety.\n\nSo, just like any other contract, a contract of bail is subject to universal rules of contract, including - in this particular case of Kanu - an implied covenant on the part of the Nigerian State that it will not in any way interfere with or impair the ability of the surety to produce Kanu whenever required to do so.\n\nThis includes the covenant that the State will not take any steps with the the defendant that might increase the risk of his flight from the jurisdiction or constrain the ability of the surety to produce the defendant at his trial.\n\nSo, when the Nigerian State which was prosecuting Kanu and thus has an abiding legal interest in his appearing for his trial, ordered her Army to invade Kanu's home, it breached the basic covenant that required the Nigerian State (or the Federal government) not to create a situation that will make it impossible for the surety to produce Kanu in court.\n\nAnd given that Kanu's death, mortal wounding, capture or flight (escape) are the foreseeable consequences of said military invasion that can impact his availability to appear in court, the contractual doctrines of frustration and force mejeure will come into play.\n\nIt is trite that the occurrence of force majeure (or superior force) relieves one or both parties from the duty to perform contract obligations. The rationale is simple and that is: The force majeure event - in this case, the military invasion - is a supervening event that was beyond the control or contemplation of the surety or even Kanu when the contract of bail was executed.\n\nIt is agreed universally that a military invasion is deemed a typical force majeure event that frustrates a contract under every human legal system. Nigeria (and now Kenya and the United Kingdom) are no exceptions. It becomes affirmative when a party to the contract is complicit in the force majeure.\n\nIt can also happen that, in certain scenarios such as this case of Kanu, a unique force majeure event will raise the prospects of another contract killer known as the doctrine of frustration.\n\nUnder this time-honored doctrine, a contract (including a bail contract) will be deemed frustrated if its fundamental purpose (assuring appearance of Nnamdi Kanu in court) is destroyed to the point that his appearance in court becomes impossible.\n\nIn such event, the the promisor or surety in the bail contract will be discharged from his obligation to produce the accused. Now, you may ask: what is the position of the promisor- the Nigerian State in this whole saga?\n\nA Nigerian State that had Kanu on trial, in the course of time released him on bail posted by another. Then, the same Nigerian State ordered its army to lethally invade Kanu's home. During the invasion, Kanu was confirmed to be on location, trapped and in line of fire.\n\nKanu is human, so his human instincts to survive will instantly take over and being that the force arrayed against him is greater, that instinct can only be expressed through flight or escape from the immediate scene. And that\u2019s exactly what happened.\n\nAnd having succeeded in fleeing from the immediate scene of the attack, is it reasonable to expect Kanu not to flee from the broader scene that comprised of the territory of a Nigerian State that controls the Army that invaded his house?\n\nThe foregoing are but some of the material factual questions that would have been judicially answered in an adversarial setting, pursuant to an application, before anyone can come to the legal conclusion that Kanu had jumped bail. And such application was made.\n\nBut guess what? The very Court that was supposed to calendar the application to be heard refused to do so and instead proceeded to decide, without taking any evidence, that Kanu had jumped bail, whereupon it issued the bench warrant that grounded the instant extraordinary rendition.\n\nHad said application been heard, the Court - in place of its ruling that Kanu had jumped bail - could have ruled the opposite, and that is: That it is the Nigerian government and its Army that destroyed the ability or duty of Kanu to appear at his trial.\n\nIn the same vein, the Court could\u2019ve also ruled that the Nigerian government was in contempt of Court by levying a lethal military invasion against a defendant (a ward of court), who was free on bail granted by such Court.\n\nTherefore, it is against the basic canons of equity and fairness to now allow the Nigerian government to profit from its own wrong of causing Kanu to flee and then turn around to declare him a fugitive. A fugitive from what? Justice or death?\n\nIt becomes a double whammy when the same Nigerian government, instead of letting sleeping dogs lie or resorting to the due process of extradition, escalated its sins against Kanu by subjecting him to extraordinary rendition. Does two wrongs make a right?\n\n\n\nAnother way of looking at this whole thing is rhetorical and that is: Would any reasonable person have said that Kanu jumped bail if his failure to appear at his trial was because he was killed during the invasion?",

          "text": "Recommendations were made in 2018 by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) for the adoption of electronic transmission of election results, TheCable can report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a joint technical analysis, the NCC and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) considered a few methods for electronic transmission of election results, and recommended the traditional data communication service from mobile network operators (MNOs).\n\nThe issue of the electoral act amendment bill, which allows for electronic transmission of election results, has been contentious, leading to serious arguments between lawmakers.\n\nIn passing the bill last Thursday, the senate had approved that the NCC must certify that national coverage is adequate and secure, while the national assembly must grant approval before INEC can transmit election results electronically.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, while appearing before the house of representatives on July 16, Umar Danbatta, executive vice-chairman of NCC who was represented by Ubale Maska, executive commissioner, technical services, said electoral coverage analysis conducted in 2018 by the commission, showed that about 50 percent of the polling units had 3G and 2G network services, while 49 percent had 2G network and below.\n\nMaska had also said only 3G is needed to transmit results electronically.\n\nThe senate later said it based its stance on information provided by the NCC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTECHNOLOGY OPTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION OF ELECTION RESULTS\n\nDuring preparations for the 2019 general election, Mahmood Yakubu, INEC chairman, had in January 2018, visited the NCC to discuss collaboration that would enhance the electoral process.\n\nA joint technical committee of INEC and NCC was subsequently formed with a mandate to map out strategies that would reduce human interventions in the transmission of election results.\n\nThe committee was headed by Maska and co-chaired by Muhammed Lecky, an INEC national commissioner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the report of the technical committee seen by TheCable, INEC was said to have made available coordinates of 118,302 polling units out of 119,973, and in its deliberation, sought, most importantly, 100 percent constant availability of network service during the period of the election.\n\nNCC had also carried out a coverage analysis of the polling units on the national mobile network coverage map based on the signal strength \u201cthreshold of -95dBm\u201d.\n\nA breakdown of INEC\u2019s results on network coverage at the time showed that 59,523 polling units were covered by 3G and 2G services;

          "text": "Recommendations were made in 2018 by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) for the adoption of electronic transmission of election results, TheCable can report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a joint technical analysis, the NCC and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) considered a few methods for electronic transmission of election results, and recommended the traditional data communication service from mobile network operators (MNOs).\n\nThe issue of the electoral act amendment bill, which allows for electronic transmission of election results, has been contentious, leading to serious arguments between lawmakers.\n\nIn passing the bill last Thursday, the senate had approved that the NCC must certify that national coverage is adequate and secure, while the national assembly must grant approval before INEC can transmit election results electronically.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, while appearing before the house of representatives on July 16, Umar Danbatta, executive vice-chairman of NCC who was represented by Ubale Maska, executive commissioner, technical services, said electoral coverage analysis conducted in 2018 by the commission, showed that about 50 percent of the polling units had 3G and 2G network services, while 49 percent had 2G network and below.\n\nMaska had also said only 3G is needed to transmit results electronically.\n\nThe senate later said it based its stance on information provided by the NCC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTECHNOLOGY OPTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION OF ELECTION RESULTS\n\nDuring preparations for the 2019 general election, Mahmood Yakubu, INEC chairman, had in January 2018, visited the NCC to discuss collaboration that would enhance the electoral process.\n\nA joint technical committee of INEC and NCC was subsequently formed with a mandate to map out strategies that would reduce human interventions in the transmission of election results.\n\nThe committee was headed by Maska and co-chaired by Muhammed Lecky, an INEC national commissioner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the report of the technical committee seen by TheCable, INEC was said to have made available coordinates of 118,302 polling units out of 119,973, and in its deliberation, sought, most importantly, 100 percent constant availability of network service during the period of the election.\n\nNCC had also carried out a coverage analysis of the polling units on the national mobile network coverage map based on the signal strength \u201cthreshold of -95dBm\u201d.\n\nA breakdown of INEC\u2019s results on network coverage at the time showed that 59,523 polling units were covered by 3G and 2G services; 50,038 were covered by only 2G service, while 8,741 units were not covered by any operator.\n\nThe committee then suggested three options: national roaming, multi-sim and traditional communication service from MNOs to transmit results.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the committee, if national roaming is available, it means \u201call SIMs in use with INEC hardware will function wherever there is network coverage, irrespective of which network is available.\u201d\n\nFor the multi-sim option, the MNOs will \u201cmake available customised SIMs to INEC for the traffic exchange and the third party transit vendor is fully aware of the provisioned SIMs details just like the MNOs.\u201d.\n\nAlthough national roaming, the committee said, is attractive and cost effective, the option was ruled out because of the fact that the regulatory framework for its deployment is currently under development by the NCC and will not be issued in time for the 2019 elections.\n\nOn the multi-sim option, the committee submitted that it is robust and reliable, but that the timeline for its deployment is rather too long.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cConsidering the sensitivity of the intended operation in terms of the security of both INEC, MNO infrastructure, and the confidentiality requirements for election results, issues of compromise may arise with the third party (IMSI vendor) who would not necessarily be under regulatory purview of the NCC,\u201d the report reads.\n\nINEC, NCC RECOMMEND ADOPTION OF TRADITIONAL DATA COMMUNICATION SERVICE\n\nAfter deliberations, the data communication service from MNOs was recommended as the practical solution that provides a wide range coverage of INEC polling units, and guarantees a more secure end-to-end connectivity as well as election results confidentiality.\n\nThe committee said the solution may provide the level of reliability or performance in network availability for user devices connected to the network.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the working group considered it as most appropriate solution for the exercise,\u201d the report further reads.\n\nAccording to the report, on the option of traditional data communication service, the MNOs \u201cconfirmed that they have delivered similar services using this option to other MDAs in the recent past\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe system architecture is such that typically, MNOs will configure same Access Point Name (APN) to connect to the central server at INEC,\u201d the document reads.\n\n\u201cData traffic is secured through a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection between MNOs and INEC.

          "text": "A few days back, someone on Nigerian Twitter asked if women would date a man who always moved around with a power bank. Seems like a harmless question, right? Well, that singular tweet snowballed into a denouncement of power banks and all who wielded it\u2014laughs in irregular power supply. Well, I wonder what they\u2019d say when they see Apple\u2019s new MagSafe Battery Pack.\n\nAfter teasing us with the spanking new magsafe feature on its iPhone 12 series last year, Apple has finally launched the long-awaited MagSafe Battery Pack\u2014its wireless charging option. This exciting piece of hardware is currently available on the Apple website at $99 and is compatible with all iPhone 12 models.\n\nImage: Apple\n\nMagSafe Battery Pack Specs: the lowdown\n\nYes, yes, we know it sounds corny, but I couldn\u2019t resist.\n\nThe MagSafe Battery pack sports a battery capacity of 1460mAh at 7.62V. Compared to other magsafe power banks, like Anker\u2019s PowerCore Magnetic 5K Wireless with its 5000mAh battery, Apple\u2019 new battery pack just doesn\u2019t cut it. Especially since the Anker option is a little above half of the Apple MagSafe price.\n\nHowever, the MagSafe may have some redeeming qualities.\n\nFor one, it is wireless, and has a slim, classy build\u2014way slimmer than the Anker option. That increases the cool factor and forgives the low battery capacity\u2014somewhat.\n\nIt also packs a charge. According to Apple Insider, the MagSafe Battery Pack might fully charge an iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 Pro with little issue. Though this depends on how much energy it wastes during charging\u2014wireless charging produces a lot of heat, and this reduces the charge.\n\nThe battery pack also has a reverse-charge feature. This means that not only can your plugged\u2014and attached\u2014MagSafe Battery charge your phone, you can also charge your attached MagSafe while your iPhone is plugged to a power supply.\n\nYou can also charge both if you attach your MagSafe Battery Pack to your iPhone, then plug your iPhone into a power source. You might want to charge this way if you need to connect your iPhone to another device while charging, like if you\u2019re using wired CarPlay or transferring photos to a Mac. If you charge your iPhone and MagSafe Battery Pack at the same time, your iPhone might charge to 80% or higher before your MagSafe Battery Pack begins charging. \u2014 Apple Support\n\nFun fact: When connected to a 20W or higher power source, the MagSafe Battery can charge with up to 15W of power.\n\nYou can also see your charging status and battery pack percentage on your lockscreen when charging. However, your MagSafe-compatible iPhone should run the iOS 14.7 update or later.\n\nAre these features worth $99? You tell me.\n\nBut one thing\u2019s for sure, your date will probably not run when they see you with this stylish gear.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Gokada\u2019s motorcycle-hailing business in Nigeria did not hibernate because there was no demand.\n\nThe evidence is on the streets of Lagos today where motorcycle transport has returned. If GRide had a death certificate, the cause of death would be head-on collision with sudden government policy. It was a near-death experience but Gokada scrapped itself for parts and started a rebirth in March 2020.\n\nIt has now been 18 months since the company pivoted from being a ride-hailing provider to a logistics company.\n\nGRide became GSend to help businesses and individuals in Lagos with intra-city deliveries. Since this pivot, delivery volume has increased by a hundred fold, revenue has increased 10 times and $100 million has been realised in annualized transaction value, according to the company.\n\nBut in its boldest step since it was founded in January 2018 by Fahim Saleh, Gokada now identifies as a super app. In addition to other items that can be packaged in a motorcyclist\u2019s delivery box, food is taking the centre stage.\n\nGokada\u2019s super app is entering the market at a time when Lagos residents are consuming \u20a65 trillion ($12 billion) worth of food annually. \u201cIf the population is to grow to about 30 million by 2030, Lagos will likely need food worth \u20a66.3 trillion on an annual basis,\u2019\u2019 the state\u2019s commissioner for Agriculture said in May.\n\nDika Oha, a former senior executive at Andela and Konga who leads Gokada\u2019s product development, says Gokada delivers more food than any other delivery service in Nigeria.\n\nDika Oha, VP of Product at Gokada. Image credit: Gokada\n\nThe claim is hard to verify without numbers from other players. But Gokada\u2019s evolution from transport provider to food aggregator could help ecosystem players understand the future of super apps in Africa.\n\nA standing fleet is an asset in emergencies\n\nIn August 2019, Gokada took a two-week break to readjust its business strategy following OPay\u2019s sensational entry into Nigeria\u2019s ride-hailing market.\n\nA new fleet of 200cc motorcycles were fitted with new tracking features. A higher standard of quality was demanded of drivers who, in many users\u2019 eyes, looked rather unkempt for a technology business.\n\nPerhaps not anticipated at inception, but these changes would serve the company effectively six months later.\n\nFacing existential questions about its future, Gokada repurposed the tracking feature from the ride-hailing business to begin winning customers over to GSend. \u201cWe decided we could not launch without that ability for customers to track,\u201d Victor Daminabo, Gokada\u2019s head of operations, tells me.\n\nBuilding on that foundation, Gokada set an audacious target: have drivers pick-up and complete every delivery in Lagos within two hours. They set up a goods-in-transit insurance policy to cover cases of damage or loss of items in their custody, Daminabo explains.\n\nStarting off as a service for sending individual packages, Gokada iterated to enable one driver to book and fulfill multiple deliveries. That iteration birthed \u2018Gokada for business\u2019 which helps enterprises create different user profiles for staff in various branches. The organisation uses one Gokada account but each unit can monitor deliveries separately.\n\nThis was how Gokada acquired Fan Milk and Jumia Foods as enterprise customers. Rather than invest in their own assets, these companies readily adopted Gokada\u2019s logistics fleet of over 1,000 motorcycles which is already integrated with payments systems like Paystack and Flutterwave.\n\nEating into other verticals\n\nAs the ghosts of GRide gave way to a thriving GSend, the data showed something interesting: Gokada says it has recorded over 1 million deliveries so far in 2021 and about 40% have been food deliveries.\n\nThis volume was driven by formal partnerships, like with Jumia Foods. But small and medium restaurants downloaded the app and used it to find drivers who would deliver food to customers.\n\nImage credit: Rotimi Daramola\n\nSusan*, who lives in the Surulere area of Lagos, tells me the food she ordered directly from a restaurant in her neighborhood in May was delivered by a Gokada driver.\n\nWith this happening frequently, it encouraged Gokada to float GShop, a service that aggregated restaurants, opening the door for the company to bundle all it offers onto one app.\n\nSo why a super app? On one level, it is a practical decision.\n\nUsers enter the company\u2019s ecosystem of services through one channel. That singular funnel makes it easier for the company\u2019s developers to manage updates. Growth and sales teams focus resources on selling one app.\n\nBut Oha, Gokada\u2019s VP of product, explains their motivation is also to take advantage of Nigerians\u2019 increasing familiarity with ecommerce as more businesses \u2013 food, fashion and furniture outlets \u2013 use Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to find and sell to customers.\n\nSocial media platforms grow through network effects \u2013 the presence of more users doing more things improves the quality and usefulness of the platforms. Super apps emulate this playbook too, following users\u2019 lead to add more products to the stack.\n\nLike Grab in Singapor and Gozem in francophone Africa, Gokada\u2019s super app journey started with transportation | Graphic by Boluwatife Sanso/TC Insights\n\nBut as Yinka Adegoke explained in this insightful piece, apps become super by offering essential services within large markets. WeChat and Alibaba serve 2 billion users a month across China and parts of Southeast Asia; but can Gokada find a market that large and homogenous?\n\nFrom food, back to ride-hailing\n\nThe only way to reach those exalted heights, then, is by aggressively focusing on customer satisfaction for high-demand products, making the app sticky and top of mind.\n\nOr as Oha puts it, ensuring Gokada is the first thought a user has when they need to order food \u2013 arguably a bigger need than sending parcels.\n\nTo assure users, Gokada is sticking with the simplicity and transparency that has made ride-hailing platforms universal: tap to order, input destination and track your order in real time as it arrives.\n\nGokada\u2019s food service notifies the user of each step along the delivery process to maintain engagement and offer assurance.\n\nAnd yes, pay on delivery.\n\nPerfecting this cycle also means paying attention to renowned global food delivery services like Doordash, Grubhub, UberEats and Deliveroo. The reward is that perfecting a time, quality and culture-sensitive business like food delivery in Africa can be a springboard for getting people to trust and use other products en masse.\n\nThose other products, according to Oha, could be groceries, fashion and electronics. And in cities that permit, motorcycle-taxi \u2013 the company\u2019s first love.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Westa.Solar sets its sights on West Africa after debut in Nigeria",
          "text": "With the increasing adoption of renewable energy use globally, a new player has emerged in the solar photovoltaic (PV) market for commercial and industrial (C&I) customers in Africa.\n\nWesta.Solar was recently launched as a joint venture between Oolu Solar, a solar home systems provider and RP Global, a renewable energy investment company.\n\nThe new company offers solar systems that range from 50kW to 5MW and has commenced operations in Nigeria. Last month, it deployed its first rooftop plant at Kano-based Petrichor Industries, a packaging products manufacturing company and subsidiary of the Petrichor Group.\n\nJointly financed by Westa.Solar and the UK Foreign & Commonwealth Development Office, the 500 Kilowatts peak (kWp is the peak power of a PV system) solar power plant provides Petrichor with, significantly, almost a quarter of its electricity needs in a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Westa.Solar.\n\nA solar PPA is an arrangement in which a third-party developer owns, operates, and maintains a PV system that is located on an industrial customer\u2019s property. The latter then buys the electric output from the solar system for a predetermined period and at a set price.\n\nPetrichor\u2019s massive 500kWp rooftop solar plant was installed by Westa.Solar in Kano, Nigeria.\n\nThe plant at Petrichor represents a perfect start to life for Westa.Solar, a company that has its sights set on the larger West African market. But its debut project was not without challenges, no thanks to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic that continues to disrupt business operations.\n\n\u201cWe started the project at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, which wasn\u2019t the best time for procuring and shipping from anywhere in the world. Getting the equipment out of China, shipping, and then clearing them at the port was challenging. We also experienced tough delays at the port in Lagos,\u201d Westa.Solar\u2019s Country Manager in Nigeria, Kolawole Akinboye, told TechCabal in an interview.\n\nThings kicked into overdrive once the logistics component of the project was resolved and the equipment got to the site in Kano. By then, Westa.Solar could manage the construction process, enabled by its technical know-how ability and the partner it was working with.\n\nHelping businesses save cost and hedge energy prices\n\nMany businesses in Africa grapple with expensive electricity tariffs, frequent power outages, and load shedding. These issues limit production and increase operating and maintenance costs, thereby hindering growth. In Nigeria, enterprises rely on diesel generators to make up for the significant lapse in power supply.\n\nWesta.Solar\u2019s customised solutions for commercial and industrial businesses can help overcome some of the power-related challenges businesses face and in the process, provide direct savings and a hedge on energy prices for its clients.\n\nThe decreasing costs of solar systems, relative to either grid or diesel generators, have helped on-site solar microgrids become economically viable alternatives for commercial and industrial use.\n\nAccording to a 2017 Bloomberg New Energy Finance report, on-site solar power is cheaper than the electricity tariffs paid by C&I companies in seven of the 15 Sub-Saharan Africa markets studied. While electricity tariffs ranged from $0.028/kWh in Ethiopia to over $0.232/kWh in Senegal, a 250kW solar project cost between $0.10-0.14/kWh in the countries assessed.\n\nThe report predicts that the cost of on-site solar will decline further to about $0.05/kWh by 2030, which will only add to its appeal to commercial users.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the cheaper rates paid for solar, as an industrial company, coming into a long-term agreement with us allows you to predict what your energy cost would be over the next few years instead of having to face rising diesel prices at some point in the future. So yes, our plants serve as a hedge for energy costs for companies,\u201d Akinboye said.\n\nThe power deal with Westa.Solar is expected to see Petrichor reduce dependence on Nigeria\u2019s unstable national grid, save money \u2013 as much as \u20a6235 million over the next 10 years \u2013 on electricity bills, as well as minimise its carbon footprint by cutting its use of diesel.\n\nMore projects and expansion\n\nOn the back of its successful installation of the massive 500kWp plant in Nigeria, Westa.Solar plans to develop and implement a large pipeline of C&I solar projects across West Africa.\n\nThe company currently has no fewer than 30 companies that it has opened discussions with and is in advanced negotiations with at least seven of them. The country manager expects to announce more partnerships within the next few months.\n\n\u201cThis is the first of what we hope will be many solar power projects for C&I companies,\u201d Akinboye said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been getting calls from various people because of the Petrichor project, because of how successful it was. We have people that are already calling to say, \u2018Wait, can you look at my own facility? What can you do with us?\u2019 So it is a door-opener because it opens the door for more success.\u201d\n\nBut for now, Westa.Solar is focused on establishing itself in Nigeria, a market that is saturated but offers many opportunities for solar energy providers.\n\n\u201cNigeria has a huge unmet need, so we are focusing on conquering the market. Then in the next year or two, we start our expansion plans across West Africa.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAfrica is rich in renewable resources but has an unmet demand for power. Many providers are currently moving to fill this gap and, in the process, help to diversify sources for generating electricity in Africa away from environmentally harmful fossil fuels.\n\nThrough its on-site grids, Westa.Solar expects to support the business of its clients while increasing the penetration of renewable energies across the region, which is yet to reach an inflection point.\n\nWesta.Solar is well-positioned to seize the opportunities that will come its way as the market in Africa expands, helped by Akinboye and his team\u2019s efforts to develop resilient microgrid projects across West Africa.\n\nOver the next five to ten years, the company aims to become the leading commercial and industrial renewable energy provider in the region. \u201cThat is our goal and that is where we are going. We\u2019re changing the narrative of commercial and industrial projects in Africa.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "If you\u2019re like me, then your face may be constantly buried in your phone screen. If you\u2019re not scrolling through your favourite social media, you\u2019re having a field day chatting with friends and family.\n\nMost times, I\u2019m scrolling through a sea of cartoonish yellow faces that describe how I feel because sometimes, words aren\u2019t enough.\n\nIn a world where more people work from home and attend events on Zoom, everyone is likely staring at a screen for the better part of the day. How can we not? It\u2019s how we bridge distance barriers and insulate ourselves from a deadly pandemic.\n\nA South African study on changes in how people perceive technology by Alex Emilio Fischer, Tanya Van Tonder, and other researchers reveals 83% of 405 respondents interviewed, worked and communicated more with technology since COVID-19 became a global pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, talking to someone physically differs from conversing using a 6.5\u201d device. When communicating face-to-face, what you don\u2019t say is more important than what you say.\n\nFacial cues and body language speak louder than you can imagine. Lydia Ramsey, Professional Speaker and Author, says that \u201cEye contact is the most obvious way you communicate. When you are looking at the other person, you show interest.\u201d\n\nRamsey claims studies show that words account for 7% of human communication while body language and tone account for 55% and 38%, respectively.\n\nUnfortunately, nowadays, the way we primarily communicate doesn\u2019t accommodate body language. It\u2019s left to collect dust behind computer screens and beneath our typing thumbs.\n\nMelanie Chan, Senior Lecturer, Media, Communication and Culture at Leeds Beckett University, feels technology has reduced face-to-face conversations.\n\nInterestingly, we not only talk through our devices, we also speak to them. Smartphone assistants have become so intelligent that I sometimes find myself asking Google Assistant to tell me jokes when I\u2019m bored.\n\nWhile technology has reduced physical communication, it has also helped us keep in touch where actual meetings are impossible. And with the aid of Japanese invention, emojis, we are perhaps retaining some aspects of normal communication.\n\nEmojis: the language of the digital world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Denis Cherkashin on Unsplash\n\nWhen we click on the emoji section of our keyboard, we likely want to convey emotion easily, or words aren\u2019t enough to say what we feel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmojis first appeared on Japanese mobile phones in the late \u201990s. Since then, they have evolved into a universal digital language. In 2015, Oxford Dictionaries named an emoji Word of the Year. Can you guess which one it was? Reply in the comments.\n\nThe popularity of emojis in Japan propelled Google and Apple to have them registered by Unicode Consortium, a non-profit organisation that maintains text standards on computers.\n\nLike the English language, more emojis are being added to the \u201cemoji vocabulary\u201d to express more emotions.\n\nEmojis also have a day set aside to celebrate them. Bizarre? Apparently, World Emoji Day is a big deal.\n\nCreated by Jeremy Burge, founder of Emojipedia \u2014 a wiki for emojis \u2014 the day has two main activities: awards are given to the most popular emojis and new ones are announced.\n\nIntriguingly, World Emoji Day is celebrated on July 17 because Apple\u2019s iOS calendar emoji have the same date. Not to worry, you\u2019ll also see the same on your Google keyboard if you\u2019re an Android user.\n\nWhile emojis might be a universal way of communication digitally, it is still perceived differently by people.\n\nWhat do users think of emojis?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can lose nuances of humour, seriousness and even sarcasm when we take words at face value.\u201d This is what Folakemi Olaniyan, final year student of English and Literary Studies, said when I asked her how important she felt emojis were.\n\nTo her, emojis help to define the mood and tone of written text. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can chat and not use emojis,\u201d she says.\n\nHowever, as much as she wants to, Olaniyan does not use emojis in a formal setting. She prefers chatting on her phone to having a physical conversation, adding that it saves her from stuttering in real life.\n\nIn contrast, Kunle Agbetiloye, a journalist, prefers physical conversations to any form of digital exchange. But, like Olaniyan, he believes emojis give more meaning to words.\n\n\u201cThere are some statements one makes that need an emoji for the receiver to understand the emotion that accompanies it,\u201d he says.\n\nHowever, Agbetiloye maintains that emojis are only necessary for informal conversations. \u201cPersonally, if I feel angry, I won\u2019t send you angry emojis because of its cartoonish look.\u201d\n\nTo test his assertion, during a lull in the conversation, I sent him an angry face emoji. True to form, he didn\u2019t take it seriously.\n\nMy chat with Daniel Whyte, another journalist, was filled with emojis. From how the conversation went, I could deduce just how important emojis were.\n\nFor Whyte, emojis help get the message across faster. In his words, \u201cI use it to communicate simple messages quickly. It saves time and flows easily.\u201d He ends this sentence with a smiling face emoji, expressing how casually the words would have flowed from his mouth in a physical conversation.\n\nLike Olaniyan and Agbetiloye, Whyte maintains that emojis should be reserved for casual conversations and kept from official emails.\n\nUniversal but personal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVyvyan Evans, Linguistics Professor and Author of The Emoji Code: Linguistics Behind Smiley Faces and Scaredy Cats, describes emojis as \u201cincontrovertibly the world\u2019s first truly universal form of communication.\u201d\n\nHowever, emojis are used by people from different cultures and with unique personalities, making meaning relative to who is using them. As a result, emoji translators were created.\n\nUsually, the thumbs-up emoji is understood as commendation or approval, but in Greek culture, it\u2019s an offensive gesture.\n\nSurprisingly, the smiling face emoji symbolises dismissiveness to Chinese people rather than happiness.\n\nRanti Omoloso, a recent university graduate, says he has difficulty chatting with older people as they often misunderstand emojis.\n\n\u201cI try to avoid chatting with parents cause they seem to understand emojis very differently. I don\u2019t like typing long sentences, so I just put a call through,\u201d he says.\n\nKeith Broni, who makes a living from translating emojis, says they are \u201clinguistics tools that are being used to complement our language.\u201d\n\nAlthough Broni believes emojis by themselves cannot be a form of communication, he admits that they play a vital role in digital communication.\n\nAn expert\u2019s take\n\nIn the opinion of Dr Oluwakemi Omole, Assistant Director, Counselling and Human Development Centre, Federal University, Oye-Ekiti, communication is an exchange of information, and the medium doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\nHighlighting the importance of communication, she says it improves our psychology and sense of self. \u201cIt is very important to our psyche as humans.\u201d\n\nShe also admits that while physical contact feels good, presence \u2014 online or physical \u2014 is what matters most. \u201cYou can be physically present with someone, and you\u2019re not communicating. It\u2019s about exchange and the ability to listen.\u201d\n\nAs a psychologist, Omole says a lot of research has gone into how effective emojis are and if they communicate feelings that cannot be easily expressed in words. She concludes that \u201cemoji is a way of bridging the gap. It is a way of letting people know what you would love to express to them.\u201d\n\nAddressing the question of emojis being a universal language, Omole refutes their ability to be understood universally. \u201cAlthough we feel the same things, the way we express them may differ across cultures.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s World Emoji Day promises the release of emoji 14.0. A new series of emojis that take into account race and gender. With the emoji vocabulary being updated frequently, could they become a stand-alone language?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Source: <a href=\u201dhttps://www.capetowndstvinstallation.com/\u201d>capetowndstvinstallation.com</a>\n\nWhat happened? Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives has requested that the Federal Government enforce all antitrust laws against the satellite television sector due to the hike in digital TV subscription fees.\n\nWhat does this mean? The laws will keep PayTV services in check, regulate their prices, and reduce the possibility of any provider monopolising the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nigeria, the satellite TV sector is dominated by MultiChoice \u2014 the South African company that owns DStv and GOtv \u2014 and Chinese-owned StarTimes.\n\nA trigger? MultiChoice, the market leader, announced an increment in the price of some DStv packages in July 2018, after it did the same for all plans in September 2012 and May 2017.\n\nThat\u2019s not all; there was another increase in May 2020, which the company blamed on the increased Value Added Tax (VAT) rate. At all these times, users and the government alike kicked against the hike.\n\nDespite the opposition, in July 2021, MultiChoice increased the monthly subscription fee of its DStv Compact Plus Package from \u20a610,650 ($25.88) to \u20a612,400 ($30.13).\n\nPer Premium Times, the need to break the satellite TV sector\u2019s monopoly was recognised following the adoption of the report of the ad-hoc committee investigating the non-implementation of pay-per-view rates.\n\nIt goes without saying that MultiChoice\u2019s DStv gets to be at the receiving end of any action resulting from that move.\n\nRecall last week, we reported that Nigeria\u2019s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) directed commercial banks to freeze MultiChoice Nigeria Limited and MultiChoice Africa\u2019s accounts to recover \u20a61.8 trillion in taxes from the companies.\n\nPer Vanguard, Nigeria contributes 34% of MultiChoice\u2019s total revenue, Kenya and Zambia contribute 11% and 10% respectively, while the rest of Africa contributes 45%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf anything, this goes to show how important the Nigerian market is to the company.\n\nHopefully, the antitrust laws, when enacted will enable more Nigerians to enjoy affordable payTV services.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nAIfluence raises $1 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Thomas Ulrich from Pixabay\n\nKenyan adtech startup, AIfluence, has raised $1 million in seed investment to invest in its AI-powered influencer marketing platform.\n\nDubai-based EQ2 Ventures led the seed round, and Antler East Africa, Oui Capital, ArabyAds, and an unnamed European family office participated in the round.\n\nWhat about AIfluence? The adtech startup was founded by Nelson Aseka (CEO), George Issaias (CMO), Lamusia Anzaya (COO), and Ankit Jindal (CTO) in 2019. It was set up to accurately match influencers to brands, run end-to-end influencer marketing campaigns, and bring transparency to the measurement of impact.\n\nBuilt on a trust network model, the platform enables advertisers to recruit and manage hundreds to thousands of micro and nano influencers per campaign, resulting in authentic peer-to-peer interactions and higher conversion rates.\n\nHow does it make money? AIfluence generates revenue through brand initiatives that increase product and service awareness and lead generation and conversion campaigns that increase sales.\n\nThe company is currently developing a software as a service (SaaS) product that it claims will put the platform\u2019s power in the hands of its customers.\n\nExpansion plans? Apart from investing in AIfluence\u2019s technology and a SaaS platform, the funds will be used to grow into the rest of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia by the end of 2021.\n\nRead more: Kenyan influencer marketing startup, AIfluence, nets $1m in seed funding for regional expansion\n\nPoS business in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Nigerian streets, urban and rural, have at least one kiosk, with most of them bearing variations of the phrase \u2018PoS is Available\u2019, meaning you can withdraw and send money there.\n\nThere are so many outlets because since the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) launched the PoS system and agent banking in 2013 to achieve financial inclusion and develop a cashless economy, the PoS business has proven to be quite lucrative.\n\nNumbers don\u2019t lie: Data released by Shared Agent Network Expansion Facilities (SANEF) showed an 859% surge in the volume of PoS transactions during the lockdown between March and April 2020.\n\nAlso, per Statista, the number of PoS payments increased significantly from 34 million in 2015 to 438.6 million in 2019. On the other hand, in 2020, Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) recorded that Nigerian merchants and mobile money operators (MMOs) processed over 655 million PoS transactions valued at \u20a64.7 trillion ($13 billion), a 50% increase from 2019.\n\nPoS outlets are not limited to cash deposits and withdrawals. They also offer services like fund transfers, utility bill payments, and airtime recharge.\n\nYou should read the article by one of our senior reporters, Oluwanifemi Kolawole, to know the views of some PoS users and operators in Nigeria.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nAn insight into how early-stage venture firm, Microtraction, invests.

          "text": "Microblogging platform, Twitter, on Wednesday, July 14, 2021, announced that its disappearing posts feature, Fleets, will no longer be available on the platform.\n\nIlya Brown, Twitter Head of Products and Video ads, said in a blog post that the feature will be scrapped on August 3, 2021.\n\nLaunched on August 17, 2020, Fleet was Twitter\u2019s way of getting those who don\u2019t tweet regularly to do so.\n\nAccording to a tweet by Kayvon Beykpour, Twitter\u2019s Head of Consumer Product, on March 4, 2020, \u201cWe\u2019ve been listening to this feedback and working to create new capabilities that address some of the anxieties that hold people back from talking on Twitter. Today, in Brazil only, we\u2019re starting a test (on Android and iOS) for one of those new capabilities. It\u2019s called Fleets.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the number of people joining the conversation with Fleets did not increase. Brown\u2019s blog post revealed that the feature was used mostly as a means of promoting tweets by people who already tweet frequently.\n\nSocial media and disappearing posts\n\nDisappearing posts was first seen on Snapchat with its introduction of Stories in October 2013. It was described as a \u201cnew way to share your day with friends.\u201d The posts last for 24 hours after which they\u2019ll no longer be seen.\n\nThe feature was introduced on Instagram in August 2016. Like Snapchat, Instagram Stories disappear after 24 hours of posting. More social media platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook and networking platform, LinkedIn, soon added the feature.\n\nAfter the feature launched on Twitter newly, it suffered stability problems due to heavy usage. Twitter Support tweeted that the rollout of Fleets would be slowed down to \u201cfix some performance and stability problems. If you don\u2019t have the feature yet, you may not get it for a few more days.\u201d\n\nWhile this means the feature was catching on in the beginning, it is not clear why its use reduced.\n\nPer TechCrunch, Twitter declined to give statistics on the usage of Fleets.\n\nHowever, Instagram, claims its Stories see 500 million interactions daily, influencer marketing agency, Mediakix says 150 million \u2014 10% \u2014 of Facebook\u2019s 1.45 billion daily users use Facebook stories. Statista also reveals that daily WhatsApp status users were up to 500 million in Q1 2019.\n\nWith no available data on other platforms\u2019 disappearing posts feature usage, could this mean we\u2019ll see more apps scrap it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter says it has learned from Fleets and will focus on creating other ways to encourage people to join the conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

So, parents and guidance should warn their children and wards against cultism.\n\n\u201cOgun State remains the most peaceful State in Nigeria, and we will not toy with that. So anybody found engaging in cultism, both his parents and the cultist will be dealt with.\n\n\u201cWithin two years, the State has executed 60 projects in this local government. The abandoned Model College in Ishara would soon be put to economic use. We believe that government is a continuum, no project embarked upon by past administration will be abandoned\u201d.\n\nAbiodun equally promised that his government will do everything humanly possible to ensure that Orile Oko remains in Remoland with provisions of necessary social amenities.\n\nAt Owode in Obafemi/Owode local government, Governor Abiodun appealed to all aggrieved members of the party to sheath their sword, withdraw their cases from court, with a promise that all the aspirants would be adequately compensated.",

The meeting, therefore, agreed that the solution that INEC wants to deploy is possible.\n\n\u201cWe have the assurance of the service providers that they have provided similar technological solutions to other agencies and have the capacity to deploy technology to cover a few blind spots.\n\n\u201cThe commission will continue to pilot different solutions bearing in mind that technology is dynamic and can limit human interference in the electoral process. The commission wants broad powers to deploy technology and is not in favour of a particular solution being written into the law.\n\n\u201cThe commission is a creation of the constitution and the law and its powers are derived from the constitution. The constitution has also given the National Assembly the power to make laws but such powers must not be in conflict with and or at variance with the provisions of the constitution.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to implement the provisions of the Electoral Act to the extent of its consistency with the constitution, as the constitution is the fundamental law of the land. The commission will continue to build integrity and trust in the electoral process.\n\n\u201cThe commission has piloted and continues to pilot various electronic solutions that will improve the integrity of the electoral process. Presently, all the registered political parties upload the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates electronically.\u201d\n\nOkoye stated that domestic election observers and the media applied for accreditation to observe and cover elections electronically and that henceforth, political parties would submit the names and photographs of their polling agents electronically.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe commission uploads Form EC8A, being polling unit results to a central viewing portal. Since 2020, the commission has been uploading these results from different parts of the country.\n\n\u201cThe commission has used and will continue to use the existing technology to upload the results from polling units. The commission has uploaded results from polling units in Southern Ijaw with its difficult riverine and difficult terrain. The commission uploaded results from areas that are only accessible through human carriers.\n\n\u201cThe commission uploaded results from conflict areas. The commission uploaded results from all geopolitical zones. Presently, the commission has obtained the GPS coordinates of all the 176,846 polling units in the country and expanded voter access to the polling units.\n\n\u201cCurrently, the commission is carrying out part of the continuous voter registration exercise online, while the physical registration of voters will be done using INEC Voter Enrolment Device that will capture the fingerprints and facials of registrants.\u201d\n\nThe House of Representatives had on Friday passed the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, maintaining the controversial Clause 52(2) as presented amidst protests, especially by members of the minority caucus.\n\nThe clause gives the Independent National Electoral Commission the discretion to determine when, where and how voting and transmission of results will be done.\n\nAfter the passage of the bill, the Speaker, Mr Femi Gbajabiamila, criticised the proposed electronic transmission of election results, saying it was not feasible in the country for now.\n\n\u201cI want to use this opportunity to talk to people out there \u2026 We all want electronic transmission of results, but based on the information from experts, it is not as easy as it sounds. We must get our electoral process right and when the time is right, we can come back and amend the law.\n\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t think that electronic voting is feasible right now. What we have been talking about is electronic transmission, and from what we have been told today (Friday), we need to do more work so that everybody\u2019s vote will be counted,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Senate also had on Thursday passed the long-awaited Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021 after division among its members on the electronic transmission of results.\n\nAfter voting, the red chamber ruled out the possibility of having results transmitted electronically when it voted that the NCC, with the National Assembly\u2019s approval, would determine whether INEC could transmit results electronically or not.\n\nMany Nigerians criticised the National Assembly for the non-acceptance of the electronic transmission of election results.\n\nSokoto State Governor and former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Aminu Tambuwal, faulted the Senate\u2019s decision to grant the NCC the power to determine the electronic transmission of results.\n\nHe described the Senate\u2019s decision as \u201cunconstitutional,\u201d saying the mode of conducting elections and the transmission of votes should be left with INEC.\n\n\u201cThe decision of the Senate to subject INEC constitutional power to conduct elections to the Nigerian Communications Commission and National Assembly is patently unconstitutional. For the avoidance of doubt, Section 78 of the Constitution provides that \u2018the registration of voters and the conduct of elections shall be subject to the direction and supervision of the Independent National Electoral Commission.\u2019\n\n\u201cIn the Third Schedule, Part 1, F, S.15: INEC has the power to organise, undertake and supervise all elections. The constitution further provides that INEC operations shall not be subject to the direction of anybody or authority.\n\n\u201cUnquestionably, the mode of election and transmission are critical parts of the conduct, supervision, undertaking, and organisation of elections in Nigeria. Of course, the National Assembly has the power to flesh out the legal framework but that has to be consistent with the Constitution,\u201d Tambuwal said in a statement.\n\nPUNCH",

          "text": "By Abankula\n\nAn estimated 3,462 Nigerian Christians have been killed this year by Nigerian Jihadists, Fulani herdsmen and state actors up till 18 July.\n\nThe International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law gave this grim report today.\n\nAccording to the report, Benue and Kaduna have recorded the most deaths in the last six months.\n\n\u201cBenue State recorded the highest number of Christian deaths in the past 200 days with 450 and had recorded 200 deaths in Jan to April and 250 from May to 18th July.\n\n\u201cKaduna State came second with 410 Christian deaths and had recorded 300 deaths in Jan to April and 110 from May to 18th July;\n\n\u201cTaraba State came third with 240 deaths\u201d, the report said.\n\nThe authors also blamed the genocide going on in Zamfara, Kaduna and most parts of the North west to \u201cmuslim Fulani bandits\u201d.\n\nThe report comes with citations about the places of the killings.\n\nThe group based in Onitsha Anambra has been tracking such killings in the past.\n\nRead the full report:\n\nIntersociety, Nigeria: Sunday, July 18, 2021: The number of defenceless Christians hacked to death by Nigeria\u2019s Islamic Jihadists and their collaborators in the security forces in the past 200 days or 1st January to 18th July 2021 has risen to no fewer than 3, 462 and this is just sixty-eight deaths less than the total deaths of Nigerian Christians in 2020 which the Open Doors\u2019 World Watch List of Persecuted Christians put at \u20183,530\u2019.\n\nThis number further represents daily average Christian deaths of seventeen and second highest since 2014 when over 5000 Christian deaths were recorded in the hands of Boko Haram and Jihadist Fulani Herdsmen.\n\nWhile Boko Haram killed over 4000 Christians in 2014, the Jihadist Fulani Herdsmen accounted for 1,229 Christian deaths.\n\nIn our last report issued on 11th May 2021, covering January to April 2021, we found that no fewer than 1,470 Christians were hacked to death and in the past 80 days or 1st May to 18th July 2021, not less than 1, 992 Christian lives have been lost. We also found that no fewer than 780 additional Christians were abducted in 80 days or 1st May to 18thJuly whereas between 1st January and 30th April, 2200 were abducted. This brings the total number of the abducted Christians since January to 3000, out of which at least three out of every abducted thirty Christians were most likely to have died in captivity; thereby indicating additional secret death in jihadists\u2019 captivity of 300 Christians. Additional deaths of 150 is also added to represent \u2018dark figures\u2019 or deaths that occurred but not reported or recorded\n\nThe number of Churches threatened or attacked and closed or destroyed or burnt since January 2021 is also estimated to be around 300 with at least ten priests or pastors abducted or killed by the jihadists. Taraba State was discovered to be the most affected with at least seventy churches threatened or attacked and closed or burnt or destroyed. For purpose of setting the record straight, therefore, the International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law is a research and investigative rights group which has been monitoring and investigating religious persecution and other forms of religious violence by state and non state actors across Nigeria since 2010. This, we do through the use of direct contacts with the victims, eyewitnesses, media tracking, review of credible local and international reports, interviews and closed sources and so on.\n\nImpunity And Complicity Of Nigerian Security Forces: It is deeply saddening that till date those responsible for the anti Christian butcheries in the country have continued to evade justice and remained unchecked, untracked, uninvestigated and untried; leading to impunity and repeat-atrocities. The surviving victims and families of the dead victims are also totally abandoned by the Government of Nigeria. The Nigerian Government has continued to face sharp criticisms and strong accusations of culpability and complicity in the killings and supervision of same. The country\u2019s security forces have so fumbled and compromised that they hardly intervene when the vulnerable Christians are in danger of threats or attacks, but only emerge after such attacks to arrest and frame up the same population threatened or attacked. In the North, the jihadists operate freely under the cover and protection of the security forces; abducting, killing, looting, destroying or burning and forcefully converting their captive and unprotected Christians and their homes and sacred places of worship and learning. But the same security forces hatefully and brutally respond with utter ferocity against Southern and Northern Christians are accused of infraction or offending the law.\n\n\n\nHerdsmen Killings Most Widespread, Accounting For 1,909 Deaths: The Jihadist Fulani Herdsmen are responsible for majority of the killings with at least 1,909 Christian deaths in 200 days, followed by Boko Haram, ISWAP and Muslim Fulani Bandits who jointly killed 1,063 Christians, while Nigerian Army, joined by the Nigeria Police Force and other branches of the Armed Forces accounted for 490 Christian deaths. The 3,462 Christian deaths include additional 300 deaths representing Christian deaths arising from deaths in the captivity of the jihadists, on average of three deaths out of every 30 Christians abducted and disappeared and another additional deaths of 150 technically representing \u2018dark figures of crime\u2019. The killings by the Jihadist Fulani Herdsmen are also the most widespread cutting across the entire six geopolitical regions of Nigeria targeting Christian areas of Taraba, Adamawa and Gombe in the Northeast; Southern Kaduna (Northwest) and other Christian settlements in the State; Benue, Plateau, Nasarawa and Kogi in the North-Central; Oyo, Ondo, Ekiti and Ogun in the Southwest; Ebonyi, Enugu, Imo, Anambra and Abia in the Southeast; and Edo, Delta, Akwa Ibom, Cross River and Rivers in the South-south.\n\nThe Muslim Fulani Bandits, originally formed in Zamfara State in 2011, are jointly responsible for terrors going on in Christian parts of Southern Kaduna, Niger, FCT, Nasarawa and Kogi States. They are also responsible for attacks on indigenous Hausa Muslims in Zamfara, Katsina, Sokoto and Kebbi. In Kebbi State, for instance, the Muslim Fulani Bandits target and kill or abduct both Christians and Muslims; holding against their fellow Muslims a jihadist belief that the \u201cindigenous Hausa Muslims are not pure Muslims\u201d\n\nThe Muslim Fulani Bandits, originally formed in Zamfara State in 2011, are jointly responsible for terrors going on in Christian parts of Southern Kaduna, Niger, FCT, Nasarawa and Kogi States. They are also responsible for attacks on indigenous Hausa Muslims in Zamfara, Katsina, Sokoto and Kebbi. In Kebbi State, for instance, the Muslim Fulani Bandits target and kill or abduct both Christians and Muslims; holding against their fellow Muslims a jihadist belief that the \u201cindigenous Hausa Muslims are not pure Muslims\u201d; same reasons used in the ferocious jihadist attacks against their fellow Muslims in Zamfara, Katsina, Sokoto, and Muslim areas of Kaduna and Niger States. Boko Haram and ISWAP, on their part, are majorly responsible for attacks in Borno, Adamawa, Yobe and Taraba; and have through their recent alliances with other jihadists, made jihadist inroads and stepped up ferocious and unchecked attacks in Niger, FCT, Nasarawa, Kebbi and Kaduna, etc.\n\n3, 642 Christian Deaths:\n\nState By State Breakdown:\n\nBenue State recorded the highest number of Christian deaths in the past 200 days with 450 and had recorded 200 deaths in Jan to April and 250 from May to 18th July;\n\nKaduna State came second with 410 Christian deaths and had recorded 300 deaths in Jan to April and 110 from May to 18th July;\n\nTaraba State came third with 240 deaths;\n\nPlateau 170 deaths and had recorded 90 deaths in Jan to April and 80 from May to 18th July,\n\nIgbo States of Ebonyi, Enugu, Anambra and Abia 200 deaths and had recorded 80 deaths in Jan to April and 120 from May to 18th July.\n\nOthers are Christian part of Niger State (i.e. Shiroro, Munya and Rafi, etc) 200 Christian deaths (out of over 400 deaths) and had recorded 70 deaths in Jan to April and 130 from May to 18 July;\n\nAdamawa 80 Christian deaths,\n\nOgun/Ondo/Oyo/Ekiti 162 Christian deaths;\n\nKebbi 100 Christian deaths (out of 200 deaths);\n\nBorno 400 Christian deaths (out of over 800 total deaths excluding battle-field combat deaths); Nasarawa 50 Christian deaths,\n\nIgbo part of Delta 30 Christian deaths,\n\nEdo State 30 Christian deaths,\n\nnon Igbo part of Delta 20 Christian deaths,\n\nGombe/Bauchi 40 Christian deaths, Christian part of Geidam in Yobe State 25 Christian deaths,\n\nKogi State 14 Christian deaths,\n\nKatsina ten Christian deaths including a Reverend Father; and\n\nNigerian Army, Police, Navy, Air Force and DSS 490 Christian deaths (Imo 150, Abia 80 plus, Benue 70, Akwa Ibom 40, Ebonyi, Anambra, Enugu and Cross River 150 others).\n\nThe total of 3, 462 Christian deaths are established when 300 additional captivity fatalities and another 150 \u2018dark figures of crime\u2019 are added.\n\n3000 Christians Abducted In 200 Days: The number of abducted Christians in Nigeria increased from 2,200 between 1st January and 30th April 2021 to 3000 in 200 days of 2021 or 1stJanuary to 18th July 2021 and it involved 1,350 abducted by Jihadist Fulani Herdsmen and Bandits in Kaduna State, 620 abducted and disappeared by Muslim dominated and controlled soldiers of the Nigerian Army in Eastern Nigeria, 100 (out of over 150 abductees) abducted by BH, ISWAP and Ansaru in Borno and 120 abducted by the same Jihadist groups in Adamawa and Taraba; 420 abducted by Fulani Bandits and BH/ISWAP in Christian areas of Niger State, 100 abducted by Fulani Bandits and BH in Christian areas of Kebbi, 68 abducted by Jihadist Fulani Herdsmen in Oyo, Ekiti, Ondo and Ogun, 40 abducted by Jihadist Fulani Herdsmen in Nasarawa, 50 abducted in Abuja and Kogi and not less than 30 abducted by Jihadist Fulani Herdsmen in Enugu, Ebonyi and Abia and 100 others abducted on Lagos, Abuja and other Northern and non Northern routes by Fulani Herdsmen and Muslim Fulani Bandits; totaling 3000 abductions in the past 200 days or 1stJanuary to 18th July 2021.\n\n240 Christians Hacked To Death In Taraba In 200 Days: Attacks on Christians in Taraba State since January 2021 have intensified with ferocity and are barely reported in the media.

          "title": "You lied: Presidency fact-checks Bishop Kukah\u2019s speech",
          "text": "Michael Adeshina\n\nThe presidency has accused Bishop Kukah of spreading falsehood with the intent to discredit President Muhammadu Buhari-led\u2019s administration.\n\nMr Kukah had in a virtual appearance before the American lawmakers accused the president of a nepotistic approach to key appointments. He said Buhari favoured Muslims over Christians.\n\nHe also criticised President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s handling of the security situation in Nigeria.\n\nKukah said: \u201cThe whole of the North is being invaded by armed bandits that are launching attacks at will. The President has shown nepotism in his appointments as he is appointing only people that share the same religion with him into key political offices like the security Chiefs,\u201d Daily Post newspaper reported the Catholic bishop as saying.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in Nigeria, the first three persons: the President, the Senate President and the Speaker of the House of Representative are all Muslims.\n\n\u201cThis has never happened before. So, we require practical and measuring assistance that can help us and our children.\u201d\n\nHowever, Presidency replied to Bishop Kukah in a statement released on Sunday.\n\nThe Presidency described the way and manner Bishop Matthew Kukah \u201ccastigated\u201d his country, Nigeria, before the United States Congress as unfortunate and disappointing.\n\nRead the full statement by Mr. Shehu below.\n\nSTATE HOUSE PRESS RELEASE\n\nRESPONSE BY THE PRESIDENCY TO THE STATEMENT MADE BY BISHOP KUKAH BEFORE THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS\n\nIt is unfortunate, and disappointing, for citizens of Nigeria to bear witness to one of their Churchmen castigating their country in front of representatives of a foreign parliament.\n\nWe are all too familiar with these overseas political tours that opposition politicians take \u2013 visiting foreign leaders and legislators in the United States, United Kingdom, and Europe. So, the argument goes, if they are heard seriously abroad, then Nigerian citizens back home should surely listen to them too.\n\nBut in order to be heard at all, and to maximise media coverage back home for their activities, inevitably these visits involve painting the worst possible picture of our country before their chosen foreign audience.\n\nSoon enough we inescapably hear an identical list of racist tropes against northerners, how one religion dominates governance above all others, how the government is doing nothing to address herder-farmer disturbances, and how the government spends money on infrastructure to benefit everyone but the group and religion of the speaker. Of course, in order not to disappoint their western audience, regardless of the fact, the list is always the same-and always slanted for whoever wishes to cross-check.\n\nNigerians expect this from their unimaginative opposition \u2013 but it is troubling when a so-called man of the Church copies the worst excesses of those seeking personal advancement in public office.\n\nOnly this government has put forward the first and singular plan in nearly a century to address herder-farmer challenges \u2013 a fact recognised by international NGOs, including the International Crisis Group. To declare to a foreign audience that this government does nothing is an incredible falsehood.\n\nTo suggest that investment in infrastructure between Nigeria and Niger is wasteful and biased \u2013 when a similar infrastructure project between Lagos and Benin has revolutionised the two neighbouring economies to the advantage of both our countries \u2013 is quite disturbing.\n\nThere is no bias in this government when the president is northern and Muslim, the vice president southern and Christian, and the cabinet equally balanced between the two religions. But neither is there anything in our Constitution to state that political posts must be apportioned according to ethnicity or faith. It takes a warped frame of mind for a critic to believe ethnicity is of primary importance in public appointments. It is yet more troubling to hear a Churchman isolating one group for criticism purely on ethnic lines.\n\nWith due respect to the esteemed position he holds, the Bishop\u2019s assertion that only Christian schools are being targeted by bandits or terrorists is not supported by the facts on the ground. It is sad to say but also true that victims of crime, kidnapping, banditry and terrorism cut across all strata of society. Sad but true that Kankara students in Katsina State were stolen by bandits of the same Islamic faith as those they took away. The same may be true of those who are still holding the 134 students of the Islamic School at Tegina in Niger State. The nation witnessed the sad incident of the female students abducted by bandits at Jangebe in Zamfara State and the over 100 predominantly Muslim students of the Federal Government Girls College Birnin Yauri in Kebbi State who are currently in captivity- and the nation\u2019s security agencies are hard at work to release them unharmed.\n\nThe attack on Christian students is sad and unacceptable; so also is the abduction of students of other faiths. The claim that only Christian schools are being targeted is totally untrue.\n\nAs a nation and a people, we must together define evil as evil. We must not allow our religious differences to divide us. No one gains but the evildoers when we divide our ranks according to ethnicity and religion in confronting them. The bandit, kidnapper, and terrorist are the enemies of the people who should be confronted in unison.\n\nTo be clear, The Bible is definitive on matters of ethnicity and racialism: In Romans 2:9-10, it says: \u201cThere will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile; but glory, honour and peace for everyone who does good\u201d; And in Galatians 3:28: \u201cThere is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\u201d Whether Christian or Muslim, we stand by these beliefs and are steadfastly committed to them in governance.\n\nThere is no place in mainstream civil discourse for those who actively, negatively, and publicly label an individual ethnic group, especially before a foreign audience. These are not the views expressed or opinions held by the vast majority of the citizens of Nigeria. For all our challenges as a nation, nearly all of us seek to live together in harmony, celebrating differences, and finding common ground as Nigerians above all. But people like Kukah are doing their best to sow discord and strife among Nigerians.\n\nMore than any other set of people, leaders \u2013 in politics or religion who preach respect for truth have a duty to practice it. It is a moral and practical responsibility.\n\nGoing by the history of the Church as is well known, it will stand up publicly for the truth.\n\nIt is time others did the same.\n\nGarba Shehu\n\nSenior Special Assistant to the President\n\n(Media & Publicity)\n\nJuly 18, 2021",

          "text": "The Presidency has responded to Bishop Matthew Kukah\u2019s recent allegations against the Buhari government before the United States Congress.\n\nKukah, the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, has raised worry that the Nigerian government, led by President Muhammadu Buhari, is not treating religious crises properly.\n\nThis was stated by the acclaimed priest during a virtual presentation to the US Congress in Washington on the persecution of Christians in Nigeria by Islamic extremist organizations in Nigeria\u2019s Northern Region.\n\nAmong other things, Kukah told the Congress that, despite the fact that attacks on Christians have been occurring in Nigeria for many years, they have increased in the last ten years.\n\nThe Presidency responded in a statement signed by Garba Shehu, a senior special assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, saying it is terrible and upsetting for Nigerians to witness one of own Churchmen condemning their country in front of representatives of a foreign parliament.\n\n\u201cWe are all too familiar with these overseas political tours that opposition politicians take \u2013 visiting foreign leaders and legislators in the United States, United Kingdom and Europe. So, the argument goes, if they are heard seriously abroad, then Nigerian citizens back home should surely listen to them too,\u201d the statement added.\n\n\u201cBut in order to be heard at all, and to maximise media coverage back home for their activities, inevitably these visits involve painting the worst possible picture of our country before their chosen foreign audience.\n\n\u201cSoon enough we inescapably hear an identical list of racist tropes against northerners, how one religion dominates governance above all others, how the government is doing nothing to address herder-farmer disturbances, and how the government spends money on infrastructure to benefit everyone but the group and religion of the speaker. Of course, in order not to disappoint their western audience, regardless of fact, the list is always the same-and always slanted for whoever wishes to cross-check.\n\n\u201cNigerians expect this from their unimaginative opposition \u2013 but it is troubling when a so-called man of the Church copies the worst excesses of those seeking personal advancement in public office.\n\n\u201cOnly this government has put forward the first and singular plan in nearly a century to address herder-farmer challenges \u2013 a fact recognised by international NGOs, including the International Crisis Group. To declare to a foreign audience that this government does nothing is an incredible falsehood.\n\n\u201cTo suggest that investment in infrastructure between Nigeria and Niger is wasteful and biased \u2013 when a similar infrastructure project between Lagos and Benin has revolutionised the two neighbouring economies to the advantage of both our countries \u2013 is quite disturbing.\n\n\u201cThere is no bias in this government when the president is northern and Muslim, the vice president southern and Christian, and the cabinet equally balanced between the two religions. But neither is there anything in our Constitution to state that political posts must be apportioned according to ethnicity or faith. It takes a warped frame of mind for a critic to believe ethnicity is of primary importance in public appointments. It is yet more troubling to hear a Churchman isolating one group for criticism purely on ethnic lines.\n\n\u201cWith due respect to the esteemed position he holds, the Bishop\u2019s assertion that only Christian schools are being targeted by bandits or terrorists is not supported by the facts on the ground. It is sad to say but also true that victims of crime, kidnapping, banditry and terrorism cut across all strata of the society.\n\n\u201cSad but true that Kankara students in Katsina State were stolen by bandits of the same Islamic faith as those they took away. The same may be true of those who are still holding the 134 students of the Islamic School at Tegina in Niger State.\n\n\u201cThe nation witnessed the sad incident of the female students abducted by bandits at Jangebe in Zamfara State and the over 100 predominantly Muslim students of the Federal Government Girls College Birnin Yauri in Kebbi State who are currently in captivity- and the nation\u2019s security agencies are hard at work to release them unharmed.\n\n\u201cThe attack on Christian students is sad and unacceptable; so also is the abduction of students of other faiths. The claim that only Christian schools are being targeted is totally untrue.\n\n\u201cAs a nation and a people, we must together define evil as evil. We must not allow our religious differences to divide us. No one gains but the evildoers when we divide our ranks according to ethnicity and religion in confronting them. The bandit, kidnapper and terrorist are the enemies of the people who should be confronted in unison.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, The Bible is definitive on matters of ethnicity and racialism: In Romans 2:9-10, it says: \u2018There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile; but glory, honour and peace for everyone who does good\u2019; And in Galatians 3:28: \u2018There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\u2019 Whether Christian or Muslim, we stand by these beliefs and are steadfastly committed to them in governance.\n\n\u201cThere is no place in mainstream civil discourse for those who actively, negatively, and publicly label an individual ethnic group, especially before a foreign audience. These are not the views expressed or opinions held by the vast majority of the citizens of Nigeria. For all our challenges as a nation, nearly all of us seek to live together in harmony, celebrating differences, and finding common ground as Nigerians above all. But people like Kukah are doing their best to sow discord and strife among Nigerians.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2026 Nigeria bleeding from subsidy payment \u2013 Kyari \u2018\u2026 Irregularities make amount being spent uncertain\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s compounded by politics \u2013 Economist \u2018\u2026A pro-people policy on crude refining key\u2019 \u2026 Ignorance fuelling oppositions \u2013 Sylva\n\nThe issue of fuel subsidy removal remains a thorny one with each administration engrossed in the debate. Notwithstanding Nigeria\u2019s economic realities, its fiscal authorities are at a crossroads over the desirability or otherwise of the policy; BENJAMIN UMUTEME reports.\n\nThe story of Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector and its entire value-chain has continued to defy explanations. With oil sale as its main source of revenue, the country has yet to fully utilise the over $300 billion realised, in three decades, from the sale of crude.\n\nAs a major oil-producing nation, Nigeria still continues to import refined products for its domestic needs. From Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly known as petrol, to AGO (diesel) and kerosene, many still ask why the 10th major oil- producer globally has continued to import refined fuel. This is as the several turn-around-maintenance over the years has not been able to bring the five refineries that are almost in comatose state back to life. The country has since been left with no choice other than to fund importation of fuel at a subsidised rate.\n\nA situation where some non-oil producing countries import crude oil from Nigeria, refine and sell the same to Nigeria is an indication that something is fundamentally wrong with political leadership in the country. The refineries in the countries are at different levels of disrepair and, therefore, cannot meet local demands, just as it\u2019s been argued that oil cabals make more money through importation and distribution of oil than its production.\n\nIt\u2019s also been argued that the economy and political institutions which have become woven around this system would take quite an effort to extricate.\n\nThe conundrum, the fluctuation\n\nThe removal of petroleum subsidy has been in the front burner of debates for decades; however, it has taken a worrisome dimension since the return to civil rule in 1999, given the frequency of the demand and constant public outcry over subsidy management. Fuel price was first increased from five kobo to 9.5 kobo per litre and since then, it has become a recurring decimal in the polity. Subsequently, on October 2, 1994, the price was increased from N3.25 to N15, but on October 4, the following year, it dropped from N15 to N11.\n\nAgain, in 1998, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar increased it from N11 to N25, but reduced it to N20 on January 6, 1999. By the time he left office in 2007, the Chief Olusegun Obasanjo-led administration raised it from N20 to N75.\n\nHowever, after Obasanjo left office, the President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua-led government felt it wise to reduce the price to N65. In his case, President Goodluck Jonathan increased it to N143, but subsequently reduced it to N97 after many days of protest, killings and destruction of public property. Last year, with the global price of crude dropping, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, announced that subsidy on petrol would finally go.\n\nThis is as the Group Managing Director (GMD), Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari, reiterated that market forces would begin to determine the price. Alas, it was not too long before the government reverted to status quo with the NNPC once again funding subsidy. Experts have argued that with the refineries not working, it would be inconsiderate for the government to remove the subsidy.\n\nCrude price burden\n\nSpeaking at a recent media parley, the minister of state for petroleum resources told journalists that the rising cost of petroleum products was not healthy for the country. Toeing the same lane at a recent virtual event, the NNPC GMD warned that rising prices of crude oil in the international market could cause major challenges for resource-dependent nations like Nigeria. He added that oil prices had started exiting the comfort zone set by the NNPC and were becoming a burden.\n\nAccording to Kyari, the payment of petrol subsidy had made NNPC unable to contribute to the Federal Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) on two occasions.\n\nHe expressed concerns that as commodity prices rise buyers of Nigeria\u2019s crude may be compelled to accelerate their investment in renewable sources of energy, thereby leaving the industry in a quagmire.\n\n\u201cIn a resource-dependent nation like Nigeria when it gets too high, it creates a big problem because your consumers shut down their demand. Demand will go down and obviously even as the prices go up, you will have less volume to sell.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a chicken and egg story and that\u2019s why in the industry when people make estimates for the future they always make it about $50 to $60. Nobody puts it beyond $60,\u201d he said.\n\nImpact on economic growth\n\nRecent checks revealed that the federal government spends as much as N1.3 billion as subsidy for fuel. Speaking at a News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Forum penultimate week in Abuja, Sylva made case for the removal of fuel subsidy, arguing that the petroleum sector should be deregulated. The minister insisted that the country\u2019s economic progress would remain slow except a market-driven pricing of products was put in place.\n\n\u201cA situation where you produce something at a certain cost and you have to sell it at a lower cost to people because you are taking some of that burden off the people is not the best.\n\n\u201cIt is a very desirable thing but it is also not too sustainable because what happens is that you produce it for N10, you sell it for N5; tomorrow, you produce it again at N10, you add N5 from somewhere, produce it again at N10 and sell it for another N5.\n\n\u201cSo, the losses increase and compound on a daily basis and those accumulated losses have brought us to where we are.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that subsidy was part of what made the refineries to stop operating, the minister said, \u201cPart of the reasons the refineries were not working is subsidy because a refinery that is producing something at a certain cost and selling at a loss, how can it sustain itself. If you are producing something and they are selling at a certain subsidised price, it cannot work. That is why you see that the sector is not growing at all.\u201d\n\nThe former Bayelsa state governor also used the opportunity to blast Nigerians stating that the lack of understanding of the real issues about subsidy had led to serious opposition to its removal. He wondered why Nigerians have continued to oppose deregulation of petrol when other products such as kerosene and diesel have been deregulated.\n\n\u201cIt is actually in the interest of the common Nigerian to ensure that some people do not just profiteer on them, which is what has been happening. But at the end of the day, I believe that it is better for us because if we are able to deregulate, then we can save money.\n\n\u201cFirst, you can imagine the savings we will make as far as Foreign Exchange (Forex) is concerned and, of course, it will bring down the pressure on forex.\n\n\u201cPeople will be able to access Forex for imports, the government will not be the one providing foreign exchange for the importation.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, since the government will no longer be subsidising, the money which is over a trillion naira yearly, would be gained, instead of being burnt in cars, and would then be used for development.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine how much money the federal and state governments will have at their disposal if there is deregulation.\u201d\n\nFG\u2019s concerns\n\nIn the same vein, the GMD NNPC disclosed that the country was bleeding from continuous subsidy payment. According to Kyari, the federal government can no longer sustain the payment of subsidy that accompanies the volume put at 100 million litres.\n\n\u201cFrom the truck out report from the PPPRA database we have seen collapse of load out average move from 70 million litres to 60 million litres just in one month. That means we can do with less than 70 million, the balance, I don\u2019t know where it goes to but we know for sure that it is not consumed in this country.\n\n\u201cIn very recent data, we see what we really want in the beginning of May and June. There was a day we got about 103 million litres of PMS within one day across the depots.\n\n\u201cWe know it is not required, we know it is inappropriate and we also know that something wrong is happening that somebody is chasing something.\n\n\u201cBut we in NNPC are not in control of that; we are not in every depot, we don\u2019t keep products in all the depots. But when the volume goes down, it comes down to us. When there is tight supply, it comes back to the NNPC and we solve the problem.\u201d\n\nExperts\u2019 reactions\n\nSpeaking on the issue, the managing director of SD&D Capital Management Limited, Gabriel Idakolo, told Blueprint Weekend that with so many irregularities in the sector, it has become difficult for the government to ascertain the amount it spends on subsidies.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere are several irregularities in the system and the Nigerian State cannot presently state the statistics of petroleum import to Nigeria. The actual consumption of petroleum products in Nigeria is also not ascertained to determine the amount of subsidy the Nigeria government pays to importers.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC refineries have been running below capacity for over 20 years and the government has not done anything about it. There is also high level corruption surrounding petroleum subsidies which has made it difficult for the government to solve the problem of subsidy.\n\n\u201cThe petroleum products directly impact the daily living of Nigerians and removal of subsidy without commensurate cushion will increase the hardship in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, a political economist and development researcher, Olamilekan Adefolarin, in a chat with this reporter said the politics around fuel subsidy has made it difficult for the government to address the subsidy issue.\n\nHe said, \u201cSubsidy removal on PMS and the deregulation of the downstream sector is one of the oldest and most fundamental issues of governance, politics and economy in Nigeria. Since 1999, no civilian administration has been proactive enough to tame the problems in our petroleum sector; rather they compound the challenges in that sector through anti-people policies that ended up reversing whatever gains or progress that should have impacted the economy.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, the statement from the NNPC GMD and that of minister are not new and Nigerians are already aware of the Nigerian state failure. Regrettably, the Nigerian State is complicit and remains the number one stumbling block to finding solutions to the subsidy saga.\n\n\u201cThe question around the four refineries rehabilitation and turn-around-maintenance over the years has proven their inept and fragrant resource wastages. In addition to this is the politics and corruption in the oil and gas sector perpetuated by the ruling class who are enjoying the proceeds of subsidy.\u201d\n\nRemedy\n\nAdefolarin suggested that to address the situation, the government must come out with a pro-people policy especially as it relates to refining crude. He noted that policy that \u201cencourages the refining of crude oil in Nigeria is the appropriate policy the government must ensure it deploys to put an end to petrol importation.\u201d\n\nThis, he said, must translate to building and owning a new refinery on behalf the citizens and encouraging private individuals to build, even as he expressed the optimism that state governments could do likewise with modular refineries.\n\n\u201cEqually, to end this quagmire there is the need for the government, especially the national assembly, to pass the petroleum industry bill (PIB) for the president\u2019s assent so as to reduce the politics around the law.\u201d\n\nIn his view, Idakolo insisted that the NNPC in conjunction with the PPMC and other regulators needed to generate actual statistics of petroleum import to enable the government to plan adequately.\n\n\u201cThe subsidy must be removed on the long run but it must be after we have been able to achieve self sufficiency in petroleum products distribution through the optimisation of the five Nigerian refineries.\n\n\u201cWe should also collaborate with private refineries, especially Dangote Refinery, which will come on stream by 2022. Perpetrators of the subsidy scam must be prosecuted by the government.\u201d",
          "summary": "Alas, it was not too long before the government reverted to status quo with the NNPC once again funding subsidy.\nThe actual consumption of petroleum products in Nigeria is also not ascertained to determine the amount of subsidy the Nigeria government pays to importers.\n\u201cThe NNPC refineries have been running below capacity for over 20 years and the government has not done anything about it.\n\u201cThe petroleum products directly impact the daily living of Nigerians and removal of subsidy without commensurate cushion will increase the hardship in the country,\u201d he said.\nRegrettably, the Nigerian State is complicit and remains the number one stumbling block to finding solutions to the subsidy saga.",

          "title": "Why We Voted For E-Transmission Of Results With Conditions \u2013 Senate President",
          "text": "President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan has advanced reasons to justify the position taken by the Senate on the electronic transmission of election results.\n\nThe Senate on Thursday, while considering the Electoral Act 2010 Amendment Bill, voted that \u201cThe Commission(INEC) may consider the electronic transmission of results, provided the national coverage is adjudged to be adequate and secure by the National Communications Commission (NCC) and approved by the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nLawan explained that the Upper Chamber voted the way it did in defense of about half of the Nigerian voters whose votes may not be counted with immediate deployment or application of electronic transmission of election results.\n\nThe Senate President spoke to journalists at the weekend while on a constituency visit to his Yobe North Senatorial District.\n\nREAD ALSO: Eid-El-Kabir: IGP Assures Nigerians Of Sustained Efforts At Improving Security\n\nAsked to comment on the passage of the Electoral Act 2010 Amendment Bill, Lawan said: \u201cI\u2019m happy that we have been able to pass the amendment even though some people are complaining of what we have passed in the Senate and probably what the House of Representatives has also passed.\n\n\u201cWhen the majority of Senators voted against immediate application or deployment of electronic transmission of results from the polling units, to the ward, to the local government, states and federal, they didn\u2019t say they do not believe in electronic transmission (of election results).\n\n\u201cAll of us in the Senate, 109 of us, believe that at one point, our electoral process must deploy electronic transmission so that it eases and enhances the electoral process and give it more credibility and integrity.\n\n\u201cBut you see, when you have not reached that stage where you could deploy the electronic transmission from every part of the country, then you have to be very careful. And no matter what anybody may say, you cannot have about 50 percent of Nigerian voters not participating or not getting their votes counted in elections and say it doesn\u2019t matter, that we have to start the electronic transmission.\n\n\u201cWe know the evils of not transmitting results electronically but compare the evils of electronically transmitting just half of the electoral votes from Nigerians and say you have elected a President with 50 percent only.\n\n\u201cAnd others have voted but their results or their votes could not be electronically transmitted. This is disenfranchising Nigerians and we are not going to support this kind of thing because essentially, we are supposed to be fair to every part of Nigeria and when we voted, every part of Nigeria voted for and against(the amendment).\n\n\u201cWhat I mean here is that you have Senators from the northern part of Nigeria who voted for electronic transmission. Maybe that is their belief or their environment is ready for electronic transmission. And you have Senators from the southern part of Nigeria who voted against the immediate deployment of electronic transmission but they support that the electronic transmission of results should be allowed after certain conditions are met and the conditions are simple: The National Communication Commission(NCC) had provided the technical information that only NCC could give \u2013 that only about 50 percent of the Nigerian environment, the polling units, in the country could possibly have their results electronically transmitted.\n\n\u201cSo what happens to the other 50 percent. So we believe that all of us in the Senate were aiming at the same target but chose to go through different routes and that is why in my concluded remarks in the Senate after the debate and voting, I said there was no Victor, no Vanquish because we all meant well.\n\n\u201cAnd for those Nigerians who still feel that the electronic transmission should have just been allowed to take effect, I said well, this is how democracy works. Democracy is to allow those minority views to be expressed and democracy provides that the majority views will always prevail.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President faulted some media reports that insinuated that only the APC Senators voted against the immediate application of the electronic transmission of results.\n\nHe said the votes cast on either side of the subject matter cut across party lines and regional divides.\n\n\u201cIn this respect, it was not just APC. I have seen it reported in the media that only APC Senators voted against the immediate deployment of electronic transmission.\n\n\u201cThere are PDP Senators who voted against that but it appears that some people want to target APC Senators. There were PDP Senators who voted against the immediate deployment. I\u2019m using the word \u2018immediate\u2019 with an emphasis.\n\n\u201cNobody said don\u2019t use electronic transmission at all. You use it when we reach there and only NCC can give you information. That is the main reason why, in the Senate version, clause 52(3), there is that provision to contact the NCC because INEC will not know until they go to NCC.\n\n\u201cSo NCC will be the only institution to give that information because they are competent and it\u2019s within their jurisdiction. And we say the National Assembly should approve of it.\n\n\u201cIt is not when they want to do transmission that they will have to go to National Assembly that we want to do the transmission. No. That once NCC has told INEC is now ready. INEC should come to the National Assembly with the NCC and say we are now ready.\n\n\u201cThere is no way any National Assembly, not even this Ninth National Assembly will deny INEC the use of electronic transmission as part of our electoral process when we are ready for it,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nThe Senate President said it was wrong to conclude that Senators who voted for electronic transmission with conditions did not like the results transmitted electronically.\n\n\u201cI want to take this opportunity to debunk that insinuation or outright castigation of Senators that voted against the immediate deployment of electronic transmission that they don\u2019t like the electronic transmission. It is not true.\n\n\u201cEven though I didn\u2019t vote. But I believe that what my colleagues did is binding on all of us in the Senate. 28 against 52\u2026l believe that what we have done requires that the Senate and the House will each constitute a conference committee. What we call harmonisation for the two sides. When we harmonise, then we will send it to Mr President,\u201d Lawan said.",

Ajose said a member of the agency\u2019s board should be retired director in the service, adding that another should have about 30 years experience in fire service.\n\nAlso contributing, Mr. Ologunboye Pascal, a retired fire service officer, said there should be a provision for fire-medics to help in dispensing first aid at fire accident scenes.\n\nA fire engineer, Mr. Jumade Adejola, suggested that commercial buildings should be mandated to install fire hydrants in their apartments to reduce fire incidents.\n\nA former Commissioner for Home Affairs in the state, Mr Oyinlomo Danmole, advised that fire hydrant should be stationed at strategic places across the state to be handy to fire fighters during fire emergencies.\n\nEarlier in his address, the Deputy Speaker of the House, Mr Wasiu Eshinlokun-Sanni, said the state government would continue to attach importance to the security of the state residents.

          "title": "Amid Dispute Between Oba of Benin and Edo Governor, FG to \u2018Take Possession\u2019 of Repatriated Benin Artefacts",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government has in clear terms ruled out turning over the 1,130 Benin bronzes presently in possession of the German government to any individuals or subnational groups when the artefacts are finally repatriated to the country by August 2022.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture Alhaji Lai Mohammed made this clarification on Saturday while addressing the press in Lagos on the efforts by the federal government to repatriate looted and smuggled artefacts from around the world.\n\nThe remarks on the heels of the controversy between the Oba of Benin Ewuare II and the Governor of Edo State Mr Godwin Obaseki over who should take possession of the artefacts.\n\nWhile the monarchy is backing the return of the artefacts to a museum to be built by the palace within its premises, or alternatively, a museum to be built and managed by the federal and state governments, the governor has vouched for a private trust to take custody of, and manage the ancient precious artworks.\n\nWhile shedding light on the controversy, Mohammed said that the return of the artefacts was being negotiated bilaterally between the federal government Nigeria and Germany in line with international best practice and the operative conventions and laws.\n\nThe minister, who last week led a federal delegation to Berlin to negotiate with the German authorities on the modalities for the unconditional repatriation of the artefacts that were looted from the Benin Kingdom in 1897, during a raid by the colonial government, insisted that Nigeria, rather than any sub group was the entity recognized by international law as the authority in control of antiquities originating from the country.\n\nHe added that international conventions recognized cultural heritage as properties that belong to a nation but not individuals and sub-national groups.\n\n\u201cGentlemen, the Federal Government is aware of the widely-reported controversy on who will take possession of the Benin Bronzes when they are returned from Germany. Let me state clearly here that, in line with international best practice and the operative Conventions and laws, the return of the artefacts is being negotiated bilaterally between the national governments of Nigeria and Germany.\n\n\u201cNigeria is the entity recognized by international law as the authority in control of antiquities originating from Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe relevant international Conventions treat heritage properties as properties belonging to the nation and not to individuals or subnational groups,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe added that Article 1 of the UNESCO Convention in 1970, defined cultural property as property specifically designated by that nation;\n\nHe stressed that the article allowed an individual nation to determine what it regards as its cultural property, adding the federal government through the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments \u2013 has in working assiduously over the past years to repatriate the looted artefacts in collaboration with important traditional institutions and state governments.\n\n\u201cWhat we are saying in essence is that the Federal government will take possession of these antiquities, because it is its duty to do so, in line with the extant laws. But we have always exercised this right in cognizance of that culture that produced the art works. That is why the Ministry of Information and Culture and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments have always involved both the Edo State government and the Royal Benin Palace in discussions and negotiations that have now resulted in the impending return of these antiquities,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nThe minister also revealed that the federal government has instituted a claim in Paris before the Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to it Countries of Origin or its Restitution in case of Illicit Appropriation (ICPRCP), against a Belgian who wanted to auction an Ife Bronze head valued at $5 million, at least.\n\nAccording to the minister, the Ife Bronze antiquity had been seized by the London Metropolitan Police, pending the decision on who the true owner is.\n\nIn addition, he said the federal government had also secured a date in October 2021 for the repatriation of antiquities from the Metropolitan Museum in New York.\n\nHe said the antiquities consisted of two important Benin Bronzes and an exquisite Ife Bronze head.\n\n\u201cGentlemen, even though not everyone in possession of these artefacts is willing to return them, we remain undeterred as we have deployed all legal and diplomatic means and we have been recording successes in our quest for repatriation. Here are some of the successes we have recorded since that press conference in 2019:\n\n\u2013 In October 2020, The Netherlands returned a highly-valued 600-year-old Ife Terracotta.\n\n\u2013 In March 2021, the University of Aberdeen in Scotland agreed to return a Benin Bronze from its collections. We shall take possession of this in October this year.\n\n\u2013 In April 2021, we received a bronze piece from Mexico.\n\n\u2013 The University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom has also agreed to return a disputed Benin artefact. We will soon commence the procedure for the repatriation of this highly-valued piece\u201d.\n\nThe minister assured that the federal government will ensure the repatriation of not just the Benin artefacts, as it is equally working towards repatriating Ife Bronzes and Terracotta, Nok Terracotta, Owo Terracotta, the arts of the Benue River Valley, the Igbo Ukwu, the arts of Bida, the arts of Igala, Jukun among others.\n\nOlawale Ajimotokan in Abuja",

          "text": "A bright blue painting sits upon the soaked debris scattered around the streets of Stolberg in western Germany, marking the studio of local artist Dennis Brandt.\n\nInside, more wreckage is piled in a heap and drenched sketches peel from the walls where floodwaters rose almost to the ceiling.\n\n\u201cThe town has been destroyed, everything really, streets and houses,\u201d Brandt told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cMy studio, 20 years of work, paintings, everything is gone. It was a painting school for children as well, now that\u2019s gone too.\u201d\n\nAmong his now-destroyed collection was a post-apocalyptic view of Stolberg that he had painted last year, which depicted high waters lapping around the town\u2019s marketplace. Brandt could scarcely believe it had become a reality.\n\n\u201cMany of my friends no longer have a home,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a war.\u201d\n\nThe scenes of devastation in Stolberg were replicated across swaths of western Germany and Belgium this week as floods devastated low-lying towns in the region.\n\nIn Germany, at least 133 people have died, making it the worst natural disaster to hit the country in almost 60 years.\n\nThe Ahrweiler district south of Cologne reported at least 90 dead, among them 12 residents of a care home for the disabled.\n\nThe tragedy has raised widespread concerns that German authorities have not done enough to prepare for increasingly frequent bouts of extreme weather, driven by climate change.\n\nBetween Tuesday and Thursday, an unusually static low-pressure zone dumped record levels of rainfall, with the worst-affected areas battered by intense storms over Wednesday night.\n\nSome received as much as two months of rainfall in just 24 hours, Germany\u2019s meteorological agency said.\n\nTens of thousands of emergency services and at least 850 soldiers have been deployed to affected areas, using helicopters, armoured vehicles and boats to rescue people trapped by the waters and search through the remains of destroyed buildings.\n\nRescue operations continue, but have been hampered by extensive damage to infrastructure, with many roads damaged or impassable, phone networks down in several areas, and more than 100,000 people without power as of Friday evening.\n\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier visited Erftstadt in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) on Saturday, offering consolation to those hit by tragedy.\n\n\u201cWe mourn with those that have lost friends, acquaintances, family members,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir fate is ripping our hearts apart.\u201d\n\nArmin Laschet, premier of NRW and favourite to succeed Angela Merkel as Chancellor after September\u2019s elections, appeared alongside Steinmeier, and promised swift financial assistance to those affected.\n\n\u201cWe will do everything so that what needs to be rebuilt can be rebuilt.\u201d\n\nThough floodwaters have receded in many areas, authorities remain on high alert.\n\nAbout 700 residents from one district of Wassenberg, next to the Dutch border, were evacuated last night as a dam on the Ruhr broke.\n\nWassenberg Mayor Marcel Maurer said the situation was stabilising, but it was \u201ctoo early to give the all-clear\u201d.\n\nGermany\u2019s meteorological service has also issued weather alerts for south east Bavaria this weekend, where flooding is expected on the Danube.\n\nDuring his 20 years living in Erftstadt, Johannes Ahrends never had cause to worry about the calm, narrow river from which the town takes its name.\n\nBut this week\u2019s deluge sent torrents rushing downstream, overwhelming flood defences and engulfing the town.\n\nHomes were gutted by the rising waters and cars now lie scattered like toys amid the debris.\n\nIn nearby Blessem, the waters filled a gravel quarry, triggering a landslide that collapsed several houses and a historic castle.\n\nAuthorities rescued 170 people, many of them airlifted to safety.\n\nNo fatalities have yet been confirmed, though soldiers continue to search cars on an engulfed stretch of motorway nearby, where it is not known whether all drivers escaped.\n\nThough Ahrends\u2019 own home is located about 400 metres away from the flood, others were less fortunate.\n\n\u201cA friend of mine who lived in that area lost all of his clothes, his house, his car, everything,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.\n\nAs soldiers arrived to help and the sounds of helicopters filled the air, locals began their own initiative, he said, setting up a Facebook group to coordinate and supply sandbags and food for their neighbours.\n\n\u201cWe need new infrastructure, but in this area Blessem there\u2019s a hole with a depth of 10 metres, so how can you ever recreate it? It\u2019s so frightening and unbelievable that part of the town is really gone and there\u2019s no chance to rebuild it.\u201d\n\nThe disaster has prompted questions about whether Germany\u2019s flood warning systems are adequate for increasingly unpredictable weather events in an ever-warming climate.\n\nEmergency warnings and evacuation notices were issued when real-time river sensors detected a massive spike in water levels.\n\nBut smaller streams and tributaries not previously perceived as threats were not monitored as closely, Rhineland Palatinate\u2019s environment minister acknowledged.\n\n\u201cExtreme rains were in the forecast, but not consistently at the right locations and in the right magnitudes,\u201d said Andreas Fink, a climate researcher at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.\n\n\u201cThere were warnings, but villages along the small river in the Eifel were not evacuated.\u201d\n\nFink said improved forecasting and evacuation procedures should be implemented quickly.\n\n\u201cHigher dykes and better infrastructure take time, but we need the decisions now,\u201d he added.\n\nThe disaster has once again forced climate to the front of the political agenda just months before federal elections.\n\nThough Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats have maintained a comfortable polling lead, her successor Laschet is widely seen as weak on climate protection for his support for coal mining and the auto industry \u2013 with an article in influential weekly Zeit on Friday describing him as a \u201cRealpolitker on the run from reality\u201d.\n\nBut for now campaigning has been suspended and politicians are focused on assisting the victims and mourning the dead.\n\nAhrends\u2019 first concern is for the reconstruction of Erftstadt and the rehousing of his neighbours, but he knows that the town\u2019s plight is a sign of an increasingly unpredictable future.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt this is climate change,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Martine Mo\u00efse, the wife of Haiti\u2019s assassinated president who was injured in the July 7 attack at their private home, returned to the Caribbean nation on Saturday following her release from a Miami hospital.\n\nHer arrival was unannounced and surprised many in the country of more than 11 million people still reeling from the killing of Jovenel Mo\u00efse in a raid authorities say involved Haitians, Haitian-Americans and former Colombian soldiers.\n\nMartine Mo\u00efse disembarked the flight at the Port-au-Prince airport wearing a black dress, a black bulletproof jacket, a black face mask, and her right arm in a black sling as she slowly walked down the steps of what appeared to be a private plan one by one. She was greeted by Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph and other officials.\n\nEarlier this week, she tweeted from the Miami hospital that she could not believe her husband, Jovenel Mo\u00efse, was gone \u201cwithout saying a last word,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis pain will never pass.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, government officials had announced that Jovenel Mo\u00efse\u2019s funeral would be held on July 23 in the northern Haitian city of Cap-Haitien and that his wife is expected to attend.\n\nShe arrived hours after a key group of international diplomats on Saturday appeared to snub the man currently running Haiti by urging another politician, the designated prime minister, to form a government following Mo\u00efse\u2019s killing.\n\nJoseph has been leading Haiti with the backing of police and the military despite the fact that Mo\u00efse had announced his replacement a day before the president was killed.\n\nJoseph and his allies argue that the designated successor, Ariel Henry, was never sworn in, though he pledged to work with him and with Joseph Lambert, the head of Haiti\u2019s inactive Senate.\n\nThe statement was issued by the Core Group, which is composed of ambassadors from Germany, Brazil, Canada, Spain, the U.S., France, the European Union and representatives from the United Nations and the Organization of American States.\n\nThe group called for the creation of \u201ca consensual and inclusive government.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo this end, it strongly encourages the designated Prime Minister Ariel Henry to continue the mission entrusted to him to form such a government,\u201d the group said.\n\nU.S. officials could not be immediately reached for comment. A U.N. spokesman declined comment except to say that the U.N. is part of the group that issued the statement. Meanwhile, an OAS spokesman only said the following: \u201cFor the moment, there is nothing further to say other than what the statement says.\u201d\n\nHenry and spokespeople for Joseph did not immediately return messages for comment.\n\nThe group also asked that \u201call political, economic and civil society actors in the country fully support authorities in their efforts to restore security.\u201d\n\nRobert Fatton, a Haitian politics expert at the University of Virginia, said the statement is very confusing especially after the U.N. representative had said that Joseph was in charge.\n\n\u201cMore confusion in a very confusing and bewildering situation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe question of who should take over has been complicated by the fact Haiti\u2019s parliament has not been functioning because a lack of elections meant most members\u2019 terms had expired.
