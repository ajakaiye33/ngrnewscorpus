          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nA Consultant Psychiatrist at the Drug Abuse Unit, Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospital Aro, Abeokuta, Ogun State, Dr. Sunday Amosu, has advised pregnant women to stay away from tobacco use, warning that babies whose mothers smoked during pregnancy are prone to suffering from repeated pneumonia within one year of their birth.\n\nAmosu said women who use tobacco in pregnancy are at risk of giving birth to children with birth defects such as cleft lips.\n\nAccording to UNICEF, though pneumonia is a preventable disease, it kills more children globally than any other infection.\n\nThe UN child agency says Nigerian children made up the highest number of those who died, with an estimated 162,000 deaths in 2018 \u2013 443 deaths per day, or 18 every hour.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, 19 percent of child deaths were due to pneumonia in 2018, and it was the biggest killer of children under-five in 2017.\n\n\u201cPneumonia is a deadly disease and takes so many children\u2019s lives \u2013 even though this is mostly preventable. And yet, this killer disease has been largely forgotten on the global and national health agendas\u201d, UNICEF said.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise as Nigeria joins the global community on Monday to mark the 2021 World No Tobacco Day, Amosu said available statistics show that about one out of every 10 Nigerians currently smoke cigarettes.\n\nThe theme for this year\u2019s commemoration is \u201cCommit to quit.\u201d\n\nThe psychiatrist said, \u201cThere are 1.1 billion smokers worldwide and 80 percent of them are in the low and middle-income countries including Nigeria. Women who smoke are, particularly at risk. We can look at the risk of tobacco smoking in pregnancy in terms of the risk to the baby and the risk to the mother.\n\n\u201cThe mother faces the risk that anybody that smokes whether male or female faces like lung cancer, chronic pulmonary diseases, ischemic heart disease, stroke. There is a great risk for the baby when it comes to tobacco in pregnancy.\n\n\u201cStudies have shown that there is an increased incidence of cleft mouth and cleft lips among children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. Also, pregnant women who smoke may have a miscarriage and lose the pregnancy.\n\nAmosu pointed out that smoking in pregnancy can also lead to sudden respiratory distress and the death of infants.\n\nContinuing, he said, \u201cSmoking in pregnancy can also cause what is called Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. The baby will just develop acute respiratory syndrome while in the cot begin to breathe excessively and suddenly the baby will die.\n\n\u201cWe have also discovered that within the first year, the baby is prone to having repeated pneumonia which is the infection of the lung. We also need to be careful because even those who are passive smokers are also prone to these problems.\u201d\n\nThe psychiatrist urged all hands to be on deck to tackle the menace of smoking in Nigeria.\n\nAlso speaking about the 2021 World No Tobacco Day, the World Health Organisation Regional Director for Africa, Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, says no fewer than 1.2 million people die annually due to exposure to tobacco smoke.\n\nMoeti said this in her message to mark the day, stressing that the theme was to remind everyone that tobacco kills half of its users, and also harms nearly every organ in the human body.\n\nShe said that even smoking one cigarette a day can seriously harm a person\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cTobacco use can lead to lung, mouth, throat, oesophagus, stomach, bowel, and other cancers.\n\n\u201dIt increases the risk of chest and lung infections, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and other conditions.\n\n\u201cThere is no safe form of tobacco\u201d, she said.\n\nMoeti said that of the 1.3 billion tobacco users globally, 60 percent have expressed the desire to quit.\n\n\u201dBut only 30 percent have access to the tools to do so successfully,\u201d she noted.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

Once Salmonella Typhi bacteria are eaten or drunk, they multiply and spread into the bloodstream,\u201d WHO said\n\nAccording to Bio-Medical Journal \u2013 a peer-reviewed medical site, intestinal perforation is a serious complication of typhoid fever that remains a significant surgical problem in developing countries, where it is associated with high mortality and morbidity, due to lack of clean drinking water, poor sanitation, and lack of medical facilities in remote areas and delay in hospitalisation.\n\n\u201cThe high incidence of perforation in most developing countries has been attributed to late diagnosis and the emergence of multi-drug resistant and virulent strains of Salmonella typhi,\u201d the medical site said.\n\nAlso, according to the UK\u2019s National Health Service, perforation of the digestive bowel is a serious medical complication.\n\n\u201cThis is because bacteria that live in your digestive system can move into your stomach and infect the lining of your abdomen,\u201d the UK NHS said.\n\nIgwegbe also explained that typhoid fever can be gotten when one eats infected food or through fecal-oral transmission.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t wash your hands properly after using the toilet and still use your hands to eat.

Teachings on this always come much later when they are older which sometimes comes too late.\n\nAccording to research conducted by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), it estimated that approximately 1 in 6 boys and 1 in 4 girls are sexually abused before the age of 18, and almost all of them knew their perpetrators.\n\nNo one particular race, culture, religion or socio-economic group is spared when it has to do with child sexual abuse. Although there\u2019s no foolproof way of protecting them from sexual abuse, but there are actually steps you can take to reduce the risk. As it\u2019s very glaring these days, sexual molesters are everywhere, they can strike at any time, and they come in different shapes/sizes/friendly/unfriendly.\n\nMost parents often say it cannot happen to their children because they will never expose them to strangers. Here are a few questions for you- Do you have friends or family come over to your house? Do they play at the neighbour\u2019s house? Do your children go to sleep over? Are they in day care/pre- school?\n\nThe simple truth is that you cannot fully prevent the risk of your child being sexually abused but you can teach them what to do to prevent them being victimized when they go out or interact with those around them. Below are some likely precautions you can take to gauge the situation/putting an end to the abuse.\n\nStart that conversation \u2013 Having a straight conversation about body parts can go a long way in protecting the children without scaring them off. Talk about body parts early, name body parts as it\u2019s never too soon to talk about them while they are still very young. Always use the right names for the different body parts.

          "text": "By Jemi Ekunkunbor\n\nFrom an abused background that left him emotionally broken, with low self esteem and long struggle with identity crises, Taiwo Akinlami has risen to become not only a voice for children, but a catalyst for good parenting and family strengthening education in Nigeria. The Social Development lawyer of over two decades is a Children\u2019s Human Rights / Protection and Family Strengthening Advocate, as well as, Subject matter expert on Securing a friendly environment for the African child.\n\nThe author of 11 books and four e-books, has worked with several organizations like UNICEF, British Council, USAID, UNFPA, SOS Children\u2019s Village, Facebook and Google reaching over 25,000,000 children.\n\nAgainst the background of International Children\u2019s day celebrated last Thursday, Allure had this interesting chat with the husband of Oluwafunmilayo as he brings one more time, his message of hope to a world where Children\u2019s rights are violated by primary and secondary caregivers.\n\nNigeria marked International Children\u2019s Day on Thursday. How would you describe the state of the Nigerian child?\n\nThis question invokes a deep feeling of sadness. Is there really anything for the Nigerian child to celebrate? We cannot discuss the state of the Nigerian child without first discussing the state of Nigeria, which is the national landlord of the Nigerian child.\n\nIt is sad that this country which UNICEF describes as \u2018country of the young,\u2019 seems to have no plan for the young. The nation has been christened the Poverty Headquarters of the world. The impact of the state of our nation is reflected in the fact that 13.5 million Nigerian children of ages 5-14 are out of school, the highest in the world; 1 in 5 Nigerian children never reach the age of 5. according to the World Bank in 2018, \u2018108 million Nigerians are estimated to be homeless, based on an average family of six people per housing unit.\u2019\n\nAccording to UNICEF, \u2018clean water, basic toilets and good hygiene practices are essential for the survival and development of children and only 26.5 per cent of the population use improved drinking water sources and sanitation facilities. UNICEF submits, \u2018Nigeria has the second highest burden of stunted children in the world.\n\nAs you can see, the precious Nigerian children are not only denied their rights, but they are also abandoned and except we advocate for a quick intervention, the nation does not have a future.\n\nWhat is her situation considering covid 19?\n\nIt is important to note that the state of the Nigerian Child is not worsened by the COVID -19 Pandemic. The real problem is the mismanagement of the pandemic by the Nigerian government. Do you know that according to UNICEF, over 42 million Nigerian children could not access education during the COVID-19 lockdown as they had no access to the internet and the tools to learn online? Do you know that many of our precious children do not have access to healthcare, nutrition, and the rest because of the gross mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic? It is sad that even today, many public schools across the country are yet to resume fully.\n\nThe violation of children in recent times has been on the rise. Why do you think this is so?\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the tension created by the lockdown, made worse the cases of domestic violence especially as a Third World nation. Also, the primary parents, who have the duty of care, are distracted by the state of the nation. There is no serious nation on earth where the responsibility of raising children rests solely on the shoulders of the primary parents.\n\nThere are four institutions, responsible for raising children. The family is first, and it is its responsibility to inculcate a positive value system in their precious children and be their first line of defence against all forms of abuse. The second is the community; the neigbours, the religious bodies, the media, the schools etc, and their role is to reinforce the positive value system being inculcated by the family and provide the second line of defence against all forms of abuse. The third is the state whose role is to create an egalitarian society, where social protection is provided and equal opportunities for social and economic emancipation are made available for most of the citizenry.\n\nAs it is in Nigeria today, the parents are the only ones playing the roles that four institutions are designed to play. Therefore, they are distracted from their primary duty of inculcating positive value system, and being the first line of defence for the protection of their precious children from all forms of abuse, particularly, child sexual abuse.\n\nWould you say that the parenting style by some parents makes their children vulnerable to violation?\n\nWell, Nigerian parents need to be encouraged because they are raising their children under exceedingly difficult circumstances, doing the duties of four institutions.\n\nPoverty is the number one threat to effective parenting in Nigeria. When the existence of a people is abused, they have nothing to offer but to abuse their precious children or expose them to abuse.\n\nThose living above the poverty line must accept the onerous responsibility of raising children in an over sexualized 21st century, and give themselves to acquiring the right knowledge, skills, and attitude to protect their precious children. They must keep their children away from strangers, be vigilant, and watch out for signs of abuse.\n\nWhat kind of lessons can children be given to help them against rapists?\n\nOur children need sound sexuality education which focuses on their personal safety and self-protection. It begins with making it clear to them that every part of their body is private, and that nobody has the right to touch it, except, for the purpose of providing cautious care and moderate affection. They must be taught that no touch is good except it is necessary. So, instead of focusing on teaching them good touch/bad touch, we must focus on necessary and unnecessary touch. They must be taught to raise an alarm and ensure they are heard when they consider a touch unnecessary.\n\nChildren must be aware that superior to protecting the areas we call the private part, is protecting what I call healthy and safe private space. which he/she must be taught not to allow anyone to breach.\n\nChildren must also be taught that those who want to abuse them do not start from the place we call private parts. They start with profiling the child, to ascertain his/her level of vulnerability. Then they proceed to grooming, making suggestive statements to the child like, calling him or her my wife or my husband, touching parts of his/her body, and building a secret relationship with the child. The goal of grooming is to get the child to be comfortable with abuse and the abuser. After grooming, the abuser attacks and violates the child and thereafter, manipulates the child by promising him/her pleasure, or employing subtle or direct threats to keep him/her quiet. Our children are not safe until they have the right teaching and understand how the mind of the abuser works.\n\nRecently, sex education seems to have been brought back aggressively with a viral music video \u201cprivate part\u201d. How appropriate is that video?\n\nI think it is a good place to start, but sexuality education must transcend teaching our precious children about the private part and public part. They should be taught that every part of their body is private to them and nobody can touch it except for the purpose of providing care and conscious affection.\n\nWhat is your take on people sharing videos of minors who are being violated?\n\nI think sharing videos or other materials, which show the nakedness of children is both morally reprehensible and illegal. It is nothing but distributing child pornography and expanding the frontiers of child sexual abuse. This is against the provisions of the Child\u2019s Rights Act 2003. In developed climes, people are arrested and prosecuted for being in possession of such materials.\n\nPersonally, I do not watch such videos or expose myself to such materials and I warn people not to send them to me. I do not think I need such materials in which the innocence and sexual dignity of our precious children are being denigrated for me to know that child abuse by adults or peers are taking place, and that we need to do something about it. The facts are palpable to the blind and audible to the deaf. I think what we need to do is to hold the parents, community, state and international community responsible and accountable for the protection of our precious children from sexual and other forms of abuse through the establishment of a system of protection, codified into a policy and broken down into processes for the ease of implementation in both private and public institutions.\n\nAre there tips to identifying a potential rapist/child molester?\n\nMost child sexual abusers are people close to our children; fathers, mothers, stepfathers, stepmothers, siblings, uncles, aunties, cousins, nephews, nieces, e.t.c Secondary caregivers like teachers, nannies, neighbours, and others. The closer people are to a child, the more sexual abuse is likely. It does not mean everyone in the categories mentioned above are all the time abusers.\n\nSo, we teach our children to suspect those who give them the slightest reason to suspect them, and they must speak up.\n\nHow can the girl child be best protected?\n\nFirst, the girl child has to be raised as a strong vessel and as an individual who can hold her turf in society. We must never raise her as a victim or property and an appendage of men. Teach the girl child how to protect herself. Serve her the right menu of Child Sexuality Education.\n\nNever put the girl child in harm\u2019s way for whatever reason because, we have seen instances where the girl child\u2019s father, stepfather and men, who her mother has one form of relationship with, is the abuser. In some bizarre instances, the mother is aware but does not speak up or even covers it up because she wants to save her relationships with these men. Abuse must be reported. Silence only weakens the abused and strengthens the abuser. But if for whatever reason sexual abuse occurs, we must teach the girl child to speak up. Many do not speak up because they claim that the girl child may not find a husband in the future.\n\nSilence shields the abuser from facing the consequences of his actions, including prosecution and conviction.\n\nShare with us your most memorable experience of a rape case you were ever involved in handling?\n\nI have been in the middle of many cases, but I think the most memorable was the case of a boy child, who was allegedly sodomized by her two seniors in a highbrow private school in Nigeria. It is memorable because it exposed my thinking that the fact that a school is big and looks sophisticated, does not mean they can provide the best of protection for our precious children.\n\nThe most painful aspect of this case was that the school in question did not have a child protection policy, no anti-bullying policy, no plan to educate the children on their sexuality and strategies for playing their roles in their personal safety and self-protection. It was a painful case because the parents trusted the school because of its sophistication and size; but the school let the parents down by not having in place a system of protection.\n\nAs someone, who was serially, sexually molested from age 6-8 by a female adult and neighbour, I understand what it means for the boy child to be sexually abused and most importantly, I understand what it means for those who have the duty of care to abandon their duty, exposing us to danger of child sexual abuse, which impact is for a lifetime. Knowing all of these, we fought relentlessly to get justice for our client and ensure that the parents get help for him.\n\nWhat can the government do in light of children\u2019s day celebrations?\n\nI do not think the present government can do much as it seems to be absent. I do not think we can put our fate in the hands of the government. We must make it a point of duty to agitate for an egalitarian society, where the rights of every Nigerian, parents and their precious children\u2019s rights to basic needs in life are respected as priorities in governance.",

          "text": "Babatunde Rufai is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Wear It All Luxury; a men\u2019s luxury boutique. Fondly and popularly called Tunde Wear It All, he has over the years in the fiercely competitive Nigerian fashion industry, carved a niche for himself by establishing a reputable brand that is synonymous with class. His luxury boutique in high brow Lekki is richly designed to cater for men who want to be simple, yet, be sure of the authenticity of the premium brands they wear.\n\nHe shares with Allure his passion for fashion, how to handle rejection and important success tips for every fashion entrepreneur. Excerpts;\n\nWhen you decided you wanted to do luxury, what steps did you take to learn the ropes?\n\nMy decision to go into luxury clothing had stemmed from the fact that there were a lot of copies of the original designer pieces down this part. I also had friends who wanted to buy the original and have to always travel out to get them. I\u2019ve always had an eye for fashion, so it was a bit easy for me to delve into it. Also, because I have always engaged in buying and selling right from time, so all the experiences needed, I already had them.\n\nWhat is the significance of your education in Italy to your fashion business?\n\nAs the saying goes \u2018speak English, kiss French, drive German and dress Italian. Italy is renowned for its high quality craftsmanship, luxury designs, sharp tailoring, manufacturing and exporting of fashionable items since the 11th century. I believe anyone going into a fashion related business needs to understand and study this unique fashion heritage to be able to be successful in it. My education in Italy was, and still is, the number one foundation in my business as I apply what I\u2019ve learnt on a daily basis to improve and solve business related issues.\n\nDuring my time in Italy, I also engaged myself in social education as I visited 15 cities, absorbing both the fashion and general culture. This is really important in the fashion business as this has helped me apply what I learnt in building my brand.\n\nWhat particularly motivated you to decide to go into the fashion business?\n\nI have always had a flair for and attachment to fashion for as long as I can remember. I decided to go into it fully and opened my first store in 2007 at Akoka, close to University of Lagos (UNILAG).\n\nAs a tertiary institution, fashion is always one of the things that matters to students and I decided to take advantage of that as I had a lot of interest from them, thus, turning my passion and motivation into a blossoming business.\n\nWhat were the hurdles you had to scale at the beginning?\n\nIt was clearly a challenge, walking into stores to convince people that you single-handedly want to start something as big as that. It took a lot of conviction, consistency, perseverance and hard work. First any big brand you walk into in Europe to stock, wants to know other big brands you are dealing with. They want to be sure their brand is going out into the big class. I had to attend fashion shows and fashion trade fairs, which helped to build my profile and connection.\n\nEvery business no matter how small, comes with its own challenges especially when you are trying to break even into the market. Selling luxurious brands comes with its challenges especially when you have to convince people to pay such a high price for something as little as a shirt when there are replicas that go way cheaper. They stand in the way of you generating sales or even a take home. It was not an easy task but with time and consistency, we stood and have been able to build this brand to what it is today.\n\nGenerally, what is the big lesson you have learnt about running a high-end fashion and footwear business?\n\nBrand in itself is determined by a customer\u2019s overall perception of your business. I did a lot of research in the industry niche and took notes of the salient things missing as regards imitation and competition which wasn\u2019t exactly there. The quality always stood for itself and people always wanted that. I maintained consistent communication, alongside experience across a lot of platforms \u2013 sales and customer service, print, packaging, environment and the most recent, which does go a long way, social media.\n\nI look particularly for style that carries an aura and speaks volume when people see it. It goes a long way in defining who you are.\n\nWhat is it like selling in times of economic melt down such as that brought by covid 19?\n\nTo be sincere, we have had the best sales ever since we opened after the lockdown. I think two possible reasons must have led to that. One is that a lot of people can\u2019t travel again, so they have to rely on buying locally. Second, even those who shop online couldn\u2019t do that simply because the banks have restricted monthly spending on cards to about $200usd. So, that must have led to the increment in sales we have been experiencing since the COVID-19 pandemic. So, it\u2019s either to buy from the local store, or make use of personal shoppers who are based abroad.\n\nWhat is the ultimate goal of WIA Luxury and how do you hope to achieve it?\n\nWear It All speaks aura, pervasive quality and luxury that comes with style. With all of the biggest names in fashion, you\u2019ll be guaranteed to find the best men\u2019s designer clothing.\n\nAlso, find stylish seasonal pieces from some of fashion\u2019s most influential labels like Gucci, Alexander McQueen, Versace and Dolce & Gabbana among others. \u2018Wear It All\u2019 stays what it stands for; originality and transparency in our mission and vision. We speak class, style and most of all, luxury! Our motto is to \u2018Let Your Wears Speak For You\u2019.\n\nI intend to turn Wear It All Luxury into a fashion empire, in every room and whenever this brand is mentioned, luxury is the only thing that comes to mind. I intend to achieve this through progressive rebranding to attain the highest level of Luxury in Nigeria and the most sought-after for fashion needs in Nigeria and abroad.\n\nWhat is your best advice to anyone who wants to run a similar business?\n\nI\u2019ll say running a business successfully is not as easy as it seems, luxurious or not. Over time, I was able to put together a few things that have made me even better at things I do. I have learnt that team work and communication does go a long way. The lack of teamwork in itself is enough to make business not thrive. It kills the dream and eventually the business and what you stand for. Also, you have to be true to your words because some people hold it highly. That\u2019s all that they need to partner with you or even be consistent in you styling them. From employing staff members to cash flow, to whatever it is that surrounds a business, you must serve a purpose. Keep exploring, and always get feedback. These things go a long way. Also you need to employ people that have passion for the business and make them feel comfortable working with you.\n\nNever ever get comfortable with your situation; strive, never give up and understand that time is an important factor in becoming that one person you want to become.\n\nSince you operate in other countries, how would you compare the Nigerian business environment to other African countries vis-\u00e0-vis profitability and challenges of setting up business?\n\nWe don\u2019t operate in other countries, we only have clients we ship to in other countries.\n\nHow do you balance work and your personal life considering how busy work and family can get?\n\nI work about 10-12hrs daily and 7days a week when in the country and when I\u2019m out of the country to stock up. My typical day starts with waking up at 6am for my morning prayer, then to the gym, take a little rest before getting ready to go to work.\n\nWe work officially from 10am to 8pm but they\u2019re also unofficial demands that require my attention sometimes at odd hours, I have to balance all these. In my spare time, I hang out with my friends and family to ease off tension and relax.\n\nHow do you handle rejections as an entrepreneur?\n\nRejection is part of entrepreneurship. It offers us the opportunity to make sure what we\u2019re doing is right for us. To handle this, I evaluate why the rejection came, I determine if this is something I really want to do, but need a better approach with. If I need more expertise, then I get that, and if it is a warning message telling me to desist, I listen to my instincts. A rejection can be a bump in the road or worse. What happens next is your choice. I vote for learning and coming back even stronger.\n\nIt takes a lot to build a business. There will be more than a few times when you\u2019re just not feeling it. You\u2019ll need to be inspired and motivated to keep going when it feels like nothing is going right. Use each rejection as fire to light you up and motivate you. Every experience in life offers a lesson. Those lessons help you become the best version of yourself. Shift the way you view rejection. Get even more determined to accomplish that goal. Use the rejection as your motivation to continue doing the work. At the end of the day, doing the work consistently is what builds your business and accomplishes your goals.\n\nWho are some of the designers you look up to and why?\n\nOne important person that has inspired me is Mr Ojukwu Onwuzulike, the CEO of Wardrobe Boutique. He\u2019s a great man who has dedicated his whole life to the fashion business and is excelling in it.\n\nWhat should the public expect from you before the year runs out and in the near future?\n\nWe are currently working on total rebranding for the Lekki brand and also working on Abuja branch\n\nHow do you relax?\n\nI hang out with my friends and spend time with my family.\n\nYour favorite holiday destination?\n\nI don\u2019t have one yet as I haven\u2019t been on proper holiday till today.\n\nHow would you describe your fashion style?\n\nVersatile, you can\u2019t predict my style.",

          "text": "From Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure, Joe Effiong, Uyo, Gyang Bere, Jos, Olanrewaju Lawal, Birnin Kebbi\n\nThe Zonal Public Hearing on the review of the 1999 constitution kicked off across the six geopolitical zones, yesterday, with a flurry of demands and proposals.\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, faulted the 1999 constitution, describing it as substandard and product of hurried national compromise.\n\nGbajabiamila said during the zonal public hearing on the review of the 1999 constitution in Lagos, yesterday, that the constitution falls below standards because it was put in place to ensure that the military returned to the barracks.\n\n\u201cA nation\u2019s constitution is the foundation of its existence. It is supposed to set the terms of our nationhood and define who we are in a manner that reflects both our common truths and highest aspirations.\n\n\u201cOur constitution falls short of this standard because the 1999 Constitution is the product of a hurried national compromise that we entered into two decades ago in other to ensure that the military returned to the barracks and that we returned to democratic government.\n\n\u201cIt was always the intention that we will one day as one people and one nation, return to amend this document so that it gives voice to the yearnings of the Nigerian people and sets out in clear details how we intend to achieve the shared ambitions of our nationhood. Providence has cast upon the 9th National Assembly the responsibility to write such a constitution for the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nThe speaker said Nigeria needs a \u201cnear-perfect\u201d constitution to correct the problems confronting the country.\n\n\u201cNo nation in the world has a perfect constitution, but we need a near-perfect constitution in Nigeria and we can achieve that through substantive amendments that significantly alter the character of our nation,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernor of Ondo State, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu advocated the scrapping of the Senate with each zones having equal number of four representatives at the National Assembly.\n\nThis is as Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi state advocated constitutional roles to traditional rulers.\n\nThey spoke separately at the Akure Centre of the Southwest and Bauchi centre of the North East centre.\n\nAkeredolu, represented by his deputy, Mr Lucky Aiyedatiwa, said the country should consider dropping the current bicameral structure of the National Assembly, and adopt unicameral legislature.\n\n\u201cThe membership of the Assembly should be part time. No member should earn allowances not known to the Revenue Mobilisation and Allocation Committee, and the people they claim to serve.\n\n\u201cLegislators should earn under a uniform salary structure. Allowance peculiarities must not be about obscenity. The Senate should be scrapped.\n\n\u201cThe House of Representatives too should not be unwieldy. A maximum of four representatives should come from each Zone,\u201d he said.\n\nAkeredolu also stated that revenue generation and allocation must reflect the extent to which a state participated in the economy.\n\nHe equally called for state police, resource control, judicial reforms, especially with zones having their court of appeals.\n\nAkeredolu concluded by a return to the 1963 Republican Constitution, saying, \u201cWe will have resolved many fundamental issues of nationhood with the adoption.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the Bauchi center hearing, Governor Mohammed recalled that in the old Northern Nigeria, the British made use of them under indirect rule, said in spite of their non-recognition by the constitution, they were directly involved in the maintenance of law and order in their respective domains.\n\n\u201cThere is the need for traditional rulers to be given roles in the constitution, especially in the maintenance of law and order and other relevant areas.\n\n\u201cTaking into cognisance that even now that they are not recognised by the constitution, all the states of the federation depend on them.\n\n\u201cIn Northern Nigeria, when the British came, they used them under indirect rule and I do not know from where we got the wisdom to throw what we have so much in custody by allowing them to be redundant, ineffective, and at the same time putting so much responsibility on them.\n\n\u201cThis is because whenever we have problems, we rush to them, but we have never held them accountable and responsible for the duties we are expecting them to perform.\n\n\u201cWe believe we can give them constitutional responsibility, salary structure and scheme of work , so that they will be able to discharge their responsibilities without forcing them into redundancy or corruption,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Ugwuanyi canvasses Nigeria anchored on justice, fairness, equity, inclusiveness\n\nWhile declaring the exercise open in Enugu, Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi reiterated his administration\u2019s support for unequivocal and unwavering commitment to an egalitarian Nigeria where justice, fairness, equity and inclusiveness shall be functional directive principles of state policy.\n\nThe Enugu centre has Anambra and Ebonyi states. Declaring it open the governor further enjoined all relevant institutions, civil society organizations, stakeholders and the entire Enugu State citizenry \u201cto stand up and be counted in this important national discussion.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his address, Deputy Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Okechukwu, on behalf of the Speaker, Gbajabiamila and the Deputy Speaker and Chairman of the House Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution, Idris Wase, welcomed Ugwuanyi and other participants to the event.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the ongoing exercise, if well harnessed, presents the Nigerian government and people with ample opportunity to find answers to the myriads of pressing challenges facing our nation today.\n\n\u201cOn our part, we assure you that your views will count. Whatever views and memos you submit here today and tomorrow will form part of the working documents and views of the Constitution Review exercise by the 9th Assembly,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Lalong advocates stiffer punishment against constitutional violators\n\nPlateau Governor, Simon Lalong called for stiff penalties against anyone found guilty of abusing the constitution so as to protect its sanctity as the highest instrumental of power and make it the main driver of Nigeria\u2019s democratic journey.\n\nHe observed that beyond amending the constitution, Nigerians must also take greater interest in how the constitution is implemented to avoid abuses that end up creating distortions and leading to agitations for more amendments.\n\n\u201cMy advice to the members of the National Assembly and indeed all Nigerians is to put in place strong safeguards in the new constitution to avoid the abuse of power. The situation where people flagrantly disobey, discard and ignore the provisions of the constitution should no longer be tolerated.\n\n\u201cWe should ensure that those who temper with the provisions of the constitution are seriously punished. No matter how frequently we amend the constitution, there may not be any difference if we fail to subject ourselves to its provisions. As citizens, we are the guardians and defenders of the constitution who can either make it work or fail by our actions or inactions. Nigerians should wake up from their slumber and lethargy by ensuring that they employ all legitimate means to protect the constitution. The days of docility are far gone\u201d.\n\n\u2022Akwa Ibom calls for free education, state police\n\nAkwa Ibom State government advocated making free education and compulsory education from primary to secondary level a constitutional issue in order to ensure that all children benefit from education in their early lives.\n\nGovernor Udom Emmanuel also said states should be allowed to control their resources so that they could develop at their own pace.\n\nEmmanuel who was represented by the secretary to Akwa Ibom State government, Dr. Emmanuel Ekuwem, reasoned that the present high rate of insecurity could be better handled if the constitution makes room for the establishment of state police.\n\nHe, however, said the state believed in one indivisible entity called Nigeria in which everyone\u2019s rights and privileges would be protected and guaranteed.\n\nRivers State Governor Nyesom Wike, who was represented by the state Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Prof. Zaccheaus Adangor, advised members of the committee not waste time in ensuring that the amendment is promptly implemented after collating all submissions and memoranda by the people\n\nWhile lamenting that cost of elections is tremendously expensive, making it difficult for public office holders to do what their communities want, Wike called for an outright drafting of a new constitution where input from every segment of the society would be considered since the present 1999 constitution has outlived its usefulness.\n\n\u2022NLC urges NASS to retain minimum wage in Exclusive List\n\nOn its part, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) appealed to National Assembly not to remove national minimum wage from the Exclusive list.\n\nMr Uchenna Ekwe, head of International Relations Department, Liaison to NASS, NLC, made the appeal in Enugu.\n\nHe said allowing the issues of the minimum wage in the Federal Government\u2019s exclusive list was part of democratic processes. Ekwe noted that those canvassing for its removal were ignorant of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) laws and making a vital mistake.\n\n\u201cThe laws allow issues of national minimum wages be maintained by the Federal Government.\u201d",

He declared June 11 and 12 as national days of prayers for Nigeria to win the war against banditry, killings and kidnappings across the nation. He also demanded immediate and temporary closure of schools in the North West and North East until adequate security is put in place to guarantee the safety of students.\n\nAsefon, who spoke in Ado-Ekiti, yesterday, in an interview with journalists, said insecurity had reached a frightening peak, as students no longer go to school with the guarantee that they would return home safely.\n\nHe decried that barely 24 hours after students of Greenfield University in Kaduna were released by their abductors, about 200 students of Islamiyya School were kidnapped in Rafi Local Government Area of Niger State, in a shocking and bizarre fashion.\n\nHe said incessant and incurable kidnapping of students in the North West and North Central calls for immediate and radical action.\n\n\u201cNANS under my leadership, having considered the continuous threats to the lives of our students and the lukewarm pace of security apparatuses to these nefarious crimes, we regrettably call on government to order immediate and temporary closure of all schools in the North West and North Central until adequate security is put in place.\n\n\u201cGovernment and security apparatuses have failed us, we can no longer trust them.

Those who cannot provide security for Nigeria. Are you seeing the killings everyday now? Are you not worried about this country? Is there any hope that they can offer to this country again?\u201d\n\nWike boasted that unlike APC, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) makes promises and commits to fulfilling them without giving excuses.\n\nAccording to him, his administration was on the first phase of a 45 days project flag-off and commissioning, which he described as unprecedented in the history of the country.\n\n\u201cYou know the difference between us and them is that you can see us everyday, moving from one local government to another. It is either we are flagging-off or commissioning projects. They are not doing so because there\u2019s nothing for them to do. They don\u2019t have anything to show. We started on the 27 of May, 2021, and we will end the first phase on 10 of July, 2021. That\u2019s more than a month of flagging- off or commissioning projects. Who has ever done so in this country? Have we not secured a place already in Guinness Book of records?\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Wike urged Etche people not be indecisive in their resolve to pitch tent with the PDP by delivering more votes to the party that brought development to them.\n\n\u201cNow, we are going to commission Odofur road, but with how many votes, mere seven thousand votes? You need something, but you won\u2019t come out and give the votes. When we make promise, we fulfill it. You too, fulfill your own promise. It should be two ways, the party, PDP and you.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike insisted that the Rivers State University must release more funds and also supervise the contractors handling the construction work at Etche closely.\n\nHe said his administration would not compromise quality work and declared that 40 plots of land would be acquired opposite the campus for the sitting of police station.\n\n\u201cWe want quality job because we are known for quality projects. From now till May, 2022, economy activities will increase here. So, please, Etche people, try and support the contractors to make sure they finish this job.\u201d\n\nPerforming the flag-off, former Vice Chancellor of the University of Port Harcourt, Prof. Don Baridam said Governor Wike was spreading development by siting campuses of the state university in other local government areas.\n\nCommissioner for Education, Prof. Kaniye Ebeku, noted that when Governor Wike first made the pronouncement and followed by the release of N16 billion to ensure that the three campuses are established, most people dismissed it as mere politics.",

          "text": "\u2022Vows attacks on INEC\u2019s assets won\u2019t stop future elections\n\n\u2022Reassures Nigerians no third term ambition\n\nBy Deji Elumoye\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday vowed to deal with those bent on destroying the nation through assaults on public buildings and institutions.\n\nHe also assured Nigerians that despite security challenges facing the country, all future elections will be conducted as scheduled by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nBuhari, while receiving a delegation of INEC, led by its National Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, at the State House, Abuja, committed his administration to providing adequate financial backing for the commission\u2019s operations.\n\nThe INEC delegation came to brief the president on the series of attacks on facilities of the electoral body nationwide.\n\nThe deteriorating security situation in the country also engaged the attention of the National Assembly yesterday with the President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, stressing the need for more legislative interventions to secure Nigerians.\n\nHe added that the Senate was tired of observing one-minute silence for victims of insecurity.\n\nMedia adviser to the president, Mr. Femi Adesina, in a statement issued at the end of the closed-door session with the INEC officials, quoted Buhari as reiterating that he has no intention of staying in office beyond 2023.\n\nOn the dangers posed to future elections by the burning of INEC facilities, the president assured the commission that his administration will do all within its powers to mitigate the effects on the conduct of future polls.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe will do that so that no one would say we don\u2019t want to go, or that we want a third term. There will be no excuse for failure. We\u2019ll meet all INEC\u2019s demands.\u201d\n\nHe, however, warned those bent on destroying the country through promoting insurrection, and burning down critical national assets to back off as a rude shock awaits them soon.\n\n\u201cI receive daily security reports on the attacks, and it is very clear that those behind them want this administration to fail.\n\n\u201cInsecurity in Nigeria is now mentioned all over the world. All the people who want power, whoever they are, you wonder what they really want. Whoever wants the destruction of the system will soon have the shock of their lives. We\u2019ve given them enough time,\u201d he stated.\n\nBuhari recalled that he visited all the 36 states of the country before the 2019 elections, \u201cand majority of the people believed me, and the election proved it.\u201d\n\nHe promised to continue leading the country in accordance with the constitution.\n\nAccording to him, those misbehaving in certain parts of the country are too young to know the travails and loss of lives that attended the Nigerian civil war.\n\nHe added: \u201cThose of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand. We are going to be very hard sooner than later.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the service chiefs and the Inspector General of Police have been changed, \u201cand we will demand security from them.\u201d\n\nShedding more light on his meeting with the INEC officials via his official Twitter handle, Buhari tweeted: \u201cI received a briefing today from the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, on the series of attacks on their facilities nationwide. These attacks are totally unacceptable, and we will not allow those behind them to achieve their evil objectives.\n\n\u201cI have assured INEC that we will make available to them everything they need to operate efficiently, so that no one will say we don\u2019t want to go, or that we want a third term. There will be no excuse for failure. We will meet all of INEC\u2019s demands.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Yakubu had said so far, 42 cases of attacks on INEC offices nationwide had been recorded, since the 2019 general election.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe 42 incidents so far occurred in 14 states of the federation for a variety of reasons\u2026.Most of the attacks happened in the last seven months, and they are unrelated to protest against previous elections. \u201cFrom the pattern and frequency of the most recent attacks, they appear to be targeted at future elections. The intention is to incapacitate the commission, undermine the nation\u2019s democracy and precipitate a national crisis.\u201d\n\nLawan Seeks More Legislative Interventions to Secure Nigerians\n\nMeanwhile, the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, has stressed the need for more legislative interventions to secure Nigerians.\n\nHe stated yesterday that that the lawmakers were tired of observing one-minute silence for the victims of insecurity.\n\nThe Senate also expressed concern about the frequency of the one-minute silence usually observed at its plenary as a result of deaths associated with security challenges facing the nation.\n\nSo far, it has observed one-minute silence six times in recent times for those who lost their lives through killings and murders in the wake of security issues across the country.\n\nLawan, at yesterday\u2019s plenary, said: \u201cLet me observe that we have observed about six one-minute silence and most of it was to pray for the repose of the souls of Nigerians who were murdered or killed by criminals.\u201d\n\nHe called for the intensification of legislative interventions by the National Assembly to protect Nigerians from the heightening insecurity in the country.\n\nAccording to him, it is imperative for the National Assembly to step up legislative interventions to reduce the number of deaths caused by criminal activities.\n\nHe added that such interventions would be backed by collaborative efforts among the legislature, executive and Nigerians to address the security challenges.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is very important that we step up our legislative intervention in ensuring that we protect the lives and properties of Nigerians to reduce the incidence of one-minute silence.\n\n\u201cI believe that the Senate and, indeed, the National Assembly, working together with the executive and getting the support of Nigerians, we can bring the much needed succour to our people, and that is why we are here.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Sultan seeks immunity clause removal, role for monarchs\n\n\u2022Akeredolu wants Senate scrapped\n\nSegun James in Lagos, Christopher Isiguzo and Gideon Arinze in Enugu, Seriki Adinoyi in Jos, James Sowole in Akure and Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi\n\nThe clamour for federalism, local government autonomy, community policing and devolution of power dominated the nationwide public hearings conducted yesterday by the House of Representatives Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nHowever, while the Sultan of Sokoto and President-General of the Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, called for the removal of the immunity clause in the constitution, the Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu , advocated the scrapping of the Senate to make the federal legislature unicameral, as one of the ways of reducing the cost of governance.\n\nPlateau, Benue and Nasarawa states have also unanimously demanded devolution of power in a manner that the states will be given more powers and finance considering their enormous responsibilities.\n\nAt Akure, one of the two venues of the public hearing for the South-west zone, Akeredolu said devolution of powers, true federalism, state police, among others, as presented last week to the Senate Committee on Constitutional Review were germane in restructuring the country.\n\nAkeredolu, who was represented by his deputy, Mr. Lucky Ayedatiwa, also advocated that membership of the National Assembly should be part-time.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe membership of the (National) Assembly should be part time. No member should earn allowances not known to the Revenue Mobilisation and Allocation Committee and, more importantly, people they claim to serve.\n\n\u201cLegislators should earn under a uniform salary structure. Allowance peculiarities must not be about obscenity. The Senate should be scrapped. The House of Representatives too should not be unwieldly. A maximum of four representatives should come from each zone.\u201d\n\nThe governor also advocated the decentralisation of the Supreme Court.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Supreme Court should be decentralised to ease the current burden of the appellate court.\n\n\u201cIn a true federal state, there should be a Supreme Court whose decisions are final in residual matters. The Supreme Court at the centre should concern itself mainly with issues bordering on constitutional interpretations and matters arising between and among the states and the federal government, as well as revenue generation by the federal government. It should also administer the National Judicial Council.\u201d\n\nIn Bauchi, the state Governor, Senator Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed, stated that Nigeria needed a workable and acceptable constitution to serve the interests of the people.\n\nSuch a document, he added, should allow for true federalism where Nigeria states are autonomous entities with power to run their affairs.\n\nThe governor also appealed to the House Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution to look into the various agitations of the state and reflect them in its report.\n\nAccording to him, the participatory approach by the National Assembly in the amendment of the constitution is expected to produce a people\u2019s constitution that will address the social-economic problems in the country.\n\nHe added that Nigeria must break from the command structure imposed on the country by the defunct military government, which concentrated enormous power at the centre as manifested in the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe constituent units of the Nigerian federation represented by the current 36 states, the FCT and the 774 local government areas are near to the people that must be given enough powers with resources in order to positively impact the lives of the people at the grassroots,\u201d he stated.\n\nIn Lagos State, the Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, restated his calls for a special economic status for the state owing to its status and the economic epicentre of the nation and the burdens it bears.\n\nHe said at the South-west zonal public hearing that the continuous request for a special status for the state was by no means a selfish one, but stemmed from the interest of every Nigerian in the state.\n\nHe stated that progress and prosperity of Nigeria as a nation is linked to that of Lagos State.\n\nEarlier, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, while urging Nigerians to take the ongoing constitutional amendment seriously, had said the process of review and amendment would give the nation a near perfect constitution.\n\nHe expressed optimism that such a new constitution will resolve the issue of \u201cidentity, political structure, human rights, administration of government, resource control, national security and so much else that has made our nation fragile and that has hindered our progress and prosperity.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe 1999 Constitution is as a result of a hurried national compromise that Nigeria entered into two decades ago, just to allow the military vacate the political scene and return to the barracks. It has always been our intention that one day, as one people, we will return to amend this document to give voice to the yearning of the Nigerian people\u201d.\n\nIn Enugu, the Governor, Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, reiterated his administration\u2019s unwavering commitment to an egalitarian Nigeria where justice, fairness, equity and inclusiveness shall be functional directive principles of state policy.\n\nThe governor had declared the state government\u2019s support for amending the constitution to enhance the nation\u2019s quest for unity and prosperity \u201cin an environment where justice, fairness and equity shall prevail.\u201d\n\nDeclaring open the South-east zonal public hearing in Enugu, the governor enjoined all institutions, civil society organisations, stakeholders and the entire Enugu State citizenry \u201cto stand up and be counted in this important national discussion.\u201d\n\nWomen groups, organisations and labour unions made varying submissions on how to improve the constitution.\n\nLabour unions demanded autonomy for local government, the legislature and the judiciary for improved service delivery, autonomy.\n\nAlso, women groups called for gender parity and inclusion to allow women to participate actively in governance and decision-making.\n\nSultan Seeks Removal of Immunity Clause\n\nOn his part, the Sultan of Sokoto and President-General of the Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, called for the removal of the immunity clause in the constitution, saying it will compel leaders to live up to their responsibilities.\n\nHe also advocated a constitutional role for traditional rulers, saying it was time Nigerians talk frankly on how they want the country managed.\n\nAddressing stakeholders at the Kebbi zonal hearing comprising Kebbi, Sokoto and Zamfara States, the sultan attributed the crisis in the country to the relegation of traditional rulers as they were given no constitutional role to play.\n\nHe said before the Nigerian nation came into being in 1914, the traditional institution had existed.\n\nHe said: \u201cOne of the controversial issues, which I feel strongly about is the immunity clause. When you are immune, nobody can take you to court as a leader and it means that you can do whatever you want to do. You can claim to be God.\n\n\u201cBut when that immunity is removed and you are made to live in a society where people are taken to court for abuse of office, I think our leaders here will wake up. Let us see how to tinker with that immunity clause.\n\n\u201cWill it be better to give immunity to a few people or remove the immunity so that all of us will be equal? It is another food for thought. So, please don\u2019t hold back, speak your mind on how you want this country to move on.\u201d\n\nPlateau, Benue, Nasarawa Demand Devolution of Power, Single Tenure for Presidents.\n\nMeanwhile, Plateau, Benue, and Nasarawa states have unanimously demanded devolution of power in a manner that the states will be given more powers and finance considering their enormous responsibilities.\n\nThey also requested that the state governors, as the chief security officers of their states, be given the powers to control the police in their states to enhance quick and rapid response to crisis and crime.\n\nThey decried the situation where a state police command has to get clearance from Abuja to respond to crisis in its domain.\n\nPresenting their memoranda at the North-central zonal public hearing in Jos, the three states also advocated a single tenure of five years for the president.\n\nPresenting the position of Benue State, representative of the governor, and Speaker of the Benue State House of Assembly, Hon. Titus Ugba, urged the National Assembly to grant the demands of people seeking creation of additional states.\n\nPlateau State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Chrisantus Ahmedu, and his Nasarawa State counterpart, Abdulkareem Kana, who toed the same line with Ugba on most of their demands, added that the three tiers of government could be reduced to two; comprising only the federal and state governments, such that states are given the resources to cater for the local governments.\n\nEarlier, while addressing the audience, Plateau State Governor, Hon. Simon Lalong, had urged Nigerians to be bold, sincere and patriotic in their submissions to the constitution review panel in their quest for a greater nation.\n\nLalong stated that the much-talked about restructuring will be considered to ensure that the agitations and anxieties being expressed are addressed.\n\nAccording to him, there are high expectations that this particular exercise will not go the way of previous ones which failed to address some key issues affecting the governance of the nation, leading to further agitations that are growing and in some way threatening peace, security and unity of the country.\n\n\u201cI therefore appeal to members of this special committee and Nigerians presenting memoranda at this public hearing to see this exercise as a very important duty which presents another opportunity for us to build a Nigeria that we desire to see. We should take advantage of the platform to ventilate and make submissions as to what we want injected or removed from the 1999 Constitution to make it more people -centred,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Oil Price Hits 30-month High on OPEC\u2019s Demand Rally Forecast",
          "text": "\u2022Nigeria\u2019s July production pegged at 1.579m bpd\n\nBy Emmanuel Addeh\n\nCrude oil prices yesterday climbed to the highest point in more than two-and-a-half years, after the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies known as OPEC+ forecast a tightening global market.\n\nBrent crude, Nigeria\u2019s oil benchmark, crossed the much-awaited $70 mark, hitting $71.33 at a point. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rose as much as 3.8 per cent to $68.87 a barrel, a level it has failed to hold for a sustained period since 2018.\n\nHowever, the climbing oil price could worsen Nigeria\u2019s fiscal crisis as it portends the federal government spending more to keep the pump price of petrol stable at the current N162-N165 price band in view of the non-conclusion of talks with labour and other stakeholders on the need to float petrol cost in conformity with the policy on the deregulation of the downstream sector.\n\nThe new price levels were driven by expectations of growing fuel demand during the summer driving season in the United States as OPEC+ agreed to boost output and strong usage indications coming from China.\n\nOPEC+ also collectively agreed to continue a slow easing of supply curbs at its virtual meeting yesterday, coordinated from Vienna, as producers balanced an expected demand recovery against a possible increase in Iranian output.\n\nThe cartel, according to information garnered from the meeting, pegged Nigeria\u2019s July\u2019s reference production at 1.829million bpd, the country\u2019s adjustment was put at 250,000 bpd, while required output for the month is expected to be 1.579 million bpd.\n\nOPEC+ decided in April to return 2.1 million barrels per day (bpd) of supply to the market from May to July, anticipating rising global demand despite the high number of coronavirus cases in India, the world\u2019s third-largest oil consumer.\n\nTraders also continue to follow the progress of negotiations between Tehran and world powers to revive the 2015 nuclear agreement, paving the way for increased oil supplies from Iran.\n\nAt the meeting, OPEC+ stuck to its plan to hike oil output in July, pressing ahead with an increase of 841,000 barrels a day in July, following hikes in May and June.\n\n\u201cThe demand picture has shown clear signs of improvement,\u201d Saudi Energy Minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, said as the ministerial meeting started. His Russian counterpart, Alexander Novak, also spoke of the \u201cgradual economic recovery.\n\nIf OPEC+ stays on course, and Iran oil\u2019s comeback is delayed, that should get WTI oil solidly above $70 a barrel, while Brent which has already exceeded $70 may then try to establish contact with the $75 region.\n\nThe surge was hovering at a level not seen since 2018 as August Brent contract rose earlier by $1.82, or 2.6 per cent, to $71.14 a barrel, a level not seen since November 2018 when measured on a continuous basis.\n\nOPEC Secretary-General, Dr Sanusi Barkindo, who spoke at the 30th Meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC), said latest projections showed Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 5.5 per cent in 2021, up from 5.4 per cent at the last meeting.\n\nHe stated that the projections for oil are largely unchanged from last month, as demand is expected to grow by 6 mb/d to around 96.5 mb/d on average for the year, an increase of 6.6 per cent.\n\nHe stated that the market outlook for later this year looks especially promising, while anticipating that demand will surpass 99 mb/d in the fourth quarter, which would put OPEC back in the range of pre-pandemic levels.\n\nBarkindo, who warned against complacency, stated that non-OPEC liquids production is now forecast to grow at a slightly slower pace than expected last month, rising by around 700,000 b/d in 2021 to an average of 63.6 mb/d.\n\nAccording to him, the actions of the Declaration of Cooperation (DOC) have continued to support the rebalancing process, and have helped reduce the global supply by more than 2.9 billion barrels since May 2020.\n\n\u201cHowever, there continues to be significant overproduction by some of the participating countries. The overproduced volumes need to be accommodated to achieve the goals we have set for ourselves.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, the 15th OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meeting agreed to extend the very generous compensation period for overproduced volumes until the end of September 2021.\n\n\u201cOur continued contributions to sustainable oil market stability depend upon all participants achieving 100 per cent conformity and, where necessary, working dutifully to compensate for overproduction,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, the meeting welcomed the positive performance of participating countries in the DoC, as overall conformity to the production adjustments was 114 per cent in April.\n\n\u201cIn view of current oil market fundamentals and the consensus on its outlook, the meeting reconfirmed the existing commitment of the 10th OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meeting in April 2020, amended in June, September, and December 2020, as well as in January and April 2021.\n\n\u201cThe agreement was to gradually return two million barrels a day (mb/d) of the adjustments to the market, with the pace being determined according to market conditions,\u201d OPEC stated in a release after the meeting.\n\nIt noted that compensation plans should be submitted in accordance with the statement of the 15th OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meeting and reconfirmed the decision on production adjustments for July as well as schedule its next meeting for July 1.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Eight Abductions That Shook Nigeria",
          "text": "The abduction of Nigerians by armed gunmen has worsened the problem of insecurity in the country. Though, it happens all over Nigeria, the Northern part of country still remains a hotbed of kidnappings by terrorists and bandits.\n\n\n\nWhile some of the victims of these abductions have lost their lives in the process, many regained their freedom through the intervention of the security agents or the payment of ransoms by family members.\n\n\n\nHowever, abduction of schoolchildren is on the rise, and here are eight major cases of kidnapping of pupils and students that have happened in Nigeria;\n\nAbducted Dapchi girls\n\n\n\n276 schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram in Chibok, Borno in April 2014\n\n\n\nOn the night of April 14, 2014, when the Senior Secondary Certificate Examination was ongoing, the deadly Boko Haram terrorists invaded Government Girls\u2019 Secondary School in Chibok town of Borno State and kidnapped 247 girls aged 16 to 18 in their dormitories.\n\n\n\nThe ugly incident was greeted by rage and criticism from local scene and the international community, while some political analysts said it was aimed at bringing down the government of the then President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\n\n\nThis brought about a movement of #BringBackOurGirls protest in Nigeria spearheaded by a former Education Minister, Oby Ezekwesili. The former first lady of the United States, Michelle Obama supported the movement by tweeting about it.\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian Armed Forces in their persistent efforts have rescued close to 100 of them. 57 of them escaped immediately after the attack, as they jumped from the trucks conveying them to the terrorist den. And till date, over 100 of the Chibok girls are still missing.\n\n\n\n\n\n110 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram in Dapchi, Yobe in February 2018\n\n\n\nBoko Haram terrorists carried out their second abduction of schoolgirls in Nigeria on February 19, 2018 in the evening at the Government Girls\u2019 Science and Technical College in Dapchi, Yobe State. They carted away 110 girls between the ages of 11 and 19 around 5:30 pm that day.\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian government tasked the nation\u2019s security agencies to find the girls. The Nigerian Air Force and Nigeria Army deployed their men to search for them, but all to no avail.\n\n\n\nHowever, the terrorist group released 104 girls in March of that same year after a purported negotiation was reached with the Nigerian government. There were reports that five of them died on the day of the abduction.

          "text": "The abduction of Nigerians by armed gunmen has worsened the problem of insecurity in the country. Though, it happens all over Nigeria, the Northern part of country still remains a hotbed of kidnappings by terrorists and bandits.\n\n\n\nWhile some of the victims of these abductions have lost their lives in the process, many regained their freedom through the intervention of the security agents or the payment of ransoms by family members.\n\n\n\nHowever, abduction of schoolchildren is on the rise, and here are eight major cases of kidnapping of pupils and students that have happened in Nigeria;\n\nAbducted Dapchi girls\n\n\n\n276 schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram in Chibok, Borno in April 2014\n\n\n\nOn the night of April 14, 2014, when the Senior Secondary Certificate Examination was ongoing, the deadly Boko Haram terrorists invaded Government Girls\u2019 Secondary School in Chibok town of Borno State and kidnapped 247 girls aged 16 to 18 in their dormitories.\n\n\n\nThe ugly incident was greeted by rage and criticism from local scene and the international community, while some political analysts said it was aimed at bringing down the government of the then President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\n\n\nThis brought about a movement of #BringBackOurGirls protest in Nigeria spearheaded by a former Education Minister, Oby Ezekwesili. The former first lady of the United States, Michelle Obama supported the movement by tweeting about it.\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian Armed Forces in their persistent efforts have rescued close to 100 of them. 57 of them escaped immediately after the attack, as they jumped from the trucks conveying them to the terrorist den. And till date, over 100 of the Chibok girls are still missing.\n\n\n\n\n\n110 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram in Dapchi, Yobe in February 2018\n\n\n\nBoko Haram terrorists carried out their second abduction of schoolgirls in Nigeria on February 19, 2018 in the evening at the Government Girls\u2019 Science and Technical College in Dapchi, Yobe State. They carted away 110 girls between the ages of 11 and 19 around 5:30 pm that day.\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian government tasked the nation\u2019s security agencies to find the girls. The Nigerian Air Force and Nigeria Army deployed their men to search for them, but all to no avail.\n\n\n\nHowever, the terrorist group released 104 girls in March of that same year after a purported negotiation was reached with the Nigerian government. There were reports that five of them died on the day of the abduction. One girl, Leah Sharibu was not released by Boko Haram under the claims that she refused to renounce her Christian faith.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver 300 schoolboys abducted in Kankara, Katsina in December 2020\n\n\n\nA gang of gunmen suspected to be bandits with links to Boko Haram terrorists attacked the Government Science Secondary School, Kankara in Katsina State to Abduct over 300 boys on December 11, 2020.

          "text": "New information available to SaharaReporters shows how the suspended Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Ms. Hadiza Bala-Usman, lied to her superiors and sabotaged the plan by the Nigerian government to decongest Lagos ports by dredging the Calabar Port.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Usman lied to Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), and the Senate about the recommendations of a committee she had set up to investigate the dredging project at the Calabar Port.\n\nHadiza Bala Usman\n\nHer lies have cost Nigeria lives, billions of naira and jobs as Nigeria continues to rely on Lagos ports with its attendant congestion and other problems, it was also gathered.\n\nFor instance, widespread congestion at the Lagos ports costs Nigeria $55 million (about N20.8 billion) daily, according to a 2020 report by Dynanmar, a Dutch consultancy firm.\n\nAccording to sources in the industry, Usman consistently lied to Osinbajo, Chairman of the Presidential Task Team on the Apapa gridlock, tasked with the job of decongesting the Lagos ports, that dredging the Calabar Port was not viable.\n\nThe project is under Calabar Channel Management, a joint venture operation between a consortium led by Niger Global Engineering and Technical Company Limited and the Nigerian Ports Authority.\n\nFollowing allegations that money was paid for dredging at Calabar Port with nothing to show for it, Usman set up a committee to investigate three allegations: One, that Niger Global Engineering and Technical Company Limited did not follow due process in carrying out the job; two, that dredging Calabar Ports is not viable and must not be done; and three, that work was not done on the site by the company.\n\nThe report of the committee along with other documents sighted by SaharaReporters indeed prove that work had commenced at Calabar Port and that it was viable, but Usman ignored the report of the committee and insisted that the job must be stopped.\n\nSources privy to the issue said Usman took the position because he wanted the job for her cronies and not a neutral company.\n\nOne of the sources privy to the committee\u2019s report said, \u201cShe (Hadiza Bala-Usman) has been hiding the truth. The job was suspended after President Muhammadu Buhari came in. There were allegations that money was paid and that the job was not done. Then she set up a committee.\n\n\u201cThe vice president has been in charge of how they can reduce traffic in Lagos so he put pressure on her and she said she would set up a committee to make recommendations. She was in London, UK when the report came out but said nobody should sign the report.\n\n\u201cLater, she granted interviews to newspapers, saying the committee indicted the company (Niger Global Engineering and Technical Company Limited), which was totally a lie. Her lies have cost the country so much money because dredging the Calabar Port would have decongested Lagos ports. It would have made more money for the government and created many jobs.\n\n\u201cThe committee members; we said we had to sign it. Later she said we should sign. But when Osinbajo and the Senate asked about it, she said the job should not continue, contrary to what is in the report. She told the Vice President that dredging should not be done because it was not viable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe confirmed the first (that Niger Global followed due process) and we hired a consultant from Switzerland to find out if work had been done and they showed work had been done. Nigerian Navy also wrote that they provided security for the dredger at the time it was working.\n\n\u201cThe Swiss company is called Coastal And Reclamation Engineering Services, popularly referred to as CARES. This company is being appointed by the NPA to regularly audit the three channel management namely; Lagos Channel Management (LCM), Bonny Channel Management (BCM) and Calabar Channel Management (CCM). Payments of work done can only be made to contractors after CARES audited the job and confirmed that work was done.\n\n\u201cThe company also confirmed that work had started there but she hid the truth and refused to share the content of the report with the Ministry of Transportation. And not dredging the Calabar Port is costing Nigeria a lot in terms of money and jobs for the teeming population.\n\n\u201cUsman mischievously questioned the work of its one hired Auditors (CARES) on Calabar channel management but at the same time accepted and made payments to LCM and BCM on the advice of the same auditor. She wanted to give the job to her cronies and consistently lied to the Vice President, AGF and the Senate.\n\n\u201cNobody except the members knows the content of the committee\u2019s report, not the Vice President or even the Ministry of Transportation or the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi. She is interested in taking the job and giving it to her cronies,\u201d another source said.\n\nSaharaReporters sighted the report of the committee set up to review the activities of Calabar Channel Management Limited done in November 2016.\n\nThe committee members are listed as: Prof Idris Abubakar, Executive Director, E&TS; Engr. Peter Obinomen, General Manager, Capital Projects; Engr. A. R. Mohammed, General Manager, PP&D; Engr. A. A. Jatto, General Manager, Engineering Maintenance; A. A. Ningi, General Manager, Audit; Nana Yakubu, Assistant General Manager, Legal; Surveyor O. Omotoso, Assistant General Manager, Hydro; Engr M. U. Isa, Principal Manager, BD&JV.\n\nThe committee\u2019s terms of reference were stated thus: \u201cto carry out a holistic review of the Joint Venture Agreement between the NPA and Niger Global, to examine the request for payments by Niger Global received vide letter ref. T0160/S107/IXA/205 dated 15th August, 2016 from the office of the Minister of Transportation, to examine the operational and administrative effectiveness of CCM, to make appropriate recommendations to management.\u201d\n\nThe recommendations of the committee among others as stated in the document say, \u201cHaving verified volumes dredged, all outstanding payments due to CCML should be effected in line with the provisions of the JV Agreement.\n\n\u201cThat in view of the subsisting presidential approval for the JV, CCML be allowed to continue with its operation but at a reduced scale to be determined by the authority\u2019s need and CCML\u2019s Board Technical and Finance Committees.\n\n\u201cThat henceforth, a multi-disciplinary project management team made of civil engineers, surveyors, hydrographers be appointed with definite responsibility to manage the dredging activities of all the channel management companies (LCM, BCC &CCML).\u201d\n\nHowever, in a letter she wrote to the Minister of Justice, Malami, the suspended NPA MD said the contractor connived with the consultant and lied to the NPA that work was done. She also lied to the minister that no key officer of the NPA such as Port Harbour Master and Port Hydrographer agreed that any work was done.\n\nThe letter dated June 5, 2018 and received by the ministry on June 8, 2018 was signed by I.G. Umar, Assistant General Manager, Board, for NPA Managing Director.\n\nThe letter was titled \u2018Re: Execution Summary of the Entire Argument Surrounding the Calabar Channel Management Contract at the Truth Verifiably Documentary Evidence\u2019.\n\nPart of Usman\u2019s letter to Malami read: \u201cThe committee found amongst others; that the Harbour Master and Port Hydrographer (two key officers) who should be involved in the dredging exercise denied that any dredging activities took place within the period claimed by Niger Global, the ship movement of the dredgers MV Atlantico, MV Hurricane and MV Waterway could not be substantiated by the Calabar port, the pre and post comparison of the depth of the channel with a survey carried out six months before the dredging exercise revealed that the alleged dredging of the areas of the channel was questionable.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, this same consultant is having a valid contact with the NPA and it is the same consultant that is confirming work of both Bonny and Lagos channel managements and the same MD is making payment to these companies on the basis of confirmation of work by the same consultant she\u2019s accusing of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThe second big lie she told the minister is that no any key officer of the NPA such as Port Harbour Master and Port Hydrographer agreed that any work was done,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nBut the report of the committee shows that Port Hydrographer, a key officer of the NPA, was a member of the technical committee and signed under a report which confirmed that work was done.\n\nA letter from the Nigerian Navy dated July 2017 with ref VT: 015/73/200/Vol.IV/70, made available to SaharaReporters also showed the suspended NPA MD was hiding the true state of things.\n\nThe letter, addressed to the Managing Director, Calabar Channel Management Company, was titled, \u2018Provision of Security Services to the Dredging Company for Calabar Channel for the period 20 November, 2014 to 15 January, 2015\u2019.\n\nIt says, \u201cThis is to confirm that the Nigerian Navy through NNS VICTORY Calabar provided all the security services to the personnel and equipment of Calabar Channel Management Company for the successful execution of dredging exercise. The operation was hitch-free based on our assessment hence there was no security breach during the period.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the moment, nobody including the minister (Amaechi) and the President is aware of the true outcome of that committee report because she refused to let them have a copy of the report and she only keeps telling them and Nigerians that the committee report indicted the contractor.\n\n\u201cShe has granted many interviews in which she told lies about the whole contract. She\u2019s a pathological liar and always knows how to get away with all this. Her arrogance and disregard for working ethics have cost Nigeria a lot and still cost Nigeria hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue. She is the reason why Calabar Port has not been dredged and Lagos ports decongested,\u201d added one of the sources.\n\nDocuments by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nCalabar Channel_Committee Review Signed Copy by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nCalabar Port Update Post Privatization Monitoring by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nJoint Confirmatory Survey by Sahara Reporters on Scribd",

Then she set up a committee.\n\n\u201cThe vice president has been in charge of how they can reduce traffic in Lagos so he put pressure on her and she said she would set up a committee to make recommendations. She was in London, UK when the report came out but said nobody should sign the report.\n\n\u201cLater, she granted interviews to newspapers, saying the committee indicted the company (Niger Global Engineering and Technical Company Limited), which was totally a lie. Her lies have cost the country so much money because dredging the Calabar Port would have decongested Lagos ports. It would have made more money for the government and created many jobs.\n\n\u201cThe committee members; we said we had to sign it. Later she said we should sign. But when Osinbajo and the Senate asked about it, she said the job should not continue, contrary to what is in the report. She told the Vice President that dredging should not be done because it was not viable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe confirmed the first (that Niger Global followed due process) and we hired a consultant from Switzerland to find out if work had been done and they showed work had been done. Nigerian Navy also wrote that they provided security for the dredger at the time it was working.\n\n\u201cThe Swiss company is called Coastal And Reclamation Engineering Services, popularly referred to as CARES. This company is being appointed by the NPA to regularly audit the three channel management namely; Lagos Channel Management (LCM), Bonny Channel Management (BCM) and Calabar Channel Management (CCM). Payments of work done can only be made to contractors after CARES audited the job and confirmed that work was done.\n\n\u201cThe company also confirmed that work had started there but she hid the truth and refused to share the content of the report with the Ministry of Transportation. And not dredging the Calabar Port is costing Nigeria a lot in terms of money and jobs for the teeming population.\n\n\u201cUsman mischievously questioned the work of its one hired Auditors (CARES) on Calabar channel management but at the same time accepted and made payments to LCM and BCM on the advice of the same auditor. She wanted to give the job to her cronies and consistently lied to the Vice President, AGF and the Senate.\n\n\u201cNobody except the members knows the content of the committee\u2019s report, not the Vice President or even the Ministry of Transportation or the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi. She is interested in taking the job and giving it to her cronies,\u201d another source said.\n\nSaharaReporters sighted the report of the committee set up to review the activities of Calabar Channel Management Limited done in November 2016.\n\nThe committee members are listed as: Prof Idris Abubakar, Executive Director, E&TS; Engr. Peter Obinomen, General Manager, Capital Projects; Engr. A. R. Mohammed, General Manager, PP&D; Engr. A. A. Jatto, General Manager, Engineering Maintenance; A. A. Ningi, General Manager, Audit; Nana Yakubu, Assistant General Manager, Legal; Surveyor O. Omotoso, Assistant General Manager, Hydro; Engr M. U. Isa, Principal Manager, BD&JV.\n\nThe committee\u2019s terms of reference were stated thus: \u201cto carry out a holistic review of the Joint Venture Agreement between the NPA and Niger Global, to examine the request for payments by Niger Global received vide letter ref. T0160/S107/IXA/205 dated 15th August, 2016 from the office of the Minister of Transportation, to examine the operational and administrative effectiveness of CCM, to make appropriate recommendations to management.\u201d\n\nThe recommendations of the committee among others as stated in the document say, \u201cHaving verified volumes dredged, all outstanding payments due to CCML should be effected in line with the provisions of the JV Agreement.\n\n\u201cThat in view of the subsisting presidential approval for the JV, CCML be allowed to continue with its operation but at a reduced scale to be determined by the authority\u2019s need and CCML\u2019s Board Technical and Finance Committees.\n\n\u201cThat henceforth, a multi-disciplinary project management team made of civil engineers, surveyors, hydrographers be appointed with definite responsibility to manage the dredging activities of all the channel management companies (LCM, BCC &CCML).\u201d\n\nHowever, in a letter she wrote to the Minister of Justice, Malami, the suspended NPA MD said the contractor connived with the consultant and lied to the NPA that work was done. She also lied to the minister that no key officer of the NPA such as Port Harbour Master and Port Hydrographer agreed that any work was done.\n\nThe letter dated June 5, 2018 and received by the ministry on June 8, 2018 was signed by I.G. Umar, Assistant General Manager, Board, for NPA Managing Director.\n\nThe letter was titled \u2018Re: Execution Summary of the Entire Argument Surrounding the Calabar Channel Management Contract at the Truth Verifiably Documentary Evidence\u2019.\n\nPart of Usman\u2019s letter to Malami read: \u201cThe committee found amongst others; that the Harbour Master and Port Hydrographer (two key officers) who should be involved in the dredging exercise denied that any dredging activities took place within the period claimed by Niger Global, the ship movement of the dredgers MV Atlantico, MV Hurricane and MV Waterway could not be substantiated by the Calabar port, the pre and post comparison of the depth of the channel with a survey carried out six months before the dredging exercise revealed that the alleged dredging of the areas of the channel was questionable.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, this same consultant is having a valid contact with the NPA and it is the same consultant that is confirming work of both Bonny and Lagos channel managements and the same MD is making payment to these companies on the basis of confirmation of work by the same consultant she\u2019s accusing of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThe second big lie she told the minister is that no any key officer of the NPA such as Port Harbour Master and Port Hydrographer agreed that any work was done,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\nBut the report of the committee shows that Port Hydrographer, a key officer of the NPA, was a member of the technical committee and signed under a report which confirmed that work was done.\n\nA letter from the Nigerian Navy dated July 2017 with ref VT: 015/73/200/Vol.IV/70, made available to SaharaReporters also showed the suspended NPA MD was hiding the true state of things.\n\nThe letter, addressed to the Managing Director, Calabar Channel Management Company, was titled, \u2018Provision of Security Services to the Dredging Company for Calabar Channel for the period 20 November, 2014 to 15 January, 2015\u2019.\n\nIt says, \u201cThis is to confirm that the Nigerian Navy through NNS VICTORY Calabar provided all the security services to the personnel and equipment of Calabar Channel Management Company for the successful execution of dredging exercise. The operation was hitch-free based on our assessment hence there was no security breach during the period.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the moment, nobody including the minister (Amaechi) and the President is aware of the true outcome of that committee report because she refused to let them have a copy of the report and she only keeps telling them and Nigerians that the committee report indicted the contractor.\n\n\u201cShe has granted many interviews in which she told lies about the whole contract. She\u2019s a pathological liar and always knows how to get away with all this. Her arrogance and disregard for working ethics have cost Nigeria a lot and still cost Nigeria hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue. She is the reason why Calabar Port has not been dredged and Lagos ports decongested,\u201d added one of the sources.\n\nDocuments by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nCalabar Channel_Committee Review Signed Copy by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nCalabar Port Update Post Privatization Monitoring by Sahara Reporters on Scribd\n\nJoint Confirmatory Survey by Sahara Reporters on Scribd",

          "title": "Sawari Ventures is leading investments in North Africa",
          "text": "From a fresh and relatable perspective, the Ask an Investor series focuses on investors in Africa \u2014 Investment Banks, sovereign wealth funds, Private Equities, Venture Capitalists and every other class of investors, explaining why and how these investments happen by talking to the people who make them happen.\n\nBefore co-founding Almentor, Ihab Fikry wore three hats. He was a management professor, author of bestsellers on management (mainly in Arabic) and a multinational expatriate at companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers and Exxon Mobil.\n\nThen he decided to quit it all to start sharing his knowledge via different mediums \u2013 television, newspapers, and YouTube.\n\nWhile he was doing this, he saw it as an opportunity to give back to the community until May 2015 when the news of Microsoft acquiring Lynda.com for $1.5 billion caught his attention. He spent the next 12 months learning about video-based learning. He was certain there was a business case for the video content he was putting out on YouTube.\n\nIn June 2016, he partnered with co-founders who worked for Google, Microsoft and other multinationals to start Almentor, a video-based online learning platform for the Middle East and North Africa. They started with a seed round of $3.5m.\n\nThe initial plan was to generate $10,000 in sales just to validate the business idea but they ended up making $300,000 in sales that year.\n\nIn 2019, they crossed the $1 million revenue line and raised the next funding round \u2013 Series A. Almentor\u2019s Series A round was led by Sawari ventures.\n\nIn today\u2019s edition of Ask an Investor I talk to one of the oldest venture capital firms in the Middle East and North Africa \u2013 Sawari Ventures.\n\nFikry pointed out that Sawari Ventures helped Almentor in three critical areas: Governance, networking with the ecosystem and technical support.\n\nSawari Ventures helped them put structures that enable the company to last for decades. It also helped with meeting relevant people in the ecosystem and provided good technical support and advice.\n\nI talk to Tamer Azer, a principal at Sawari Ventures; he joined the firm in 2019. One of the first things he pointed out to me early in our initial email exchange was that he had done an Ask an Investor series before. His own version was a free-flowing conversation with people interested in learning about how investors make decisions and the differences between concepts like equity and convertible notes.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: Tell me about Sawari Ventures\n\nTamer Azer: Sawari ventures has been around since 2010. It was founded by three partners \u2013 Ahmed El Alfi, Hany Al-Sonbaty and Wael Amin. They\u2019re also the founders of Flat6Labs \u2013 the MENA region\u2019s largest accelerator. Sawari Ventures is also a limited partner in Flat6Labs Cairo and Flat6Labs Tunis. We invest in companies anywhere from a million to $3 million per ticket and up to $5 million for the life of the company, across Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco. We\u2019re fairly sector-agnostic. We most definitely look for companies who have a very clear product-market fit and are doing something really innovative and meaningful.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the premise behind the investments you make?\n\nTA: There\u2019s an argument to be made that the tech entrepreneurship ecosystem in Egypt became a lot more attractive after the Arab Spring when a lot of people found their sense of purpose and sense of independence.\n\nIt\u2019s picking up a lot from there. A lot of people saw it as a way to express themselves in a way to be able to engage on their own terms. There\u2019s an argument that a lot of people make that\u2019s connected somehow. In terms of the investment thesis, we\u2019re definitely sector-agnostic. We look out for companies that really have unique intellectual property. I\u2019m not just talking about documentation. The company has to be doing something really defensible and really unique. It can be doing something that we all know and love, but in a way that nobody else has done. Obviously, teams factor in a huge way. We\u2019re looking for professionally mature people who work with intention, who are coachable, who understand why, what and how they\u2019re doing it.\n\nDA: How do you find these companies or better still how do people get your attention?\n\nTA: I made a decision when I first started working in this industry to respond to absolutely everybody. I respond to anyone who messages me on LinkedIn, anyone who emails me. I try to put myself out there a lot and speak at events and do articles like the one I\u2019m doing with you right now, so that people hear about me and they try to reach out to me. Deal sourcing is always two ways.\n\nSometimes it takes me longer than I\u2019d like to admit, but I do try my best to respond to absolutely everyone.\n\nDA: That\u2019s really generous. If you get more popular you\u2019ll probably need to get an assistant. So does Sawari invest in cohorts?\n\nTA: We\u2019re not an accelerator. These are types of activities that Flat6Labs would organize. For us, we look for companies that are a bit more mature than that.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the relationship between Flat6Labs and Sawari ventures?\n\nTA: The founders of Sawari Ventures and the founders and Flat6labs are the same. When Sawari Ventures raised its North Africa fund, we invested in Flat6Labs Cairo and Flat6Labs Tunis. There\u2019s something really important here I need to point out between when a company joins Flat6Labs and when it can join Sawari Ventures. There has to be a bit of a gap, where they go out into the world and raise their middle round.\n\nJust because you get into Flat6Labs does not mean that once you graduate you\u2019re going to get money from Sawari Ventures automatically. We look out for whoever survives, manages to go out into the world, get a seed fund, grow their business even more, and then they can come to Sawari for their Series A round.\n\nDA: What does support from Sawari Ventures look like?\n\nTA: Typically, one of the partners of the firm would sit on the board. We\u2019ve worked very closely with our companies in the beginning to build a strong relationship and to build a strong plan for the business. Moving forward, we work very closely with them to help with business development, growth, as well as fundraising. We work with them to analyze the data that they share with us and help them make data-driven decisions. Obviously, we deploy our entire network to support their growth.\n\nThese are how most VCs support the portfolio companies. We\u2019re also in a position where we have some very strong limited partners who are interested in co-investing. We have a really wide network that allows us to bring a lot of international VCs into the next rounds for the companies. For instance, we brought in Partec to co-invest with us in MoneyFellows.\n\nDA: How does due diligence happen and how long does it take?\n\nTA: Each company will have a different level of preparedness, investment readiness, and every company will have different rounds. A priced round will have a very different timeline than a convertible note round or a safe round. So ultimately, every process is fluid depending on the nature of the round and the co-investors in the round and the lead.\n\nWe will always want to be the lead on any investment that we make and we\u2019re always trying to bring co-investors into the process. We definitely conduct four layers of due diligence. There\u2019s commercial, financial, legal, and tech.\n\nThe rest happen a little later in the process. Initially, there has to be a good solid commercial due diligence, so we can buy into the market, the team, the company, and then we take it forward from there.\n\nDA: What are some red flags?\n\nTA: One that comes to mind is coachability. I\u2019m turned off when I see that a founder or co-founders are not really being responsive to feedback from an investor or a customer. When they have a reputation for being not just defensive, but being uncoachable. That\u2019s a major red flag because when you invest in someone, the relationship is very close for a very long period of time. If you can\u2019t give and take, then it becomes really tricky to nurture this relationship over that period of time. Another thing I really look for as a red flag is co-founder dynamics. Are they both at the pitch? How do they talk during the pitch? How do they answer questions? What does the dynamic and the relationship between them look like? If it looks out of sync, that\u2019s a pretty major red flag.\n\nDA: You said Sawari Ventures typically takes the lead on investments. Why the emphasis on this?\n\nTA: We also co-lead. As regards the times we lead investment rounds, it\u2019s because of the environment. Many companies in this region find investors who can\u2019t and won\u2019t lead, who will tell them, find the lead and we\u2019ll follow. It\u2019s part of a fund ethos that we like to lead our own investments because we really believe in them. Another reason is the market dynamics in the region, there\u2019s a lot of people who want to follow on, but not lead, which ultimately leaves you in a strong position when you are capable and willing.\n\nWe\u2019re a very experienced team. We have very clear intentions about what we like to invest in and why we invest in certain things.\n\nDA: What are your thoughts on exits and M&A?\n\nTA: I think the African market, we\u2019re all suffering from a lack of exits. We all have that problem. Angel investors all over the continent are just dying for an exit because they\u2019ve been investing for years and years. We\u2019re all really dying for exits but exits are really a function of foreign direct investment. It\u2019s a function of mature stock exchanges. I think we\u2019re going to start seeing more and more exits from North Africa. We have seen a few and they\u2019re getting bigger, but we still need so many more before more capital comes into North Africa and that capital gets redeployed.\n\nYou know how it works, you have a company and you exit, all of a sudden you\u2019re an angel investor. Then you\u2019re a fund manager or you start another company that people want to invest in quickly because you already have a successful exit. We\u2019re seeing the industry in North Africa mature, and it\u2019s heading more and more towards some of these interesting exits. We\u2019re starting to see bigger rounds. We\u2019re starting to see exits, we\u2019re starting to see mergers in the continent, in North Africa and in Egypt especially because it\u2019s the market that I\u2019m closest to. We are seeing a lot of maturity, a lot of growth. For example, a lot of ex-Uber and ex-Careem staff are starting companies that have been doing fantastically well. As more and more of these things happen, the maturity of the entrepreneurs and investors grows, and exits will come. We just have to keep at it.\n\nDA: What\u2019s the difference between raising money as a VC fund and a startup?\n\nTA: VC funds are different. They have a limited lifetime, They have a 10 year lifetime. You\u2019ll spend the first third of your time investing, the second third growing and the last third exiting your investments. You need to give the money back to your investors. It\u2019s really the only way for many of us to actually make money off of this business. And it takes time.\n\nJust like startups, we go out into the market and raise money. Startups get the money a little bit at a time, and have to prove themselves every 12 to 18 months.\n\nWe have to raise all the money at once. So you come with a bit of a track record, and then you go out into the market and try to raise capital. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re raising a million or two million dollars in rounds. You\u2019re raising 50 to 100 million dollars from a market and institutional investors that haven\u2019t really gotten comfortable with the asset class yet. You\u2019re reaching out to international investors, asking people in the United States and Europe to invest in Africa. It\u2019s not just about writing checks, we have to get the money to be able to write these checks first.\n\nIt\u2019s a very different dynamic and we have to work really hard to be able to write these checks. We work really hard to make the decisions on who we should give this money to.\n\nDA: What are some trends you\u2019re seeing in the market?\n\nTA: I think for me, the main trends are the fact that people are starting to solve deep-rooted fundamental problems. They\u2019re starting to solve access to finance. They\u2019re starting to solve financial literacy and financial inclusion. They\u2019re starting to solve healthcare problems. People are actually tackling the big-ticket issues that were previously left to the public sector. We\u2019re seeing the market respond very positively to that.\n\nDA: Any final words?\n\nTA: It\u2019d be interesting to see more engagement from large institutional investors with investing in startups. There\u2019s immense potential and having your local financial institutions support you as a fund manager helps immensely when it comes to getting international development. It\u2019s a team effort, we have to do it together.\n\nI\u2019m encouraging more engagement from African financial institutions, not just banks but hedge funds, insurance companies and pension plans.",

          "title": "For Rising Tide Africa, more African women should build diversified investment portfolios",
          "text": "Rising Tide Africa wants more women to be bolder at investment tables, to dream bigger and ask for more money to do bigger things. As told to me by Co- founder, Yemi Keri and Founding member, Ivana Osagie.\n\nWhen Ivana Osagie first started investing in startups, it was not entirely to make money for herself but out of a shared passion to help small businesses gain ground.\n\nThis meant that her investment efforts were without any knowledge of how things should work. So she did things without a proper framework, like weighing and diversifying her risks as well as evaluating her opportunities.\n\nBefore she could come to terms with this defect, the entrepreneur she invested with had disappeared with her money and she lost everything.\n\nWhile sulking over her loss, she stumbled upon angel investing and realised that it was what she needed to build her portfolio. Angels flock together for a reason,\u201d Osagie tells me on our Google call. \u201cBy investing alongside others, you get to diversify your risks to some extent, bringing certain expertise to the table. When you combine that with the expertise of other people, then you have a fuller picture of a startup.\u201d\n\nToday, Ivana is a founding member of Rising Tide Africa, an investment network that consists of a group of female angel investors harnessing their power, passion and capital to positively impact and actively create a new Africa.\n\nIvana Osagie: Founding member, Rising Tide Africa.\n\nWhat exactly does Rising Tide Africa do?\n\nFunded by private investors only, Rising Tide Africa was founded in 2016 by Co-founders Yemi Keri and Ndidi Nnoli- Edozien as a trans-border women-oriented investment network that engages in educating women to become angel investors. They do this through activities such as mentoring, networking and ultimately, offering opportunities for women to build a diversified portfolio of investments.\n\nRising Tide believes that it will bring about positive change by investing in the continent\u2019s exciting startups and next generation to create a new Africa.\n\nOsagie said that apart from investing money, they are also involved in other routines that aid the growth of the startups in their portfolio.\n\nWith every investing procedure comes other packages that involve mentoring and networking. She is of the opinion that investing isn\u2019t just about capitalism. \u201cWhen entrepreneurs come on board, we find that many times they\u2019re not investment-ready. So we need to work with them to get them investment-ready.\u201d\n\nThis process includes mentoring by industry experts and sharing a network of contacts.\n\nThis network of female investors has a mentoring team that works with founders to build business models, develop business plans and get a proper hold on the businesses. \u201cIt could be about helping them personally, for instance, learning how to communicate, how to stand in front of investors and convince them of the viability of the solution,\u201d she tells me.\n\nMuch talk about women empowerment\n\nAlthough the VC firm invests in female lead and gender diverse teams predominantly, there is a reason for this.\n\nIn the last decade, Africa has seen a massive explosion in the business sector, especially for tech-enabled startups. Early-stage companies and SMEs now exist in an exciting technology economy that is fast sprouting a lot of opportunities for business owners on the continent. But in all of these, there is still a limited opportunity pipeline for women.\n\nWhen it comes to access to finance, amongst other things, reports still prove that women aren\u2019t participating as much.\n\nGlobally, women\u2019s access to finance is disproportionately low. In 2017, according to this report, 65% of women had a financial account compared with 72% of men. Fast forward to 2021, not much has changed. In trying to determine what could still be the reason behind this, according to a World Bank report, the gap between men and women in developing economies remains unchanged since 2011, at 9 percentage points.\n\nOnly 37% of women have a bank account in Sub-Saharan Africa as of 2017, compared with 48% of men with bank accounts.\n\nThe African Development Bank revealed that there is a $42 billion gender gap in access to finance. In Nigeria, for example, an estimated 50% of the population lives in extreme poverty and financial exclusion for women is only 36%. In bridging this gap, more organisations and startups are leaning towards gender balance in their operations.\n\nThat\u2019s not really a pretty sight, is it?\n\nThese reasons and more formed the foundation of Rising Tide Africa.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to be able to paint a different landscape. We wanted women to come to the table, to be bolder, to dream bigger dreams, and to ask for more money to do bigger things because we know that women have the capacity to do so. We might just need a bit of support. So that\u2019s why we set about building an angel network that comprises women so that we can open up space for more women,\u201d Ivana says.\n\nShe believes that by giving women agency, \u201cwe\u2019re actually building a bigger and stronger community and ensuring better outcomes for everybody; men, women and children inclusive.\n\nInvestment opportunity pipeline for startups\n\nApart from investing solely in female-led companies, Rising Tide looks out for all kinds of tech-enabled startups. Co-founder Yemi Keri says leveraging technology will keep the startups flexible and scalable as well as give them a sustainable model. \u201cThere are multiple revenue models for startups that leverage technology.\u201d\n\nYemi says Rising Tide always looks forward to exits so as to plug funds into other businesses that come on board. Ultimately, their goal is to create a an avenue for more African women to build diversified investment portfolios.",

          "text": "As CEO of Lori Systems, Uche Ogboi will bear some of the weight of African logistics on her shoulders.\n\nWhen Lori Systems started operations in Kenya in 2016, Uche Ogboi was nearing the end of an eventful eight-year career as an investment banker at Citi.\n\nShe had led the multinational bank\u2019s fund for small businesses and helped deploy billions of dollars for projects in Sub-Saharan Africa and Europe.\n\nA year later, Lori would be the star startup at TechCrunch\u2019s first-ever Battlefield Africa competition, winning $25,000. One of the judges at the event was Eghosa Omoigui, the founding partner at EchoVC Partners, a Nigerian venture capital firm. Ogboi had joined EchoVC as an associate principal, closing deals and helping the firm\u2019s portfolio companies figure out operations.\n\nJosh Sandler, Lori\u2019s founding CEO, first met Ogboi in 2017. When they met again in 2019, Ogboi was now principal at EchoVC and led the VC firm\u2019s investment in Lori\u2019s Series A round.\n\nHer due diligence process impressed Sandler who was looking out for someone to bring structure and help scale the logistics startup\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cShe was so incredibly structured and process-driven,\u201d Sandler says to TechCabal in a joint interview with Ogboi.\n\n\u201cShe understood what we were doing and pushed us in new directions. Lori needed her.\u201d\n\nJoining Lori and multitasking\n\nOgboi joined Lori as Chief Operations Officer (COO) in July 2019, four months before the Series A raise was announced. But in her first few months at Lori, Ogboi had to do more than be COO to immerse herself in the thorny business of logistics in Africa.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t functionally do the role until over a year in. I started by experiencing almost every role in the business because that was needed,\u201d she says.\n\nUche Ogboi. Image credit: Lori Systems.\n\nShe was on the field managing cargo departures and overseeing transportation. For a time, she filled in as the startup\u2019s chief financial officer and general manager for their operations in East and West Africa.\n\n\u201cThat experience has allowed me to work very closely and empathize with every part of the team, as well as with customers and transporters. I have seen the business from all sides.\u201d\n\nThis boots-on-the-ground experience of the business helped her understand logistics pain points. It clarified how technology will ultimately drive solutions that relieve those pains.\n\n\u201cFor our investors and stakeholders, I know and understand what it takes to scale Lori to become a multi-billion-dollar company on the continent.\u201d\n\nDeploying to Nigeria and saving costs\n\nOne of Lori\u2019s goals is to help clients save cost by up to 20%. While they have historically achieved that, Sandler credits Ogboi for some transformations that have happened since 2019.\n\nUntil Ogboi joined, the startup was largely an East African company in two Kenyan cities (Nairobi and Mombasa) and Kampala, the Ugandan capital. Sandler ran the company with Jean-Claude Homawoo, as co-founder and chief product officer.\n\nAs part of her first task, Ogboi scaled Lori\u2019s official expansion to Nigeria in the second half of that year. In doing so, she increased competition in Nigeria\u2019s tech-enabled logistics sector which already included startups like Kobo360 and TradeDepot.\n\nAccording to Sandler, she grew the Nigerian business tenfold within that first year. In 2020, she kept the entire organisation lean when COVID-19 disrupted regular flow at borders, helping the company save 40% of costs and nearly doubling margins.\n\nBy mid-2020, Ogboi\u2019s actions in shaping Lori\u2019s adjustment to the pandemic led Sandler to have deeper thoughts about the startup\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cOnce I saw Uche in action, it became even more clear that as Lori continues to grow, she should be the person at the helm of this organisation,\u201d Sandler says.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a quick decision but by December, conversations became more serious, setting a succession plan in motion that would lead to her appointment as CEO, with effect from July 1, 2021.\n\nA rare CEO leading an African first-mover\n\nSandler, a South African, will become Lori\u2019s Executive Chairman while Ogboi takes the wheel as the startup\u2019s visionary.\n\nJosh Sandler, Lori\u2019s founding CEO, will become Executive Chairman\n\nShe hopes to lean into her ten-year \u201ccocktail of experiences\u201d from investment banking through venture capital to drive Lori\u2019s mission of being the platform that makes every node in the logistics value chain efficient, thereby lowering haulage costs in Africa.\n\nSome factors like poor road infrastructure and policy inconsistencies will be out of her control.\n\nAs of 2018, the World Bank\u2019s Logistics Performance Index ranked Kenya 68th, Uganda 102nd and Nigeria 110th out of 160 countries.\n\nBut Ogboi\u2019s main anchor for changing the space \u2013 the focus of her leadership at Lori \u2013 will be further exploring the power of digital technology for logistics. At the moment, Lori provides clients with real-time information on goods and trucking assets through web-based apps.\n\nSo what\u2019s next on their technology roadmap: Internet of Things? Augmented Reality for warehousing? Blockchain for trucking?\n\nLogistics-tech companies like Lori may not solve Lagos traffic or build roads in Kampala. But they hope to exert influence through technology.\n\nOgboi does not give specifics. But she says they are working on some things over the next few months that will help them \u201cscale much quicker.\u201d\n\nOn one hand, it should be inevitable that someone as experienced should lead a mission as big. In reality, Ogboi is one of only a handful of female tech CEOs in Africa. She takes a deep breath and acknowledges the sad reality but knows she is in a position to drive more women up the ladder in other tech startups but especially at Lori.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has recovered from 2020\u2019s shock. It is back to its pre-COVID growth rates of 20% month over month. Last November, they received an undisclosed investment and signed a partnership agreement with Imperial Logistics, a global logistics company.\n\nSandler is confident that Ogboi will increase Lori\u2019s partnerships and relationships. Under his leadership, Lori helped move cargo worth billions of dollars; he looks forward to trillions with Ogboi in charge.\n\nNo pressure, huh?\n\nFor the new CEO \u2013 a mother of two daughters \u2013 it has been tradition to wake in the middle of the night to think about Lori. Now she\u2019ll probably sleep even less with the weight of African logistics on her shoulders. I prod and poke for what her first announcement will be. Convivial but coy, she only volunteers a general sign: \u201cwatch this space.\u201d",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Nigeria is reeling from the effect of the SIM registration ban, as mobile subscribers have dropped drastically in just four months.\n\nPooling data from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Intelligence by Techpoint reveals that Nigeria lost 15.5 million subscribers between December 2020 and March 2021.\n\nIn December 2020, the Minister of Communications & Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Pantami, through the NCC, suspended the registration of SIM cards by network operators in Nigeria. Here's a look at how the suspension affected the country's mobile subscriptions. pic.twitter.com/TdPYGSNAgM \u2014 Intelligence by Techpoint (@TechpointIntel) June 1, 2021\n\nIn 2020, Nigeria had 190 million mobile subscribers, but that number hit 192 million in March 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn December 2020, the Nigerian government banned the sale and registration of new SIM cards and introduced a December 30 deadline for people to link their National Identity Number (NIN) with their SIM cards.\n\nIn retrospect, it is not clear if the government considered the risks of COVID-19, as that move coincided with a sharp increase in positive cases in the following months.\n\nMTN and Airtel\u2019s financial reports for Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 revealed that this policy would also hurt telecom companies. Both companies registered a reduction in subscriber numbers during the period in question.\n\nThe NCC\u2019s data all but confirms these numbers.\n\nIn November 2020, Nigeria had up to 207.9 mobile subscribers, but the country has witnessed a downward spiral since then, leading to the loss of over 15 million subscribers.\n\nCompared to previous years, this could be considered an abysmal showing.\n\nBy comparison, Nigeria gained 15.7 million subscribers between March 2019 and March 2020. From March 2018 to 2019, subscribers grew by a whopping 23 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NCC\u2019s subscriber numbers could perhaps be termed inflated, considering the data doesn\u2019t account for people holding multiple SIMs in different devices.\n\nConsequently, the actual number of mobile subscribers is much lower than what the NCC\u2019s records show. Though the regulator had plans to regularise the data in the past, nothing much came of them until the NIN order.\n\nThe subscriber decline in such a short time continues to raise questions about the size of Nigeria\u2019s addressable Internet market, as most of the lost subscribers are Internet users.\n\nPer the NCC, Nigeria lost 9.2 million Internet subscribers between December 2020 and March 2021.\n\nWhile the data wars of 2019 and 2020 were particularly thrilling to observe, Nigerian telecom companies were on a losing streak in the three months between December 2020 and March 2021.\n\nMTN was the hardest hit, with 3.8 million Internet subscribers lost. For context, MTN lost 4.8 million subscribers in total. This means about 70% of them were Internet subscribers.\n\nHistorically a formidable competitor to MTN in the data market, Airtel lost about 3.5 million Internet users. This is about 67% of the subscribers it lost in total.\n\nGlo fared way better than the first two, losing 1.3 million Internet subscribers, about 68% of the total mobile users it lost.\n\nSIM ban or not, 9mobile has struggled with the loss of its subscribers in recent years. However, it lost the least number of Internet subscribers at a respectable 701k.\n\nHowever, this number gets weird considering that it lost just 132k mobile subscribers. This would mean about 569 9mobile subscribers went offline during this period.\n\nThe loss of Internet subscribers by Nigerian telcos is also telling considering that, due to the pandemic, more people needed to be online to attend to their businesses, jobs, or education, but the SIM ban period might have been a stumbling block.\n\nThankfully, the ban has been lifted even though the NIN registrations continue.",
          "summary": "Nigeria is reeling from the effect of the SIM registration ban, as mobile subscribers have dropped drastically in just four months.\nPooling data from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Intelligence by Techpoint reveals that Nigeria lost 15.5 million subscribers between December 2020 and March 2021.\npic.twitter.com/TdPYGSNAgM \u2014 Intelligence by Techpoint (@TechpointIntel) June 1, 2021In 2020, Nigeria had 190 million mobile subscribers, but that number hit 192 million in March 2021.\nPer the NCC, Nigeria lost 9.2 million Internet subscribers between December 2020 and March 2021.\nMTN was the hardest hit, with 3.8 million Internet subscribers lost.",

          "text": "Today, June 1, 2021, TalentQL is launching Pipeline by TalentQL, a specialised training programme for software engineers in Africa.\n\nDuring an interview with Techpoint Africa in November 2020, Adewale Yusuf, TalentQL CEO, revealed that Pipeline had been in the works since the company\u2019s inception. He discussed plans to launch the talent pipeline programme for training and upskilling junior developers in the first or second quarter of 2021.\n\nHowever, unlike the previous plan to focus on junior developers, this programme is focused on training and upskilling mid-level software engineers across the continent to senior software engineers.\n\nPipeline is Africa\u2019s first senior engineers\u2019 incubation programme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfrica suffers a dearth of senior software engineers. According to the IFC-Google report 2020, the continent has nearly 700,000 professional developers, but the ratio of junior developers to senior developers is quite disproportionate.\n\nThis narrative is not new to the African tech ecosystem as Andela \u2014 formerly a talent accelerator, now a talent outsourcing company \u2014 laid off 420 junior developers in 2019. The underlying thread behind this decision was the search for more senior developers to join its ranks.\n\nDuring our chat with Yusuf, he said, \u201cThe demand for senior engineers is at an all-time high. Up to 90% of our clients are seeking senior engineers. [But] most of the senior software engineers didn\u2019t pass our international clients\u2019 tests. So that\u2019s why we have to upskill them. Africa has enough junior engineers but not [enough] seniors.\u201d\n\nHe cites the largely self-taught developers littering the landscape, who \u201cdidn\u2019t train in a more structured environment,\u201d as the reason for this large skill gap. According to him, our education system doesn\u2019t prepare developers for the global stage.\n\nThis idea might not be far from the truth, as the IFC-Google report states that 31% of African developers are self-taught.\n\nAs Yusuf says, while there\u2019s a need to give African talents an opportunity, \u201cyou need more talent in the market to give opportunities.\u201d Hence the launch of this program.\n\nThe programme follows the Lambda School\u2019s model of a pay-later scheme, with participants not required to pay until they\u2019ve found the next opportunity after completing the programme.\n\nLambda\u2019s Income Share Agreements (ISAs) have come under severe scrutiny, with three students recently suing the for-profit company for issues relating to the contract.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile we do not have the details of TalentQL\u2019s proposed arrangement, Yusuf believes the programme is sustainable, and its team of highly experienced professionals can handle whatever is thrown at it.\n\nPipeline will be entirely remote and will run a peer-to-peer learning format offering one-on-one mentorship provided by top senior software engineers working in some of the biggest tech companies globally, including Twitter, Tesla, GitLab, Amazon, and Google.\n\nThis model is different from the programme\u2019s initial model, which would have had a campus at Ile-Ife, Osun State. It seems plans for this campus have been put on hold for now.\n\nThe intensive six-month programme will not only focus on tech skills but \u201cwill also cover soft skills that are needed to compete in the global market.\u201d\n\nThese skills \u2014 team skills, client/user skills, and sales/interview skills, among others \u2014 are quite important in a software developer\u2019s journey to becoming a senior software engineer.\n\nAccording to Yusuf, \u201cWhat differentiates a mid-level developer from a senior developer is not just the technical skills but exposure to challenging projects, soft skills, and the right mentorship.\u201d\n\nAccording to the IFC\u2019s report, a minimum experience level of six years is required to be labelled a senior software engineer.\n\nYusuf says that TalentQL is accepting only the best intermediate-level engineers, thus closing the gap with a minimum requirement of three years experience.\n\nRegistration begins today, and there is a vetting process to ensure that only qualified candidates get into the programme.",

          "text": "As competition intensifies in Nigeria\u2019s domestic aviation industry, some airlines are left with little or no choice to survive by charging below their operating cost, as they focus on retaining or gaining better market share.\n\nNigeria\u2019s aviation industry has been experiencing a flurry of activities, with new airlines coming up, and 25 prospective operators in the process of marking their presence in the skies.\n\nNew entrants are adopting strategies such as low fares, comfort and timeliness to attract the market, as operating cost become secondary, at least at these early stages.\n\nFor instance, Green Africa, a prospective airline, announced fares between N16,500 and N23,000, which is about a 50 to 70 percent slash in fares charged by other airlines.\n\nExperts say these prices are below operating cost, considering the high exchange rate, depleting fleet size, high cost of aviation fuel, labour cost and multiple taxations airlines have to pay.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s checks show that before the current challenge of depleting aircraft fleet and high foreign exchange rate, airlines charged between N23,000 and N30,000 for a one-way trip from Lagos to Abuja, Lagos to Port Harcourt or Lagos to Owerri.\n\nExperts say at these rates, airlines are not realising their operating costs.\n\nFor instance, it cost about $3,000 to operate a Boeing 737 aircraft on a one hour flight when aviation fuel was less than N100 per litre.\n\nFurther checks show that with the current exchange rate and increase in aviation fuel, which currently cost about N220 per litre, airlines operate a B737 aircraft at a cost of about $6,000.\n\nAverage fuel consumption on a Lagos to Abuja flight takes nothing less than 8,000 litres and at N220/litre, airlines would be paying N1.76 million for fuel alone; that is if the airline does not have to divert flight for weather or technical reasons.\n\nWith the current exchange rate of N500 to a dollar, it would cost airlines N3 million to operate a B737 aircraft. This means, for airlines to realise cost of operations on a B737 aircraft carrying an average of 100 passengers, the airline would have to charge an average of N30,000 for each passenger on a one-way flight.\n\nIf airlines hope to make some profit from their operations, then a one-way ticket on an hour flight should cost between N35,000 and N45,000.\n\nDaniel Young, an aviation analyst, told BusinessDay that disruptive market entry could work in other sectors, not aviation except there were under-the- table funding of the airline business.\n\nConsidering the Revenue Passenger Miles (RPM) based on cost of Available Seat Miles (ASM) against current Cost per Available Seat Mile (CASM), this ticket pricing by Green Africa is a mathematical impossibility, Young said.\n\nEven if the airline does not make profit, it should at least be able to cover operating expenses, he noted.\n\nAccording to Young, as new airlines spring up and they introduce promotional fares, cutting cost might help stimulate demand but may likely generate an elastic demand for seats way beyond the capacity and capabilities of the new airline; leading to service failures and disappointments.\n\nThe checks show further that aviation fuel takes 32 percent of operating cost, labour 17 percent, aircraft rent and ownership 8.5 percent, non-aircraft rents and ownership 7 percent, professional services 4.5 percent, landing fees 3 percent, food and beverage 1.5 percent, maintenance materials 13 percent, transport related 1.5 percent, and others 12 percent.\n\nObi Mbanuzuo, chief operating officer/accountable manager at Dana Air, told BusinessDay that airlines fix prices of tickets after considering variables such as cost of operation, level of competition, each individual airline\u2019s strategy and how much the market can pay.\n\nFor cost of operations, he said airlines fix prices with considerations on whether the aircraft is wet or dry leased, or owned by the operating airline.\n\n\u201cEach aircraft model has differing maintenance costs based on manufacturers\u2019 intervals for heavy or C/D checks. Newer aircraft are more reliable and break down less often than older ones, and also have longer maintenance intervals (up to 48 months for B737 Max compared to 18 months for older B737s ) so the maintenance cost is usually lower,\u201d Mbanuzuo said.\n\nJohn Ojikutu, aviation security consultant and secretary general of the Aviation Safety Round Table Initiative (ASRTI), told BusinessDay that operational cost determines ticketing price.\n\nThe operational cost components, he said, include fuel consumption for the duration of the flight, which in itself depends on the engine type or numbers of (one or multiple) propeller, turbo or jet; air navigation and control en-route, terminal services like toilet and other airport convenient and safety services such as the runway landings, lightings and approach aids services; ground handling services, catering services, etc.\n\n\u201cFirst, operating B737, a medium range aircraft with less than 70 percent load capacity for mostly short range flights or distances of Lagos/Abuja, Lagos/PH, Lagos/Enugu, etc, makes no economic sense.\n\n\u201cNigeria Airways in its days would fly F27/F28. That is why it makes sense seeing some of the airlines reverting to aircraft like Embraers now. The air navigation services charges vary with flight conditions (VFR or IFR) and the navigational support,\u201d Ojikutu explained.\n\nHe said ground services charges too depend on aircraft type or size, as operators cannot operate an Embraer at the same cost as they would a B737.\n\nAirfare is a product, but it has far more pricing variables than most. Airline ticket prices can and sometimes change every day.\n\nFor Tolu Odutola, a pilot and aviation expert, factors that influence pricing of airfare include aviation fuel, flight distance, competition, timing of purchase, timing of flight, passenger appetite and empty middle seat.\n\nOn competition, Odutola said the more airlines, the merrier for passengers. \u201cFierce competition means lower ticket prices,\u201d he said",

          "text": "Nigeria can productively engage about 60 percent of its under-utilised pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity and cut importation of pharmaceutical products by at least 25 percent with the adoption of contract manufacturing (outsourcing), industry analysts and stakeholders have said, making a case for growth.\n\nContract manufacturing is one of the strategies emerging market peers have adopted to own a significant share of global pharmaceutical production, by servicing the rising need for outsourcing different aspects of production.\n\nChina, India, Singapore, South Korea and even Malaysia have become an attractive hub for giant pharmaceutical firms looking to have others manage the business of up-scaling their backend for large volumes of production and stay price competitive.\n\nThis played a significant part in placing Asian manufacturers as the second-leading exporter of drugs and medicines in 2019 with 9.5 percent of the global total, despite European countries controlling over 80 percent.\n\nTaking on these roles has given these manufacturers an edge in a highly contested marketplace such that India, for instance, now answers as the largest producer of vaccines in the world.\n\nAnalysts think the contracting manufacturing strategies hold huge growth potential for Nigeria to make a bold statement on the world map, considering the opportunities inherent in collaborations with corporations of repute for quality standards.\n\nAs of 2017, Nigeria\u2019s drug manufacturing industry only catered to a quarter of the local demand, with the remaining three quarters handled by Asian manufacturers\u2019 exports to Nigeria.\n\nThis implies as much as 70 percent of marketed drugs by about 130 pharmaceutical firms were imported.\n\nIt is a growing concern that the Nigerian Representatives of Overseas Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (NIROPHARM) say the country may not be rid of it and shies away from opportunities such as contract manufacturing.\n\nThe group in a position report provided to BusinessDay stated that some of the goals outlined in the Nigerian Industrial Revolution Plan to make Nigeria a top hub in West Africa and an ideal supplier of low and medium technology consumer and industrial goods could materialise with the contracting approach in a pharmaceutical market expected to worth $4 billion by 2026, according to McKinsey\u2019s projections.\n\n\u201cWhat we are saying is that instead of banning the importation, why don\u2019t you allow these local companies that have the capacity to work with the international firms raise their standards, and with that take on the volume that is being imported,\u201d Omongiade Ehighebolo, director, communications, Government Affairs and Global Health \u2013 Africa at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).\n\nDifferent from regular manufacturing companies that are neck-deep in all operations of production, contract manufacturing organisations are based on the client\u2019s specific designs, formulas and specifications.\n\nWhile some clients request for active ingredient manufacturing, for example, others simply want solid dosage produced to their specifications.\n\nSome of the drivers of growth in Nigeria currently include demand for generic compositions to reduce the rising cost of healthcare increased collaborations with pharmaceutical firms overseas, availability of production facilities, and regional trade integration across Africa.\n\nNIROPHARM sees this as a growth area that the government can pursue strongly to position Nigeria\u2019s manufacturing sector better on the continent.\n\nCountries across Africa are bending towards generic drugs, which have sustained double-digit market share at the expense of over-the-counter and branded products.\n\n\u201cYou are going to have higher capacity utilisation; your cost of manufacturing will drop and make the product. If a Fidson is trying to compete for export of a drug within the AfCFTA to Senegal, the average doctor will still want to buy a GSK product for trust. But if you present a product that is in partnership with GSK, the trust will extend to this product and position Nigeria better,\u201d Ehighebolo said.",

The virus has changed the way we live and interact with one another globally.\n\n\u201cIt is heartwarming today that we continue with our gradual return to our normal lives with the commencement of the second dose coronavirus vaccination. With this, we hope for brighter days ahead as we collectively fight to defeat the virus.\n\n\u201cThe second dose vaccination exercise commences today, June 1, and will last for 40 days, during which period we intend to get the vaccines to our people, including frontline workers who are 18 years and above across the 18 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of the State.\n\nObaseki said the second dose is a booster dose which will provide full protection against the coronavirus disease, adding: \u201cThe flag off is important to create awareness in the state and boost public confidence in the safety and efficiency of the vaccines.\n\n\u201cI took the first dose. Despite all the fears expressed, nothing happened. I am here today to flag off the second dose vaccination. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t take my second dose today because the time scheduled for me is not due. I will be due for the second dose on the 12th of June. However, some people have earlier dates. That is why the programme is launched today. I will take my second dose on the 12th of June and you will be invited to know the importance of the vaccination.\u201d\n\nNoting that the vaccines will be rolled out in phases, he said: \u201cThe first phase is now being administered to frontline workers, strategic leaders and the elderly; as scheduled for them. The second and third phase will follow and the rest of the eligible population will take turns to be vaccinated.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the goal of his administration is to vaccinate about 70 per cent of the population.\n\n\u201cFor those who have not been vaccinated, it is important to take the vaccine because by the end of June, it might be almost impossible to travel around the world without a vaccination certificate.\n\n\u201cGovernment alone can\u2019t fix this pandemic. We must all play our part by adhering to COVID 19 protocol to enable us to protect our loved ones, even after taking the second dose of the vaccines.\u201d\n\nGovernor Obaseki seized the opportunity to thank President Muhammadu Buhari for his support and role played in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that different stakeholders, particularly development partners, worked in synergy with the Edo State Government in ridding the state of the virus.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe have vaccinated 38,500 people in the first phase of the first dose vaccination exercise. We are expecting that 38,500 people will come forward for their second dose. It is only then that you will have full immunization.\u201d\n\n...",

Fr. Fidelis Arhedo made the call while delivering a keynote address to audience at an event organized by the body in Uromi, Esan North East Local Government Area of Edo State, to commemorate the 2021 Child Protection Day.\n\nHe described Child Protection as the safeguarding of children from violence, exploitation, abuse and neglect, adding that Article 9 of the UN Convention on the Right of the child provides for the protection of children in and out of schools and places of worship.\n\nThe clergyman also emphasized the need for leaders in the community to be supportive of children and families, just as he asked employers to provide family-friendly work environment.\n\nHe blamed lack of parenting skills, drug and alcohol use, poor parent-child relationship, difficulties in managing anger and stress, personal health issues, including low self-confidence, among others for the prevalence of child abuse in the society.\n\nRev. Fr. Arhedo consequently admonished parents to discipline their children thoughtfully, teach children their rights, invest in kids and implored people to endeavour to report any case of child abuse to relevant agencies for prosecution.\n\nSpeaking on the the theme of the 2021 Child Protection Day, \u201cThe Role of Parents and Caregivers in the Protection of Children, the Coordinator of the Edo State Child Protection Network, Barr. Stella Obehi Ojeme said it was the right of every child to be protected.\n\nHe listed the types of Child Abuse to include Physical, Emotional and Sexual Abuses, asserting that abusing a child constituted the worst thing anybody could do to a child.\n\n\u201d It is the right of children to be protected. When you protect children, you are not doing them a favour. It is the duty of everyone to protect children because we are all stakeholders.\n\n\u201cNot putting a child in school is another form of child abuse. Every child deserve to be well treated. Discrimination against children is yet another form of abuse\u201d, she said.\n\nParticipants at the event were secondary students from the five local government areas of Edo Central Senatorial Districts, parents, teachers, security agents, civil society groups, among others.\n\n...",

that KYC process constituted a significant cost to their operations, with 71 per cent anticipating that the cost of KYC would continue to increase.\n\nIn addition, more than 70 per cent of the responding banks, according to the KPMG, spend about N10,000 as direct cost for identity and address verification of a customer while others spend as much as N40,000 on the KYC of a customer.\n\nThe key drivers of the continual increase in the cost, according to the report, included frequent changes in regulatory requirements, financial inclusion programs, increase in customer base, initial cost of acquiring technology needed to implement KYC, more complex ownership structures of some businesses operating bank accounts and increase in the number of employees required to administer the KYC unit in a bank.\n\nThe survey findings added: \u201cOur analysis of the data reveals that for many banks, the direct cost of KYC is below N50 million per annum, but depending on the size of the bank it can rise to as much as N400 million per annum, which do not include the indirect cost of KYC.\n\n\u201cBanks also incur significant indirect cost in performing KYC that include cost incurred in staffing the compliance office/sanctions screening desk, purchasing, installing and implementing technology, storing and managing customer KYC data, cost incurred due to regulatory reporting, fines incurred as a result of failure to report, opportunity cost incurred as a result of customers who are discouraged from opening accounts due to inefficient or cumbersome KYC systems.\u201d\n\nKPMG also highlighted that some of the topmost challenges banks encountered while implementing KYC in Nigeria include identifying complex legal structures, verifying addresses and identities, identifying and verifying politically exposed persons (PEPs), as well as remediating rather high-volume of legacy accounts.\n\nIt added: \u201cDue to the current manual nature of searches at the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) as well as continued existence of jurisdictions designated as tax/secret havens \u2013 it is difficult for banks to unravel complex legal structures, especially where these complex legal structures are employed to mask true or ultimate beneficial owners.\u201d\n\nThe report also noted that address verification is expensive and cumbersome in Nigeria and might not be effective in ascertaining the true location of potential money launderers or terrorist financiers during investigations.\n\nIt acknowledged that the deployment of Biometric Verification Number (BVN) and the ongoing National Identification Number (NIN) registration would continue to contribute to addressing this challenge of disparate identity systems in Nigeria that made it difficult for banks to effectively and efficiently identify individuals.\n\nPartner and Head of Forensic Services, KPMG in Nigeria, Mr. Saheed Olawuyi, explained: \u201cIt is important for regulators and banks to continuously develop ways to address the KYC challenges, while not compromising the integrity of the financial systems.\u201d\n\nThe report recommended that banks should continue to explore technology as a way of tackling the challenges of KYC in Nigeria and create opportunities to share the cost of KYC among them by maintaining common KYC utility facilities.\n\nThe KPMG report said: \u201cWe would like to encourage more investment in the deployment and adoption of artificial intelligence, machine learning and robotics to automate certain segments of the KYC process, so as to build more efficiency, accuracy and predictive capabilities in the KYC process.\u201d\n\nThe report also urged the CAC to further enhance its recently launched digital platform to seamlessly enable users to carry out search on the directors and shareholders of companies, in order to drive efficiency of corporate onboarding and identification of complex ownership structures.\n\nIt also called on the CBN and other relevant regulators and stakeholders to streamline the definition of PEPs and \u201ccreate a collaborative environment where all parties come together and proffer solutions to common KYC issues.\u201d\n\nThisDay",

          "title": "Asaba Declaration: Crossing the threshold of gullibility and division",
          "text": "By Obunike Nwosu\n\nOn May 11, 2021, Governors of the 17 states of Southern Nigeria met in Asaba, Delta State and resolved to ban the horrendous and anachronistic open grazing of cattle throughout their territory. They also called for the devolution of powers and for national dialogue to reset the country\u2019s trajectory.\n\nIt is a landmark that all Southern Governors could meet and take a uniform stand on national matters and have been supported by their National Assembly members, regardless of political party. The resolution has been widely endorsed in the North as well. Congratulations to all the participants and, in particular, to the Chairman of the Forum, Chief \u2018Rotimi Akeredolu, S. A. N., Governor of Ondo State, who has always demonstrated a rare strength of character.\n\nThe jinx has been broken but the journey to a united front has only begun. Southern leaders must now demonstrate that they are not as selfish, gullible and easily browbeaten as thought.\n\nWithout standing together, Southern Nigeria cannot muster the bargaining power to drag the country out of the path to perdition, in order to develop it (which should be the preferred option) or to secede from it (which may become inevitable) \u2013 despite the excellence of her people in the academia, the professions, public service, science and technology, commerce and industry, literature, music and the rest of the arts as well as sports and everything that makes the society tick, all around the competitive world.\n\nIn that case, the country would continue in crisis and in decline, their citizens will be stuck in the mess, their growth would remain arrested and they would remain second class citizens in the country they contribute the most to build, for whatever it is yet worth. Nigeria\u2019s redemptive potential for the black race would also be totally wasted. Therefore, this breakthrough should never be allowed to fizzle.\n\nBe it known, too, that the unity of Southern Nigeria is dreaded by the conservative Fulani-led Moslem North, who are set in their views about the rest of Nigeria as subordinate and have been in control of state power (directly or indirectly) by divide-and-rule tactics, since independence. In word and in action, they remain committed to the complete conquest and subjugation of Nigerians, begun by Jihad in the 19th Century, which the current leadership \u2013 knowingly or by default \u2013 has been facilitating.\n\nBut a people could be conquered only if they could be kept divided, as Southern Nigeria has perennially been. Thus, they are bound to resist the emergent Southern unity and would deploy blackmail, bullying, baits (including 2023) diplomacy and all sorts of wit to annul it.\n\nAlready, you can see the reprobate, self-righteous, master \u2013 servant, indignation of the Senate President, Dr. Ahmed Lawan and the Attorney-General of the Federation, Malam Abubakar Malami, S. A. N., to the resolution \u2013 as if they are more patriotic than the Governors and as if the Governors have no knowledge of the law. Mallam Garba Shehu (a spokesman of the Presidency) went further to deploy a purported memorandum of the Minister of Agriculture, on the reactivation of grazing reserves and routes, to override the resolution of 17 Governors. What an affront and an insult!\n\nIt does not matter to them that the 17 Governors represent the half of Nigeria\u2019s population as well as the territory from which the revenue for running the country is derived. The deluge of blood and tears, flowing in the land, purportedly, for the sake of cows, does not move them. For all they care, you may die or relocate provided the primitive practice of nomadic herding is sustained, as Femi Adesina, another spokesman of the Presidency was once sent to advocate! It could mean that the herdsmen (who do not own the cows) are armed and sent on a mission and that the cows are baits.\n\nCuriously, the Secret Service and the Armed Forces and the Police, who are swift in smoking out EndSARS benefactors, IPOB and ESN members and camps and in extra-judicially torturing and killing suspects, have been incapable of locating the cells of the marauding herdsmen, bandits and kidnappers, not to talk of arresting and dislodging them from occupied communities and forests for restoration to the owners. As long as the President condones the atrocities \u2013 expressly or by body language \u2013 the Armed Forces and the Police will never move against them, regardless of platitudes. The Nigerian Armed Forces and the Police have more been slaves of the Head of State than defenders of the people, from inception.\n\nWhen the Federal Government has failed to act but, rather, is bent on seizing land (that is highly limited) in Southern Nigeria for Fulani settlements, for the sake of the same herdsmen, through the obnoxious Water Resources Bill, Rural Grazing Areas (RUGA) Grazing Reserves and Routes as well as the Nigerian Livestock Transformation Plan, e. t. c (while sidelining the clean solution of ranching in the North) who would not understand that a game is going on? What option did the Governors have under their limited powers than the Asaba Resolution? Or, should they simply watch their territory overrun?\n\nSince there cannot be a national Armed Forces and Police, Secret Service, Judiciary, Legislature and Civil Service (other than ones servile to the Head of State and his people) only the Aburi Accord of 1967 (or a confederation) can truly stabilize Nigeria. Under the Aburi Accord, for example, almost everything \u2013 from Resource Control to Agriculture, Education, Highways, Power generation and the Armed Forces and the Police \u2013 would be regionalized. Are Hisbah, Amotekun, Ebube Agu and Eastern Security Network (ESN) not pointing to the inevitability of the Aburi Accord?\n\nNigeria is a natural federate country. As a federation of regions in the 1960s, it was doing so well, socio-economically, that it was acclaimed as the future leader of the black race \u2013 until derailed by the greed of domination. Next, a confederation (Aburi Accord) was agreed in 1967 but was repudiated before implementation, which precipitated the Civil War of 1967 \u2013 1970, followed by other deviant behaviors and the obnoxious, predatory, Constitution of 1999 largely responsible for the current mess. The Governors are only affirming the call of the rest of Nigeria for true federalism and devolution of powers.\n\nBe it known that unless this Constitution and the supremacy mindset can be dispensed with and the Aburi Accord (or, at least, the structure for the socio-economic performance of the First Republic) is restored \u2013 so that everybody can breathe, can be weighed on the same scale and can substantially self-actualize \u2013 Nigeria is bound to suffocate to death, despite all the sentiment to the contrary. Instead of artificially sticking together and die, let us naturally move apart and prosper, as Ojukwu advocated at Aburi.\n\nOtherwise, an Oduduwa or a Biafran nation had better fill Nigeria\u2019s destiny in the world. Imagine that Biafra had survived. It would have become an industrial cum military complex comparable to Israel, South Korea, Turkey, India and China. All that Oduduwa or Biafra needs to do is to take money and rascality away from political office and enforce drastic laws against graft and nepotism \u2013 given that Africans, in general and Nigerians, in particular, have been incorrigible in the abuse of public office, whereas they serve their clubs, professional bodies and communities honorably, without pay. The remainder of Nigeria would be the better for Oduduwa or Biafra, given that prosperity is infectious \u2013 as was evident before the political crisis of the First Republic. The current system is unsustainable, by whatever means.\n\nObunike Nwosu wrote for Lekki, Lagos",

There is no indication that H10N3 can spread easily in humans.\n\nThe man, a resident of the city of Zhenjiang, was hospitalized on April 28 and diagnosed with H10N3 on May 28, the health commission said. It did not give details on how the man was infected.\n\nHis condition is now stable and he is ready to be discharged. Investigation of his close contacts found no other cases, the NHC said. No other cases of human infection with H10N3 have been reported globally, it added.\n\nH10N3 is low pathogenic, which means it causes relatively less severe disease in poultry and is unlikely to cause a large-scale outbreak, the NHC added.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO), in a reply to Reuters in Geneva, said: \u201cThe source of the patient\u2019s exposure to the H10N3 virus is not known at this time, and no other cases were found in emergency surveillance among the local population. At this time, there is no indication of human-to-human transmission.\n\nREAD ALSO: Asaba Declaration: We have no apologies on open\u2026\n\n\u201cAs long as avian influenza viruses circulate in poultry, sporadic infection of avian influenza in humans is not surprising, which is a vivid reminder that the threat of an influenza pandemic is persistent,\u201d the WHO added.\n\nThe strain is \u201cnot a very common virus\u201d, said Filip Claes, regional laboratory coordinator of the Food and Agriculture Organization\u2019s Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases at the regional office for Asia and the Pacific.\n\nOnly around 160 isolates of the virus were reported in the 40 years to 2018, mostly in wild birds or waterfowl in Asia and some limited parts of North America, and none had been detected in chickens so far, he added.\n\nAnalysing the genetic data of the virus will be necessary to determine whether it resembles older viruses or if it is a novel mix of different viruses, Claes said.\n\nThere have been no significant numbers of human infections with bird flu since the H7N9 strain killed around 300 people during 2016-2017",

It stated that many countries are now looking up to Nigeria to learn how to better roll out vaccination programmes.\n\nWHO Country Representative Dr. Kazadi Mulombo spoke during a joint news briefing on COVID-19 vaccination update of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), WHO and the United Nations Children\u2019s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) in Abuja.\n\nHe said: \u201cMore than 1.8 billion vaccines are being distributed globally as of today, mostly in 10 countries.

Thugs have been on the loose in the area, killing people and torching public and private property. The president has previously warned that the attacks would have repercussions, and security personnel have been scouring the region for pro-Biafran individuals.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the president further up his condemnation of the violence, saying it was clearly perpetrated by those who had not lived through the Nigerian Civil War, which lasted from 1966 to 1970 and saw Nigerian military fighting Biafran separatists.\n\nDuring the war, an estimated three million people were slaughtered, many of whom were picked up by Nigerian soldiers and shot at close range, while hundreds of others died of starvation. Several stories with strong corroboration stated how Nigerian forces slaughtered Igbo residents at Asaba, Onitsha, and Enugu, among other communities in the region, despite the fact that the war was not properly documented.\n\nAlthough the war ended in 1970, historians continue to bemoan the country\u2019s failure to achieve a meaningful reconciliation 50 years later.\n\nMr Buhari was reported to have participating in the killings at the time while seeking to keep Biafra as part of Nigeria, alongside Murtala Mohammed and other questionable military officers from the Muslim-dominated northern region.\n\nMr Buhari singled out the South-East with threats of bloodshed on Tuesday evening, despite overwhelming calls for him to do something about the violence that has engulfed the country. The president has persistently excluded the Igbo, one of Nigeria\u2019s three major ethnic groups, from his administration, presumably in keeping with his remarks immediately after taking office in 2015 that they would not profit much from his administration because they did not vote for him.\n\nBuhari wrote on Twitter: \u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Hundreds of Igbo youths were killed by Nigerian forces at a rally commemorating Biafran Day in Onitsha. Civil society groups later discovered their burnt bodies, but Mr Buhari\u2019s government has yet to hold anyone accountable.",

          "text": "The federal government has said its performance in all sectors of development in the last six years has shamed critics of the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration and demystified the naysayers on the resolve to take Nigeria to the next level.\n\nReeling out the mid-term report of the All Progressives Congress(APC)-led government at a press conference in Abuja Tuesday, Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed said the naysayers decided to close their eyes to the tremendous achievements recorded in the last six years.\n\nThe minister said, to prove to Nigerians the administration had taken the country from Change when it took over power in 2015 to the Next Level which it promised the people, government has decided to release a documentary through video footages of the various efforts to make life conducive for everyone.\n\nThe new strategy\n\nHe said government decided to mark this year\u2019s anniversary in a new style and strategy with a view to availing Nigerians quality information about the modest efforts in making life meaningful for the citizenry.\n\n\u201cTo mark this anniversary, we have decided to, once again, change our strategy. Since 2016, we have heralded every anniversary, as well as every end of year, by giving massive publicity to the achievements of the Administration. We have leveraged our Town Hall Meetings, 18 of which we have held up to day, to showcase the achievements. We have also undertaken media tours of federal government projects covering many sectors across the country.\n\n\u201cIn the run up to the 2019 general elections, we introduced a novel idea when we launched our \u2018Testimony Series\u2019, under which we showcased the Administration\u2019s achievements from the perspective and prism of Nigerians who have benefitted from the various government projects and programmes, ranging from infrastructure to school feeding system. The \u2018Testimony Series\u2019 was so successful that it rattled the opposition into issuing a statement calling for a probe of the funds spent on it.\n\n\u201cThis year, 2021, which marks the half-way point of the second and final term of the Muhammadu Buhari Administration, we have decided to once again change our style for more effectiveness. Our new strategy is to suffuse the airwaves and the social media with unmistakable video evidence of the various achievements, to such an extent that even the blind can \u2018see\u2019 and the deaf can \u2018hear\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe documentary, which will be updated from time to time until the end of the Administration\u2019s tenure, covers roads, rail, housing, power, aviation, agriculture, ports, bridges, health, fight against Covid-19, water resources and the economy generally.\n\n\u201cLet me repeat what I have said many times in the past: Never in the history of our country has any Administration done so much with so little. It\u2019s easy to forget now, but when this Administration came into office in 2015, the price of crude oil, which provides 80 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s budgetary revenues and 95 per cent of foreign exchange earnings, dropped drastically and, along with it, the fund available to the government. It is therefore monumental that this Administration has achieved so much despite the paucity of fund,\u201d the minister said.\n\nOn some of the projects\n\nHe listed some of the projects undertaken by the present administration, noting that while work had been completed on many of the projects, work was still ongoing on others. The projects include roads and railways infrastructure, security, agriculture, ports among others.\n\nMohammed said the 156km Lagos-Ibadan Standard Gauge Rail is nearing completion; 327km Itakpe-Warri Standard Gauge Rail completed and commissioned 33 years after construction began; while the Abuja Light Rail was completed in 2018.\n\nHe said ground-breaking was done for the construction of the Kano-Maradi Standard Gauge Rail; revamping of Port-Harcourt-Maiduguri Narrow Gauge Rail; while financing negotiation is ongoing for Ibadan-Kano Standard Gauge Rail project.\n\nOn road infrastructure, the minister said Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) \u201cis investing over a billion dollars in three flagship projects; Lagos -Ibadan Expressway, Second Niger Bridge, Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Expressway.\n\nHe said the \u201cExecutive Order 7 was explored in mobilising private investment into the development of key roads and bridges like Bodo-Bonny in Rivers and Apapa-Oshodi-Oworonshoki-Ojota in Lagos, while the Highway Development and Management Initiative (HDMI), a public-private partnership programme was entered into to mobilise, in its first Phase, over a Trillion Naira in private investment into the development and maintenance of 12 Roads, amounting to 1,963km in length while more than N360 billion worth of Sukuk Bonds raised since 2017 for dozens of critical road projects across all six geopolitical zones.\u201d\n\nSecurity\n\nSpeaking on insecurity, Lai said: \u201cI want to state emphatically that while more attention has been given, especially in recent times, to the security challenges facing our country; those challenges are fleeting and will not define the legacy of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cLet me say that President Buhari\u2019s legacy is assured, and will be defined by his massive achievements in office. The roads, rails, bridges, mass housing, port development, improvement in power supply and other massive infrastructural development will last for generations to come and will help propel economic growth and national development.\u201d\n\nHe said the Air Force had acquired 26 brand new aircraft since President Buhari assumed office in 2015, and expecting another 12 (the twelve Super Tucano currently on order from the United States Government, due for delivery starting July 2021).\n\nThe NAF is also locally re-activating several previously unserviceable planes, the minister added.\n\nSimilarly, he said: \u201cThe Nigerian Navy has acquired close to 400 new platforms since 2015, including 172 Riverine Patrol Boats (RPBs), 114 Rigid-Hull Inflatable Boats (RHIBs), 2 Seaward Defence Boats (SDBs), 12 Manta Class/Inshore Patrol Craft (IPC), 3 Whaler Boats, 4 Barges / Tug Boats, 22 Fast Attack Boats, 14 Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), 4 Helicopters, 14 River Town Class, 14 House Boats and 4 Capital Ships.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn line with the president\u2019s directive, the Nigerian Navy has established a Naval Base Lake Chad in Baga, Borno state, as well as deployed 14 Naval Security Stations along the nation\u2019s coastline in areas prone to criminal activity.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari signed into law, in 2019, the Bill establishing the Police Trust Fund, which will significantly improve funding for the Nigeria Police Force. Nigeria Police Force launched a new National Command and Control Center in Abuja in 2019,\u201d he said.\n\nPorts\n\nThe minister also spoke on the completion of the new terminals for international airports in Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt; construction of new runway for Abuja and Enugu International Airports; presidential approval for four International Airports as Special Economic Zones: Lagos, Kano, Abuja and Port Harcourt as well as the approval for new private-sector funded deep sea ports, including the Lekki Deep Sea Port (construction already well underway, for completion in 2022); Bonny Deep Sea Port (ground-breaking done in March 2021); Ibom Deep Sea Port; and the Warri Deep Sea Port.\n\nDevelopment of Eastern Ports\n\nHe further said: \u201cIn December 2017, Calabar Port commenced export of bulk cement to Tema Port in Ghana; in 2019, three container ships berthed at Calabar Port, for the first time in eleven years; dredging of Warri Port (Escravos Bar\u2014Warri Port channel) completed in 2018.\n\n\u201cOn October 30, 2019, an LPG Tanker operated by NLNG, berthed in Port Harcourt \u2013 the first time ever an LPG ship berthed in any of the Eastern Ports.\n\n\u201cOn December 8, 2019, Onne Port received JPO VOLANS (owned by Maersk), the FIRST gearless and largest container vessel (265.07 metres) to call at any Eastern Port in Nigeria. On August 1, 2019, Onne Port\u2019s Brawal Terminal received MSC GRACE, its first container vessel since 2012.\n\nAgriculture\n\nOn agriculture, he said: \u201cThe Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP) of the Central Bank of Nigeria, launched by President Muhammadu Buhari on November 17, 2015, has made more than 300 billion Naira to more than 3.1 million smallholder farmers of 21 different commodities (including Rice, Wheat, Maize, Cotton, Cassava, Poultry, Soy Beans, Groundnut, Fish), cultivating over 3.8 million hectares of farmland.\n\n\u201cLaunched as a government-to-government partnership between the Nigerian and Moroccan Governments, in December 2016, the Presidential Fertilizer Initiative (PFI) produced 12million 50kg bags of NPK 20:10:10 equivalent in 2020, bringing total production since inception to over 30 million 50kg bags equivalent; and number of participating blending plants increased to 44 from three at inception.\n\n\u201cA partnership between FGN, AfDB Group, and other stakeholders, including IFAD and BOI.

It will also train 100,000 new extension workers,\u201d he further said.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nTelegram\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",
          "summary": "Since 2016, we have heralded every anniversary, as well as every end of year, by giving massive publicity to the achievements of the Administration.\nWe have leveraged our Town Hall Meetings, 18 of which we have held up to day, to showcase the achievements.\nWe have also undertaken media tours of federal government projects covering many sectors across the country.\n\u201cThe documentary, which will be updated from time to time until the end of the Administration\u2019s tenure, covers roads, rail, housing, power, aviation, agriculture, ports, bridges, health, fight against Covid-19, water resources and the economy generally.\nIt is therefore monumental that this Administration has achieved so much despite the paucity of fund,\u201d the minister said.",

Paschal Oluchukwu, expressed disappointment that \u201cdespite earlier signs and premeditations including an alleged audio voice note widely circulated on the Social media which alerted on the plan to launch a fresh offensive on our defenseless citizens, the Ebonyi state government took no action to protect and defend the victims of this recent onslaught.\n\n\u201cWe are greatly pained that helpless and hapless women, children and youths were cut in their prime in a dastard carnage that spanned for some hours while their victims were deep in their sleep.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, medical and health-care workers in various parts of the State are offering treatments to scores of victims who sustained varying degrees of injuries during the attack. They have also been calls for ebullient citizens to provide clothing and other essential materials to the victims many of who are stranded in the Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, AE-FUTHA, Abakaliki.\n\n\u201cOur anxiety over this sadly depressing attacks is made worse by the fact that the State\u2019s Chief Security Officer, Engr. David Umahi on whose shoulders hugely lie the constitutional burden of protection of lives and properties of our beloved citizens has largely down-played all sensible and reasonable warnings about the activities of killer herdsmen.\n\nWhile condemning the massacre in Ebonyi communities, the group decried and questioned the conducts and activities of the men operating under the EbubeAgu Security network, saying \u201cthe outfit has remained what we had feared- a deliberate, willful and willing tool in the hands of the state government to hunt down, hound and maim members of the opposition- PDP and other voices.\n\n\u201cRather than seek practical and viable solutions that can quell the growing unrests and attacks on our people, AESID wishes to reiterate that Umahi is so deeply stuck in his 2023 politics that he is rather empowering and emboldening the \u2018bad guys\u2019 to attack and kill those he considers his opponents.\n\n\u201cThis group consequently condemn the claim that the attack took place in Benue State and the attempt by the State government to further downplay or trivialize not only the latest attack on Izhi communities but the entire security affairs in our dear State. The silence of the Speaker and political class in Izhi land, nay Ebonyi State and their inability to condemn these attack including the desperation of Umahi and his cahoots in security circles to always exonerate the provocative Fulani herdsmen from blames where and whenever they occur in Ebonyi demands thorough probe by International security bodies.\u201d\n\nAESID however, called on the state government to change tactics in addressing insecurity in Ebonyi state.\n\n\u201cUnless perhaps he changes style and strategy on his current grandstanding and unbridled politicization of the security of lives and property of our people, AESID will continue to dump the blames of the killings of our people by marauding herders on the doorsteps of the Governor just as he continues to pay more attention and interest to his shadow-chasing 2023 political projections and campaigns!\u201d",

All the people who want power, whoever they are, you wonder what they really want. Whoever wants the destruction of the system will soon have the shock of their lives. We\u2019ve given them enough time.\u201d\n\nWhile recalling that hat he visited all the 36 states of the country before the 2019 general elections, Buhari said: \u201cMajority of the people believed me, and the election proved it.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: No Third Term Agenda, Elections Will Hold \u2013 Buhari\n\nHe promised to continue leading the country in accordance with constitutional provisions, adding that those misbehaving in certain parts of the country were obviously too young to know the travails and loss of lives that attended the Nigerian Civil War.\n\nHe added, \u201cThose of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand. We are going to be very hard sooner than later.\u201d\n\nThe President said the Service Chiefs and the Inspector-General of Police have been changed, \u201cand we will demand security from them.\u201d\n\nOn the dangers posed to future elections by the burning of INEC facilities, President Buhari said he would give the electoral commission all it needed to operate, \u201cso that no one would say we don\u2019t want to go, or that we want a third term. There will be no excuse for failure. We\u2019ll meet all INEC\u2019s demands.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the INEC Chairman said that so far, there have been 42 cases of attacks on INEC offices nationwide, since the last General Election.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe 42 incidents so far occurred in 14 states of the Federation for a variety of reasons\u2026.Most of the attacks happened in the last seven months, and they are unrelated to protest against previous elections.\n\n\u201cFrom the pattern and frequency of the most recent attacks, they appear to be targeted at future elections.

          "text": "The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has faulted the 1999 Constitution, calling for an amendment by the National Assembly.\n\nSpeaking on Tuesday in Lagos during the public hearing on the review of the Nigerian Constitution, Gbajabiamila said the National Assembly could only achieve the task after getting the inputs and support of the citizens.\n\nWhile noting that the document failed to address some critical national questions confronting the country, Gbajabiamila said there was an urgent need for the legislature to amend it.\n\n\u201cOur constitution falls short of this standard,\u201d the Speaker was quoted as saying via a statement issued by his spokesman, Lanre Lasisi.\n\n\u201cThe 1999 Constitution is the product of a hurried national compromise that we entered into two decades ago in order to ensure that the military returned to the barracks and that we returned to democratic government.\u201d\n\nParticipants at the 2-day public hearing included the Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Dr. Babafemi Hamzat, who represented Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu; members of the House of Representatives Special Committee on the Review of the Constitution; members of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ); Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC); representatives of political parties, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), youth organizations and market women.\n\nREAD ALSO: Buhari Meets With INEC Chairman, Commissioners\n\nGbajabiamila said though the current exercise is not the first of its kind, it might be the most important one in the nation\u2019s recent history as the decisions to be made would have far-reaching consequences for the future of Nigeria.\n\nIn response to the doubts expressed in some quarters about the exercise, he noted that there was no perfect constitution anywhere in the world, but that it was imperative for Nigeria to have a near-perfect constitution to enable the country to confront and resolve many of its political, economic and socio-cultural challenges.\n\nThe Speaker, therefore, urged Nigerians to participate fully in the ongoing process so that their inputs would be captured for the country to have a new direction, adding that they could not afford to miss the opportunity of addressing their challenges and sustaining their future at this critical moment.\n\nHe assured Nigerians of the sincerity of purpose of the 9th National Assembly to deliver a reviewed constitution that everyone would be proud of.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe foundational constitution of the United States of America deemed people of colour to be \u2018less than\u2019 and denied women the right to vote. It did not include any limits on the President\u2019s term of office and allowed for citizens to be denied the right to vote for failure to pay the \u2018poll tax\u2019. Twenty-seven reviews and amendments, over one hundred years cured these and other defects.\n\n\u201cNo nation in the world has a perfect constitution, but we need a near-perfect constitution in Nigeria and we can achieve that through substantive amendments that significantly alter the character of our nation.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the task before us now is to use this process of review and amendment to devise for ourselves a constitution that resolves the issues of identity and political structure, of human rights and the administration of government, resource control, national security and so much else, that have fractured our nation and hindered our progress and prosperity.\n\n\u201cOur job is to produce a constitution that turns the page on our past, yet heeds its many painful lessons. It is not an easy task, but it is a necessary and urgent one.\u201d",

          "text": "The doors of Heirs Insurance Limited and Heirs Life Assurance Limited were on Tuesday officially opened for business in Lagos. The ceremony also saw the unveiling of the Heirs Towers, a new edifice by Heirs Holdings.\n\nThe event had in attendance, the Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu; the Commissioner for Insurance, Mr. Sunday Thomas; Chairman of Heirs Holdings and Founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation, Mr. Tony Elumelu; bank chief executives as well as other business executives.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Elumelu who is the Chairman of Heirs Insurance, thanked the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) for granting operating licences to both organisations.\n\nHe pledged to deepen insurance penetration in the country as well as change the insurance landscape.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet me say that the journey that started seven years ago has finally materialised. It is good when our policymakers, regulators and public sector leaders begin to understand that for us to eradicate poverty, both the private and public sector must work together.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, by approving the licences for both companies, the regulator has helped to create more jobs in the country and improve the country\u2019s tax revenue.\n\nHe stated that over the years, Nigerians have been yearning for insurance companies that will offer excellence and superior services, which would be digitally-driven.\n\nHe added: \u201cThese are what Heirs Insurance and Heirs Life Assurance would bring to our people. I want to say to you (Thomas) as our regulator, we have a track record of governance, best tradition of compliance and making sure that you (Thomas) looking back even when you retired, you will be very proud that you signed off these licences for these two companies.\n\n\u201cTo the general public, we believe that our economy is the biggest in Africa, yet insurance-to-Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is insignificant. We need to work with the regulator and other stakeholders to make sure that insurance-to-GDP improves. In most other economies, insurance companies own banks.\n\n\u201cFinally, I want to say that we are coming with a strong track record, not just on governance, but on business success and business turn around and most importantly, wealth creation for all. We believe that prosperity should be democratised; success for us will not only be felt by the shareholders, but would be felt by everybody, including our communities as we strive to eradicate poverty.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Sanwo-Olu, who commended Elumelu, said coming out of the pandemic, there was need for increased collaboration with the private sector.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe need to encourage the private sector because they are the real engines of growth; we need to acknowledge that no matter how well the government does, we certainly cannot employ everybody that needs to be employed and the private sector are the ones that can create opportunities for our businesses and they are the ones that can grow the GDP.\n\n\u201cHeirs Insurance and Heirs Life are bringing freshness and new beginning to the sector and they have said to us that they are going to be simple, they are going to use technology to drive insurance and that it is going to be affordable.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that Heirs Life and Heirs Insurance would certainly change the insurance landscape. With the array of men on the board and management team, it is clear to me that you will bring your wealth of experience to drive this company and take this sector to greater heights.\u201d\n\nThomas also commended Elumelu over his decision to play in the insurance sector as well as his decision to contribute to building the insurance sector.\n\n\u201cThe timing of this launch could not have been more auspicious in view of the fact that NAICOM has been rolling out various developmental initiatives aimed at deepening insurance penetration in the country. With the capitalisation of these companies (Heirs Life and Heirs Insurance), I have no doubt that the Nigerian insurance market is poised to write big ticket risks.\n\n\u201cWe want to minimise outflows and conserve foreign exchange for national development. Let me quickly state that the commission expects that the affairs of these companies would be conducted in consonance with extant insurance sector corporate governance guidelines and other directives.\n\n\u201cThe independence of the board and its committees, including ensuring adequate disclosures and transparency are required of these companies. Let me state here that the commission is now more determined to ensure professionalism and high ethical standards to protect the integrity of the Nigerian insurance industry,\u201d Thomas added.\n\nIn her contribution, the Acting MD/CEO, Heirs Insurance, Dr. Adaobi Nwakuche, said: \u201cWe are delivering insurance that is easy to understand, quick and reliable, simplifying our customers\u2019 lives. Our mission is simple: make insurance accessible.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to transform customer service: cutting waiting time in claims processing and purchase to bare minutes \u2014 across all touchpoints, including mobile devices. At Heirs Insurance, we want to give our customers what they have so often lacked \u2013 high quality insurance, at an affordable price \u2013 and with an insurer that is on their side.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the MD/CEO, Heirs Life, Niyi Onifade, said: \u201cOur goal is to integrate life insurance products into people\u2019s daily lives to create financial inclusion and bring quality financial services to the many, not just the few.\n\n\u201cThis way, we empower people to live more confidently and achieve their dreams, whilst securing the future of their loved ones. Heirs is all about giving our clients financial security. As people build wealth, we want them to know that they have a partner in Heirs Life, providing financial support throughout their life.\u201d\n\nObinna Chima",

Nevertheless, bilateral conversations are ongoing to see how we can access the surplus vaccines being stockpiled by developed countries,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that the federal government was collaborating with 33 embassies and high commissions in Nigeria on how to secure more supplies of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nHe added that the federal Ministry of Health was working with critical stakeholders to fast-track the establishment of local vaccine production plants in Nigeria so as to provide alternative supply of vaccines.\n\nOn the state of vaccination in the country, he said 73,465 Nigerians had so far received their second dose.\n\nShuaib said Buhari and Osinbajo did their second doses on Saturday, May 29.\n\nSimilarly, he said many state governors, members of the legislature, traditional and religious leaders had publicly started taking the second dose of their vaccinations.\n\nSpeaking on the reports of adverse effects of the vaccine, Shuaib said there had been cases of mild, moderate and severe Adverse Events Following Immunisations (AEFIs) since the rolled out of Covid-19 vaccination on March 15, 2021.\n\nHe added that the AEFls symptoms ranged from pain and swelling at site of vaccination to more serious symptoms such as headaches, abdominal pain, fever, dizziness and allergic reactions.\n\nAccording to him, \u201ca total of 10,027 cases of mild AEFI have been reported as of May 30, while 86 cases of moderate to severe incidents have been reported.

          "title": "Revival of Cotton, Textile Industries Critical for Nigeria\u2019s Economic Recovery: Central Bank Chief Emefiele",
          "text": "The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, on Tuesday described the revival of the Cotton, Textile and Garment (CTG) sector as crucial for strengthening economic recovery, boosting employment and creating wealth for Nigerians.\n\nEmefiele, at a meeting in Abuja with critical stakeholders in the CTG sector also said the CBN\u2019s intervention in the sector had led to the creation of 620,000 direct and indirect jobs since the efforts to reposition the sector began in 2019.\n\nThe apex bank has disbursed a total of N44 billion between 2019 and 2020 across the CTG value chain while monitoring recovery over the period.\n\nEmefiele, while listing other gains from CBN\u2019s intervention programme in the sector, said nine ginneries had been resuscitated while cotton had been ginned all-year- round for the first time in 10 years.\n\nHe said the bank financed over 278,500 hectares in 2019 and 2020, adding that over 90,000 Metric Tonnes (MT) of cotton seed was harvested while industry capacity of ginneries increased from an average of 19 per cent to 51 per cent.\n\nHe said the textile sector got 100 per cent of its major raw materials (cotton lint) at a CBN- subsidised rate of N440,000 as against the market price of N593,000, adding that the industry has an increase in production of over 10 million meters of yarn materials.\n\nAt the meeting, which was convened to among other things, deliberate on the current state of the industry as well as chart the way forward, Emefiele told stakeholders that the uniformed services had started to patronise locally-made textiles for their uniforms while the garment industry received orders for production of uniforms and cotton hand bags.\n\nHe stated that the CBN\u2019s engagement with uniformed services has further resulted in no fewer than five agencies partnering with local textile manufacturers.\n\nEmefiele, represented by CBN Deputy Governor, Corporate Services Directorate, Mr. Edward Adamu, stated that the bank is currently collaborating with some private stakeholders towards improving the quality of seeds to guarantee high yields.\n\nHe added that textile companies have been supported in the last two to three years, leading to the revival of some previously moribund ones.\n\nEmefiele, however, said for the 2021 wet season, plans were underway with the involvement of ginneries to integrate backwards by cultivating an average of 53,100 hectares with an estimated output of 106,200 metric tonnes at two metric tonnes per hectare.\n\nAccording to him, the CBN is also working with prime anchors for 10,000 hectares of land with estimated output of 20,000 metric tons.\n\nHe stated that the bank would be working with associations to cultivate about 80,000 hectares with an average output of 120,000 metric tonnes at 15 metric tonnes per hectare.\n\nHe, however, said while some progress had been recorded, more work needed to be done as opportunities for higher capacity utilisation in textile and garment companies as well as ginneries abound.\n\nHe explained that the main objective of the engagement was to \u201ceffectively engage with all stakeholders to identify the pain points inhibiting the realisation of the major potentials of the CTG sector intervention and develop strategies to achieve the desired impact of the intervention.\u201d\n\nEmefiele added that the CBN remained committed to ensuring the successful implementation of the CTG policy, adding that it will dedicate appropriate resources to drive its implementation.\n\nEarlier, CBN Director, Development Finance Department, Mr. Yila Yusuf, said the bank had disbursed a total of N44 billion between 2019 and 2020 across the CTG value chain while monitoring recovery over the period.\n\nHe stated that the main targets of the CBN intervention in the sector were to close the seed cotton gap of 450,000 metric tonnes by 2022 as well as increase the capacity utilisation of ginneries from less than 30 per cent to 80 per cent within same timeline.\n\nHe said the CBN also sought to reduce smuggling and dumping of textile by at least 40 per cent by the end of 2022.\n\nYusuf, represented by Head, Retail Contact, Division, CBN, Mr. Chika Nwanja, said the CBN had also financed over 200,000 cotton farmers, cultivating 291,761 hectares of land with an output of 94,787 metric tonnes of cotton seed.\n\nHe added that this has led to improvement in the household income of each farmer by an average of N240,000.\n\nHe said the bank had also financed 19 ginneries, four textile companies and three garment manufacturers under the textile intervention facility, resulting in an increase in the number of active ginneries from 13 in 2019 to 21 as at June 2021.\n\nHowever, the stakeholders unanimously lauded the CBN\u2019s intervention programme in the sector, describing it as unprecedented.\n\nPresident, National Cotton Association of Nigeria (NACOTAN), Mr. Anibe Achimugu, said the progress so far achieved would have been impossible without the apex bank\u2019s drive.\n\nAccording to him, the Anchor Borrower\u2019s Programme (ABP) remains one of the best agricultural interventions programmes of the CBN.\n\nThe President, Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Mansur Ahmed, said the CTG industry could resolve the country\u2019s unemployment challenges, adding that the federal government and the CBN have done a great deal to revive the industry.\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja",

          "text": "The Sultan of Sokoto and President-General of the Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, Alhaji Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, has called for the removal of the immunity clause in the constitution, saying it will compel leaders to live up to their responsibilities.\n\nHe also advocated a constitutional role for traditional rulers, saying it was time Nigerians talk frankly on how they want the country managed.\n\nAddressing stakeholders at the Kebbi zonal constitutional review hearing comprising Kebbi, Sokoto and Zamfara States, the sultan attributed the crisis in the country to the relegation of traditional rulers as they were given no constitutional role to play.\n\nHe said before the Nigerian nation came into being in 1914, the traditional institution had existed.\n\nHe said: \u201cOne of the controversial issues, which I feel strongly about is the immunity clause. When you are immune, nobody can take you to court as a leader and it means that you can do whatever you want to do. You can claim to be God.\n\n\u201cBut when that immunity is removed and you are made to live in a society where people are taken to court for abuse of office, I think our leaders here will wake up. Let us see how to tinker with that immunity clause.\n\n\u201cWill it be better to give immunity to a few people or remove the immunity so that all of us will be equal? It is another food for thought. So, please don\u2019t hold back, speak your mind on how you want this country to move on.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Plateau, Benue, and Nasarawa states have unanimously demanded devolution of power in a manner that the states will be given more powers and finance considering their enormous responsibilities.\n\nThey also requested that the state governors, as the chief security officers of their states, be given the powers to control the police in their states to enhance quick and rapid response to crisis and crime.\n\nThey decried the situation where a state police command has to get clearance from Abuja to respond to crisis in its domain.\n\nPresenting their memoranda at the North-central zonal public hearing in Jos, the three states also advocated a single tenure of five years for the president.\n\nPresenting the position of Benue State, representative of the governor, and Speaker of the Benue State House of Assembly, Hon. Titus Ugba, urged the National Assembly to grant the demands of people seeking creation of additional states.\n\nPlateau State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Chrisantus Ahmedu, and his Nasarawa State counterpart, Abdulkareem Kana, who toed the same line with Ugba on most of their demands, added that the three tiers of government could be reduced to two; comprising only the federal and state governments, such that states are given the resources to cater for the local governments.\n\nEarlier, while addressing the audience, Plateau State Governor, Hon. Simon Lalong, had urged Nigerians to be bold, sincere and patriotic in their submissions to the constitution review panel in their quest for a greater nation.\n\nLalong stated that the much-talked about restructuring will be considered to ensure that the agitations and anxieties being expressed are addressed.\n\nAccording to him, there are high expectations that this particular exercise will not go the way of previous ones which failed to address some key issues affecting the governance of the nation, leading to further agitations that are growing and in some way threatening peace, security and unity of the country.\n\n\u201cI therefore appeal to members of this special committee and Nigerians presenting memoranda at this public hearing to see this exercise as a very important duty which presents another opportunity for us to build a Nigeria that we desire to see. We should take advantage of the platform to ventilate and make submissions as to what we want injected or removed from the 1999 Constitution to make it more people -centred,\u201d he said.\n\nSegun James in Lagos, Christopher Isiguzo and Gideon Arinze in Enugu, Seriki Adinoyi in Jos, James Sowole in Akure and Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi",
