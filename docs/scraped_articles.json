          "title": "Lagos has special status: Let\u2019s make it official",
          "text": "Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State.\n\nBy Setonji David\n\nWHAT manner of special status for Lagos? The argument, to grant or not to grant, could easily have arisen out of avoidable misconceptions. Does any state in Nigeria hold the key to over 75 per cent of all manufacturing activities in the country? Or account for 70 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s maritime trade?\n\nIf a cog is thrown in the wheel of Lagos\u2019 progress, could any state replace 55% of all VAT revenue which accrues to the Federation Account from Lagos out of 36 states? If tax revenue is important for the system to work, Lagos alone generates over 82% of Companies Income Tax available to the Nigerian State.\n\nIf her economy slumps, if for any reason half of the jobs in Lagos were to disappear, is there an easy way Nigeria can absorb the army of jobless citizens that would be unleashed on the polity? Has Nigeria got the answer to any of these dilemmas that could easily be thrown up if Lagos were to become shackled by the starkly real threats to her development that are staring us all in the face?\n\nI imagine any of you, dear compatriots, somewhere in Paris or Hague, at an International Conference, listening to a speaker presenting city profiles as he latched onto Lagos: Lagos State\u2019s GDP is bigger than the rest of West Africa put together; if Lagos is a country, it would be the 5th largest economy in Africa. I imagine you smiling and nodding your head proudly and muttering loudly to a few people\u2019s hearing: \u201cLagos, in Nigeria. Lagos is in Nigeria.\u201d After all, the flag on your desk, which everyone could see, was clearly of Nigeria. Lagos stood for Nigeria, for our pride as Nigerians, for our backbone as the largest economy in Africa. Are we going to stand up for Lagos now?\n\nLagos, God forbid, may soon slide into a difficult state of intractable decline, developmentally. While the average annual population growth in the developing world is three per cent and Nigeria\u2019s rate is 2.7 per cent, Lagos has an annual population growth of staggering eight per cent. With a population realistically put at 24 million, Lagos is among the top 10 of the world\u2019s fastest growing cities and urban areas. There is an estimated influx of 10, 000 people, Foreigners and Nigerians from other states, into Lagos every single day. Lagos has been a willing host to all.\n\nNow, Lagos groans under the weight of its gargantuan responsibility towards all whom she has offered a home. A population growth challenge like Lagos\u2019 needs to be met with building more roads, providing housing, providing more resources for disposing solid waste, building more schools, providing security and health facilities. The then Governor of Lagos State, Governor Tunde Fashola, as far back as 2017, shouted hoarse that Lagos would require an investment of N6.14 trillion over the next 15 years to build and upgrade infrastructural facilities in the state for her teeming populace. Despite her commendable feat in IGR generation, Lagos is in want of a helping hand from the rest of the country. Is it wise to fold our hands and just look, do nothing?\n\nCity Mayors Foundation, an international think-tank dedicated to urban affairs, in 2011 recognised Lagos as among the world\u2019s 10 fastest growing cities. Lagos comes after Beeithai (China), Ghaziabad (India), Sana\u2019a (Yemen), Surat (India), Kabul (Afghanistan), and Bamako (Mali). As of today, Lagos is the only one on this list without a constitutionally recognised special status in terms of development attention. China designated Beithai as a \u201cSpecial Economic Zone and Marine Protected Area\u201d, India designates Ghaziabad as \u201ca national Capital Region\u201d and Surat \u2013a city of six million people in 2016- as a \u201cSmart City\u201d under an urban renewal programme funded by the Indian government. The other cities are political capitals.\n\nALSO READ:\n\nIf Nigeria did not move the political capital from Lagos to Abuja in 1999, the Federal Government, as before, would have continued to complement the effort of the state in providing jobs, housing and other infrastructural amenities to absorb the growth rate. But the capital moved. Should the Federal Government\u2019s social and infrastructural investment in Lagos have stopped? Even the federal roads in Lagos, for not getting priority attention, have constituted an acute economic drain and waste on the fortune of the state\u2019s development.\n\nA case in point was the utter neglect of the Apapa-Oworonshoki expressway, the lack of parking and loading lots for trucks serving Nigeria\u2019s two major ports, and the resultant gridlock. Property value in Apapa crashed, businesses relocated outside of Apapa and Nigeria to avoid being grounded, goods -imports and exports- and machinery were delayed beyond pardonable spells on this axis. Lagos suffered. And Nigeria\u2019s economy reeled from loss of port business to neigbouring countries, lower capacity utilisation in industries, lower company profits and foreign direct investment flight.\n\nLet it be known that other countries have moved their political capital before but most managed the developmental fallout with fairness. A few countries have more than one capital. Some countries have a political capital, as well as a judicial capital and a legislative capital. Malaysia has Kuala Lumpur as its official and royal capital and seat of national legislature, and Putrajaya as administrative centre and seat of national judiciary.\n\nThe Netherland and South Africa have their state functions spread likewise. The Netherlands has Amsterdam as de jure capital under the constitution of the Netherlands and Hague the Seat of government and residence of the royal family. South Africa has Pretoria as administrative and executive capital, Cape Town as the legislative capital and Bloemfontein as her judicial capital. These are decent efforts at making sure that the burden of development continued to be shared by the respective federal governments.\n\nAnd indeed when General Muritala Mohammed announced the proposed movement of the capital from Lagos to Abuja in 1976, he was aware of this moral and developmental imperative. He had promised that Lagos and three others \u2013Enugu, Port Harcourt and Kaduna- would be turned into centres of excellence to ensure developmental spread. Nigerian leaders today \u2013the Senate- can revisit this promise and start somewhere, where the need is greatest, by recognising and providing for Lagos\u2019 Special Status.\n\nThere had been two attempts, failed, sadly \u2013 for a bill to designate the state as special in terms of allocation of development resources due to its socio-economic significance and peculiar needs. The bill sponsored by Senator Oluremi Tinubu, the senator for Lagos Central Senatorial District, proposed a law that allocates one per cent of federally-generated revenues as special grant for Lagos State.\n\nIt was to compel the Federal Government to officially recognise Lagos as the country\u2019s commercial capital. Some senators did not see any need for a constitutional intervention and others raised arguments for special status for their own states. Needless to say, a good bill was drowned under the weight and noise of political posturing.\n\nIt is not that Nigeria ought to grant Lagos special favours. Rather, the Federal Government ought to support and encourage Lagos to grow in the many ways it had grown and afforded Nigeria greater tax revenue, greater GDP growth, greater number and quality of jobs for Nigerians of all tribes, and greater influence in the comity of nations. Let the derivable content of a special status for Lagos State change from \u201cspecial favours\u201d as presently perceived to that of fair share of stakes and opportunities.\n\nIt is equitable for Lagos to enjoy derivation benefit, as with oil producing states, in regard of her 55% VAT revenue contribution to the federal purse. It is fair for Lagos to receive derivation percentage of her 82 per cent contribution to the income tax revenue accruing to the centre. Prof Yemi Osinbajo was recently reported as revealing that all the 214 people who paid up to N 20 million each as tax per annum were resident in Lagos. That of another 914 who paid between N10 million and N20 million tax, only two were resident outside Lagos.\n\nIt is actually fair; reasoning from the angle of a Lagos many would claim belongs to all Nigerians, to allocate that one per cent of all federally-collected revenue to address development challenges of this microcosm of Nigeria.\n\nNigeria has only one Lagos. Just like America has one Big Apple, New York City, New York when hit with a disaster was not another American state. It was a rallying point for national awakening, vigour, action and affirmation. As Nigerians we have one state with the nature, character, significance and importance of Lagos. When Lagos is in distress we ought to listen. From all tribes and corners, from all works of life, we all have a part of us within the borders of this \u201cevery man\u2019s land\u201d \u2013 Lagos.\n\nThe Nigerian Senate and other stakeholders, can lead the way, reinvent Nigeria and her thirst for robust unity and development by showing that as a nation, we can collectively do the right thing in spite of the pressure to differ for personal reasons and parochial political interests. Let our federal lawmakers prove \u2013now- that our diversity is truly a basis for a strong progressive country.\n\nRecognise and confirm Lagos State\u2019s special status and let the attendant benefit revamp Lagos, speed it to becoming the major African hub of progress, commerce and development that the biggest city in Nigeria ought to be. This is for the well-being of all who reside in Lagos, for Nigeria\u2019s trajectory of growth and for the pride it affords all Nigerians.\n\nHon.

          "text": "..as PDP lamemts lack of solution to economic, security crisis\n\nBy Chioma Onuegbu, Uyo\n\nGovernor Udom Emmanuel has decried the deprivation of the South-south states of revenue due to them through the current alleged subsidy regime and the worsening economic situation in the country.\n\nEmmanuel who spoke at a meeting of South-South zonal executive committee of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, on Thursday at the Government House, Uyo, wondered why 72 dollars per barrel crude oil price, payment of salaries and wages still constitute difficulty in the country.\n\nHe said with limited pipelines to distribute the product to every part of the country and the poor roads network across Nigeria, it was surprising that the country allegedly evacuates 93 million litres of petroleum products every day.\n\nHis words, \u201cAs of today, oil price is 72 dollars per barrel, while our budget benchmark was less than 40 dollars, yet there is not a dollar in the excess crude account. Even our 13 percent derivation is not given to us.\n\nALSO READ: June 12: Delta CP warns against \u2018any form of protest\u2019\n\n\u201cThey say they are using it to pay for subsidy and we don\u2019t know those consuming 93 million litres of petrol every day. Tell me, what logistics do we have in Nigeria to support the importation of 93 million litres of petrol every day.\n\n\u201cEven during COVID-19 crisis, we were still paying for subsidy on daily basis, but there was no movement. Who were those moving with the petrol?, we don\u2019t know. All these, to deny us of the 13per cent derivation when we can barely pay salaries. And to construct a kilometre of road here takes about eight times the cost of making it in other regions\u201d\n\nThe governor who stressed that Nigeria\u2019s problem is not about political party but lack of sincerity on the part of those in leadership, commended the zonal EXCO for winning the trust of the party faithful to run the affairs of PDP in the South-south zone.\n\nHe reiterated that the South-south would remain the PDP strong hold, noting that PDP has not lost Cross River State, despite the recent defection of Governor Ben Ayade to the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nHe expressed concern that the people of Cross River State were at the verge of losing PDP which is the only political party that its governors have been able to showcase projects in the nation over time.\n\nHe reiterated that the rumour of his planned defection was a mere wish, stressing, \u201cthat the touch of excellence and capacity brought to bear by the PDP led state governments have a lot to do with the quality of people in the party\u201d\n\nGovernor Emmanuel also reiterated his position that the National Assembly should ensure speedy passage of the electoral Bill, because it is fundamental to the sustenance of Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nALSO READ: ESL: UEFA halts disciplinary proceedings against Madrid, Barca, Juventus\n\n\u201cTaking the nation on the path of constitutional review will portend a deliberate distraction, when the issue of Electoral bill which should assure Nigerians of their stake in the democracy is on ground. I call on Nigerians to defy partisanship in such issue of national interest.\n\n\u201cThough the Electoral Bill may not be a single solution to all of Nigeria\u2019s problem, it is a major step forward. Nigeria has tried democracy over the years as a borrowed system and with the level of success so far, it has become expedient to streamline the system\u201d, Emmanuel said.\n\nSpeaking earlier, the National Vice Chairman of PDP South-South, Chief Dan Obih lauded the developmental strides of governor Emmanuel, describing him as an asset to the party and the nation as a whole.\n\nObih decried the inability of the present federal government to proffer solution to the economic recession and insecurity crisis bedeviling the country, stressing that the country needs the PD to progress and move the country forward.\n\n\u201cThese are certainly not very good times. We notice that on a daily basis the naira is on a free fall. This country needs the PDP than ever before because of the problems that this government has not been able to solve. Nigerians need PDP; Nigerians need you and others to save our country\u201d, Obih asserted.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Rather, the Federal Government ought to support and encourage Lagos to grow in the many ways it had grown and afforded Nigeria greater tax revenue, greater GDP growth, greater number and quality of jobs for Nigerians of all tribes, and greater influence in the comity of nations. Let the derivable content of a special status for Lagos State change from \u201cspecial favours\u201d as presently perceived to that of fair share of stakes and opportunities.\n\nIt is equitable for Lagos to enjoy derivation benefit, as with oil producing states, in regard of her 55% VAT revenue contribution to the federal purse. It is fair for Lagos to receive derivation percentage of her 82 per cent contribution to the income tax revenue accruing to the centre. Prof Yemi Osinbajo was recently reported as revealing that all the 214 people who paid up to N 20 million each as tax per annum were resident in Lagos. That of another 914 who paid between N10 million and N20 million tax, only two were resident outside Lagos.\n\nIt is actually fair; reasoning from the angle of a Lagos many would claim belongs to all Nigerians, to allocate that one per cent of all federally-collected revenue to address development challenges of this microcosm of Nigeria.\n\nNigeria has only one Lagos. Just like America has one Big Apple, New York City, New York when hit with a disaster was not another American state. It was a rallying point for national awakening, vigour, action and affirmation. As Nigerians we have one state with the nature, character, significance and importance of Lagos. When Lagos is in distress we ought to listen. From all tribes and corners, from all works of life, we all have a part of us within the borders of this \u201cevery man\u2019s land\u201d \u2013 Lagos.\n\nThe Nigerian Senate and other stakeholders, can lead the way, reinvent Nigeria and her thirst for robust unity and development by showing that as a nation, we can collectively do the right thing in spite of the pressure to differ for personal reasons and parochial political interests. Let our federal lawmakers prove \u2013now- that our diversity is truly a basis for a strong progressive country.\n\nRecognise and confirm Lagos State\u2019s special status and let the attendant benefit revamp Lagos, speed it to becoming the major African hub of progress, commerce and development that the biggest city in Nigeria ought to be. This is for the well-being of all who reside in Lagos, for Nigeria\u2019s trajectory of growth and for the pride it affords all Nigerians.\n\nHon. Setonji , Chairman, House Committee on Information, Strategy, & Security, Lagos State House of Assembly, wrote from Lagos\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",
          "summary": "I imagine any of you, dear compatriots, somewhere in Paris or Hague, at an International Conference, listening to a speaker presenting city profiles as he latched onto Lagos: Lagos State\u2019s GDP is bigger than the rest of West Africa put together; if Lagos is a country, it would be the 5th largest economy in Africa.\nNigerian leaders today \u2013the Senate- can revisit this promise and start somewhere, where the need is greatest, by recognising and providing for Lagos\u2019 Special Status.\nLet the derivable content of a special status for Lagos State change from \u201cspecial favours\u201d as presently perceived to that of fair share of stakes and opportunities.\nRecognise and confirm Lagos State\u2019s special status and let the attendant benefit revamp Lagos, speed it to becoming the major African hub of progress, commerce and development that the biggest city in Nigeria ought to be.\nSetonji , Chairman, House Committee on Information, Strategy, & Security, Lagos State House of Assembly, wrote from LagosVanguard News Nigeria",

Any further action to take to the streets either on presumed peaceful protest will be counter-productive.\n\n\u201cThose bankrolling such moves should get their children and immediate family to embark on such protests as the South West cannot afford to lose their youths on a mundane and irresponsible protest that may likely lead to breakdown of law and order, killings and destruction of property, \u201d Animashaun said.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that June 12 is a significant landmark in the political history of Nigeria and the declaration of June 12 as Nigeria\u2019s Democracy Day by\n\nPresident Buhari in 2020 further buttressed the importance of the day.\n\nOn June 12, 1993, the country witnessed an election that many claimed was the fairest in the nation\u2019s history, however, the results of the election remain unknown as the election was annulled by the then military head of state, retired Gen.

Despite the many challenges we are facing, I want Nigerians to rest assured that we will secure this country.\n\n\u2018\u2018We will secure our infrastructure, our highways, our communities and our forests. We will secure the lives of our people,\u2019\u2019 it further quoted him as saying.\n\nThe president told members of the Nigeria Police Force that government would strive to improve their welfare and capacity, but added that the citizens equally had expectations from them.\n\n\u2018\u2018First, let me commend the Inspector-General of Police and the entire Force for the recent efforts to restore peace to troubled parts of the country.\n\n\u2018\u2018I have charged the Inspector-General to leave no stone unturned in rebuilding the morale of his officers and men, especially in the aftermath of the mindless violence associated with the EndSARS protests as well as the recent spate of attacks on Police Stations in some parts of the country.\u201d\n\nWhile commending the governor for providing the security equipment and assets, the president noted that it would go a long way in boosting the morale of the Police and further enhance the capacity to fight crime and combat criminality.\n\n\u2018\u2018This is even more touching in the light of the unwarranted violence that ensued in the wake of the ENDSARS protests last October during which the security architecture in Lagos State was severely damaged,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe president added that it was commendable that Lagos State, the Centre of Excellence, had shown a truly resilient spirit in the face of the massive destruction it suffered last October.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2018You did not allow yourselves to be deterred by the severe setback; instead, you have bounced back and already boldly rebuilding the confidence of residents and investors in the State.\n\n\u2018\u2018I acknowledge the initiative taken to kick-start the rebuilding process, through the establishment of the Lagos State Rebuild Trust Fund, and through this very laudable effort by the Lagos State Security Trust Fund.\n\n\u201cI enjoin other State Governments to emulate your bold, proactive and resourceful initiative.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe president also reiterated that government was taking its constitutional oath to secure the lives and properties of the Nigerian people very seriously.\n\nHe said his administration is conscious of the fact that lasting security is a necessary foundation for business, investment and true prosperity.\n\nBuhari declared that no federal government, since 1999, had been as committed as his administration toward reforming and repositioning the Nigeria Police Force and national policing architecture.\n\n\u2018\u2018In 2019, I signed into law the Act establishing the Nigeria Police Trust Fund, the first in the history of the Force, to provide guaranteed funding to support Police welfare, logistics and equipment.\n\n\u2018\u2018In 2020, I assented to the Bill amending the Nigeria Police Act, which was originally enacted in 1943.\n\n\u2018\u2018This new Act, a vast improvement over the old one, among other things, spells out the modalities for the implementation of a National Community Policing Scheme in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018This new scheme will build confidence within our local communities and make them active stakeholders in the safety and security of their environs.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are currently recruiting 10,000 Police officers to reinforce our personnel capacity across the country.\u201d",

          "title": "\u2026Vows to restore cattle routes, grazing areas across the country",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has said his administration would reinstate cattle routes and grazing areas across the country to ensure that herders have free access for their animals.\n\nHe also directed the military and police to deal ruthlessly with insurgents and other criminals across the country.\n\nBuhari, who expressed confidence that the order would yield positive results within weeks, recalled that he had in the past visited Chad, Niger and Cameroon as part of efforts to promote good neighbourliness and security at the nation\u2019s borders.\n\nWarning that the country might experience food shortage, Buhari said there was the need to decisively tackle insurgents who are keeping farmers away from their farms.\n\nThe president also defended the administration\u2019s appointments, insisting that there were made based on merit.\n\nThe president, who expressed the hope that Nigerians would be fair to him while assessing his administration, also urged them to question previous regimes on what they did with the nation\u2019s humongous earnings.\n\nHe spoke, yesterday, during an interview with Arise TV.\n\nIn apparent response to the ban on open cattle grazing by the 17 Southern governors, he said when the governors gave the directive that open grazing would be banned, he referred them to the gazette that makes provisions for cattle routes and open grazing areas.\n\n\u201cWhat I told the governors was to ask them to go and dig up the gazette. There are certain routes and grazing areas so that when cattle rearers were moving from the north to the west, they were allowed to go through there. But if you allow your cattle to stray into any farmer\u2019s farm, you are arrested and the farmer is invited to submit his claims. Those who encroach on these cattle routes and grazing areas would be dispossessed. The problem is trying to understand the culture of the cattle rearers. The Governor of Benue said I am not disciplining the cattle rearers because I am one of them and I told him that the Nigerian cattle rearer doesn\u2019t carry anything more than a stick or a machete. But I can tell you that we are trying to resuscitate these cattle routes and grazing areas.\u201d\n\n\u2022Anti-graft war\n\nBuhari said fighting corruption in a democratic setting is a difficult task to accomplish.\n\nHe, however, stressed that his administration had succeeded in easing out corrupt public officials without making noise about it.\n\nBuhari recalled that much was achieved in the fight against corruption when he was military Head of State in the early 80s \u201cwhen a lot of people were sent to prisons before I was also booted out.\u201d\n\nThe president frowned at the way and manner local government system was being managed, saying the local government administration was almost non-existent in the country.\n\nHe cited situation where state governors continued to starve the local governments of funds saying \u201cin a situation where N300 million is allocated to local government and they are given N100 million is not fair\u201d.\n\n\u2022IPOB like a dot in a circle \u2014 we\u2019ll defeat them\n\nHe described the Indigenous People Of Biafra (IPOB) as a dot in a circle, saying the group is isolated in its call for secession.\n\nBuhari said he has been assured by the elderly people and the youths from the South-South that they have no intention of seceding.\n\nHe said IPOB will not have access to anywhere even if they eventually secede from the country.\n\nThe president then reiterated his statement that IPOB members will treated in the language that they understand.\n\n\u201cI was encouraged by what I heard, nobody told me. Two statements from the south south: one by the elderly people, they said this time around there would be no (secession). And again the youth made the same statement; such encouragement.\n\n\u201cSo that IPOB is just like a dot in a circle. Even if they want to exit, they\u2019ll have no access to anywhere. And the way they are spread all over the country, having businesses and properties. I don\u2019t think IPOB knows what they are talking about.\n\n\u201cIn any case, we say we\u2019ll talk to them in the language that they understand. We\u2019ll organise the police and the military to pursue them.\u201d\n\nIPOB has been agitating for the secession of the South-East.\n\n\u2022Bandits in N/East\n\nOn activities of Bandits and kidnappers particularly in the North West and North Central zones, President Buhari said he had given the police and armed forces instructions to be ruthless with bandits and vandals terrorising innocent citizens across the country.\n\nHe said he had told the security agencies to treat bandits and other criminals in the \u201cthe language they understand\u201d.\n\n\u201cProblem in the north-west; you have people over there stealing each other\u2019s cattle and burning each other\u2019s villages.\n\n\u201cLike I said, we are going to treat them in the language they understand.\n\n\u201cWe have given the police and the military the power to be ruthless. You watch it in a few weeks\u2019 time there will be difference.\n\n\u201cBecause we told them if we keep people away from their farm, we are going to starve. And the government can\u2019t control the public.\n\n\u201cIf you allow hunger, the government is going to be in trouble and we don\u2019t want to be in trouble.\n\n\u201cWe are already in enough trouble. So we warn them sooner than later you\u2019ll see the difference,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBuhari dismissed the assertion that majority of Boko Haram members were foreigners.\n\n\u2022State police\n\nOn call for the creation of state police, Buhari revealed that two governors from the South-West governors visited him with complaints about encroachment by herdsmen on farmlands in their states but he urged them not to be idle but that they should work hard to protect their states because that is why they were elected.\n\n\u201cTwo governors from the South West came to be complaining about herdsmen encroaching on their farms and I told them that they campaigned to be elected, so they should go back and secure themselves. They cannot go round and win elections and think that someone will do their jobs for them, so I sent them back.\u201d\n\nOn the calls by Southern governors for devolution of powers, the president said if the three tiers of government were working as they should, there would not have been such social problems. He said the local governments which are under the control of state governors are dead, which he says is bad for the country.\n\n\u201cThe local governments are virtually dead and it is not good for this country because if your local government is supposed to receive N300 million, they will sign that they have received N300 million but they will be given only N100 million. So our local governments are dead.\u201d\n\n\u2022Anti graft war\n\nWhen asked about the success of the fight against corruption which was one of his campaign promises, the President said that fighting corruption in a democracy is more difficult than fighting corruption under military rule. However, he said that despite that, if anyone he receives intelligence about anyone in his administration, the person will be held accountable and eased out.\n\n\u201cCorruption fight is very difficult under this system and even under the military system and luckily I have experienced both sides. When I arrested people, I put them in Kirikiri and said that they were guilty until proven innocent. I set up investigation panels based on geo political zones for political leaders and civil servants. Then people didn\u2019t get positions until they declare their assets but what happened? Eventually, I myself was arrested and detained. I will not change but the system is making it difficult as a court case can take 10 years to resolve. But I assure that despite the problem we are having with the system, whenever we have intelligence about anyone, we would hold him accountable and ease him out. We don\u2019t give it to much publicity. We don\u2019t tolerate corruption,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Zoning\n\nOn zoning the presidency, Buhari said nobody has the power to decide for the All Progressives Congress (APC). He said only members of APC has the power to decide the party\u2019s fate while reiterating that the acting leadership of the party is working to reposition the party.\n\n\u201cThe hope of this administration is to see APC last beyond it. Therefore we should allow the party to decide. You cannot sit here in Lagos, for instance and decide on the fate of APC on zoning. The restructuring of the party has begun from the bottom to the top with the membership card registration. Every member of the party must be involved. We will soon conduct our convention. No single member of the party will be allowed to go against the wish of the party. The political party has to know how many mewmbers it has state by state. This the right step to go about. This administration under APC has achieved a lot. Go look at what was on ground before we came in and now. My succession plan depends on the party. The party will sit and make decision by the constituency they want and so on. So, those who want to be president should better join APC,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Merit\n\nThe president also reacted to criticisms of nepotism and appointing more northerners in strategic positions. He faced backlash after the recent appointment of the Chief of Army Staff, Yahaya Faruk, who was picked over many of his seniors who had spent more years in service and were forced into early retirement as a result.\n\nHe denied the allegations, saying that his appointments are based on merit, not ethnic balancing or federal character and that he cannot jettison seniority and merit for balance and federal character. \u201cPeople who have been there for 18 years or even for 10 years, they trained in Zaria or in Abeokuta, they come through the ranks. And because they served under all the circumstances, the crises and everything and they gradually rise to that status and you think you just pick somebody just to balance up? These positions have to be earned,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022DFI\n\nWhen asked about his administration\u2019s plans to make Nigeria more attractive for foreign investments, the President said that youths would have to behave well if they want better jobs. He also alleged that the EndSARS protests were attempts by Nigerian youths to remove him from office and attributed the loss of foreign investment to the protests.\n\n\u201cThis question was answered when there were the EndSARS protests. You remember the young people who wanted to match here and remove me. I have ordered the members of the executive council to go to each state to speak to the governors, the traditional leaders, the business people to tell the youths that if they want jobs, they would have to behave themselves and make sure Nigeria is secured. This is so that people can come in to invest because people know Nigeria is secured. We are a rich country, and God had endowed us,\u201d he said.",
          "summary": "President Muhammadu Buhari has said his administration would reinstate cattle routes and grazing areas across the country to ensure that herders have free access for their animals.\nIn apparent response to the ban on open cattle grazing by the 17 Southern governors, he said when the governors gave the directive that open grazing would be banned, he referred them to the gazette that makes provisions for cattle routes and open grazing areas.\nThere are certain routes and grazing areas so that when cattle rearers were moving from the north to the west, they were allowed to go through there.\nThose who encroach on these cattle routes and grazing areas would be dispossessed.\nHe said the local governments which are under the control of state governors are dead, which he says is bad for the country.",

T. Y. Danjuma, and Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, Senators Ike Ekweremadu and Enyinna Abaribe had urged the president to embrace the norms of democracy.\n\nOhanaeze recalled that Obiozor had at a world press conference in Enugu on June 4, reiterated the Igbo position that Ndigbo will not support break-up of Nigeria but Ndigbo will not be victims of Nigerian unity.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari has a choice between dialogue on one hand and an avoidable war against the Igbo on the other. Again, history shows that our thoughts are very infinitesimal to the immutable law of the universe.\u201d\n\nLeading Igbo groups, the Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) and Association of South East town Unions (ASETU) claimed Buhari had not repented in his avowed threat of annihilating the Igbo.\n\nADF advised him to play the role of a nationalist and a patriot instead of looking for excuses to play up his Fulani supremacist agenda.\n\nOn its part, ASETU said the statements from Buhari were troubling and not presidential.\n\nIts National President, Emeka Diwe and National Secretary, Gideon Adikwuru, who addressed newsmen in Enugu, said if the injustices against Ndigbo in Nigeria were erased today, the agitations will end the next day.\n\nIn his reaction, leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, expressed anger over Buhari\u2019s description of the South East as dot in a circle.\n\nKanu assured him that same dot in a circle will soon join the rest of the progressive countries as Committee of nations.\n\nReacting in a statement through the group\u2019s media and publicity secretary, Emma Powerful, Kanu: \u201cThe earth is also a dot within the galaxy.

          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nThe Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) has registered discontent with the level of recognition accorded Islam in the 1999 Constitution.\n\nThe bishops observed that Islam was mentioned many times in the Constitution, while no mention was made of Christianity, or any other religion.\n\nThe clerics stated this in their presentation to the Senate Committee on Constitution Review where they demanded for changes in the proposed constitution amendment to either give equal recognition to all religions, or expunge the recognition given to Islam.\n\nPresident of CBCN, Most Rev. Augustine Akubueze, who disclosed the position of the bishops in a statement in Abuja, yesterday, said of the 1999 Constitution: \u201cIn the first place there was no time Nigerians convened as individual stakeholders or as represented citizens to decide on or give to themselves as a binding law or constitution. The 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is a product of an imposition of the military.\u201d\n\nAkubueze said by granting recognition to only Islam in a secular state, the 1999 Constitution, had put adherents of other religions in a disadvantaged position.\n\n\u201cThe particular aspect we want to address for this constitution review has to do with the place Islam as a religion has assumed in our Constitution vis-a-vis our national life, to the extent that the 1999 Constitution put Christians and adherents of other religions at a disadvantage in any place with Muslim majority. Complaints abound on the lack of adequate compliance with the provisions of the 1999 Constitution of the against the establishment of any state religion, respect for the freedom of religion, including the right to freely change one\u2019s religion, and equality of all religions before the law. In particular, there have been complaints about the special bias, recognition and prominence accorded to Islam in the Constitution of Nigeria.\n\nThis should be redressed. To ensure peace and unity of the nation, there must be an end to the practically established status that Islam enjoys in our Constitution. Senate should see this constitution review exercise as an opportunity to give sincere listening ear to Nigerians to whom the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) was imposed on.\u201d",

          "title": "Buhari Approves More Personnel, Salary Increase for Police Force",
          "text": "\u2022In ARISE NEWS exclusive interview, president orders security agencies to be ruthless\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nHe stated that the removal of service chiefs and the appointment of officers, who have been at the theatre of operation and command the respect of fellow soldiers will ease the insecurity in the country.\n\nHe described the security situation in the North-east and North-west as overwhelming.\n\nHowever, he said the government was on top of the situation, adding that bandits are now being treated as criminals and are currently suffering heavy casualties but are unwilling to admit it for fear of losing their recruitment constituency.\n\nHe said: \u201cTry and appreciate what the federal government has done. One, we have removed all the service chiefs and the Inspector-General of Police; made new ones. We allowed them to go round and see the problem. They have been part of it all the time but now they are in charge and we made sure that their priority is to make sure they bring normalcy. They have to accept the responsibility of their offices and perform. We are working very hard on this but we cannot give it much publicity so that we can take the criminals unawares.\n\n\u201cThe problem in the North-east and the South-south we understand them, but the North-west, same people, same culture, killing each other, stealing each other\u2019s cattle, burning their villages.\n\n\u201cAs I said, we are going to treat them in the language they understand. We have given the military and the police power to be ruthless and you watch it, in a few weeks\u2019 time there will be a difference- because we told them, \u2018if we keep people away from their farm, we are going to starve and the government cannot control the public.\u2019\n\n\u201cIf you allow hunger to permeate the whole society, the government will be in trouble and we don\u2019t want to be in trouble. We are already in enough trouble. I can assure you that sooner than later you will see the difference.\u201d\n\nThe president reiterated his commitment to go after the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Eastern Security Network (ESN) by treating them in the language they understand.\n\nHe added: \u201cI said it, and we will do it. My statement about speaking the language (they understand) is very simple. It is meant for all criminals in Nigeria. What it means for the IPOB is that I will go after them through the military and police and rid them of their criminal tendencies. I have no regrets whatsoever\u2026..\u201d\n\nOn allegation that his appointments of service chiefs were lopsided as they did not reflect federal character, Buhari said he could not be forced to appoint unqualified people.\n\nHe added: \u201cYou\u2019re saying someone who has gone through military and police training all his life should not be appointed to lead the military or police department he works with just because we must balance appointments? What are you saying? The system didn\u2019t restrict anyone from joining the military or the police, and if you decided not to join, we will not force you, but you too will not force us to bring someone who is not qualified in training and experience when it comes to leadership of these institutions just because we want to balance some appointments\u2026\u201d\n\nOn the appointment of Chief of Army Staff, Maj. Gen. Farouk Yahaya, Buhari stated that he could not just pick anybody because of seniority, adding that he appointed someone who has been in the military, worked and fought with the soldiers, and is well known to them.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen you look at NNPC, military, the people who have been there for 18 years or 10 years, trained in Zaria, or Abeokuta. They came through the ranks and because they served under all the circumstances and they gradually rise to that status. Those positions have to be earned. There are people who have been there for 10 to 15 years. When you join, you go through the programme and you rise through the system.\u201d\n\nThe president also downplayed the concerns over which region will produce his successor, saying his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), has the final say on whether his successor will emerge from the South or the North.\n\nAccording to him, the APC\u2019s recently concluded membership registration is designed to rid the party of godfathers and give members across board a say in the party.\n\n\u201cWe should allow the party to decide. I have just told you that we have started from the bottom-up and I gave the acting chairman the end of June to submit a report on the convention we are going to conduct and then arrange the general election, all elections till 2023. We have started this from the bottom up so that members of the party will feel they are involved in decision making. Nobody is just going to sit in Lagos and tell them what to do. This is what we are arranging.\n\n\u201cSuccession plan depends on the party. We are going to leave that to the party. The party will sit and make a decision by the constituencies that they won and so on. So, those who want to be president, they better join APC,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari added that the controversial railway to the Niger Republic will be of immense economic benefits to Nigeria.\n\nWhen completed, he said, Nigeria would benefit from the import and export trades of Niger Republic, which currently go through Benin Republic.\n\n\u201cHow many rail routes do you have? You have to cultivate our neighbours. If you don\u2019t, you will be in trouble. If you could recall, when I came on board, I had to go to Chad, Niger, and Cameroon, which was what happened with Boko Haram. If we were not on good terms with the three countries, Boko Haram would have done worst things to us than this. About Niger, our border with Niger is about 1,400 kilometres. On Niger, I have to tell you this: the Europeans in 1885 sat down with ruler and pencil and drew lines and I say I have first cousins in Niger Republic. There are Kanuris, there are Hausas, there are Fulanis in Niger Republic, just as there are Yorubas in Republic of Benin. You can\u2019t absolutely cut them off.\n\n\u201cBut the rail, look at the plan, if you watch the plan and why we are constructing the railway. Niger has discovered oil as you know and we don\u2019t want them to go through Benin Republic. We want them to come through Nigeria. We hope that they will send through Maradi all their exports, through Nigeria rather than through Benin Republic.\n\n\u201cWith the roads and the railways working, those from Maiduguri to Port Harcourt, those from Kano to Lagos and so on, definitely, if you make the infrastructure, road, rail, work, I can assure you that Nigerians will keep themselves very busy and they will leave you alone.\n\n\u201cBut when the roads are not working, the roads are virtually crippled, people will have so much time to harass you,\u201d he stated.\n\nOn how he will spend his time after his presidency in 2023, Buhari said he would retire to his farm.\n\n\u201cI have never avoided my farm. I still have got a number of cattle. When I leave, I will still, go to my farm daily. I will try and keep myself busy. Between now and then, I will keep on convincing Nigerians that I mean very well. I will make sure that the few identifiable problems that we have, security, economy, fight against corruption, we will continue to work on it, and as I said, visibly, we have made progress in the North-east, we have made progress in the South-south but I am overwhelmed almost in the North-west and they are going to get it very soon,\u201d he added.\n\nAsked what will be his legacy, he said: \u201cI will like Nigerians to discuss it, I hope they will be fair to me. I wouldn\u2019t like to say it myself. I will like Nigerians to try and spend time when we came, both the security and the economy, where we were for the eight years I may be around and try to look at it, I hope Nigerians will be fair to me. This is all I need.\u201d\n\nDirects AGF to Recover Land for Herdsmen\n\nOn efforts by his administration to resolve the crisis of open grazing, which is the main driver of farmer-herder conflict, Buhari said he had asked the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, to recover designated routes created during the First Republic for cattle movements.\n\nAccording to him, the land will be recovered from persons who have converted cattle grazing routes to personal use.\n\nHe said the grazing routes were designated in the First Republic when \u201cNigerians use to obey laws\u201d but those routes had been converted.\n\nWhen asked if he agreed with the AGF\u2019s position that the 17 Southern governors lacked powers to ban open grazing, Buhari said: \u201cYou want me to contradict my attorney-general?\n\n\u201cWhat I did was ask him to go and dig the gazette of the First Republic when people were obeying laws. There were cattle routes and grazing areas. Cattle routes were for when they (herdsmen) are moving up country, north to south or east to west, they had to go through there.\n\n\u201cIf you allow your cattle to stray into any farm, you are arrested. The farmer is invited to submit his claims. The khadi or the judge will say pay this amount and if you can\u2019t the cattle is sold. And if there is any benefit, you are given and people were behaving themselves and in the grazing areas, they built dams, put windmills in some places there were even veterinary departments so that the herders are limited. Their route is known, their grazing area is known.\n\n\u201cBut I am telling you, this rushing to the centre (sic) so I asked for the gazette to make sure that those who encroached on these cattle routes and grazing areas will be dispossessed in law and try to bring some order back into the cattle grazing.\u201d\n\nHe also condemned the reactions of Benue State Governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, who had accused him of failing to take actions against herdsmen because they are his Fulani kinsmen.\n\nAccording to him, although he is a Fulani, Ortom is being unfair to him.\n\nHe said he had told Ortom that the herdsmen perpetrating the attacks were not Nigerians.\n\nBuhari added that the Tivs, which form the majority in Benue, and the Fulanis had been engaged in cultural conflicts for a long time.\n\n\u201cThe problem is trying to understand the culture of the cattle rearers. There is a cultural difference between the Tivs and the Fulanis. So, the governor of Benue said I am not disciplining the cattle rearers because I am one of them.\n\n\u201cI cannot say I am not one of them, but he is being very unfair to me and I told him that the Nigerian cattle rearer was not carrying anything more than a stick sometimes with a machete to cut some trees and feed his cattle but those sophisticated ones move with AK-47.\n\n\u201cSo, from other areas, people rush to Nigeria you know and Fulanis from Mauritania and Central Africa look the same. So, they feel they are the Nigerian ones and I assure you that we are trying to resuscitate these cattle routes, grazing areas and make them accountable.\u201d\n\nBuhari urged the state governors to also find a lasting solution to the problem.\n\nOn when his administration will restore the operations of Twitter in Nigeria, the president deflected, saying he would keep that to himself.\n\nAsked if it was time for state police in the face of daunting security challenges facing the country, the president said in the past the traditional institutions were effective in tackling security.\n\nHe added that recently, two South-west governors visited him to complain about herdsmen encroaching on farmers\u2019 land in their regions.\n\nHe said he told the governors that \u201cyou know these people more than I do, and you are democratically elected to protect your people. Don\u2019t sit idly expecting me to do everything, take action.\u201d\n\nFighting Corruption in Democratic Setting Difficult, Says Buhari\n\nBuhari also said that fighting corruption in a democratic setting was a difficult task to accomplish.\n\nAccording to him, the war against corruption has not been easy for him since he became a democratically elected president.\n\nHe, however, added that his administration has succeeded in easing out corrupt public officials without making noise about it.\n\nBuhari stated that much was achieved in the fight against corruption when he was military head of state in the early 80s, adding that \u201ca lot of people were sent to prisons before I was also booted out.\u201d\n\nResponding to the clamour for devolution of powers, the president lamented that the local government system has been killed, adding that if the federal, state and local governments are operated as stipulated in the constitution, the country won\u2019t be in a crisis now.\n\nHe said: \u201cBut the problem is the local government has been virtually killed and this is not good for this country because those who became the local government chairmen have been compromised. If your local government is entitled to receive N300 million and later you are only given N100 million and the chairman will keep quiet\u2026..is that how we will continue?\u201d\n\nMore Personnel, Salary Increase for Police\n\nMeanwhile, the president yesterday disclosed that he has directed National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission (NSIWC) to carry out an upward review of salaries of policemen.\n\nThe president also stated that 10,000 new personnel are being recruited into the force, declaring that no administration since 1999 was as committed as his administration in reforming and repositioning the Nigeria Police Force and national policing architecture.\n\nBuhari spoke yesterday in Lagos at the official launch of newly procured security equipment, including hundreds of patrol vans for the state security agencies by the Lagos State Government at the Parade Ground, Police College, Ikeja, Lagos.\n\n\u2018\u2018In 2019, I signed into law the Act establishing the Nigeria Police Trust Fund, the first in the history of the Force, to provide guaranteed funding to support Police welfare, logistics and equipment.\n\n\u2018\u2018In September 2020, I assented to the Bill amending the Nigeria Police Act, which was originally enacted in 1943.\n\n\u2018\u2018This new Act, a vast improvement over the old one, among other things spells out the modalities for the implementation of a National Community Policing Scheme in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018This new scheme will build confidence within our local communities and make them active stakeholders in the safety and security of their environs.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are currently recruiting 10,000 new Police officers to reinforce our personnel capacity across the country. In addition to this, I have directed the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission to carry out an upward review of Police salaries and benefits,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe reiterated his directive to security operatives to shoot-on-sight anyone found to be wielding AK-47 and other assault weapons.\n\nThe President also vowed that his administration will act firmly and decisively \u2018\u2018against any and all persons fomenting or carrying out attacks on our Police Force and other security personnel.\u2019\u2019\n\nBuhari warned that \u2018\u2018a nation that turns its Police personnel and infrastructure into targets of violence and destruction is a nation on the path of self-destruction.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018As Commander-in-chief, my primary responsibility remains the security of the country and the safety of all citizens. Despite the many challenges we are facing, I want Nigerians to rest assured that we will secure this country.\n\n\u2018\u2018We will secure our infrastructure, our highways, our communities, and our forests, and we will secure the lives of our people,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President told members of the Nigeria Police that as the government strives to improve their welfare and capacity, the citizens equally had expectations from them.\n\n\u2018\u2018First let me commend the Inspector-General of Police and the entire Force for the recent efforts to restore peace to troubled parts of the country.\n\n\u2018\u2018I have charged the Inspector-General to leave no stone unturned in rebuilding the morale of his officers and men, especially in the aftermath of the mindless violence associated with the EndSARS protests, as well as the recent spate of attacks on Police Stations in some parts of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Has a Choice Between War, Dialogue, Says Ohanaeze\n\nMeanwhile, the pan Yoruba sociopolitical group, Afenifere and the apex Igbo sociopolitical organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, in reacting to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s statements during the interview, faulted his position on some of the issues he addressed.\n\nAfenifere described Buhari as a person who has sheer contempt for Nigerians and is an unrepentant tribalist.\n\nHowever, Ohanaeze Ndigbo urged him to embrace dialogue, because he has a choice between dialogue and war in the handling of the crisis in the South-east.\n\nThe Ohanaeze Ndigbo asked Buhari to use dialogue instead of confrontations in tackling the challenge.\n\nThe organisation lamented that Nigeria has come to a critical juncture \u201cwith the present level of violence in Nigeria, armed robbery, banditry, kidnappings, unknown gunmen, herdsmen menace, Boko Haram, mass poverty, unemployment, the downward spiral of Nigerian currency and other untoward signals.\u201d\n\nOhanaeze, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Chief Chiedozie Alex Ogbonnia said both history and literature had shown that the decision taken by a leader at a critical juncture had a lasting effect on society.\n\nIt added: \u201cPresident Buhari has a choice between dialogue on one hand and an avoidable war against the Igbo on the other. Again, history shows that our thoughts are very infinitesimal to the immutable law of the universe.\u201d\n\nThe statement said Ohanaeze Ndigbo had followed with deep concern the security sequence targeted at the Igbo; namely: \u201cThe deliberate posting of Northern military and police officers at the various strategic locations in the South-east, the special National Security Council meeting, where major decisions were taken for the South-east and the South-south to the utter exclusion of security personnel from the South-east of Nigeria; the ominous launching of the Operation Restore Peace in the South-east and South-south, the Shoot-on- sight order by the Inspector General of Police targeted at the Igbo youths, and the shocking tweet where Mr. President stated that \u2018those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the agitation by IPOB became heightened due to the exclusion of the Igbo in Buhari\u2019s government, adding that the president has not in any way hidden his disdain for those that failed to vote for him en-masse in 2015 and 2019 general elections.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo has cautioned that the unprecedented lopsidedness of the Nigerian government in favour of the Fulani, to the exclusion of other ethnic groups, especially in the security architecture, will rather exacerbate the internal security challenges in the country. History shows that leaders who espoused ethnocentric ideology, especially in Africa, had often created more problems than they intended to solve,\u201d Ohanaeze said.\n\nIt described the agitation by Igbo youth over marginalisation as justified.\n\nIt, however, added that in spite of the orchestrated alienation of the Igbo, it remains committed to a diplomatic approach towards a restructured Nigeria that guarantees equity, fairness and rule of law.\n\nAlso, the Secretary General of Afenifere, Chief Sola Ebiseni, said yesterday while reacting to Buhari\u2019s interview on ARISE News Channel, that \u201cfirst, his arranged interview on Arise Television is not a substitute for the clamour of Nigerians that the president, as the father of the federation, should speak to Nigerians in these critical times. \u201cSecondly, his engagement was full of lies, inconsistencies, contradictions and utter disrespect for the ethnic nationalities, including their elected governors. He is pathetically unschooled in the constitution which he often claims to guide him in spite of its manifest flaws.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s claim that his appointment in the armed forces is based on merit and seniority and not to satisfy geopolitical zones, is a violation of the letters and intendment of the provisions of Sections 217-220 dealing with the armed forces of the federation and appointments thereto.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, Section 217 (3) provides that the composition of the officer corps and other ranks of the armed forces of the federation shall reflect the federal character of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn Section 219, all the powers given the president, including the appointment of service chiefs, is subject to the Act of the National Assembly ensuring the reflection of the federal character. Even his latest appointment of the chief of army staff, is flawed particularly on seniority.\n\n\u201cThe constitution never contemplates nor approve of the situation under Buhari where 90 per cent of the commanding heights of the armed forces and security architecture will be from only Northern Nigeria and only the two zones of North-east and North-west\u201d.\n\nAfenifere accused Buhari of taking delight in ridiculing the Ndigbo, which he used IPOB to represent.\n\n\u201cThus, to him, the Igbo and their territory is just a dot in a circle of the map of Nigeria, which even if they secede, could exit to nowhere since the elders and youths of the South-south had assured him of not being part of the secessionist agenda. He couldn\u2019t have been reacting to the IPOB but the Igbo who he said had businesses everywhere. His utterances were very un-presidential and in the mode of common expressions with some unidentifiable northern organisations.\u201d\n\nAfenifere stated that Buhari owned up to the statements of his media aide, Garba Shehu, that the ban on open grazing by the governors was illegal.\n\nIt said the president contradicted himself when he admitted that he asked two of the South-west governors to exercise \u201ca non-existent powers\u201d to deal with terrorists herdsmen who he acknowledged bear arms, even as foreigners against Nigerian citizens.\u201d\n\nAfenifere regretted that the president \u201chas no solution rather than the braggadocio of re-opening grazing routes in states by repossessing such lands for his beloved herdsmen.\u201d\n\nIt added that the Yoruba people are solidly behind their governors, adding that not an inch of land in the territory will be carved out for any grazing reserves.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022 Defends suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nMinister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, yesterday admitted that the federal government is exceeding its borrowing plan for 2021, blaming the development on the COVID-19 pandemic and the fall in oil prices.\n\nIn an interview with France 24, monitored by THISDAY yesterday, the minister said inflation had continued to heighten, worsened by an inadequate supply of foreign exchange, adding that the problems have a lot of multiplier effects on the economy.\n\nShe stated that the fiscal space remains tight now, but the federal government is re-planning, cutting down non-essential expenditures and providing resources where they are most needed like in the health sector.\n\nAhmed described as disturbing a World Bank report, which put a large portion of Nigerians under the poverty line, saying it was caused largely by the COVID-19 pandemic and fall in oil prices.\n\nHowever, she said the economic sustainability plan was targeting massive recruitment, health insurance, and a review of the poverty indices, to redress the setback COVID-19.\n\n\u201cOur fiscal threshold was that we shouldn\u2019t borrow more than 3 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), now we are at about 4 per cent of GDP and that\u2019s a target that we are trying to work on and bring down,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the revenue side, she stated that the target is to move revenue to GDP from the current 8 per cent to 15 per cent, adding that the 8 per cent is low for the size of the Nigerian economy.\n\nSpeaking on the ease of doing business, against the backdrop of the federal government\u2019s suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations, she said it won\u2019t affect Nigeria\u2019s image, as no foreign body should be allowed to cause war in the country.\n\n\u201cYou cannot shut out the president of a country and not expect consequences,\u201d the minister added.\n\nShe described the suspension of Twitter as a well-thought-out decision, saying it shouldn\u2019t affect the country\u2019s image in the eyes of international investors.\n\nShe said the move was \u201cnot something that we take lightly,\u201d and that the government had planned talks with the social media company over the issue.\n\nThe minister identified accessing available doses as the biggest challenge facing the country\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination programme.\n\nNigeria has so far only received four million of the 43 million vaccines it was promised by the Covax programme, according to the minister, who said the government expected to vaccinate 70 per cent of its population by next year.\n\nThe country\u2019s economy went into recession in 2020, largely due to a drop in oil prices, but Ahmed hoped for a strong upsurge in growth by the end of the year.\n\nThe government is planning to create jobs with massive new investment in public works and low-cost housing, she said, while the extra spending would be funded by increasing tax revenue and improving tax collection process.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Pompeo Tackles FG, Says 1,500 Christians Killed in 2021",
          "text": "Ejiofor Alike\n\nThe immediate past United States Secretary of State, Mr. Mike Pompeo, has said that no fewer than 1,500 Christians have been killed in Nigeria since the beginning of 2021, while others are being held hostage.\n\nPompeo, who is also a former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, (CIA), in an article titled, \u2018The Persecution of Christians in Nigeria Demands Our Attention,\u2019 which was published by the American Centre for Law and Justice (ACLJ) on Wednesday, accused the federal government of not doing enough to protect religious freedom.\n\nHe said the Nigerian government had downplayed the attacks on Christians, by characterising them as conflicts between herders and farmers rather than as religiously motivated acts of terror.\n\n\u201cAt least 1,500 Christians have already been killed in Nigeria during 2021, and even more, have been kidnapped and are either being held hostage or trafficked. The attacks are brutal. Armed radical Islamic groups arrive in a village during the night, kill the men, rape and murder the women, and kidnap the children. The Nigerian government thus far has sought to downplay the attacks, characterising them as conflicts between herders and farmers rather than as religiously motivated acts of terror,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged the federal government to hold terrorists accountable for such characterisations.\n\nHe stated that since \u201cNigeria has the largest Christian population of any African country \u2013 over 80 million, nearly half of its people \u2013 it is essential that this persecution is snuffed out before it becomes even worse.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, every single day in Nigeria, Christians are not allowed their right to religious freedom, and are being murdered because of their faith in Jesus.\n\nHe said no society that denied its people the right to worship according to their beliefs, or that allowed that right to come under attack without consequence could claim to be truly good.\n\nPompeo said: \u201cWhere religious freedom is denied or ignored, you can be sure that tyranny and oppression are soon to follow. That is why a foreign policy that takes seriously the issue of ensuring religious freedom around the world is critical to serving America\u2019s interests. It is why the ongoing persecution and martyrdom of Christians in Nigeria demands our attention and action.\u201d\n\nHe said in 2018, 110 schoolgirls were kidnapped by Boko Haram, and when a deal was sealed to free most of the girls, only one was held back, Leah Sharibu.\n\n\u201cThis unbelievably brave and faithful girl refused to renounce her faith as a Christian; and for that reason, Boko Haram refused to release her and condemned her to slavery. Three years later, she is still being held as a slave by this cowardly terrorist cell in North-east Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nPompeo described Sharibu\u2019s story as tragic, infuriating, and emblematic of a troubling trend of Christian persecution in Nigeria.\n\nCiting Open Doors\u2019 Country Report, Pompeo said more Christians were murdered for their faith in Nigeria than in any other country in the world.\n\nAccording to him, the number of Christians murdered in Nigeria increased by 60 per cent in 2020.\n\nHe said he had personally met with Christian Nigerian leaders and heard their tragic stories of those who had been persecuted because of their faith.\n\nPompeo stated that during the Trump administration took the important first steps toward dealing with this serious issue in December 2020, when it added Nigeria to the State Department\u2019s \u201cCountries of Particular Concern\u201d (CPC) list.\n\nHe said the work done by the ACLJ was informative for the State Department when it began to evaluate whether or not to designate Nigeria as a CPC.\n\nHe said the team at the State Department recognised that the \u201cNigerian government was tolerating the systematic, ongoing, egregious violations of the religious freedom of its people, allowing them to suffer at the hands of radical Islamic terror.\u201d\n\nPompeo said the designation signaled to the Nigerian government that swift action on their part was needed to end the persecution, or there would be further consequences in the form of sanctions and increased diplomatic pressure.\n\nAccording to him, such a designation was part of the broader Trump administration\u2019s approach to take seriously violations of religious freedom around the world, which also included declaring the brutal policies of the Chinese Communist Party toward Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang as genocidal.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the tragedy in Nigeria persists,\u201d he added.\n\nPompeo said the ACLJ was actively engaged in the effort to raise awareness of and demand action regarding the ongoing atrocities committed against Christians in Nigeria.\n\nThe ACLJ, according to him, has filed its 18th written submission and made critical oral interventions at the UN Human Rights Council regarding the plight of Christians in Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m eager to engage in this work with them as we seek to put a stop to these ongoing tragedies. What is happening to Christians in Nigeria warrants serious action. America has always stood as a beacon for freedom, and we can only back up that responsibility if we take seriously our obligation to stand up for the rights of religious believers around the world. American civil society and the American government need to hold the Nigerian government accountable for its inaction in allowing terrorist organisations like Boko Haram to fester in their nation.\n\n\u201cIf the problem is allowed to persist, it will only spread and become worse throughout Africa and around the world. The killing must end.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Under normal circumstances that would have been considered an easy task to undertake. However, given that the circumstances in our times can no longer be considered normal in the light of the level of violence, criminality and divisiveness which is now our daily experience, the undertaking becomes a challenge and a dilemma. There was a time that some of our leaders especially in the military era would glibly tell us that Nigerian unity is non-negotiable. Most people in the present situation we find ourselves will consider such an affirmation not only hollow but clearly now as uninformed and ignorant. This situation would not have arisen five, ten or twenty years ago. So what went wrong and why?\u201d- Professor Anya. O.

Those familiar with this history will recall that at the institution of the Aare Ona Kakanfo in the sixteenth century, the first title holder of the unique institution was Kokoro Igangan. The warlord was said to hail from Iwoye but my gut feeling is that the coincidence of his name with the ancient town of Igangan was not accidental. The appointment was reserved for the best acclaimed warlord of the day and could be appointed from any part of the empire.\n\n\u2018It is a title akin to a field marshal, and is conferred upon the greatest soldier and tactician of the day. After installation, the Kakanfo leaves Oyo, the Alaafin\u2019s city for his own domain; it is forbidden that the Kakanfo and the Alaafin live together in the same town. In addition, the Kakanfo is required to wage war against any peoples and territories at the behest of the Alaafin, and is expected to win, or return a corpse\u2019. Like so many cultural innovations, the institution was a testimony to the sophistication of the Oyo Empire. And, ironically, when the empire was going to unravel, the Kakanfo (in the person of Afonja) proved to be its nemesis.\n\nIn a manner of speaking and given the rapid political retrogression of Nigeria back into its precolonial ethno national elements, the Yoruba appears to be reliving this history especially in the aspect of securing the realm against external aggression. It is what has given rise to warlordism encapsulated in the Sunday Igboho phenomenon. And we now talk more of charms than bullets as an instrument of prosecuting local wars.\n\nIn the contemporary experience of the savage humiliation to which the Yoruba have been subjected right in their regional homestead, there is not much that is exceptional about Igangan. What is exceptional was the long imagined retributory response mounted by a counter Yoruba militia spearheaded by Igboho. Hitherto pummelled and stupefied into inaction and self-pity and endlessly betrayed by a conniving (by omission or commission) Nigerian security forces, the response captured the imagination of the Yoruba community and ignited a spirit of militant nationalism. In the circumstance, the Igboho embodied rebellion was a direct consequence of this connivance (running the gamut of wilful neglect and covert complicity) of a compromised Nigerian security establishment.The Alaafin of Oyo recently lamented the futility of seeking the law and order intervention of the Nigerian police into crimes involving the fulani who appeared to enjoy a licence to impunity and would sooner be spared of any penalty regardless the severity of the crime at issue. It was a fraught situation that brought to the fore the legitimate imperative of recourse to self-help and self-defence.\n\nGeneral Theophilus Yakubu Danjuma had captured the moment a few years ago: \u201cThe armed forces are not neutral. They collude with the armed bandits that kill people, kill Nigerians. They facilitate their movement. They cover them\u2026If you are depending on the armed forces to stop the killings, you will die one by one,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe ethnic cleansing must stop in Taraba State. It must stop in all the states of Nigeria, otherwise Somalia will be a child\u2019s play. I ask everyone of you to be at alert and defend your country, defend your territory, defend your state. You have nowhere else to go,\u201d he further added.\n\nTaking the cue in Igangan, the compound and properties (including several luxury vehicles) of the suspected godfather of the Fulani kidnap-for-ransom-consortium, the Seriki Fulani were torched and burnt down. He was declared persona non grata and banished from the community along with his proteges and sundry field operatives. There was bound to be a reprisal attack and the surprise was that when it came, it caught both the Igboho guerilla army and the regular security forces pants down. More shocking was the disproportionate scale of the violence, in magnitude and sheer savagery, reminiscent of the Fulani militia campaign of terror and pacification in the Middle Belt region. Obadiah Mailafia sounded the early warning system.\n\nAbout a week ago, the Oyo State Amotekun Commander, Kunle Togun, similarly raised the alarm (that the worst is yet to come) that was more remarkable for its potential to obfuscate and misdirect. There was an inherent exculpation of domestic Nigerian component in his obsessive attribution of all that is going awry in the South-west to non-Nigerians. \u201cThe foreign Fulani herdsmen have invaded South-west. There is nowhere in the South-west that they are not. They are there. \u201cThey are the Okada riders. They are the ones using wheelbarrows to sell carrots and other things. I said they are foot soldiers. They said they have come in to take the inheritance given to them by Allah and that is Nigerian land, particularly South-west. So, they will still strike. I am not just screaming aloud. So, everybody has to be ready\u201d. The question then arises, is the Seriki Fulani of Igangan a foreigner? Are his accomplices including the notorious Wakili from Mali and Niger? To the contrary, many of those caught have identified and have been identified as Fulani with deep roots in Nigeria including, for that matter, the Yoruba society (especially Ilorin) dating back generations.\n\nAdding to the confusion is the enactment (of the precedent of Moses and the Israelites) who were given to renouncing their liberation at the encounter of any difficulties in their journey to freedom. And so, with the savage reprisal attack on Igangan has come the criticism and strictures blaming Igboho for initiating the rebellion to begin with. In the affectation of wisdom and sobriety and beyond the specific instance of Igangan, there have been remonstrations from those who identify with the status quo that coming to terms with cohabitation in hell can be a better option than the uncertain promise of heaven. As if anyone has cultivated belligerence and bellicosity as second nature and goes around looking for war as hobby. Short of the philosophy of turning the other cheek it is difficult to see what options are left for the oppressed confronted with the perennial menace of a murderous bully. In all of this, there is the psychological injury to the victims. They are liable to wonder if it is conceivable that a group of Yoruba marauders would have the audacity to besiege Azare or Daura the way the criminal Fulani militia are running rampant over Yorubaland.\n\nIn what is fast degenerating to an unbroken chain of violence and terror, it is near inevitable that in one form or another, a Yoruba response to this reprisal attack on Igangan is on the way especially if, typically, no one is called to account. The continuous radicalisation and escalation of the cycle of violence raises the question of how all this harvest of ill-wind will end. President Buhari has announced his preferred option in a revealing tweet and it is straight out from the civil war conquistador playbook.\n\n\u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of thedestruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in\n\nthe language they understand,\u201d. First, the fact that the social media tech giant, Twitter, deems it fit to delete this tweet and cite it as \u2018abusive behaviour\u2019 towards the Igbo, tells a familiar story of Buhari. It corroborates his well documented penchant for violent verbiage. You will recall such bloody minded threats as the \u2018dog and the baboon will soak in blood\u2019. \u2018I can die for the cause of Islam if necessary. We are ready to fight another civil war\u2019. For those at the pinnacle of the federal alliance power structure that prevailed in the war, resort to this \u2018might is right\u2019 precedent is always a irresistible temptation. The perennial utility of the threat to \u2018national unity\u2019 has come in handy as a blank cheque on which any pretext for scapegoating a convenient victim and target can be requested. Those who like Buhari are given to hacking back to the civil war and national unity in this proprietorial manner should be asked what are the lessons Nigeria should learn from this defining tragedy. That any evil is justified in the self-serving pursuit of the distorted notion of national unity as an end unto itself? Shouldn\u2019t we be told that prior to the declaration of Biafra secession, another group of Nigerians were openly contemplating Araba and the other verbalised the intention to follow suit if Biafra becomes a reality? I have always held the opinion that (on the template of equity and justice) if the Igbo should be blamed, it can only be for not being in a position to actualise its justified aspiration. At the end of the day what made the difference was not the moral imperative of sustaining a desirable and worthy national unity but that a protagonist was in a position to enforce its will and the other was not. If Nigeria is ever to transcend this balance of terror predicate, it would have to learn that the road to enduring national unity does not go through the barrel of the gun and the imposition of unrestrained regional hegemony.\n\nQUOTE\n\nIf Nigeria is ever to transcend this balance of terror predicate, it would have to learn that the road to enduring national unity does not go through the barrel of the gun and the imposition of unrestrained regional hegemony.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Our primary objective amongst others is to promote peaceful coexistence and security of lives and properties, inrrespective of tribe, culture or party affiliation.\n\n\"The people Lagos state have suffered a lot during the #EndSARS protest. We can not fold our hands and allow any form of protest in the state that will be hijacked by unguided and scrupulous miscreants, especially when the country is facing security challenges.

You know that recently President Muhammadu Buhari honoured MKO but Ogbeni had been working on it. He had a one-man campaign on this issue for a very long time. And well before President Buhari was President, when we had President Jonathan, Ogbeni also approached Jonathan to make an appeal that MKO be honoured,\u201d Abiola-Costello said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI cannot remember which of my siblings told me this, but the sibling told me that they sat with President Jonathan and President Jonathan asked: \u201cwhat do you think should be done and how do you think it should be done?\u201d And Ogbeni offered his thoughts and President Jonathan said do you think it is possible because he had some concerns about backlash. So, it was not something that was carried out eventually.\u201d\n\nShe said Aregbesola also saw to the naming of a road in Ikeja after Kudirat Abiola, her late mother.\n\n\u201cI want to thank Ogbeni for neither forgetting my Dad and also my mother. You know that road, the Kudirat Abiola Road, Oregun in Ikeja. He was the Commissioner for Works in Lagos State that was responsible for that road. And this time around, I remember which of my siblings told me this story. It was Jamiu (Abiola) who told me that he (Aregbesola) would go to that road around midnight and find Ogbeni there with the workers getting the road fixed and ready. So, I just want to thank Ogbeni for the many steps he has taken to honour MKO and Kudirat Abiola,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOgbeni Rauf Aregbesola is one of my favourite people. I like his simplicity because when he was governor of Osun, I used to visit him and I observed that his life had some simplicity about it. And his wife, Alhaja Sherifat Aregbesola would tease me saying it was because she was raised in the North.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

          "text": "With decentralised digital currencies like bitcoin becoming increasingly popular, the world\u2019s central banks have \u2013 in the past two years at least \u2013 been working towards developing government-backed digital currencies.\n\nNigeria may pilot an official digital currency in 2021, going by the words of Rakiyat Mohammed, a Central Bank Director in charge of the Information Technology Department, who revealed on Thursday that the banking regulator will soon launch a digital currency.\n\nA Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) represents a country\u2019s official currency in digital form. As against printing money, the apex bank issues electronic coins and notes that are backed by the government, unlike existing cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria has made \u201ctremendous progress\u201d exploring the technology for digital currency for over two years now, Mohammed revealed at a press briefing after a meeting of the Bankers\u2019 Committee. \u201cBefore the end of the year, the Central Bank will be making a special announcement and possibly launching a pilot scheme in order to be able to provide this kind of currency to its populace.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes on the back of efforts by Nigerian authorities targeted at regulating the use of decentralised cryptocurrencies in the country. The apex bank in February directed all local banks to close accounts linked to crypto platforms.\n\nDespite the clampdown, Nigerians continue to use digital currencies as a store of value and remittance tool and in a change of tone, the CBN governor later clarified that crypto trading is not banned in the country.\n\nWhy would the CBN get into virtual currencies?\n\nAccording to the CBN director, about 80% of central banks in the world are currently exploring the possibility of issuing central bank digital currency and Nigeria could not be left behind.\n\nChina in April 2020 became the first major economy to pilot a digital currency and is working towards achieving a wide, domestic use of the digital yuan by the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nLast year, the Bahamas launched the world\u2019s first central bank digital currency. Other countries where national digital currency trials are ongoing include Indonesia, Norway, Japan, Sweden and South Korea and in Africa, Egypt, South Africa, Ghana, Morocco and Kenya are exploring the technology\u2019s feasibility.\n\nBeyond just following the global trend, there are lots of potential reasons for the planned rollout of an official digital currency in Nigeria later this year.\n\nThe CBN director particularly cited the need to make remittances travel easier from abroad to Nigeria as one motivation. \u201cWe all know how money has to travel for someone to send money from Nigeria to abroad and it is a huge money in Africa,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nWhen it eventually becomes operational, the digital currency will complement the existing forms of currency in the country and could help reduce the high cost of managing and transferring cash.\n\nDigital currency could also boost financial inclusion as those unbanked can get easier and safer access to money through their phone. A recent report by the Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFiNA) shows that Nigeria did not meet its financial inclusion targets for 2020 and at the current rate, they might not be achieved anytime soon.\n\n\u201cWe know that the recent report by EFiNA was that our target was to achieve 80% financial inclusion. We are about 60% and at the rate at which we are going, we are not going to meet this target,\u201d Mohammed said, adding that the Central Bank digital currency could \u201caccelerate\u201d the CBN\u2019s ability to meet this target.\n\nAfter the announcement, the apex bank will now explore technological options and engage various industry players, as well as move to the next stage of proof of concept to pilot the scheme, according to the CBN director.",

          "title": "What is a VPN and how does it work in Nigeria?",
          "text": "Virtual Private Networks (VPN) are all the rage right now in Nigeria since the government banned Twitter. The rise in popularity of VPNs has brought up questions about how exactly they work.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about how VPNs work.\n\nOn the internet, different computers send and receive information between Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Think of it as sending items between two or more physical addresses. When we surf the internet with our IP address, different websites will know specific information about us such as our location, device type, browser and operating system.\n\nWhat does a VPN do?\n\nWith VPNs, our IP addresses change and online activities are hidden.\n\nBefore turning on my VPN, my device was in Lagos, Nigeria\n\nAfter turning on my VPN, my device is in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\n\nThe images above show how my location changed from Nigeria to Dominican Republic after turning on my VPN.\n\nThink about it this way: The internet is like a highway that connects different cities across different countries. These highways are mostly public roads that many people use. If you drive on a public road anyone can follow you and track where you go, how long you spend at your destination, and when you return. They might even be able to spy inside your car and learn more about you.\n\nWith a VPN, you have your own private tunnel/road. A tunnel where no one can see what you\u2019re doing or where you\u2019re going.\n\nWhat can a VPN do for you?\n\nNo monitoring: As we mentioned earlier, your internet service provider (ISP) can see your internet traffic and probably log your browsing history. With a VPN, information about your activities online are scrambled in an encrypted tunnel so that external parties, your ISP included, can\u2019t read it.\n\nAccess any site: Every now and then, websites or services you want to use may be inaccessible from your location. VPN enables access to these sites or services from anywhere. If a website isn\u2019t available to devices located in Nigeria, VPNs can change your device location to a different country which has access to this website.\n\nProtection: Free public Wi-Fi might make you forget all your life\u2019s problems but it can also be the beginning of a new set of problems. Public Wi-Fi can easily be accessed by hackers on the same network, who can read your personal data. A VPN encrypts your entire internet connection to protect all your communications, even over unsecured networks.\n\nWhat is the difference between a VPN app, a VPN plugin, and a VPN browser?\n\nCurious about which you should use? VPN browsers or browser plugins only protect your web browser traffic. Note, however, that the rest of the network traffic from your device is still exposed to internet service providers and potential hackers. A VPN app encrypts and protects all network traffic from your device.\n\nIs it safe to use a VPN for online banking?\n\nYes\u2013 but ensure you are using a reputable VPN service. VPNs help protect your privacy while you perform online banking transactions. But remember, a VPN is a tunnel that encrypts your data. It cannot protect you from viruses or guarantee that you won\u2019t be hacked. Remember to create a strong password and adhere to online safety measures.\n\nWhat else should I know about VPNs?\n\nVPNs aren\u2019t without flaws. They have their fair share of practical drawbacks. Internet speed can be slower because VPNs have to reroute and encrypt your data while sending and receiving information between your device and a website.\n\nAlso, some sites and services look at VPN traffic as suspicious and won\u2019t let you connect. It becomes suspicious when a device is in different locations within a short time \u2014 in New York, Lagos and Tokyo within an hour. This could become a real problem, especially when it\u2019s your bank that blocks you.",

          "title": "#TwitterBanNigeria: Is it even legal?",
          "text": "On Friday the 4th of June, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, announced that the country\u2019s federal government would be suspending Twitter\u2019s operations within Nigeria. This came after Twitter deleted a tweet by the country\u2019s president where he threatened \u201ccivil war\u201d type violence on citizens of the country.\n\nFollowing this announcement, in the early hours of Saturday, June 5, Nigerian Twitter users found that they could only access the site with the use of a VPN (Virtual Private Network) which allows people to access blocked websites by masking their actual locations.\n\nThe loss of access formally took place after the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) issued a directive to all telcos and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) instructing them to restrict their users\u2019 access to the social media platform.\n\nWhile there are ongoing debates around how the ban affects Nigeria\u2019s digital economy and what it means for freedom of speech in the country, one issue that hasn\u2019t been addressed is the legality of this action by the executive arm of the Nigerian government.\n\nIn a democracy, various arms of government exist to work together and keep each other in check.\n\nWhile one arm makes laws, another enforces; but it is unusual for one arm to enforce a law that the other did not make. This is the situation in Nigeria today as the directive barring the use of Twitter is not currently backed by any law passed by the country\u2019s legislature.\n\nIn response to the Twitter ban, Malechi Okafor, a lawyer and managing partner at M & O Legal Services said, \u201cIt is unprecedented because we never thought we would get to a point where a democratically elected leader would try to take away the voice of the people.\u201d\n\nWhile he is currently a democratic leader, President Buhari, a retired army general and former military head of state, is not a stranger to muzzling the media as his regime in the 1980s was one wrought with media clampdowns.\n\nIn what seems like an encore performance, President Buhari\u2019s 1984 media clampdowns have taken a new form as the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, issued a directive on the 5th of June that citizens found still using Twitter were to be prosecuted.\n\nWith this we suddenly have two things to be addressed: was blocking Twitter legal and should people be prosecuted for carrying on tweeting with their VPNs.\n\nThe Almighty NCC\n\nIn my discussion with Imade Iyamu, a corporate lawyer at Banwo and Ighodalo, she shed some light on what actual powers the Nigerian Communications Commission has when it comes to telcos and ISPS.\n\n\u201cJust like the CBN has a lot of power over banks, the NCC has the power to issue directives,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the fact that a directive is issued does not make it entirely legal. This is why the courts exist, to allow citizens or concerned entities to challenge directives or actions performed by the government or its parastatals.\n\nSo to reverse the decision, we must head to the courts then?\n\nWell, not exactly. In Nigeria, the courts have been inactive for weeks as the court workers, under the umbrella of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN), have been on strike for weeks now. It has however been reported on Wednesday that the strikes have been suspended and the courts will reopen on Monday the 14th of June.\n\nJUSUN has very clear demands. In 2020, President Buhari signed an executive order mandating that state governors adhere to a provision in the country\u2019s 1999 constitution that gives the judiciary financial autonomy and access to a federal fund. The governors have ignored this.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly has a budget that they manage. The judiciary should have one as well to pay themselves and handle their affairs \u2013 to be truly independent,\u201d Okafor tells me during our talk.\n\nA truly independent judiciary would be the recourse of the people at this time but that is not something that is currently available.\n\nWithout the courts, the directive by the NCC stands unchallenged and while this is in itself a problem, the bigger problem lies in the directive issued by the country\u2019s attorney general and minister of justice.\n\nThen there\u2019s Malami\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t declare that people should be prosecuted without a written law,\u201d this sentiment expressed by Iyamu during our call is one I have heard from several lawyers both offline and on Twitter.\n\nThe directive issued by the attorney general is unlawful. That much is clear.\n\nOne of the tenets of a democratic society like ours is the idea that laws are deliberated on and passed by a body of elected officials \u2013 the legislature. These laws can then be enforced by the executive branch and interpreted by the judiciary. The attorney general falls into the class of the former but in this regard, he has no law to enforce. Just one he has made himself.\n\nTwo days ago, the country\u2019s house of representatives invited the Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, to ask questions regarding the Twitter ban.\n\nThere has been no official statement from the legislature regarding Malami\u2019s declaration that the use of Twitter will be met with prosecution. While VPNs provide momentary succour from the irrational directive of the NCC, Malami\u2019s push for prosecution might be harmful to citizens who continue to use Twitter as is protected by their right to free speech.\n\nSo, is the current Twitter ban with the threat of prosecution illegal? You bet it is. But until the courts open on Monday and the people get a chance to exercise their rights, I guess we\u2019ll have to wait.",

          "title": "Fostering Gender Inclusion in Technology with the Bolt Drive4WITech Initiative",
          "text": "The journey into tech for women in Africa is an ongoing discussion largely influenced by cultural norms and societal expectations concerning gender. Bolt, an inclusive mobility company, recognises this and as part of efforts to drive participation and inclusion for women in technology, launched the #Drive4WITech (Drive for Women in Tech) initiative to support young women in Africa. The initiative is an immersive internship programme for young women to challenge the status quo and kickstart a career in the tech space. The goal for Bolt is to equip the interns with preliminary knowledge and hands-on tools required to expand their career paths into areas in technology.\n\nFrom the vast number of applicants across Africa, nine interns were selected with three from Nigeria. Two of them \u2013 Onyekachukwu Orji and Oluwakorede Oseni spoke about their experience. The interns chosen are made up of undergraduate and post-graduates across different interests.\n\nQ: Among the many applications received, you were selected to intern with Bolt in the #Drive4WITech initiative. How did you feel when you were selected?\n\nOluwakorede: I was excited when I was notified that I had been selected. I saw this as an opportunity to work with a global and inclusive brand that is committed to solving the mobility challenge in Africa. It is an opportunity I have been waiting.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I felt elated to have been selected. I have always been curious about what it would feel like working at Bolt. I am happy and satisfied with the knowledge I have gained during my time as an intern.\n\nQ: What area did you specialise in during the programme?\n\nOluwakorede: I supported the marketing team at Bolt Nigeria. This provided me with a basic understanding of the necessary skills needed to supervise teams, programmes, and strategically plan for maximum impact.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I specialised in City Operations. I worked closely with Heads of Departments to build strategic solutions to issues as they arose, and it has helped me develop core competence in identifying and resolving issues.\n\nQ: Tell us about the experience and the new skills you learnt during the programme?\n\nOluwakorede: I had a great experience working at Bolt. In the marketing department, I discovered that marketing plays in promoting business goals and driving sales of products or services. Some of the skills I learnt include creative writing and how to structure the language of blogs and messages, using Emails and push notifications to pass across a clear message. I also learnt how to research and identify the organisation\u2019s target audience which helps in crafting content.\n\nOnyekachukwu: My experience was very exciting. I learnt the importance of teamwork, communication, staying up to date on issues that concern the company, professionalism, time management and discipline. The most important thing I have learnt is the ownership mentality. I must act like I own the business, that way, I would be at my best to ensure that everything runs smoothly and the business stays functional. To observe and think of ways to improve the business, it is paramount to communicate doubts and concerns where necessary. In addition, ask for clarity when in doubt and always being courageous enough to say when or where I lack knowledge. I have also developed analytical skills.\n\nQ: What impact has Drive4WITech had on you and how will it enhance your career?\n\nOluwakorede: The programme was very impactful. It exposed me to the importance of marketing and the role it plays in the business world. I am more confident, and I believe I more versatile and can provide useful insights. With all these learnings, I am positive of adding immense value in my future roles.\n\nOnyekachukwu: The skills I learnt will play an instrumental role in helping me to build a successful career. I am more equipped to confidently make significant contributions to my future work team.\n\nQ: How do you plan to use the knowledge gained to your advantage in the tech industry?\n\nOluwakorede: I aspire to own a tech company and to run the company successfully. I have learnt that it is important to manage the brand\u2019s image and proper representation of the brand. I want to use the knowledge gained to build my brand having realised that there is a misconception by tech enthusiasts about other fields. So, the knowledge will be very instrumental to my success in the industry.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I plan to pursue a career in data analytics. With the knowledge gained, I will be able to help businesses optimise their performances and make better consumer decisions, while leveraging on trends and insights for a better customer experience.\n\nQ: Did you have any challenges interning at Bolt?\n\nOluwakorede: A major challenge was writing and developing content because I initially had little knowledge about how to structure and develop detailed content with accurate language to pass across the right message. However, with the support of my team members who constantly provided guidance, I was able to overcome the challenge and I can boldly say that I am better off than I joined.\n\nOnyekachukwu: No, the company made my internship as accommodating as possible. Whenever I felt overwhelmed, I reached out to my team for support. This has also helped me develop strong organisational skills, where I am more focused on important things.\n\nQ: The Drive4WITech initiative positions Bolt as an inclusive and diverse organization. How immersing was it for you?\n\nOluwakorede: It was very immersing and educating beyond a regular internship. The programme provided an effective vehicle for me to learn and grow. It also helped me develop strong work ethics that enhance productivity while building expertise working with a diverse team.\n\nOnyekachukwu: It was very engaging. Every team did their best to take us through their task and how they work. The operations team taught us several new processes in data analytics. From what was taught, I now understand more about data, how it is stored, and how to use it better. I also learnt how data can be used to tell a story and find useful insights.\n\nQ: Did the programme meet your expectations?\n\nOluwakorede: My experience during the programme exceeded my expectations as I did not expect to learn a lot from marketing. It was fun and challenging because there is always a new technique to learn, a case to study, and strategies to research which is very interesting.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I came in with a curious mind and some expectation to learn and practice analytical skills. Even so, the internship curriculum covered more than I expected. It was highly satisfactory.\n\nQ: What is that one thing you will miss about interning at Bolt?\n\nOluwakorede: I will miss the friendly environment and meetings where I am encouraged to share ideas and ask questions, motivating me.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I will miss the work culture and healthy workspace that encourages growth, as well as my team; especially Onyinye, Bimbo and Miracle.",

          "text": "The latest smartphone in the product line of the Note series, the Infinix Note 10, is a device that was built to \u2018Meet Beauty with Strength\u2019. The elements of the new Note 10 are Speed, Beauty, Power, and Strength. The beautiful screen, the bodywork, and the overall design of the device, plus the strength of its processor all come together to provide an extraordinary experience for users. Infinix has gone a step further to bring upgraded and improved features to the new Note 10, while still maintaining affordable pricing for consumers.\n\nThe Infinix Note 10 Pro won the IF design award 2021 for its iconic design and flattering colour variants. The brilliant bodywork was followed with this remark by IF World design Guide, \u201cThis generation has a single appearance but two different battery cover designs. One is full of symmetrical design aesthetics \u2013 \u201cpolygonal vertical grating\u201d \u2013 while the other has more mysterious shimmering patterns and texture.\u201d\n\nAccording to Unbox Therapy, \u201c\u2026 if entertainment is one of your priorities and you need a budget smartphone the Infinix Note 10 Pro looks like it\u2019s up to the task. The Infinix Note 10 Pro will certainly satisfy with its whopper of a 6.95inch IPS display. It is definitely one for those who want their smartphone to be as big as humanly possible.\u201d And the Tech Chap, a UK top tech YouTuber, further confirmed the screen size by saying, \u201cI really love just how big the screen is. We\u2019ve got nice thin bezels around the edges; we\u2019ve got the hole punch selfie at the top. As I said, 6.95 inches \u2013 if you are watching movies or playing games, this is going to give you a really immersive experience.\u201d\n\nAnother UK tech reviewer, Tech Spurt said, \u201cThe batteries are integrated with ultra power saving mode so you can get an extra 58 hours of call time even when the battery is at 5% capacity\u201d. Another tech reviewer, the Tech Chap also said, \u201cWe do also have that fast 33W charger, which actually charges up 50 minutes faster than the previous generation of this phone \u2013 a nice upgrade there.\u201d\n\nIn the words of a British tech reviewer, SuperSarf, \u201cA 90hz refresh rate at this price, that\u2019s just insane. It\u2019s going to make everything very smooth. You will be very surprised to learn that this will be retailing for $259. I think you will be pretty impressed with what this offers for that price.\u201d Just in case you were wondering if the Note 10 is a good buy for your money, there you have it from the tech gurus themselves. So, if you had doubts about what the Note 10 had to offer, be rest assured you\u2019re in good hands.\n\nConfirming every feature that the device is claimed to have, media houses have described the Note 10 smartphone as a value-for-money device that offers high-end features such as impressive entertainment experiences, long-lasting battery, and high-performance processing power.\n\n\u201cTheir 6.95\u201d displays (FHD+, 1080\u00d72460) should make any visual application extremely agreeable to use. The panels are based on IPS LCD technology, which typically does quite well in color gamut and maximum brightness (480 NITs).\u201d \u2013 Hubert Nguyen, Ubergizmo\n\n\u201cWith the new 33W X-Charge a 0-100% charge takes 50 minutes less than it did on the previous Note model. A quick 5-minute top-up is enough for 2 hours of gaming.\u201d \u2013 Peter Bonov, GSMArena\n\nMeanwhile, the Note 10 online launch was brimming with thrill and excitement around the main features of the Note 10 \u2013 speed, beauty, power, strength \u2013 as the functionalities of the new smartphone were tested live.

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s democracy is losing its voice",
          "text": "I told some old friends from King\u2019s College that I wanted to protest the negative impact of the Twitter ban on small businesses at the Lekki Toll gate and needed company. We were going to take a simplistic view of how the restriction was stifling the multitude of businesses that use Twitter as a means of constant communication with old and new customers. It was unacceptable for the government to act this way, not caring about the economic consequences.\n\nI referenced data from Netblocks, an online service that publishes estimates of the economic cost of internet disruptions around the world. Netblocks had put the cost of the ban to Nigeria at N90.7 million ($250,600) per hour. I gave several analogies to buttress how the cost was mainly shouldered by private businesses and not President Muhammadu Buhari who ordered the ban because his ego was bruised by the microblogging platform\u2019s treatment of his tweet. If these private businesses who had all been shut out of Twitter had a say, would the majority sign up to the ban?\n\nMy friends cut me short at this point.\n\nWhile they agreed we would be protesting for a good cause, they urged caution, citing the way the government had violently quashed protests against police brutality last year after armed military men shot at peaceful protesters and killed some of them. Drawing from that experience they urged me to say nothing. They didn\u2019t have to remind me about the events of October 20, 2020. I had also not forgotten the shameful incident for which not a single person has been tried eight months after. I actually had something else up my sleeves. I was carrying out a test of what democracy meant to young Nigerians and there I got my answer.\n\nDemocracy is about freedom. Freedom of speech, expression, association etc, and is also about holding the government accountable. When people are so afraid to speak for the fear of being brutally silenced, what does it say about democracy in such a country?\n\nOf course, we shouldn\u2019t define Nigeria\u2019s democracy by the events of just one year. Our democracy has indeed grown leaps and bounds since the military era, but it is now fast deteriorating.\n\nRead Also: 22 years of democracy: Poverty, insecurity dealing deadly blow on Nigerians\n\nThere\u2019s been a global hit\n\nGlobally, democracy actually took a hit in 2020.\n\nThe average regional scores in The Economist Intelligence Unit\u2019s Democracy Index worsened in every single region of the world in 2020 for the first time since 2010.\n\nThe average global score in 2020 fell to 5.37 (on a scale of 0-10) from 5.44 in 2019, driven by regressions across all regions, and especially large ones in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nA decade ago the cause of a similar democratic recession was disaffection with governments and a collapse of trust in institutions following the global economic and financial crisis.\n\nBy contrast, the 2020 worldwide democratic regression was largely the result of the measures taken by governments to address the public health emergency caused by the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, which has entailed the suspension of the civil liberties of entire populations for prolonged periods. Across the world in 2020, citizens experienced the biggest rollback of individual freedoms ever undertaken by governments during peacetime (and perhaps even in wartime). The willing surrender of fundamental freedoms by millions of people was perhaps one of the most remarkable occurrences in an extraordinary year.\n\nThe main policy response of governments to the pandemic, whether they were authoritarian or democratic, was to impose social distancing, quarantines and lockdown measures of greater or lesser severity and of longer or shorter duration. By the end of 2020, many Western countries were entering their third lockdowns as cases of the coronavirus surged again as a result of the spread of new, more infectious strains. Only one year before, when the Chinese authorities locked down the city of Wuhan in Hubei province in central China, the rest of the world looked on incredulously, and people said that it could \u201cnever happen here\u201d.\n\nYet within months, countries around the world were following the Chinese template of lockdowns, albeit without employing the same repressive techniques as China to contain what had by then become a global pandemic. Political and cultural differences\u2014and, in some cases, an initial belief that the pandemic was a hoax\u2014led some democracies to resist the policy of lockdowns. In the US in particular, a strong culture of anti-statism and commitment to individual rights resulted in high levels of popular resistance to the public health measures taken by state authorities to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Yet these were differences mainly of degree rather than substance, and social distancing and lockdowns became the standard approach to dealing with the public health emergency across the developed world. In many emerging markets and poorer countries, lockdowns tended to be shorter (but more coercive) and social distancing less restrictive, given the dependence of so many on the informal economy and the state\u2019s inability to provide a social safety net for long, if at all.\n\nAcross the world the pandemic led governments to take away their citizens\u2019 freedoms and suspend civil liberties. Freedom of movement was taken away as a result of border closures, international travel bans, and restrictions on domestic travel and the use of public transport. Governments invoked emergency powers or imposed states of emergency; dispensed with parliamentary oversight and checks and balances; introduced compulsory social distancing, lockdowns, curfews and mask-wearing; confined people to their homes, except for limited activities; closed educational and cultural establishments; cancelled or postponed elections; prohibited public protests; censured dissenting voices and curtailed freedom of expression, and used the full force of the law to punish those who disobeyed. This list may sound dystopian, yet this was the experience of most people in 2020.\n\nThe unprecedented suspension of individual freedoms, at least in countries where liberty prevailed before the pandemic, accounts for the sharp democratic regression recorded in the 2020 Democracy Index. Government restrictions on citizens\u2019 civil liberties led to scoring downgrades for several Democracy Index questions for almost every country in the world.\n\nNigeria\u2019s democracy suffers under Buhari\n\nNigeria\u2019s democracy index score declined to 4.10 in 2020 from 4.12 in 2019. In 2015, when the Buhari government was first appointed, the score was 4.62 which means the country saw a 10 percent slump between 2015 and 2020. So Nigeria\u2019s deterioration did not start last year, it\u2019s been on for the entire duration of the Buhari administration.\n\nIt is ironic that Nigeria\u2019s democracy is seemingly rescinding under the watch of Buhari who rode the coattails of a vibrant democracy to mount a sweeping defeat of an incumbent president, the first time it had ever happened in the country\u2019s history of democratic rule.\n\nHis victory was the result of rife discontent among Nigerians about the previous government.\n\nBuhari has however now become a threat to the same vibrant democracy that brought him into power whether it\u2019s in the form of sanctioning the use of aggressive force against peaceful protesters or the recent Twitter ban for all Nigerians. His entire administration is tainted with violation of court orders, arrest of journalists and other anti-democratic actions.\n\nThere was the crack down on Omoyele Sowore, a journalist and publisher of Sahara Reporters who tried to lead national protests against Buhari\u2019s administration on the grounds of rising insecurity and corruption, even as there is the case of the leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, Ibrahim El-Zakzaky and his wife Zeenat who on June 9 clocked 2000 days in illegal detention.\n\nAs far back as December 2016, a Federal High Court in Abuja had ordered El-Zakzaky and his wife released from detention, citing that the continued detention violates their rights and is against Section 35(1) of the constitution which provided \u201cevery person shall be entitled to his personal liberty and no person shall be deprived of such liberty\u2026in accordance with a procedure by law.\u201d\n\nBut the Nigerian government has continued to detain them using the exemption provided in Section 35 (1)(c), that an individual can be detained \u201c\u2026upon reasonable suspicion of his having committed a criminal offense.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter if El-Zakzaky\u2019s continued detention is against the other provisions of the constitution.\n\nThis is what Nigeria has become, civic rights are no longer guaranteed. It is why Nigerians are now afraid to hold the government accountable through protests. Unfortunately, the pain of that forced silence is being borne by Nigerians whose misery is worsening.\n\nIn his six years as president, Nigerians have grown poorer each year, with the economy failing to expand at a fast enough pace to provide opportunities for a bulging population. Jobs are scarce and unemployment is the second highest globally at 33 percent in 2020. Unattractive government policies and a difficult business environment won\u2019t let private capital come in droves to create jobs while the few investors within the country are being suffocated to death and the few jobs available are lost. The lack of jobs for its teeming youth population is fanning insecurity and the worst may be yet to come for a country that is projected by the United Nations to be the third most populous nation in the world by 2050- with 400 million people, double of the current population.\n\nThe silence of Nigerians amid the country\u2019s economic realities should be an indictment on its democracy, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be, at least not yet.",
          "summary": "I was carrying out a test of what democracy meant to young Nigerians and there I got my answer.\nOf course, we shouldn\u2019t define Nigeria\u2019s democracy by the events of just one year.\nRead Also: 22 years of democracy: Poverty, insecurity dealing deadly blow on NigeriansThere\u2019s been a global hitGlobally, democracy actually took a hit in 2020.\nThe unprecedented suspension of individual freedoms, at least in countries where liberty prevailed before the pandemic, accounts for the sharp democratic regression recorded in the 2020 Democracy Index.\nNigeria\u2019s democracy suffers under BuhariNigeria\u2019s democracy index score declined to 4.10 in 2020 from 4.12 in 2019.",

          "text": "Folorunsho Ayobami was not supposed to be on duty on Thursday morning. He had to be because he had heard that the Nigerian president would be in Lagos to commission the new Mobolaji Johnson train station directly opposite his workplace.\n\nThe 53-year-old security guard at UAIB Insurance is a train lover who once avidly patronized the Oyingbo train station which is now abandoned.\n\nHe recalls that during festivals in his hometown in Osun State, former Governor Rauf Aregbesola gave them free train rides to and fro the state, and subsequent governors have kept the tradition.\n\n\u201cAnd we enjoyed it,\u201d he remembers.\n\nSo, Ayobami had come to work earlier on Thursday because he wanted to have a feel of the commissioning and, perhaps, see the man who\u2019s been in the news all through the week.\n\nFor him, the commissioning reminded him of what transportation was once like and the hope this new train station brings to both Nigerians and the economy, and his expectations were met as President Muhammadu Buhari touched down at the venue in his glorious presidential National Air Force chopper.\n\nAbayomi even filmed the proceedings on his phone. All of it. Even the road sweepers who crowded the place in a struggle to catch a glimpse of the man who is attempting to bring \u2018salvation\u2019 to the transport sector.\n\n\u201cThis terminal at Mobolaji station is not the first nor the last one. We\u2019ve experienced the one at Oyingbo. So, instead of going to Oyingbo, this location is better. I believe we\u2019re going to have a lot of benefits from it and it\u2019ll favour all of us, especially people that travel by train,\u201d he says.\n\nAccording Ayobami, it is a lot safer than travelling by road and people are saved from the perennial traffic, accidents, and armed robbers.\n\nBy observation, his excitement and commendations for the project were genuine, but something else bothered him.\n\nThe transportation fares.\n\nWhen the train was newly introduced and put up for a test run, the fare was pegged at N3,000. This attracted wide criticism from Nigerians who said the fare was higher than boarding a bus to Ibadan.\n\nRead Also: Buhari\u2019s Lagos visit sees no major cheer from stock buyers\n\nAbayomi tells BusinessDay that going to Ibadan by road is around N1,500. Tops, N2,000, compared to travelling by train which is N3,500.\n\n\u201cWhy should it be like that?\u201d he asks with brewing anger. \u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be so. We\u2019re appealing to the governor to reduce the fare in order for poor people to enjoy it. The government needs to reduce the money. It\u2019s supposed to be cheaper than road transport.\u201d\n\nAccustomed to travelling by train every year from Lagos to Osogbo when the Oyingbo station was functioning, this security guard hopes to begin again. But the fare could prevent that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping to enter it this coming Sallah with my family. That is, if the money is not too much,\u201d he adds.\n\nAlso expressing her concern, Rita Osadebe, a food seller, says from directing people to the station, she noticed that only a few people could afford it as those who cannot opt for road transport to Ibadan.\n\n\u201cThe money should be brought down to something like N1,800 or N1,700 so that poor people can afford it. Because many people cannot afford it,\u201d she says.\n\nOsadebe has some personal connection to the new train station. First, she was part of the people whose houses were demolished to erect the structure. Secondly, her husband works there as a train driver.\n\nBut she is also concerned about the rent of the shops at the station, especially because she has been selling food to the Chinese workers and would like to continue doing her food business at a shop at the station.\n\nShe tells BusnessDay that she has been selling by the roadside since her house was demolished in 2018. She needs a shop to do her food business but cannot afford the cost of a space there.\n\n\u201cIf they are doing something, they should be considering poor women who can\u2019t afford it. The shops are too expensive, they should bring it down,\u201d she says.\n\nNonetheless, she says that the project is a great achievement for Nigeria as people will not have to depend on road transport and it will also ease traffic.\n\nFor Olateju Mohammed, a trader, the station is good for the economy because people can quickly move from one place to another without traffic delays. It will also enable interstate businesses as people in Lagos and Ibadan can now do business freely.\n\nWhile she expects that people will begin to patronise the train service, she insists that the fares are quite high and should be reduced due to the economic situation of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cN2,500 is much. They can reduce it to N1,500,\u201d she suggests.\n\nSpeaking to a senior human resource officer of the Nigerian Railway Corporation who identified herself as Njah, BusinessDay learnt that the fares vary. Business-class is around N7,000, second-class is N5,000, while economy class is N2,000.\n\nThe excited staff member said the commissioning was unexpected and it showed that the Nigerian Railway Corporation was headed towards attaining greater heights.\n\nAccording to her, Nigerians have been enjoying the Lagos-Ibadan train station and now they can compare it with the rest of the world.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be in history!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cWith this, we are sure of travelling in a safe and conducive environment.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari, who arrived in Lagos on Thursday morning for the commissioning of the Lagos-Ibadan railway project, described it as another milestone in the revitalisation of railway projects to boost economic activities in Nigeria.\n\nHe said the project was part of the Lagos-Kano railway project, which already has Abuja-Kaduna component and is being given the needed attention. He said when the Lagos-Kano project is completed, it would link up to Maradi in Niger Republic.\n\nBuhari also commended the minister of transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, for his persistency and determination in completing the railway project.\n\n\u2018Leave your vehicles at home, patronise the train\u2019\n\nThe Erelu Kuti IV of Lagos, Abiola Dosunmu, in an interview with BusinessDay said the project would ease the lives of Lagosians. Hence, she recommended it to all irrespective of social status because it is of the \u201chighest standard\u201d.\n\nAccording to her, patronising the train station would help to decongest Lagos State. She also called on residents to leave their cars at home.\n\n\u201cAll of us should leave our vehicles at home and patronise the train and also decongest the streets of Lagos,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nIt\u2019s longer news that the corporate existence of Nigeria is threatened by the unabating attacks of insurrectionists, bandits, terrorists and the aberration of unknown gunmen. Due to the helplessness of the government to curb this ugly and incessant attacks on the precious lives and property of the citizens, Nigerians are taking recourse to their primordial ethnic cocoons which decimates the Nigerian state to the threshold of near collapse.\n\nThe security conundrum has put everyone in danger. The activities of these anti-state actors have imperiled farmers, traders, students, political leaders, travelers and ofcourse corps members who are entrusted with the patriotic mandate of rendering selfless service to the motherland.\n\nConcerned Nigerians are asking what the way out of the quagmire could be. It is this existential question that has birthed a precipitous bill seeking to scrap National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). Sponsored by Awayi Abiante from Rivers State, the bill has now reached the second reading at the Green Chamber. This bill has brought NYSC to the stead to be a whipping boy for our insecurity as lawmakers debate it relevance to the nation after 48 years of existence.\n\nHon. Awaji-Inombek Abiante in the explanatory memorandum of the proposal, listed various reasons why the NYSC should be scrapped.One of the reasons, according to Abiante, is due to incessant killing of innocent corps members in some parts of the country due to banditry, religious extremism and ethnic violence.\n\nHon Abiante also gave economic exploitation of Corpers by private agencies as another reason for his bill seeking the discontinuation of the scheme as they \u201care no longer recruiting able and qualified Nigerian youths, thus relying heavily on the availability of corps members who have not been well remunerated and get relieved with impunity at the end of their service year without any hope of being gainfully employed.\u201d\n\nApart from serving in their various places of primary assignment, corps members are often deployed for key assignments such as working as ad hoc electoral staff during elections which he also explains endangers the safety of corps members since elections in Nigeria are most times volatile.\n\nIt is worthy to note that since the inception of nysc itself in 1973 the program has been trailed by waves of protest . Just so you know that the scheme has always been a bone of contention right from the day it\u2019s decree was promulgated in 1973. In the words of the scheme\u2019s founder, Gen. Yakubu Gowon \u201cthe establishment of the scheme was followed by a protest throughout the length and breadth of the country\u201d\n\nThe administration of Gen. Gowon established the NYSC with the promulgation of Decree No 24 of May 22, 1973, the objective was to ensure that Nigeria remained an indivisible entity that would be focused on sustainable development and four decades later the scheme can do better but it\u2019s relevance to the socio economic fabrics of Nigeria can be attested to by well meaning and patriotic citizens of Nigeria though not devoid of challenges.\n\nIt was the same General Yakubu Gowon who launched the famous 3Rs which are reconstruction, rehabilitation, reconciliation in order to galvanize the wartorned Nigeria after the devastating civil war the giant of Africa was plunged into between 1967 to 1970 and he found young graduates as one of the veritable tools of nation building. Reconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation should be seen as an ongoing efforts of nation building just as government is a continuous process.\n\nThe NYSC posts Corps members to cities or villages and states far from home and states of origin, where they are expected to mix with people of other tribes, social and family backgrounds where they could learn the culture of the indigenes in the place they are posted. This of course fosters mutual understanding of the country\u2019s diverse cultures and national cohesion. What if there was no NYSC?\n\nNYSC should be seen as a work in progress. The government should strengthen the scheme to ensure it meets the current socio-economic reality of our country but scrapping it because of insecurity is like a farmer throwing away his hoe because he\u2019s unable to use it. The problem is not the hoe but the farmer\u2019s inability to use it.\n\nNigeria is one of the most terrorized countries in the world and no society can thrive in an atmosphere of severe insecurity like the one in Nigeria. Government must live up to it\u2019s primary responsibility of providing security of lives and property to citizens. This is the least citizens can ever ask of any government.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSinafi Omanga is a serving corps member with the Nigerian Observer.\n\nEmail: benomanga01@gmail.com\n\n...",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAhmed Lawan, Nigeria\u2019s Senate President, has broken his silence on the federal government\u2019s decision to indefinitely ban the operations of Twitter in Nigeria.\n\nWhile he refused to give a definite stand on the ban, the lawmaker said he is optimistic that the matter will be resolved soon just as the federal government is currently in talks with Twitter.\n\nMr Lawan made this comment during a media briefing with journalists at the National Assembly on Friday.\n\nThe event, organised by his office, is to mark the second anniversary of the ninth assembly.\n\nThe federal government had, on June 4, announced the \u201cindefinite suspension\u201d of Twitter operations in Nigeria \u2013 two days after the site took down a controversial tweet by President Muhammadu Buhari. Twitter had said the tweet violated its rules and many Nigerians viewed it as a threat of violence against the Igbo ethnic group.\n\nThe announcement triggered controversies and condemnation from within and outside Nigeria, with many describing the ban as an attempt to gag the media, an attack on press freedom, freedom of expression and attempt to pass the controversial Social Media Bill.\n\nMr Lawan was asked why the Senate has been silent on the matter as well as his thoughts. He reminded journalists present that the federal government was working towards resolving the issue.\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, has informed Nigerians that they are talking with Twitter to resolve this matter.\n\n\u201cNigeria needs Twitter just as much as Twitter needs Nigeria. I believe this engagement between Twitter and the government will yield fruitful results.\n\n\u201cI am an optimist. I believe all of us would have learnt our lessons,\u201d he said.\n\nHis comment comes barely 48 hours after the Senate held a special session without discussing the #TwitterBan, a contrast to their counterparts at the House of Representatives, who summoned the Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed over the ban.\n\nMembers of the main opposition party, PDP, in the House also walked out of plenary after the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, turned down an attempt to ask the federal government to review the #TwitterBan.\n\nNigerians had expected the Senate to discuss the issue during plenary on Tuesday but mum was the word. The subject was not listed for discussion on the Order Paper neither was a motion or Point of Order raised to that regard.\n\nThe lawmakers, who began plenary at 11:02 a.m., went into a closed door meeting shortly after opening prayer. The executive session lasted for over half an hour and the Senate President, thereafter, announced that the discussions behind closed doors bothered on the workings of the Senate.",

          "text": "A member of the Kaduna State House of Assembly, representing Jaba state constituency, Hon. Samson Dikko (PDP), has called on state governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai, to suspend his planned tuition fee hike for university students.\n\nDikko called on the state government to immediately suspend the plan in all the tertiary institutions of the state.\n\nRecall that the Southern Kaduna People\u2019s Union (SOKAPU) students wing had earlier berated the state lawmakers over their silence on the tuition fees hike, promising to make them politically irrelevant.\n\nThe lawmaker, who spoke in an exclusive interview with LEADERSHIP in Kwoi, the headquarters of Jaba local government area, said there was no gainsaying the fact that education is the bedrock of development in any society, hence people should be encouraged to acquire it.\n\n\u201cEducation is an essential gift from the government to a child. Let me link this thought with one inscription boldly written and pasted at the former Leventis Roundabout by the Kaduna\n\nState government that \u2018It is a must for children of the poor to have access to quality education\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lawmaker said going by that inscription written by the el-Rufai administration, it is duty-bound to allow children access to free and qualitative education from primary to tertiary level.\n\n\u201cWhile Kaduna state government is\n\nhiking the tuition fees of her students, the Sule Lamido University in Jigawa state is offering a free education to her female students to enable them get qualitative education. What a contradiction?\n\n\u201cIt is a known fact that Jigawa State cannot compare its revenue generation with that of Kaduna State. It is the primary responsibility of government to alleviate sufferings of the teeming masses and not creating problems and hardship for them,\u201d Dikko added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe noted that the most painful aspect of the issue is the fact that parents of most of the concerned students have been sacked from work in the ongoing rightsizing of workforce in the state.\n\n\u201cIt was a pointer that students within this category are likely to drop out\n\nfrom their educational pursuit. My question here is leaving these students and their parents unprotected from this unfortunate situation, don\u2019t you think it will create more rooms for social ills and other forms of criminality in the state? We must know that a stitch in time saves nine.\n\n\u201cIn the light of this fact, I wish to draw the attention of the Kaduna state government as a matter of urgent public importance to suspend the planned action,\u201d Dikko insisted.\n\nOn insecurity, Dikko said: \u201cI am deeply worried that our roads that link the Kaduna city to other major cities are not safe for commuters. Are we talking of Kaduna \u2013 Birnin-Gwari road where it is over 10 years now that\n\npeople hardly follow the road to Lagos in fear of armed bandits? Are we also talking of Zaria road or Kaduna-Kafanchan road?\n\n\u201cThe worst is the Kaduna-Abuja road where people have resorted to using the rail service from Kaduna to Abuja. But the question here is who can afford the rail line transport if not just a few of us. Indeed we are not safe in our homes; our farmers are not\n\nsafe, our students no longer go to school because of fear of kidnappers.\u201d",

          "text": "The delayed Euro 2020 will finally get under way today, a year behind schedule, with Covid still set to cast a shadow over the tournament.\n\nThe continent-wide event, first envisaged by then-UEFA president Michel Platini when he announced the tournament would be held across Europe, will be played in front of limited crowds and with strict health restrictions in place.\n\nThe action kicks off at Rome\u2019s Stadio Olimpico, where Italy take on Turkey in front of 16 000 fans.\n\nSpain\u2019s preparations for the month-long tournament have been hit after two players, Sergio Busquets and Diego Llorente, tested positive for the virus, although Llorente on Thursday returned a negative test.\n\nThe team even had to name a \u201cparallel\u201d squad of 17 reserve players, fearing a possible wider outbreak in the official 26-man squad.\n\nBut despite the ongoing threat, UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin has been bullish, insisting Euro 2020 will be safe.\n\n\u201cIt will be the perfect opportunity to show the world that Europe is adapting,\u201d he said. \u201cEurope is alive and celebrating life. Europe is back.\u201d\n\nThe clearest illustration of that is set to come from Budapest, where it is hoped the new Puskas Arena will be packed to capacity.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the majority of the 11 venues, all in different countries, will only be partially-filled for matches, although Denmark on Thursday announced it would lift mask rules and allow 25 000 fans, instead of 16 000, to attend games in Copenhagen.\n\nMunich aims to host a minimum of 14 500 fans \u2014 around 22 per cent of the Allianz Arena\u2019s capacity, the lowest of the stadiums being used.\n\nDublin and Bilbao were dropped from the list of hosts after being unable to give guarantees they could meet Uefa\u2019s requirement of accommodating limited numbers of spectators, but Seville stepped in for Bilbao while Dublin\u2019s games went to London and Saint-Petersburg.\n\nOn the pitch, France will be firm favourites despite being one of the few traditional giants not to have any games at home. The world champions\u2019 first match is in Munich against Germany on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cAll the other countries envy us,\u201d said a recent front page of French sports daily L\u2019Equipe underneath pictures of Kylian Mbappe, Karim Benzema and Antoine Griezmann.\n\nAll eyes will be on 33-year-old forward Benzema, who was recalled after an international exile of five and a half years following a prolific season for Real Madrid.\n\nHolders Portugal, with a star-studded squad led by Cristiano Ronaldo, and Hungary complete a tough-looking Group F.\n\nThe other likely contenders among the 24 nations include Belgium, sweating over the fitness of key player Kevin De Bruyne after he suffered facial injuries in the recent Champions League final, and usual suspects Spain and Italy.\n\nIn England, there are hopes Gareth Southgate\u2019s young side could take advantage of playing most of their games at Wembley.\n\nEngland have never before reached a European Championship final, but captain Harry Kane believes the team will start their bid in a \u201cbetter place\u201d than they were before reaching the 2018 World Cup semifinals.",

          "title": "More reactions trail JUSUN strike suspension \u2014 Daily Times Nigeria",
          "text": "The suspension of the 64-day-old nationwide strike embarked upon by the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria, JUSUN, has been received with mixed feelings in Abuja.\n\nSome lawyers described the suspension as a welcome development, owing to the strategic importance of the judiciary, others expressed the reservation that since all issues which warranted the strike have not been fully resolved, it would be too early to celebrate.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the strike, the longest industrial action in the Nigerian judiciary was suspended on Wednesday, following a meeting between officials of the union and the National Judicial Council (NJC) led by the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Ibrahim Muhammad.\n\nBoth parties agreed that the strike should be called off in the interest of the nation and to give room for the implementation of agreements JUSUN reached with the Federal Government.\n\nNAN reports that courts are to re-open on June 14.\n\nA Lagos-based Lawyer, Victor Opara, said:\u201dJUSUN through the strike, has sensitised the public on the challenges the judiciary is facing for not being autonomous.\n\n\u201cThey brought awareness to the fact that judicial autonomy and judicial awareness is something that we need, and that will augur well for the administration of justice.\n\n\u201cThey have been able to sensitize lawyers and stakeholders that autonomy and independence, as is constitutionally provided for, is something that should be adhered to.\n\n\u201cFrom what we read, they have been able to get some concessions and some state governors who have hitherto exhibited a lackadaisical attitude to it sat down at the round table to discuss it.\n\n\u201d At least some agreements were reached, and a window for implementation decided upon\u201d.\n\nOpara,however, advised parties to be faithful to the agreement signed.\n\n\u201cIf an agreement has been signed, it remains for the parties to be faithful to that agreement.\n\n\u201cAny departure from that would suggest that one party is simply reneging on that agreement\u201d.\n\nHowever, Chudi Ojuwku, who spent over two decades teaching at the Nigerian Law School shared a different opinion on the benefits of the JUSUN strike.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is that at the end of the day, they have not exactly got the financial autonomy they are demanding.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the judiciary still does not have financial autonomy because the system we run does not allow that to happen.\n\n\u201cAutonomy would mean that the money meant for the judiciary would go to the judiciary and it would be up to it to decide how to use it\u201d.\n\nHe added that as it stands now, the Executive is not interested in that.\n\n\u201cThey want to be the ones to budget and apply the judiciary money for them.\n\n\u201cSo one wonders if (JUSUN) called off the strike to save face or have reached a compromise,\u201d he queried.\n\nAlso, an Abuja-based Lawyer, Mr Bowie Attamah felt that whether or not the strike achieved much depends on how one looks at.\n\n\u201cIt goes without saying however that the state of affairs where the judiciary gets its funds at the behest of the state government needed to be looked into.\n\n\u201d That is what the JUSUN strike has drawn attention to. It is now open to public debate.\n\n\u201cAnd it seems to me that the public is weighing in on the side of JUSUN, if we must practise true separation of powers,\u201d Attamah added.\n\nAlso, Mr Frank Tietie, a Human Rights Activist said the suspension of the strike was a welcomed development.\n\nAccording to Tietie, the strike brought hardship and pain to lawyers, litigants and those in police detentions that required the services of the courts.\n\n\u201cThere are several other ways of ensuring compliance to the constitution standards of judicial autonomy rather than crippling the entire judiciary.\n\n\u201cThe government may function without the judiciary, but businesses and the ordinary man cannot operate normally without the judiciary.\n\nNAN reports that the union JUSUN had begun a nationwide strike on Tuesday, April 6, when the union directed all its members across the federation to shut down all courts after the expiration of the 21-day ultimatum earlier given over the failure of the government to implement the law.\n\nNAN reports that a verdict of the Federal High Court in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja, had in January 2014 held that financial autonomy for the judiciary is a constitutional provision that must be complied with by the executive branch of government.\n\nNAN reports that on May 23, President Buhari signed into law the Executive Order to grant financial autonomy to the legislature and the judiciary across the 36 states of the country.\n\nThe order also mandates the Accountant-General of the Federation to deduct from source amount due to state legislatures and judiciaries from the monthly allocation to each state for states that refuse to grant such autonomy.\n\nThe Attorney General of the Federation Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, said Executive Order No. 10 of 2020 made it mandatory that all states of the federation should include the allocations of both the legislature and the judiciary in the first-line charge of their budgets.\n\nAccording to the AGF: \u201cA Presidential Implementation Committee was constituted to fashion out strategies and modalities for the implementation of financial autonomy for the State Legislature and State Judiciary in compliance with section 121(3) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as Amended).\u201d\n\nNAN reports that the Nigeria Governors Forum said it will start implementing financial autonomy for the judiciary latest by May ending, a pledge that indicated that an end to the ongoing strike that has crippled the nation\u2019s judiciary may be in sight.\n\nThe governors also called on striking members of the JUSUN to call off their two weeks old strike then.\n\nThe Chairman of the NGF, Gov. Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti, gave this assurance in an interview with journalists after meeting with \u201cstakeholders\u201d from the state judiciary and legislature at the Presidential Villa in Abuja.\n\nFayemi said the modalities for the implementation were worked out at the meeting held at the Presidential Villa.\n\nAccording to him, the meeting, chaired by the Chief of Staff to President Buhari, Ibrahim Gambari, was attended by the Solicitor-General of the Federation, representatives of the judiciary, Conference of Speakers and House of Representatives.\n\nThe first line charge status, which is being respected by the Federal Government in respect of the federal judiciary, entitles the state judiciaries to get funds due to them directly from the Federation Account.",

          "text": "The Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, has dismissed reports that his office will be prosecuting Nigerians who tweet despite the ban on Twitter operations in Nigeria.\n\nIn a chat with Vanguard, Malami said his office will not be prosecuting Nigerians residing in or out the country who are making use of the microblogging site but will go after any company or entity that offers to help Twitter bypass the suspension of its operations in the country.\n\nTwo days ago, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Adeboye, and the Senior Pastor of Deeper Life Church, Pastor Kumuyi, tweeted from their handles and many Nigerians had asked if the Minister would be carrying out his threat to prosecute Twitter defaulters, on the respected clergymen.\n\nReacting during the interview, Malami said;\n\n\u201cIt is within their guaranteed fundamental right to tweet from anywhere in the world. Nigeria, being a democratic nation, cannot stop its citizens from exercising their rights of freedom of expression.

But we are going to use the legal instruments at our disposal to go after those who aid and abet Twitter to continue to threaten our corporate existence as a nation.\n\nIt is clear from the barrage of insinuations and falsehood being orchestrated by some Nigerians and those trying to change the clear position of the Government of Nigeria to suit their whims and caprices and to whip up sentiments to hoodwink the people, that they are up to some mischievous and sinister games, which the Federal Government will not condone.\n\nAt no time did we threaten any religious leader for using Twitter to express themselves. Neither did we indicate in any way that we were going after them. But mischief-makers were quick to mention names of religious leaders and give the impression that we were already in court to try them.\n\nLet it be made clear that the Buhari administration being a people-centred government that relies on the rule of law, will never adopt any policy or programme that seeks to add pain or injury to the very people who elected it to serve them.\n\nFor the record, let it be made amply clear that the AGF, Abubakar Malami, is not after any Nigerian, tweeting from Nigeria or anywhere in the world but that any Nigerian company or entity that gives a helping hand for Twitter to escape the ban placed on it, will be dealt with,\u201d Malami said",

Therefore, we should allow the party to decide. You cannot sit there in Lagos, for instance, and decide on the fate of APC on zoning.

Our citizens and especially the members of the APC should not fall for this.\n\n\u201cThe ruling party, the APC, unlike others before it is a popular political party owned by its entire membership, hence Mr. President was making the point during the 45-minutes interview that neither he nor anyone in the leadership could impose their wishes on the party.\n\n\u201cThis is a basic consensus that binds the entire party leadership. The party leaders remain firmly committed to the principles that succession must be through the democratic norms and processes.\n\n\u201cThe mention he made of Lagos was not a reference to the respected party leader, Senator Bola Tinubu, as the opposition party\u2019s predatory designs would put it in order to damage the excellent relationship between the two of them.\n\n\u201cThe President, the Asiwaju and the rapidly growing members of the party, want a dynastic succession of elected leaders.\n\n\u201cThe APC should not be distracted from its progress as a democratic party.\u201d",

          "title": "BUHARI at Arise TV: We\u2019ll return to First Republic\u2019s open grazing practice",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the country\u2019s return to open grazing as obtained during the First Republic where herdsmen used designated grazing routes to move their cattle to all parts of the country.\n\nTo this end, the president said he had asked the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), to begin the process of recovering land from persons who have converted cattle grazing routes for their personal use.\n\nBuhari said this during an interview with Arise Television aired Thursday.\n\nHe said the grazing routes were designated in the 1st Republic when \u201cNigerians used to obey laws.\u201d\n\nBuhari was reacting to a question on the decision by 17 southern governors to ban open grazing.\n\nThe AGF had kicked against the declaration by the governors, saying it was like northern governors banning spare part trading, a job synonymous with the south easterners.\n\nWhen asked if he agreed with the AGF\u2019s position, Buhari laughingly responded: \u201cYou want me to contradict my attorney-general? What I did was ask him to go and dig the gazette of the 1st Republic when people were obeying laws. There were cattle routes and grazing areas. Cattle routes were for when they (herdsmen) are moving up country, north to south or east to west, they had to go through there.\n\n\u201cIf you allow your cattle to stray into any farm, you are arrested. The farmer is invited to submit his claims. The khadi or the judge will say pay this amount and if you can\u2019t the cattle is sold. And if there is any benefit, you are given and people were behaving themselves and in the grazing areas, they built dams, put windmills in some places. There were even veterinary departments so that the herders are limited. Their route is known, their grazing area is known.\n\n\u201cBut I am telling you, this rushing to the centre (sic) so I asked for the gazette to make sure that those who encroached on these cattle routes and grazing areas will be dispossessed in law and try to bring some order back into the cattle grazing.\u201d\n\nOn Ortom\n\nHe also lamented the style and utterances of Benue state Governor Samuel Ortom, who had not only implemented an aggressive anti-open grazing law but had accused Buhari of failing to take actions against herdsmen because he is also a member of the Fulani herders.\n\nBuhari said indeed, he is a Fulani man but Ortom was being unfair to him.\n\nThe president said he had told Ortom that the herdsmen perpetrating the attacks were not the Nigerian ones.\n\nThe president further explained that the Tiv, who form the majority in Benue, and the Fulani had been engaged in cultural conflicts for a long time.\n\n\u201cThe problem is trying to understand the culture of the cattle rearers. There is a cultural difference between the Tivs and the Fulanis. So, the governor of Benue said I am not disciplining the cattle rearers because I am one of them.\n\n\u201cI cannot say I am not one of them but he is being very unfair to me and I told him that the Nigerian cattle rearer was not carrying anything more than a stick sometime with a machete to cut some trees and feed his cattle but those sophisticated ones move with AK 47.\n\n\u201cSo, from other areas, people rush to Nigeria you know and Fulanis from Mauritania and Central Africa look the same, so they feel they are the Nigerian ones and I assure you that we are trying to resuscitate these cattle routes, grazing areas and make them accountable,\u201d Buhari said.\n\n$1.9bn Nigeria-Niger Republic railway project\n\nOn the $1.9billion Nigeria-Niger railway project, the president justified the decision, saying it would further strengthen the bond of friendship between the two countries.\n\nHe said borders were arbitrarily drawn by the French colonialists without taking into cognisance the cultural similarities of the people of Niger and Nigeria, pointing out he has first cousins in Niger Republic just like some people in the South-West similarly have cousins in neighbouring Benin Republic.\n\nBesides, the president said the Nigerian government embarked on the project to further boost the friendly relationship with Niger which has helped Nigeria in the insurgency fight.\n\n\u201cIf you recall, when I came, I went to Chad, I went to Niger, I went to Cameroon. Look at what happened with Boko Haram. If we were not in a good relationship with Niger, Chad and Cameroon, Boko Haram would have done worse things to us and you say I am going to Niger.\n\n\u201cI told you the border between us and Niger is 1,500km. And Niger (sic). I spoke to one French man and I had to tell him this. He spoke nonsense and I told him look, in 1885, you sat down and drew lines (boundaries). I said I have first cousins in Niger. There are Kanuris, there are Hausas, there are Fulanis in Niger Republic just as there are Yorubas in Benin. You can\u2019t absolutely cut them off,\u201d the president explained.\n\nBuhari said the new rail would help Nigeria compete with Benin Republic which has cornered entrepot trade in the region.\n\nHe said, Niger, as a landlocked nation, has discovered oil, and \u201cwe want them to come through Nigeria. We want them to send their exports through Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIPOB\n\nConcerning the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and their activities, the president said the group is like a dot in a circle that has nowhere to go.\n\nHe said: \u201cThat IPOB is just like a dot in a circle. Even if they want to exit, they will have no access to anywhere. And the way they are spread all over the country, having businesses and properties, I don\u2019t think IPOB knows what they are talking about.\n\n\u201cIn any case, we say we\u2019ll talk to them in the language that they understand. We\u2019ll organise the police and the military to pursue them.\u201d\n\nHe also said \u201cthe elderly people\u201d and \u201cthe youths\u201d from the South-South part of the country had assured their region had no intention to seceding.\n\nBuhari said IPOB would not have \u201caccess to anywhere\u201d even if they eventually secede from the country.\n\n\u201cI was encouraged by what I heard, nobody told me. Two statements from the south-south. One by the elderly people, they said this time around there would be no (secession). And again the youth made the same statement; such encouragement,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nLG system\n\nOn the local government administration in the country, the president frowned at the way the tier of government was being run, saying it had become almost non-existent in the country.\n\nHe said state governors continued to starve the local governments of funds, saying \u201cin a situation where N300 million is allocated to local government and they are given N100 million is not fair.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the spate of activities by bandits and kidnappers, particularly in the North West and North Central zones, the president said he had given the police and armed forces the instructions to be ruthless with bandits and vandals terrorising innocent citizens across the country.\n\n\u201cProblem in the North-west; you have people over there stealing each other\u2019s cattle and burning each other\u2019s villages. Like I said, we are going to treat them in the language they understand.\n\n\u201cWe have given the police and the military the power to be ruthless. You watch it in a few weeks\u2019 time there will be (a) difference.\n\n\u201cBecause we told them if we keep people away from their farm, we are going to starve. And the government can\u2019t control the public.\n\n\u201cIf you allow hunger, the government is going to be in trouble and we don\u2019t want to be in trouble. We are already in enough trouble. So we warned them, sooner than later, you\u2019ll see the difference,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also dismissed the assertion that majority of Boko Haram members were foreigners, saying his administration had done a lot to fight the terrorists and insurgents but the problem in the \u201cNorth-East is very difficult.\u201d\n\n#EndSARS\n\nSpeaking on last year\u2019s #EndSARS protest against police brutality, the president said it was targeted at removing him from office, even as he said the protest was responsible for the dwindling inflow of foreign direct investment to the country.\n\n\u201cThis question was answered last year when there was the #EndSARS protest. You remember the young people that wanted to march here and remove me?\n\n\u201cTell the young people to behave themselves and make the country safe, then we can attract real investors to the country.\u201d\n\nPDP faults claims on rail project\n\nBut the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) berated President Buhari for allegedly laying claims to projects done by the PDP-led governments.\n\nPDP National Publicity Secretary Kola Ologbondiyan started this while briefing journalists Thursday in Abuja.\n\nHe said rather than \u201caddressing issues and providing direction for our nation, President Buhari allegedly made very provocative comments that could embolden terrorists as well as serve as recipe for further division and violence in the country.\u201d\n\nThe party\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cOn Infrastructure, it is ludicrous to us in the PDP that Mr. President can disingenuously seek to subtract the deliverables achieved by past PDP administration from his so-called achievement on infrastructure.\u201d\n\nOlogbondiyan said Nigerians were also aware that President Olusegun Obasanjo, who was elected on the party\u2019s platform of the PDP, introduced a 25 years national development plan upon assumption of office in 1999.\n\n\u201cThis included the massive construction and expansion of road network, power plants, railways projects, inland and coastal waterways, airports, housing, agricultural and health projects as well as establishment of new universities and other legacy projects in various parts of our country,\u201d he added.\n\nOlogbondiyan further said: \u201cWe want to inform President Buhari, since he is not always aware, that successive governments elected on the platform of the PDP built on these development plans leading to the expansion of major trunk roads across our country, railways and other legacy projects which, probably, his handlers are making him to believe are his.\n\n\u201cIt is on record that President Goodluck Jonathan also took on a massive expansion of our international and domestic airports, across the country, built and commissioned railway stations.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to state that where projects were yet to be completed, it is only a natural occurrence for any Nigerian elected as President to proceed, in the national interest, to complete such projects.\n\n\u201cThe PDP therefore considers it tacky for Mr. President to seek to claim any credit for projects he never conceptualized, commenced or built to near completion, just because he found himself in office at the point of completion.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has officially flagged off commercial operations of the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge railway project yesterday.\n\nThe President while speaking at the flag off ceremony at the Mobolaji Johnson Railway Station, Ebute Metta, Lagos, said the project signals yet another milestone in the drive of the Buhari Administration to revitalize the railway system, establish it as a choice mode of transportation for both passengers and freight and position it as a transportation backbone that can transform industrial and economic activity in the country.\n\nAccording to President Buhari, the project is a vital line that establishes an end-to-end logistic supply chain in railway transport within its short corridor, Lagos \u2013 Ibadan, as goods to the hinterland would now be transported by rail directly from the Apapa port Quayside straight to the Inland Container Depot located in Ibadan from where it can be distributed to other parts of the country.\n\n\u201d In clear recognition of the challenges posed to our economic growth by absence of strong and effective infrastructure, we have in the rail sector, further to other ongoing railway infrastructure projects, embarked on the completion of the outstanding segment of the Lagos \u2013 Kano railway, which is Ibadan \u2013 Kano.\n\n\u201d The Lagos \u2013 Kano railway project when completed will link the Kano \u2013 Maradi line at Kano and a rail link from the Nigeria southern ports of Lagos to Maradi in Niger Republic will be achieved.\u201d\n\nBuhari noted that the connection through rail would position Nigerian ports as the choice for import and export business of the people of landlocked Niger Republic and it would be beneficial to the economy through employment from new business opportunities and wealth creation.\n\nHe revealed that the Federal Ministry of Transportation and Ministry of Finance have been directed to vigorously act on engagement and reaching financial agreements with appropriate co-financiers to partner with the Federal Government for the development of the Ibadan \u2013 Kano railway and the connection to the Tin Can Island port as well as the West \u2013 East Coastal rail line from Lagos to Calabar linking Onitsha, Benin, Warri, Yenagoa, Port Harcourt, Aba and Uyo.\n\n\u201d This is already yielding the desired result as construction activities on the railway segment, Kaduna \u2013 Kano has commenced with back-end engineering activities.\n\nDistinguished guests, from the beginning of this administration, railway infrastructure development has been given the priority it deserves and various milestones have been reached, right from when the Abuja \u2013 Kaduna railway was flagged-off for commercial operation in 2016 to this Lagos \u2013 Ibadan railway project being commissioned today for full commercial operation.\u201d\n\nHe commended the Minister of Transportation, Hon. Rotimi Chibuike Amaechi, for his drive and tenacity towards achieving the milestone recorded today, as well as the wonderful team in the Ministry that assisted in achieving this feat.\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Hon. Rotimi Amaechi earlier in his remarks expressed gratitude to President Muhammadu Buhari for summoning the courage to take the loan from China Exim bank to execute the rail project.\n\nHe also thanked the Chinese government for the loan with the hope that the Asian country will also approve the loan for the Ibadan to Kano axis which he said the Buhari led administration intends to start and complete before the end of its tenure.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful that the Chinese government through the China Exim bank was able to give us the loan at a concessionary rate to construct from the seaport down to Ibadan.\n\n\u201c We hope that we get money to be able to construct from Ibadan -Kano so that we can complete the track and make sure that business takes place,\u201d he said\n\nThe Board Chairman, Nigerian Railway Commission NRC in his welcome address reiterated that the importance of the project cannot be over emphasized as it would be of great impact to the Nation\u2019s citizens and her economy.\n\nThanking President Buhari for his support in ensuring the project is a success, he stressed that the occasion is the third time of the President commissioning railway project completed during his tenure.\n\nHe equally thanked the Minister for being the chief pilot of the project in which the project wouldnt have been successful without his tenacity.\n\nDignitries at the event include Professor Wole Soyinka, Minsters of Info and culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed , Works and Housing SAN Babatunde Fashola, Youth and Sports, Dr Sunday Dare, Minister of State for Health, Dr Olorunnimbe Mamora, Minister of State for Transport, Sen Gbemisola Saraki, Perm Sec Dr. Magdalene Ajani.

          "text": "*As Senate donates truckload of items worth N10m\n\nSenate President, Dr. Ahmad Lawan has appealed to Nigerians in leadership positions to always show empathy to the Internally Displaced Persons, IDPs in the country by ensuring that their lives and dignity are protected.\n\nLawan, who spoke yesterday when he led a delegation of senators to the Wasa IDP camp in southern Abuja to commemorate the 2nd year anniversary of the Ninth Assembly, said the planned visit was a conscious and collective decision of the upper legislative chamber.\n\nThe Senate delegation during the visit donated food items and other materials worth N10 million to the IDPs.\n\nLawan said: \u201cThis is an Internally Displaced Persons Camp. None of our sisters and brothers in this camp wanted to be here or wish to be here.\n\n\u201cAll of them are forced to be in an IDP camp, and those of use especially in leadership positions are supposed to show empathy and commitment in ensuring that while there our compatriots are in this camp and, indeed, any other camp, their life and dignity is protected.\n\n\u201c(And) of course, I\u2019d like to mention here that we must ensure that these Nigerians who are in this camp and other refugee camps, who are vulnerable in so many ways, receive what is due to them from the government.\n\n\u201cThat is to say, there must be sufficient security presence here and, indeed, across the country to protect them.\n\n\u201c(But) they also need the government to do what is right. We are supposed to as a government provide some livelihood here. We must be able to give them something to eat, and we should do so responsibly.\n\n\u201cWhen I use the word responsibly, I mean not to throw away a few things and leave them to eke a living, because it is going to be impossible for these people here to eke any meaningful living on their own.\n\n\u201cThis is a price we have to pay because of the security situation we have found ourselves in. Food alone is not enough.\n\n\u201cSo, we will take particular interest in the health facilities available to this camp and, indeed, others.\n\n\u201cWe would like to know the details of how and when they fall sick from a major sickness that would go beyond the capacity of primary health care \u2013 that requires a secondary health care intervention.\n\n\u201cWe have a national policy on refugees and people in camps like these, how are we up-to-date with the implementation of the provisions of that national policy? It may sound too hard, but they are necessary questions and we owe these people.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President added that the amendment to the Electoral Act by the National Assembly seeks to provide an electoral climate that would enable Nigerians to elect their leaders and representatives.\n\nHe explained further that the review of the Constitution by the Ninth Assembly is aimed at ensuring that governance is improved in the country.\n\nAccording to him, this can be realized through the provision of a legal framework that would provide for good governance at all levels of government.\n\nLawan disclosed that the National Assembly has been working closely with the executive arm of government to provide more resources to the armed forces and security agencies in the fight against insecurity.\n\nHe gave the assurances of the National Assembly to expedite action on the request when received, so as to ensure the return of internally displaced persons to their respective communities across the country.",

Freedom of expression and access to information both online and offline are foundational to prosperous and secure democratic societies,\u201d read a statement posted on the Department of State\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cWe support Nigeria as it works towards unity, peace, and prosperity. As its partner, we call on the government to respect its citizens\u2019 right to freedom of expression by reversing this suspension.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Twitter Deletes Buhari\u2019s \u2018In The Language They Understand\u2019 Tweet\n\nIn a move that has caused ripples across the nation, many Nigerians in the wake of the ban devised several means to sidestep the blockade including using Virtual Private Networks (VPN).\n\nNigeria\u2019s Minister of Justice and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami had in a swift reaction ordered the prosecution of people using the social media platform in the country.\n\nBut the US government has faulted the move as well as the National Broadcasting Commission\u2019s order to broadcast houses in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe United States condemns the ongoing suspension of Twitter by the Nigerian government and subsequent threats to arrest and prosecute Nigerians who use Twitter,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cThe United States is likewise concerned that the Nigerian National Broadcasting Commission ordered all television and radio broadcasters to cease using Twitter.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: #TwitterBan: SERAP Drags FG To ECOWAS Court\n\n\u2018You Must Register In Nigeria\u2019\n\nNigeria has one of the largest social media users in Africa. Over 120 million Nigerians can access the internet and about 40 million of them have a Twitter account \u2014 20 percent of the population, according to Lagos-based researcher NOI Polls.\n\nBut on Friday, the government suspended Twitter days after the company deleted a tweet from President Muhammadu Buhari referencing the Nigerian Civil War and threatening to deal with those responsible for recurring attacks on public infrastructure.\n\nThe ban triggered a flurry of reactions from far and near. Top diplomatic missions and rights groups have condemned the move and critics believe it is an attempt to cage the opposition.\n\nREAD ALSO: FG Says It Has Indefinitely Suspended Twitter Operations In Nigeria\n\nWhile the government has met with foreign envoys following the heavy outcry that greeted the suspension, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama says the tech giant is negotiating with the Nigerian government.\n\n\u201cThere are discussions ongoing with Twitter, we will see how that progresses, so I cannot say for now the duration of the suspension,\u201d Onyeama said after a meeting with diplomats over the issue.\n\nInformation and Culture Minister Lai Mohammed who is a leading figure in Nigeria\u2019s battle with the US-based technology firm on Wednesday defended the government\u2019s action.\n\nHe insisted that Twitter and other social media platforms must be registered in Nigeria before doing business in Africa\u2019s most populous nation.\n\n\u201cWhat we are saying is that for all platforms, you must register in Nigeria. You must be a corporate entity before you can do business in Nigeria,\u201d the minister said after the weekly cabinet meeting in Abuja.\n\n\u201cWhether it is Netflix, Iroko, or Facebook\u2026they are all doing business in Nigeria, making money and they are not paying taxes. This is in addition to being able to regulate them. They are making billions of naira out of this country and they are not paying tax. That can\u2019t be allowed to go on.\u201d\n\nA \u2018Deeply Concerned\u2019 Twitter\n\nThe minister has consistently questioned Twitter\u2019s motive in the country, accusing the technology firm of double standards.\n\n\u201cWe have a country to rule and we will do so to the best of our ability. Twitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria is very suspect, they have an agenda,\u201d he said while announcing the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very suspicious. Has Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? Has it? The same Twitter during the #EndSARS protests that were funding #EndSARS protesters, it was the first to close the account of the former president of the US, Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd you see when people were burning police stations and killing policemen in Nigeria during #EndSARS, for Twitter, it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened on the Capitol, it became insurrection.\u201d\n\nThe social media platform in a statement, however, said it is \u201cdeeply concerned by the blocking of Twitter in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccess to the free and #OpenInternet is an essential human right in modern society. We will work to restore access for all those in Nigeria who rely on Twitter to communicate and connect with the world,\u201d the microblogging site added.",

          "title": "Nigeria Plans to Launch Digital Currency Before December",
          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has unveiled plans to launch a digital currency before December.\n\nThe Director, Information Technology, CBN, Ms. Rakiya Mohammed, said Thursday during a virtual media briefing at the end of a Bankers Committee meeting that also held virtually that the digital currency would be accessible to all Nigerians.\n\nThe planned launch is coming about six months after the CBN barred deposit money banks and all other financial institutions from any virtual currency transaction.\n\nThe CBN, in a circular by its Director of Financial Policy and Regulation Department, Mr. Kevin Amugo, said deposit money banks and other financial institutions were being barred because payments and exchanges using cryptocurrency were untraceable and anonymous, making them susceptible to abuse by criminals, especially in money laundering and terrorism cases.\n\nBut Mohammed added that just like everybody has access to cash, everyone would also have access to the central bank\u2019s digital currency.\n\nShe said: \u201cLet me state categorically that cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin and the rest of them are not under the control of the central bank; they are purely private decisions that individuals make and are not part of this arrangement.\n\n\u201cWe have spent over two years studying this concept of central bank\u2019s digital currency and we have identified the risks. And it is one of the reasons why I said we are setting up a central governance structure that would involve all industry stakeholders to access all the risks as we continue on this journey.\n\n\u201cVery soon we would make an announcement on the date for the launch and by the end of the year, we should have the digital currency.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, about 80 per cent of central banks across the world are presently exploring the possibility of issuing the central bank\u2019s digital currency, saying that Nigeria cannot be left behind.\n\nShedding more light on the implication of the digital currency, Mohammed said: \u201cYou are aware that we have two forms of fiat money: The notes and the coins. So, the central bank\u2019s digital currency is the third form of fiat money. So, this digital money is going to complement the cash and note that we have.\n\n\u201cThe central bank digital currency will just be as good as you having cash in your pocket. So, if you are having the currency in your pocket, you are as good as having cash on your phone.\n\n\u201cNow, why did we need to go into this? There are different cases that the central bank is looking at. For instance, we have remittances, which is a huge market in Africa. We also know that in the last EFInA report, our target for this year was to achieve 80 per cent financial inclusion. We are about 60 per cent and at the rate we are going, it is unlikely we would meet this target. But the central bank digital currency would accelerate this target.\u201d\n\nShe said it would support the cashless policy as well as innovation, adding that the central bank has a \u201cvery clear roadmap on this and we are about to move to the next stage of a proof of consent after which we would start a pilot.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking at the media briefing, the Managing Director/CEO, Access Bank Plc, Herbert Wigwe, said the central bank planned to introduce what he termed local card scheme.\n\nAccording to him, the initiative would ensure that all card schemes are registered locally.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea is that if the card schemes are registered locally, payment would terminate locally and it would enhance the efficiency of the local payment system. It will also minimise the amount of money that banks and other institutions pay when you use foreign cards and help conserve foreign currency.\n\n\u201cSo, card schemes, local and international are advised to be registered locally. That way, the overall efficiency of the local payment system would be enhanced,\u201d he said.\n\nHis counterpart at Fidelity Bank Plc, Mrs. Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe, said the Bankers\u2019 Committee discussed how the central bank would ensure availability of forex during summer and the return of students to schools in September.\n\n\u201cThese are pressure points normally for forex and it has been observed that rates are going up. The CBN said all the banks must make sure there is forex availability always and anybody who wants to buy forex for BTA, PTA, medicals, students\u2019 fees, and others should be made to get them so that Nigerians would not resort to the parallel market,\u201d she stated.\n\nShe said the central bank assured bankers that BDCs would continue to have their weekly allocations, and the banks would have additional allocations.\n\n\u201cThe essence is to ensure that all the touchpoints where Nigeria needs legitimate forex are met. The whole idea is to ensure that the pressure on forex rates is reduced,\u201d she said.\n\nIn his contribution, Managing Director, Ecobank Nigeria Limited, Mr. Patrick Akinwuntan, said: \u201cAs the economy is being powered to grow post-COVID-19, SMEs continue to be of critical relevance. If you look at the growth recorded in our GDP, the non-oil sector, which is in the agric space, the SME space, contributed significantly to that growth.\n\n\u201cAnd as part of diversifying our economy and to create employment as well as for SMEs to be able to thrive post-COVID-19, there is a need to continue to assure the availability of forex to meet the needs of SMEs. All banks have been told to ensure that all demand for forex are met and the central bank reiterated its willingness to support the functioning of SMEs.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, the Managing Director, Sterling Bank Plc, Abubakar Suleiman, said: \u201cThe central bank has provided sufficient forex for us to meet the legitimate need of all Nigerian travellers and therefore the idea of going to any other market should not arise at all.\n\n\u201cSo, for all the businessmen out there, if you have a legitimate business and you need forex, all the banks have been positioned to provide you forex. For travellers, if you have the right documentation, there is no need for you to go to another market.\u201d",

          "text": "Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, on Thursday admitted that the federal government is exceeding its borrowing plan for 2021, blaming the development on the COVID-19 pandemic and the fall in oil prices.\n\nIn an interview with France 24, the minister said inflation had continued to heighten, worsened by an inadequate supply of foreign exchange, adding that the problems have a lot of multiplier effects on the economy.\n\nShe stated that the fiscal space remains tight now, but the federal government is re-planning, cutting down non-essential expenditures and providing resources where they are most needed like in the health sector.\n\nAhmed described as disturbing a World Bank report, which put a large portion of Nigerians under the poverty line, saying it was caused largely by the COVID-19 pandemic and fall in oil prices.\n\nHowever, she said the economic sustainability plan was targeting massive recruitment, health insurance, and a review of the poverty indices, to redress the setback COVID-19.\n\n\u201cOur fiscal threshold was that we shouldn\u2019t borrow more than 3 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), now we are at about 4 per cent of GDP and that\u2019s a target that we are trying to work on and bring down,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the revenue side, she stated that the target is to move revenue to GDP from the current 8 per cent to 15 per cent, adding that the 8 per cent is low for the size of the Nigerian economy.\n\nSpeaking on the ease of doing business, against the backdrop of the federal government\u2019s suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations, she said it won\u2019t affect Nigeria\u2019s image, as no foreign body should be allowed to cause war in the country.\n\n\u201cYou cannot shut out the president of a country and not expect consequences,\u201d the minister added.\n\nShe described the suspension of Twitter as a well-thought-out decision, saying it shouldn\u2019t affect the country\u2019s image in the eyes of international investors.\n\nShe said the move was \u201cnot something that we take lightly,\u201d and that the government had planned talks with the social media company over the issue.\n\nThe minister identified accessing available doses as the biggest challenge facing the country\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination programme.\n\nNigeria has so far only received four million of the 43 million vaccines it was promised by the Covax programme, according to the minister, who said the government expected to vaccinate 70 per cent of its population by next year.\n\nThe country\u2019s economy went into recession in 2020, largely due to a drop in oil prices, but Ahmed hoped for a strong upsurge in growth by the end of the year.\n\nThe government is planning to create jobs with massive new investment in public works and low-cost housing, she said, while the extra spending would be funded by increasing tax revenue and improving tax collection process.",

Again, history shows that our thoughts are very infinitesimal to the immutable law of the universe.\u201d\n\nThe statement said Ohanaeze Ndigbo had followed with deep concern the security sequence targeted at the Igbo; namely: \u201cThe deliberate posting of Northern military and police officers at the various strategic locations in the South-east, the special National Security Council meeting, where major decisions were taken for the South-east and the South-south to the utter exclusion of security personnel from the South-east of Nigeria; the ominous launching of the Operation Restore Peace in the South-east and South-south, the Shoot-on- sight order by the Inspector General of Police targeted at the Igbo youths, and the shocking tweet where Mr. President stated that \u2018those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the agitation by IPOB became heightened due to the exclusion of the Igbo in Buhari\u2019s government, adding that the president has not in any way hidden his disdain for those that failed to vote for him en-masse in 2015 and 2019 general elections.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo has cautioned that the unprecedented lopsidedness of the Nigerian government in favour of the Fulani, to the exclusion of other ethnic groups, especially in the security architecture, will rather exacerbate the internal security challenges in the country. History shows that leaders who espoused ethnocentric ideology, especially in Africa, had often created more problems than they intended to solve,\u201d Ohanaeze said.\n\nIt described the agitation by Igbo youth over marginalisation as justified.\n\nIt, however, added that in spite of the orchestrated alienation of the Igbo, it remains committed to a diplomatic approach towards a restructured Nigeria that guarantees equity, fairness and rule of law.\n\nAlso, the Secretary General of Afenifere, Chief Sola Ebiseni, said Thursday while reacting to Buhari\u2019s interview on ARISE News Channel, that \u201cfirst, his arranged interview on Arise Television is not a substitute for the clamour of Nigerians that the president, as the father of the federation, should speak to Nigerians in these critical times.\n\n\u201cSecondly, his engagement was full of lies, inconsistencies, contradictions and utter disrespect for the ethnic nationalities, including their elected governors. He is pathetically unschooled in the constitution which he often claims to guide him in spite of its manifest flaws.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s claim that his appointment in the armed forces is based on merit and seniority and not to satisfy geopolitical zones, is a violation of the letters and intendment of the provisions of Sections 217-220 dealing with the armed forces of the federation and appointments thereto.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, Section 217 (3) provides that the composition of the officer corps and other ranks of the armed forces of the federation shall reflect the federal character of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn Section 219, all the powers given the president, including the appointment of service chiefs, is subject to the Act of the National Assembly ensuring the reflection of the federal character. Even his latest appointment of the chief of army staff, is flawed particularly on seniority.\n\n\u201cThe constitution never contemplates nor approve of the situation under Buhari where 90 per cent of the commanding heights of the armed forces and security architecture will be from only Northern Nigeria and only the two zones of North-east and North-west\u201d.\n\nAfenifere accused Buhari of taking delight in ridiculing the Ndigbo, which he used IPOB to represent.\n\n\u201cThus, to him, the Igbo and their territory is just a dot in a circle of the map of Nigeria, which even if they secede, could exit to nowhere since the elders and youths of the South-south had assured him of not being part of the secessionist agenda. He couldn\u2019t have been reacting to the IPOB but the Igbo who he said had businesses everywhere. His utterances were very un-presidential and in the mode of common expressions with some unidentifiable northern organisations.\u201d\n\nAfenifere stated that Buhari owned up to the statements of his media aide, Garba Shehu, that the ban on open grazing by the governors was illegal.\n\nIt said the president contradicted himself when he admitted that he asked two of the South-west governors to exercise \u201ca non-existent powers\u201d to deal with terrorists herdsmen who he acknowledged bear arms, even as foreigners against Nigerian citizens.\u201d\n\nAfenifere regretted that the president \u201chas no solution rather than the braggadocio of re-opening grazing routes in states by repossessing such lands for his beloved herdsmen.\u201d\n\nIt added that the Yoruba people are solidly behind their governors, adding that not an inch of land in the territory will be carved out for any grazing reserves.\n\nTHISDAY",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday disclosed that he has directed National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission (NSIWC) to carry out an upward review of salaries of policemen.\n\nThe president also stated that 10,000 new personnel are being recruited into the force, declaring that no administration since 1999 was as committed as his administration in reforming and repositioning the Nigeria Police Force and national policing architecture.\n\nBuhari spoke Thursday in Lagos at the official launch of newly procured security equipment, including hundreds of patrol vans for the state security agencies by the Lagos State Government at the Parade Ground, Police College, Ikeja, Lagos.\n\n\u2018\u2018In 2019, I signed into law the Act establishing the Nigeria Police Trust Fund, the first in the history of the Force, to provide guaranteed funding to support Police welfare, logistics and equipment.\n\n\u2018\u2018In September 2020, I assented to the Bill amending the Nigeria Police Act, which was originally enacted in 1943.\n\n\u2018\u2018This new Act, a vast improvement over the old one, among other things spells out the modalities for the implementation of a National Community Policing Scheme in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018This new scheme will build confidence within our local communities and make them active stakeholders in the safety and security of their environs.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are currently recruiting 10,000 new Police officers to reinforce our personnel capacity across the country. In addition to this, I have directed the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission to carry out an upward review of Police salaries and benefits,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe reiterated his directive to security operatives to shoot-on-sight anyone found to be wielding AK-47 and other assault weapons.\n\nThe President also vowed that his administration will act firmly and decisively \u2018\u2018against any and all persons fomenting or carrying out attacks on our Police Force and other security personnel.\u2019\u2019\n\nBuhari warned that \u2018\u2018a nation that turns its Police personnel and infrastructure into targets of violence and destruction is a nation on the path of self-destruction.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018As Commander-in-chief, my primary responsibility remains the security of the country and the safety of all citizens. Despite the many challenges we are facing, I want Nigerians to rest assured that we will secure this country.\n\n\u2018\u2018We will secure our infrastructure, our highways, our communities, and our forests, and we will secure the lives of our people,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President told members of the Nigeria Police that as the government strives to improve their welfare and capacity, the citizens equally had expectations from them.\n\n\u2018\u2018First let me commend the Inspector-General of Police and the entire Force for the recent efforts to restore peace to troubled parts of the country.\n\n\u2018\u2018I have charged the Inspector-General to leave no stone unturned in rebuilding the morale of his officers and men, especially in the aftermath of the mindless violence associated with the EndSARS protests, as well as the recent spate of attacks on Police Stations in some parts of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated that the removal of service chiefs and the appointment of officers, who have been at the theatre of operation and command the respect of fellow soldiers will ease the insecurity in the country.\n\nHe described the security situation in the North-east and North-west as overwhelming.\n\nHowever, he said the government was on top of the situation, adding that bandits are now being treated as criminals and are currently suffering heavy casualties but are unwilling to admit it for fear of losing their recruitment constituency.\n\nHe said: \u201cTry and appreciate what the federal government has done. One, we have removed all the service chiefs and the Inspector-General of Police; made new ones. We allowed them to go round and see the problem. They have been part of it all the time but now they are in charge and we made sure that their priority is to make sure they bring normalcy. They have to accept the responsibility of their offices and perform. We are working very hard on this but we cannot give it much publicity so that we can take the criminals unawares.\n\n\u201cThe problem in the North-east and the South-south we understand them, but the North-west, same people, same culture, killing each other, stealing each other\u2019s cattle, burning their villages.\n\n\u201cAs I said, we are going to treat them in the language they understand. We have given the military and the police power to be ruthless and you watch it, in a few weeks\u2019 time there will be a difference- because we told them, \u2018if we keep people away from their farm, we are going to starve and the government cannot control the public.\u2019\n\n\u201cIf you allow hunger to permeate the whole society, the government will be in trouble and we don\u2019t want to be in trouble. We are already in enough trouble. I can assure you that sooner than later you will see the difference.\u201d\n\nThe president reiterated his commitment to go after the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Eastern Security Network (ESN) by treating them in the language they understand.\n\nHe added: \u201cI said it, and we will do it. My statement about speaking the language (they understand) is very simple. It is meant for all criminals in Nigeria. What it means for the IPOB is that I will go after them through the military and police and rid them of their criminal tendencies. I have no regrets whatsoever\u2026\u201d\n\nOn allegation that his appointments of service chiefs were lopsided as they did not reflect federal character, Buhari said he could not be forced to appoint unqualified people.\n\nHe added: \u201cYou\u2019re saying someone who has gone through military and police training all his life should not be appointed to lead the military or police department he works with just because we must balance appointments? What are you saying? The system didn\u2019t restrict anyone from joining the military or the police, and if you decided not to join, we will not force you, but you too will not force us to bring someone who is not qualified in training and experience when it comes to leadership of these institutions just because we want to balance some appointments\u2026\u201d\n\nOn the appointment of Chief of Army Staff, Maj. Gen. Farouk Yahaya, Buhari stated that he could not just pick anybody because of seniority, adding that he appointed someone who has been in the military, worked and fought with the soldiers, and is well known to them.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen you look at NNPC, military, the people who have been there for 18 years or 10 years, trained in Zaria, or Abeokuta. They came through the ranks and because they served under all the circumstances and they gradually rise to that status. Those positions have to be earned. There are people who have been there for 10 to 15 years. When you join, you go through the programme and you rise through the system.\u201d\n\nThe president also downplayed the concerns over which region will produce his successor, saying his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), has the final say on whether his successor will emerge from the South or the North.\n\nAccording to him, the APC\u2019s recently concluded membership registration is designed to rid the party of godfathers and give members across board a say in the party.\n\n\u201cWe should allow the party to decide. I have just told you that we have started from the bottom-up and I gave the acting chairman the end of June to submit a report on the convention we are going to conduct and then arrange the general election, all elections till 2023. We have started this from the bottom up so that members of the party will feel they are involved in decision making. Nobody is just going to sit in Lagos and tell them what to do. This is what we are arranging.\n\n\u201cSuccession plan depends on the party. We are going to leave that to the party. The party will sit and make a decision by the constituencies that they won and so on. So, those who want to be president, they better join APC,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari added that the controversial railway to the Niger Republic will be of immense economic benefits to Nigeria.\n\nWhen completed, he said, Nigeria would benefit from the import and export trades of Niger Republic, which currently go through Benin Republic.\n\n\u201cHow many rail routes do you have? You have to cultivate our neighbours. If you don\u2019t, you will be in trouble. If you could recall, when I came on board, I had to go to Chad, Niger, and Cameroon, which was what happened with Boko Haram. If we were not on good terms with the three countries, Boko Haram would have done worst things to us than this. About Niger, our border with Niger is about 1,400 kilometres. On Niger, I have to tell you this: the Europeans in 1885 sat down with ruler and pencil and drew lines and I say I have first cousins in Niger Republic. There are Kanuris, there are Hausas, there are Fulanis in Niger Republic, just as there are Yorubas in Republic of Benin. You can\u2019t absolutely cut them off.\n\n\u201cBut the rail, look at the plan, if you watch the plan and why we are constructing the railway. Niger has discovered oil as you know and we don\u2019t want them to go through Benin Republic. We want them to come through Nigeria. We hope that they will send through Maradi all their exports, through Nigeria rather than through Benin Republic.\n\n\u201cWith the roads and the railways working, those from Maiduguri to Port Harcourt, those from Kano to Lagos and so on, definitely, if you make the infrastructure, road, rail, work, I can assure you that Nigerians will keep themselves very busy and they will leave you alone.\n\n\u201cBut when the roads are not working, the roads are virtually crippled, people will have so much time to harass you,\u201d he stated.\n\nOn how he will spend his time after his presidency in 2023, Buhari said he would retire to his farm.\n\n\u201cI have never avoided my farm. I still have got a number of cattle. When I leave, I will still, go to my farm daily. I will try and keep myself busy. Between now and then, I will keep on convincing Nigerians that I mean very well. I will make sure that the few identifiable problems that we have, security, economy, fight against corruption, we will continue to work on it, and as I said, visibly, we have made progress in the North-east, we have made progress in the South-south but I am overwhelmed almost in the North-west and they are going to get it very soon,\u201d he added.\n\nAsked what will be his legacy, he said: \u201cI will like Nigerians to discuss it, I hope they will be fair to me. I wouldn\u2019t like to say it myself. I will like Nigerians to try and spend time when we came, both the security and the economy, where we were for the eight years I may be around and try to look at it, I hope Nigerians will be fair to me. This is all I need.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY",
