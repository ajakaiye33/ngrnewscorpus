          "title": "We face ridicule, can\u2019t walk long distance \u2013 Children with obesity",
          "text": "A recent World Health Organisation analysis warned that one in 10 children and teenagers will be obese by December 2023 in 10 high-burden African countries if no robust measures are taken to curb the increasing incidence of the health condition. In this report, some children living with obesity lamented that the health condition is making life tough for them, noting that they are troubled by their inability to engage in some physical tasks like their peers. They also bemoaned their obesity-related health issues and the daily mockery they endure due to their weight. ANGELA ONWUZOO reports\n\nLiving with obesity has been quite challenging for a 13-year-old Daniel Akpan and his parents.\n\nDaniel, an indigene of Akwa Ibom State, said the excruciating pain he daily experienced on his knees and waist had been making life difficult for him.\n\nThe JSS 3 student, said despite his young age, he could barely walk a long distance let alone run due to his weight, unlike his peers who were doing such with ease.\n\nBesides the physical pain, the young boy said his condition was also bringing him psychological pain due to stigma which he lamented was making life unbearable for him.\n\nDaniel decried the ridicule and mockery he had to go through daily in the hands of neighbours, friends, family members, and classmates who made fun of him for being obese.\n\nSharing his frustration with PUNCH Healthwise, Daniel who is the only son of his parents said, \u201cSince primary school, I have been having pains in my legs due to my weight. My weight is too heavy for my legs to carry and because of that walking, most times becomes a difficult task for me.\n\nConstant leg and waist pain\n\n\u201cI always experience pain in my waist and knees. There was even a time in my primary school when I stopped going to school because of my weight. I am not happy with my size at all. It is denying me a lot of things and comfort.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t eat some of the things my sister and friends are eating; I can\u2019t run; I can\u2019t walk a long distance and if I try to do that, it will be as if I want to faint.\n\n\u201cThe chocolates, sweets and biscuits that my mates consume, I can\u2019t consume them because my mother said they will make me add more weight.\n\n\u201cI am given small portions of food, especially wheat all the time. Yet, I am still fat despite all those restrictions. I feel bad each time I am unable to do what my peers are doing nor eat what they eat.\n\n\u201cAnd I was told that if my weight remains like this, I may have a heart problem. The whole thing is making me sad.\u201d\n\nI stopped going to government school because of stigma\n\nContinuing, Daniel said, \u201cNow, apart from the health problems, the ridicule and mockery that I face daily over my weight is too much.\n\n\u201cSometimes, I feel like not going to school nor interacting with anybody because of the way people look at me. I can\u2019t walk on the street freely without people calling me all sorts of names.\n\n\u201cIf I am walking on the street or going to school, people will call me \u2018Orobo, fatty bum bum. In the compound where we live, if I should come out to play, people will be calling me names and will also be touching me anyhow.\n\n\u201cSome will say I have a big breast, tummy, and buttocks like a woman.\u201d\n\nDaniel, looking sad, said some people even accused him of being responsible for his problem by eating too much.\n\n\u201cSome people will call me a glutton. I was attending a government school before but because of the way they mock me and call me \u2018Orobokibo\u2019, my parents had to withdraw me from the school and put me in a private school.\n\n\u201cThe mockery is still there in private school but it\u2019s not like what I experienced when I was attending the government school,\u201d he recounted.\n\nI am not happy with my looks\n\nOn measures taken to help himself apart from the small portion of food given to him by his mother, Daniel said, \u201cI am doing exercise to see if I can change how I look but I am not seeing any improvement. I want my weight to go down. I am not happy with how I look.\n\nDaniel\u2019s mother, Mrs. Margret Akpan, who gave insight into the plight of her son, told our correspondent that her son was quite small when she gave birth to him on October 14, 2009.\n\nMy son became obese after recovering from an illness\n\nThe 41-year-old mother said Daniel became obese at the age of two after recovering from illness.\n\nShe narrated, \u201cWhen I gave birth to him in 2009, he was not fat. He weighed 2.5kg at birth. Around a year and six months, he became sick and was given treatment.\n\n\u201cIn 2011, after he recovered from that illness, he started gaining weight rapidly and when it was becoming too much, I took him to the private hospital where he was treated.\n\n\u201cGetting there, the doctor referred us to Massey Street Children\u2019s Hospital, Lagos Island. At Massey, we were asked to carry out certain tests after which one of the results showed he had high cholesterol.\n\n\u201cSo, he continued to gain weight to the point that he now developed bowlegs because his legs could no longer carry his weight. The weight began to cause him serious pain in his legs. So, I started giving him Lipton tea, grape water, and lime to see if he would shed weight.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, the pain in his legs became worse as he could no longer walk again because of his weight.\n\n\u201cSo, I took him to Massey hospital again. When I got there, they referred us to the Lagos University Teaching Hospital.\n\n\u201cIt was at LUTH that he was diagnosed with obesity in 2018 after several tests were carried out on him. \u201cSo, they asked me to bring him to LUTH every Friday for an exercise, but I was not able to do so because of my work.\u201d\n\nThe businesswoman stated that her efforts to help her son to lose weight had not been successful.\n\n\u201cHe is still obese despite all we have done. You can see his size. I told him to exercise at home but he refused. He is always complaining of tiredness and he eats a lot. If I give him a small portion of food, he will go back and take more.\n\nTo continue reading this story, go to: https://healthwise.punchng.com/\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\n\u2026says the Speaker attended the same universities as him\n\n\u2026berates mischief-makers, urge them to stay away from infamy\n\nBy Festus Ahon, ASABA\n\nNiger Delta youths activist, Chief Vincent Oyibode has said the Speaker of Delta State House of Assembly, Rt Hon Sheriff Oborevwori is duly qualified to stand in for the State 2023 governorship election.\n\nReacting to widespread rumours of possible disqualification of Rt Hon Sheriff Oborevwori from the governorship race over discrepancies in certificates tendered before the screening Committee in Port-Harcourt, Oyibode condemned the negative media in a session on the social media and online platforms.\n\nHe described it as mischievous campaigns of calumny against the frontline gubernatorial aspirant, Rt Hon Sheriff Oborevwori, warning his detractors to stay away from their path of infamy and join hands to \u201cbuild a better Delta State for all instead of dwelling on completely unfounded claims of discrepancies in the certificate of the speaker.\u201d\n\nOyibode said; \u201cI went to the same Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma, Edo State with the Speaker and we were in the same faculty of Social Science. The Speaker was also in the same University as me during his Master\u2019s program, Delta State University, Abraka from where he graduated with a Master of Science degree in Political Science (Msc).\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that some persons who dread the rising political profile or do not know Rt Hon Sheriff Oborevwori too well on issues of Educational attainment have gone to town with some blasphemous claims of possible disqualification.\n\nRt. Hon Sheriff Oborevwori is a second class upper graduate of Political Science from Ambrose Alli University, Ekpomah Edo, State in 2004. Anyone who doubts this should go to the 16th Convocation Brochure of the aforementioned institution for quick verification. Oborevwori wouldn\u2019t have been admitted to a degree program without the requisite documents and qualifications.\n\n\u201cHe later obtained a master of science degree in Political Science (Msc)from the Delta State University, Abraka. Sheriff was a full-time Student in both degree programs and not a part-time Student. Did sheriff submit his credentials to be elected a member of the Delta State House of Assembly before electing him as Speaker? If yes, what happened to the certificates he submitted that qualified him to run for House of Assembly? Same qualifications can make him Governor as well as president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria\n\n\u201cI read Public Administration in my first degree and Sheriff Oborevwori, as mentioned earlier studied Political Science. The institution\u2019s Exams and Records section is there for anyone to visit and verify. We later met at DELSU Abraka where he was a year ahead of me in our master program.\n\n\u201cAbraka is close by. Those doubting my claims should go and verify instead of resorting to wild and dubious publications against a man who has laboured hard to build a reputation for himself. Politics and electoral victory are not by cheap blackmail but by hard work and God\u2019s favour.\n\n\u201cThose disgruntled elements spreading the unfounded rumours must stop their evil act. They should confirm or verify every piece of information and not write anything based on assumptions. To the best of my knowledge, there is no confusion in the camp of Governor Ifeanyi Okowa.\n\n\u201cEverything is intact and the project is very much on course. The family is united and focused. Deltans are Sherified and no evil rumour can change what has been ordained by God. Sheriff is the next governor of Delta State. You can take that to the bank\u201d.",

          "text": ".\n\nAs 1,598 new officers, recruits join Air Force\n\nBy Ibrahim Hassan-Wuyo\n\nThe Minister of Defence, Major-General Bashir Magashi (rtd) has assured that in addition to the recent procurement of J-F17 Thunder multi-role aircraft and Super Tucano attack aircraft to enhance the capacity of the Air Force to tackle current security challenges in the country, the country is also expecting the delivery of the DA-42 surveillance aircraft, A109 Trekker helicopters and Beechcraft KA-360i aircraft.\n\nThe Minister spoke in Kaduna on Saturday as 49 new officers were commissioned and 1,549 recruits enlisted into the Nigerian Air Force (NAF).\n\nRepresented by the Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, the minister charged the military to protect the lives and property of Nigerians in the face of the various security challenges bedevilling the country.\n\nHe said the military profession was more than just a job, but a career that required hard work, especially at this crucial time in Nigeria\u2019s history, when the Nation was battling the challenges of insecurity on several fronts.\n\nThe Minister served as the Reviewing Officer at the Combined Passing Out Parade of Cadets of Branch Commission 1/2022 and Recruits of Basic Military Training Course 42/2021 at the NAF Military Training Centre, Kaduna.\n\nHe charged the new officers, personnel and other officers and men of the service to ensure optimal utilization of resources at their disposal while subordinating their personal interests to those of the Service and the Nation.\n\n\u201cThe military profession, which you have chosen, requires absolute discipline, loyalty and hard work, among other virtues. It is much more than just a job, especially at this crucial time in our Nation\u2019s history, when we are battling the challenges of insecurity on several fronts.\n\n\u201cAs such, you are expected to secure the lives and properties of the Nigerian people and ensure that they can live in peace and pursue their legitimate aspirations without fear. Such a noble service demands extraordinary courage, commitment, and patriotism, and Nigeria will continue to count on you and demand such qualities from you.\n\n\u201cToday, undoubtedly, marks a special day in your lives and that of your families, given that you have successfully scaled through the rigorous training at this Centre. I must highlight that the training was deliberately made to be demanding to simulate, as closely as possible, the real-life scenarios you are likely to encounter going forward.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, encourage the graduands, and indeed all personnel, to ensure optimal utilization of resources while subordinating their personal interests to those of the Service and the Nation. Above all, you must exhibit the core values of \u2018Integrity\u2019, \u2018Service before Self\u2019 and \u2018Excellence\u2019 for which the Nigerian Air Force is known.\n\n\u201cAt this juncture, I would like to appreciate the President, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, President Mohammadu Buhari, for his unflinching support to meet our Armed Forces\u2019 operational and logistics requirements in general and the Nigerian Air Force in particular.\n\n\u2018Accordingly, the Federal Government\u2019s recent procurement of new platforms such as the J-F17 Thunder multi-role aircraft and Super Tucano attack aircraft to enhance the capacity of the Nigerian Air Force to tackle current security challenges in the country is a testament to Mr President\u2019s quest for equipping the Nigerian Air Force.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Air Force is also expecting the delivery of the DA-42 surveillance aircraft, A109 Trekker helicopters and Beechcraft KA-360i aircraft in the next few years, among so many other requirements. We, therefore, once again thank Mr President for strengthening our Armed Forces and pledge our unalloyed loyalty and total commitment towards restoring peace and order in all parts of the country.\n\n\u201cLet me commend the Chief of Air the Staff for providing the right leadership to his officers, airmen and airwomen. I have noted with satisfaction, the measures that you have emplaced to engender transparency, accountability and prudent utilisation of resources for optimal results. I implore you not to relent and assure you of my continued support to sustain your capacity development efforts,\u201d he said,\n\nThe Minister presided over the presidential commissioning of the 49 Branch Commissioned Officers into the Air Force as Flying Officers.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ",\n\nBy Chimaobi Nwaiwu, NNEWI\n\nUnknown gunmen numbering about eight Friday evening at about 7. 30 pm invaded a popular beer parlour in Obiofia Village, Osumenyi, in Nnewi South Local Government Area of Anambra State, killing four men mainly youths, and a lady said to be the owner of the drinking joint.\n\nNo fewer than ten people sustained various degrees of injuries from the gunmen and those who sustained theirs while running for their lives.\n\nSaturday Vanguard gathered that the yet to be unidentified gunmen who invaded the restaurant drove to the area and immediately opened fire on customers who were drinking and having fun.\n\nThe popular beer drinking spot known as \u2018Uto Ndu\u2019 Beer Parlour (Swiftness of Life) is owned by the lady victim from Amichi, a nearby town to Osumenyi, also in the same council area.\n\nAn indigene of Osumenyi, who pleaded anonymity said told Saturday Vanguard that the number of the victims, including the dead and the injured, could not be ascertained until Saturday morning because of the time of the incident, adding that people were afraid to come out following the sporadic and persistent gunshot, adding that some of the dead victims may have died due to no assistance offered them to hospital.\n\n\u201cI have spoken with about four victims who are close to me, and they told me that they sustained serious injuries from the invading gunmen, just like others numbering over eight.\n\n\u201cWe are in fear here because we do not know the grouse of the invading gunmen, in fact, we are confused, as we do not know the reason this could happen in our town, we do have cult members here. Our youths are don\u2019t involve in cult activities. It was a pure unknown gunmen activity but we do not know where they are coming from.\n\n\u201cWhile I cannot speak for anybody, o doubt if an Igbo man will just go yo a drinking place where people are relaxing and enjoying themselves and open fire on them without exchanging words with them. What I know some hoodlums do is surrender them and collect their money and phones. But the gun men came in their cars, stopped, alighted and opened fire on people without taking anything away from them.\n\n\u201cWe are so afraid here and we are in deep mourning because they are vibrant and responsible youths of Osumenyi, who were cooling off after the days of toiling. Is really painful my brother. We are in deep mourning and fears.\u201d\n\nThe joint is in a very strategic place as you enter Osumenyi from Amichi, which is opposite the compound where youths from the community gather to conduct some development activities in our town.\n\nA trending video on social media from the scene of the incident, shows the lifeless body of four of the male victims, with that of the female, said to be the owner of the drinking spot lying lifeless in their blood.\n\nSympathizers, friends and relatives of the victims were also seen mourning and lamenting as the corpses were being loaded in the Sienna bus suspected to be an ambulance, for evacuation to the mortuary.\n\n\u201cA weeping feminine voice was also heard in the background lamenting in Igbo language, \u201cWhat have we done oooo? Who have we offended? What did we do to deserve all this kind of attack and killing?\u201d\n\nThe Osumenyi attack is coming barely one month after gunmen invaded the Nnewi South Local Government Headquarters in Ukpor and set some buildings and offices ablaze, after which they also killed a security man guarding the premises.\n\nIt will also be recalled that the unknown gunmen after burning the council headquarter which attracted the state governor to the scene, the next day set three Police stations in Ezinifte, Amichi and Osumenyi on fire.\n\nIt will also be recalled that gunmen, on Easter day, attacked another beer parlour and fast food joint, known as the \u2018Sophia Fast Food\u2019, located close to the Federal Polytechnic, Oko, in Orumba South Local Government Area of the State, where they also attacked and robbed customers who were having a fun-filled Easter bash at the restaurant.\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer in Anambra State, DSP Tochukwu Ikenga, is yet to confirm the Osumenyi Friday night attack, when he was contacted according to him, \u201cenquires are still ongoing and I will revert back to you when I get clear information on the incident.",

He, therefore, called on the Commission to partner with the Chamber to enable it to record greater success in the ICTEL 2022 edition.\n\nResponding, Director, Digital Economy, Dr. Austin Nwaulune, who received the delegation on behalf of the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta, applauded LCCI for its consistency in organising the annual conference.\n\nNwaulune stated that the theme of this year\u2019s conference aligns with the Commission\u2019s focus on facilitating infrastructural development and deployment to enhance the socio-economic development of Nigeria.\n\nDemonstrating the connection between the thematic focus of the conference and NCC mandates and activities, Nwaulune explained that, through the NCC, the Federal Government has established various policies such as the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (2020-2025), which is being vigorously implemented to improve broadband infrastructure across the country.\n\nThe Director Digital Economy Department at the Commission also recalled efforts of the Commission in ensuring that the seven Infrastructure Companies (InfraCos) already licensed by the telecom regulator accelerated their infrastructure deployment across the six geo-political zones of the country.\n\nThe Director commended the organisers for the calibre of sponsors listed for the expo and asserted that the event will be a hub for stakeholders such as Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), InfraCos and international organisations, and offer them the opportunity to glean developments in the country and to deepen their interests in promoting innovation, competition.\n\nIn his comments, the NCC Director, Consumer Affairs Bureau, Efosa Idehen, explained that the Commission has evidently adopted an open-door policy and particularly through its consumer-centric initiatives.\n\nHe also emphasised that the Commission appreciates collaboration with stakeholders whose programmes allow consumers to interact with the service providers.\n\n\u201cThe NCC prioritises the consumers. We, therefore, see this forthcoming expo as another opportunity for the consumer\u2019s voice to be heard as they interface with service providers.\n\n\u201cThis is based on our regulatory mandate of ensuring that consumers of telecommunications services get value for their money and are treated right as critical stakeholders in the telecom ecosystem,\u201d Idehen stated to reiterate NCC\u2019s commitment to the promotion, protection and defence of the interests of telecom consumers",

Excerpts:\n\nAs a member of the ruling party, APC, how do you see the N100 million peg for the purchase of presidential form amidst fighting corruption?\n\nWhen one is buying APC presidential form; you are buying a form from a party that is already in power, have a national structure, robust outreach and on INEC register; one might buy a form for N100 million and then spend significantly less than someone who buys his for N10 million to contest for the national office. Could you compare a plot of land for N10 million to a luxuriously tasteful furnished mansion to be sold at the same price? Presidential form is for serious minded people who are ready to contest and win election. Anyone who is serious enough to run for the presidency can either afford it or have the national appeal to be able to raise funds from far and wide. If the forms are very cheap, it will become too easily accessible and everybody will buy it will complicate the primary process. I do not think it is too expensive at that price.\n\nN100 million for just presidential form?\n\nIf you are running for presidency in Nigeria and do your logistics calculations based on touring the 36 states at the very minimum, another tour for the six-geopolitical zones, look at a structure of the election day with several agents at over 100 polling units across the country ensuring people vote for you, canvassers in every ward wearing your cap campaigning for you; work out the number and see that N100 million will be a tiny percentage of the total sum. Except one is talking about people who just want to be called aspirants, who want their names to be included for negotiation later, but for a serious minded-person who wants to contest and win election, N100 million should not be a problem.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nYou were former deputy governor for almost 11 years, what were those things you did in Jigawa State that the electorate would look at and bring you back to office assuming you want to contest and become the governor?\n\nConstitutionally, I served as a two-term deputy governor and left to contest for the Senate in 2019. Though it was a most rewarding experience, challenging in the sense that being a deputy in Nigeria, everything boils down to your relationship with your principal. A lot of people call deputy governors spare tyre, some wait for crisis to erupt, there have been cases where deputy governors are impeached. One goes in there with a full complement of the office, long convoy with sirens and then at the end of the day, you might feel a bit underutilized. In a situation where there are specific roles for deputy governors, it will help. Whatever the role is between the two, the deputy has something to contribute to the big office.\n\nWhat have you observed from the different declarations from different political zones?\n\nMy take on the so many declarations is that this is the season for declarations. We have seen political gladiators that can hold on their own vying for various offices, some governors rooting for second term, some want to escalate their services to the national level, we have also seen a vice president who wants to succeed his principal, what is surprising is how everybody is dancing around the issue because of the electoral dynamics. I am yet to see a serious female presidential aspirant; we have seen a couple of young men who are representing the youths. Activities are happening so close to the electoral primaries. In most states, we are yet to see the emergence of aspirants because they are waiting for the guidelines.\n\nWill you be contesting governorship of your state?\n\nI have not really made up my mind because of the peculiar political system we have in Jigawa State. It has to be discussed at consensus level. We are waiting for that to happen then we sit down and discuss it. It will be pre-emptive on the part of anyone to make a declaration now.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nIf you finally make up your mind and probably win the election, what will be your primary focus, especially with the state of women?\n\nEven as a senator, one of my three-cardinal principles is supporting women and girl-child education. My programmes in the last two years, everything is geared towards girl-child education, all my sponsorship projects are on primary and post primary schools exclusively for girls\u2019 schools. We have a programme that secures schools and gives parents the encouragement to allow their girls be in school. We beefed up the security, provided solar power security around the schools, secured more hostels that are better positioned, constant security patrol within the schools in my zone. We also provided CCTV camera coverage for all the girl\u2019s secondary schools. Again, we have a bicycle programme that provided 2,000 simple girls bicycles for students who walk through and fro a distance of three kilometers to their secondary schools daily. When we noticed the challenge was the distance, which enabled most parents to withdraw their wards from school; we introduced the bicycle system. There are also rewards for healthy academic competition, empowerment like deep freezers, solar light, motor-cycle for the parents to encourage the girls go to school. My focus has been on women, even if I become the governor, it will also be my primary responsibility.\n\nWhy bicycle in place of school bus and driver?\n\nFrom experience, school bus and driver would be grounded within three-four months because no one would be responsible for the maintenance and drivers\u2019 payment. In 2015, we inherited a rural ambulance programme, when we bought a station wagon to serve as a quick ambulance for the community, within seven months, it was all over 90 per cent of the services were dedicated to personal commercial and family use. But a bicycle is a \u2018gift and forget programme\u2019, the little personal maintenance would not break the bank. Again, bus would not traverse some of the places, they are foot and motorcycle paths.\n\nWhat do you think about the declaration of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo against his political godfather, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu?\n\nHonestly, I do not think there is any thing wrong with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s declaration to contest for the position of the presidency. We are talking about politics and not cultural things. I do not see any reason he cannot contest for the number one seat. If he has made the declaration before Tinubu, then this dynamic would have been different. People are saying Asiwaju has declared his ambition, Osinbajo should have stepped down for him. I don\u2019t think that Asiwaju himself has taught he would come out unopposed. If you look at the two principals, both have been matured about the situation, there is no hard or negative feeling from any of them. At the end of the day, I can assure that even if its 50 aspirants, only one will emerge; then others would support whoever that emerged from the same political party.\n\nWhat kind of president are we looking for?\n\nI am hoping that we have someone who will tackle three-four agenda in the first two-three years of emergence. If we have a president who will pick his cabinet from a rich variety of professionals who will focus on economy and security situations first. If these two could be handled within two years, I believe others will pick up immediately.\n\nWhat about the clarion call for presidency of Igbo extraction?\n\nTo be honest, I could not careless whether we have a presidency from Ghana or Ivory Coast if he can come and sort out the problems in the land. If we have a president of an Igbo extraction who cannot deliver, what will be the gain? Let our new detribalized leader focus on polity, tackle insecurity, unite the country and deliver on promises. If people have jobs, economy is driven, efforts are rewarded, create sectors that will absolve the younger generation, safety is assured, all these agitations would stop.\n\nOn insecurity in the land?\n\nSecurity is the number one issue that needs to be solved. There is absolutely nothing that will happen in the country without handling the security situation. In fact, it is even threatening the 2023 election, which is the bedrock of democracy that gives every government its legitimacy. So, it has to be addressed. Security requires some level of focus, there is need to change the security architecture, pay a premium on intelligent gathering, acquire best and most sophisticated security surveillance equipment to tackle the situation and then move into a preventive phase instead of being defensive. The resources spent in the last seven years by this administration should have gotten it right though I am not a security expert.",

          "text": "By Doris Obinna\n\nThe dynamics of the 2023 presidential race in the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) may change next week, with the expected surprise entry of President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan.\n\nUntil now, majority of the presidential aspirants in APC are from the South, with the exception of Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, from the North. Some of the southern aspirants include Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo; leader of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; Ekiti State governor, Kayode Fayemi; Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi; former governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunke Amosun; former governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha; Minister of Transportation, Hon Chibuike Amaechi; Minister of Labour & Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, and Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, among others.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nCompetent sources told Saturday Sun that some northern elders, who are desirous of having the APC retain power, looking at what is happening in the opposition political party, the Peoples Democratic Party, are working to draft Lawan, from Yobe in North East, into the presidential race.\n\nIt was gathered that the Senate President has been under immense pressure to join the race, since the northern elders mooted the idea and may succumb after the Ed-el-Fitr celebration, following a decisive meeting in Saudi Arabia by northerner powerbrokers, who had gone for hajj. He is likely to formally declare his intension to contest after the Sallah holiday.\n\nSources revealed that Lawan might become the dark horse who will become the consensus candidate of the APC in next year\u2019s presidential race. Afraid that the APC might field a presidential candidate from the South and be disadvantaged, the northern elders rooting for Lawan fear that in the event that PDP also succumbs to pressure and settles for a southern presidential candidate or opts for former Vice President Atiku Abubakar or one of the consensus candidate their counterpart in the PDP chose, former Kano State Governor, Musa Kwankwaso, who recently dumped the PDP and joined the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), would become a formidable force that could topple the apple cart.\n\nSpecifically afraid that Kwankwaso may become the favourite bride of northern voters, in the event of the above scenario, northern elders wants to draft Lawan as their own consensus candidate in the APC. It was gathered that the northern elders would set out to brief and get President Buhari\u2019s buy-in this weekend, before Lawan would be persuaded to formally join the presidential race.\n\nOne of the points the northern elders have marshalled out to convince Buhari, who, it was learnt, is tilting towards having a South East presidential candidate for the APC, include telling him that fielding a southern candidate when Kwankwaso is in the race or when the PDP could pick a northern candidate, would place APC at a disadvantage. Also, the group wants to tell Buhari that having Kwankwaso as a major northern candidate, in the expectation that APC and PDP could field southern presidential candidates, would give him an advantage and could lead to having a president who would emerge outside the scope of northern powerbrokers. The group also wants to tell Buhari that it would be disastrous for the APC to lose next year\u2019s election, as a president from another political party would cause the decimation and possible death of the governing political party.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nSaturday Sun gathered that the northern elders planning to draft Lawan are proposing a vice president from the South East or South West. Whichever geopolitical zone, between the South East and South West that does not get the vice presidential slot would produce the next Senate President, it was gathered.\n\nAlso, in the arrangement, the position of the Speaker, House of Representatives would be zoned to the North-West, while North Central would produce the Deputy Senate President. Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives will go to South South. The plan is to have all major positions shared among the six geopolitical zones as a way of having a government of inclusion.\n\nAccording to the northern elders\u2019 proposal, if Lawan is supported to become the president on the APC platform, he would do only one term, to allow South East take over thereafter. His coming is expected to consolidate the hold of the APC and also work for the political party\u2019s penetration to the South East, in order to make the transition of power to the zone after four years seamless and easy.\n\nSources say the pro-Lawan group is not sure how President Buhari would take the proposal, giving the fact that the President wants to surprise the South East with the APC presidential ticket. A South East senator has been consistent in saying that President Buhari may surprise the Igbo before leaving office, apparently referring to the President\u2019s disposition to have someone from the South East fly the APC presidential flag next year.\n\nEfforts to get the reaction of Lawan on the emerging succession plot proved abortive. He and his aides refused to make comments. Lawan has been a supporter of Tinubu, in the expectation that the APC would concede the presidential ticket to the South, it was gathered. With the development, his support would shift, in the overall interest of the APC.\n\nOwing to the fact that northerners were not joining the presidential race in APC, there has been an assumption that the governing party would zone the presidential ticket to the South.\n\nThere has been agitation and pressure that power should shift to the South after President Buhari. Southern governors, in both APC and PDP, have severally stated that power should shift to the zone next year. The demand has been high in PDP until recently when pro-South presidency voices started coming up in APC.",

The party has not made a decision and I cannot preempt what the party\u2019s decision will be.\u201d\n\nGovernor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State had, just before the party\u2019s National Convention, said even though the APC had not decided on zoning the presidential ticket, the swapping of national offices was an indication of where its presidential candidate would come from.\n\n\n\nThe APC swapped its national offices between North and South, leading to the emergence of Adamu from the North-central as the National Chairman in March.\n\n\n\nResponding to the issue of when political appointees who intend to contest in the election are expected to resign, especially in the light of the party\u2019s recently issued guidelines for people in that category, Adamu declined comment, saying \u201cthe matter is currently in court.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cOur luck on this end is that I happen to be a lawyer and the issue you are raising is in court right now. So, it will be subjudice for me to discuss it at all.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the issue of the cost of the party\u2019s nomination and expression of interest forms, which many considered rather high, the Chairman said the party had no regret setting the prices at the current rate, citing the need to protect the party from unserious aspirants, moles, as well as the need to generate money to run the election processes.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been listening, with rapt attention, to the hues and cries from our lovers and from our adversaries. We have no regrets whatsoever. We did some homework, we know what it takes to go through primaries, go through presidential campaigns, go through election for the President. We know what it takes.\n\n\u201cWe also do know that there are citizens who are qualified to contest, but who are not serious contenders, who will just want to take anything cheap by the roadside, and assert what they call their rights and create problems for our party.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also aware that some parties that have no chance whatsoever to win the presidential election in Nigeria, they will sponsor people into parties that have prospects for winning the election, to create problems for us, to divert our attention.\n\n\n\n\u201cOver and above that, yes, we are the ruling party. Yes, we need to set examples in what we do, but I ask you, I don\u2019t know which part of the country you come from. If, God forbid, your traditional ruler dies today, contestants to that office will go for more than N100 million, it\u2019s no news.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I contested for the Senate, all I paid was just a token; N5 million, N10 million, including the expression (of interest). When my colleague wanted to be chairman of the party, in the days of Adams Oshimhole, it cost him N500,000. Today, for me, just as an example, to contest the national chairman of our party, I had to pay N20 million.\n\n\u201cAlright, and even the enormity of work that has to be done, and this work will be done with money. We don\u2019t want to continue begging.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, I want to say that we\u2019re able to mobilise sufficient funds to support our efforts to win the election. Some protests may be well founded, I have no quarrel with that, but the propensity of this, that people just assume \u2018it\u2019s the ruling party\u2019, is quick\u2026 in our democracy.\n\n\u201cI will not quarrel with that, everyone of us has the right to express himself, and I\u2019m in full support of these obligations, but we wear the shoes for our party and we know where it pinches us the most.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn reports that the process of settling for a presidential candidate could tear the party apart, if not carefully handled, Adamu said: \u201cGod will not allow that to happen to us. We will come out, by the grace of God, at the appropriate time, our great party will choose the candidate at the convention.\n\n\n\n\u201cI do not want to speculate, but my duty as chairman is to listen to party men, party leaders, stakeholders, to see what is going to be best when the time comes and I\u2019ve always found it easier and more noble to get a bridge before I jump to cross it. We are not there yet.\u201d\n\nAPC\u2019s Presidential Aspirants Lengthen to 13\n\n\n\nThe number of presidential aspirants on the platform of the APC jumped to 13 yesterday as the Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi, sent out a notice that he would formally declare for president next Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nFayemi joins a long list that includes Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo; former governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu; former governor of Abia State, Orji Kalu; ex-governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha; Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State; Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State, Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige; Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba; former president of the Senate, Ken Nnamani; Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State and Senator Ibikunle Amosun.\n\nFive of the presidential aspirants have so far paid N100 million and picked up their forms. Those who did were Tinubu, Umahi, Bello, Nwajiuba and Okorocha.\n\n\n\nNnamani, while declaring his intention to run for president yesterday, promised to improve on the legacy of President Buhari, while also demanding for the reduction of the cost of interest and nomination forms for aspirants seeking elective posts under the APC.\n\n\n\nHe said compared with other aspirants, he was the most suited for the job of the President.\n\nNnamani said his pedigree as the President of the Senate and Chairman of the Presidential Committee on Constitutional and Electoral Reform make him the right candidate.\n\n\n\nOkorocha picked his presidential expression of interest and nomination forms yesterday, insisting that Nigeria\u2019s biggest challenge remains the inability to create wealth.\n\nOkorocha, who was presented the documents by \u201cThe New Nigeria Team\u201d, in his Unity House office in Abuja, maintained that he remained the right candidate to take over from Buhari, promising that his government would be pro-people.\n\nTinubu Support Groups (TSG) yesterday picked the N100 million Expression of Interest and nomination forms on behalf of Tinubu.\n\n\n\nThe TSG team was led by a member representing Ikeja Federal constituency in the House of Representatives and the Chairman House Committee on Finance, Hon. James Faleke.\n\nFaleke said Tinubu paid for his form personally but asked them to pick it up on his behalf because he was out of the country.\n\nThe lawmaker stressed that Tinubu was the candidate to beat, no matter the mode of primaries adopted by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\n\n\u201cAsiwaju at the appropriate time will deliver his address to us, but I know that this country under Tinubu will be better off. Economy will be better off because he is an economist, he is not a lawyer, he is an economist. He will deal with the economic situation of this country. He did it in Lagos, the security challenges in Lagos were solved by him. He will solve the same security challenges. He is a man who rewards loyalty, who ensures that people who work are also taken care of.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn his part, the former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Babachir Lawal said Tinubu is a branded product, adding that every Nigerian knows that he is the man to beat.\n\n\n\nOn his chances, he noted, \u201cIf we were not sure we have chances to win this election we would not waste our N100 million. Everybody\u2019s free to buy the forms if he has N100 million. The choice is his own. He has the money. But as far as we are concerned, we are only fulfilling the constitutional requirement of campaigning and going for election. We don\u2019t foresee any opposition in the contest.\u201d\n\nPDP Screens Presidential Aspirants\n\n\n\nThe PDP yesterday screened all its presidential aspirants ahead of its National Convention slated for May 30.\n\nFormer senate president, David Mark headed the presidential screening committee.\n\nAll the presidential aspirants like the former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, former Senate President Bukola Saraki, former secretary to the government of federation Anyim Pius Anyim, Chief Dele Momodu, Peter Obi, Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, Governor Emmanuel Udom, Governor Aminu Tambuwal, Mohammed Hayatu-deen and Ayo Fayose, were at the screening.\n\n\n\nThe committee at the end of the sitting disqualified two aspirants.\n\nMark confirmed this after the conclusion of the exercise at Legacy House, Abuja, at 7pm yesterday.\n\nHe, however, refused to disclose the identities of the disqualified aspirants or the reasons for their disqualification.\n\nMark simply noted that the aspirants did not meet the requirements.\n\n\n\nBut sources told THISDAY that the likely disqualified aspirants were Dr. Nwachukwu Anakwenze and Cosmas Ndukwe. Ndukwe took the party to court over zoning.\n\nMark also affirmed that the report of the screening will be transmitted to the PDP National Working Committee for consideration Friday night.\n\n\n\nAnyim, who spoke to reporters after screening, described the process as simple, explaining that they were asked about their financial capabilities for campaigns, when they became members of the party and their tax papers.\n\nAlso speaking after screening, former governor of Ekiti State, Ayo Fayose warned the party against jettisoning zoning \u201cas it will hurt the PDP in the future.\u201d\n\nBut Governor Emmanuel disagreed saying, \u201cany decision taken by the PDP on zoning is supreme and must be obeyed.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso Peter Obi who described the screening exercise as perfect said that he would respect the position of the party on zoning.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Omo N\u2019Oba Uku Akpolokpolo Ewuare II, accompanied by members of the Royal Court of Benin and the Board of Trustees of the Benin Royal Museum.\n\n\n\nThe Royal Majesty was at the State House to thank the President on the recent return of two important Benin Bronzes to its original place of abode by the University of Cambridge and the University of Aberdeen, both in the United Kingdom, after 125 years.\n\n\n\nThe Royal Museum, to be housed in the palace of the Oba of Benin, is in conjunction with the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM).\n\n\n\nThe Oba of Benin told the President: \u201cWe want to reassure Mr. President that the Royal Court of Benin and NCMM are working closely to ensure safe custody, preservation and enhancement of these Benin Bronzes and artefacts, not only for their cultural and economic benefits, but more importantly towards the promotion of the tourism industry in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Royal Majesty reassured Nigerians that the Benin Bronzes and artefacts represent the country\u2019s cultural heritage in particular and Africa in general, saying \u201cwe hold these objects in trust as the original owners in conjunction with NCMM for the benefit of all.\u201d\n\n\n\nEarlier, the President declared that the federal government would continue to vigorously pursue the repatriation of Nigeria\u2019s looted artefacts from abroad, including 1,130 Benin Bronzes in Germany\u2019s public museums and Ife terracotta/bronze heads in Netherlands and United States museums.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the returned artefacts, Buhari expressed delight that it had brought immense goodwill and acclaim to Nigeria, the ancient Benin Kingdom, as well as happiness to the Oba of Benin.\n\n\n\nHe noted that while it was widely acknowledged around the world that some of the best ancient arts belong to Nigeria, including those from Benin, Ife, Nok and Igbo-Ukwu, many of these beautiful works were illicitly taken away, particularly during the colonial period.\n\n\n\nAffirming that these great cultural and artistic works were records of history, the President vowed that Nigeria would not permit these great works to become properties of others, adding that this administration had made it an important task to ensure the return of the artefacts.\n\n\n\nThe President, therefore, assured the first-class traditional ruler that the federal Government would continue in this great cause with his support and that of other traditional rulers.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cIn furtherance to these efforts, an agreement between Nigeria and Germany is currently being prepared.

This will be a monumental achievement.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2018Furthermore, on the 7th of this month, the Glasgow City Council agreed to return 17 Benin Bronzes to Nigeria.

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

How are you doing? How do you intend to spend your weekend? If you don\u2019t know, you can still use my tips. I think I\u2019m down for enjoyment this weekend. And I guess you know what to do. Haha! Again, nobody will know.\n\nWell, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore information on Flutterwave\u2019s CEO\n\nFinancial literacy for startup founders\n\nEden Life\u2019s expansion and acquisition\n\nOnePort 365\u2019s $5m seed\n\nQuick update on the Flutterwave CEO story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, April 12, 2022, David Hundeyin, an investigative journalist, accused Flutterwave Founder and CEO, Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola of impersonation, inappropriate behaviour, and insider trading in an article.\n\nFollowing that article, various stories were published. However, an article was published yesterday, Thursday, April 28, 2022, that provided some interesting points to the story.\n\nI\u2019m not going to bore you with epistles. Here are some key points:\n\nAccording to Rest of World, in 2019, Iyin Aboyeji, former CEO of Flutterwave, who resigned from the board in 2018, was arrested by the Nigerian police and spent the night in jail.\n\nWhy? The company was accused of fraud at the time, per the police, after failing to refund a customer card transaction. The company had failed to remove Aboyeji\u2019s name from official documentation, hence, his arrest. Nonetheless, he was eventually released without charge.\n\nOver the last two years, Agboola has backed at least 25 startups, typically investing between $25,000 and $150,000. Among his investments are stock trading app, Bamboo; fintechs, Mono and Sudo Africa; and the media company Big Cabal Media, publisher of Zikoko and TechCabal.\n\nDue to the recent allegations, an acquisition deal has come to a halt. It is unclear who is acquiring who. The concern is that Flutterwave may be unable to raise a series E.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that we still don\u2019t know, but I simply want justice to be served. What do you think?\n\nWell, since you are here, I think you\u2019ll find this story enlightening: Analysing 2 major allegations against Olugbenga Agboola\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nFrom forging a career in blockchain to learning how to make money with NFTs, the Web3 space can be very tricky.

Register and get your early bird tickets here.\n\nFinancial literacy for startup founder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, I watched The Smart Money Woman, and I believe there are many Zuris out there, regardless of gender, race, religion, or employment.\n\nFirst off, who is Zuri? The main character, Zuri, appeared to be financially successful but suffered a series of misfortunes that made her realise she was in financial trouble and needed to make sound financial decisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough she was sound, educated, had an amazing job, and was literate, Zuri was financially illiterate but soon understood that she had to learn to make good financial decisions.\n\nHow was she financially illiterate? She couldn\u2019t read and write matters related to money. \ud83d\ude02 Hey, I\u2019m kidding. Scratch that. She was financially illiterate because she couldn\u2019t stick to a budget, manage her debt, or make wise financial decisions.\n\nMaybe you\u2019re checking yourself to see if you\u2019re financially literate. To be honest, I can\u2019t answer that question because it\u2019s a little tricky. This time, I\u2019m not going to give you the gist. \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut, be honest, do you believe you are financially illiterate as an individual, entrepreneur, or startup founder?\n\nDo you believe that startup founders, regardless of their background, should embrace financial literacy? Is financial literacy necessary?\n\nRemember we had a Twitter Space titled Do startups need financial literacy? a few weeks ago. We had Olumide Adesina and Kalu Aja speak to us about the concept and what it means for startups.\n\nConsequently, Chimgozirim took his time to give us an interesting overview of the conversation. I believe you\u2019ll learn something from it, whether you\u2019re a startup founder or not. You can find it here: \u201cAll startup founders must be financially literate.\u201d \u2013 Olumide Adesina\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

Also, the company has acquired Lynk, a technology company that connects unemployed Kenyans to job opportunities in Kenya.\n\nWhy the expansion? Building on its success in Lagos, Nigeria, Eden says it intends to remove obstacles to discovering dependable household services in Nairobi.\n\nWhat\u2019s its success rate in Lagos? The company claims that the service has had an 80% retention rate since 2021, with a 15% MoM growth rate.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you think of when you hear financial literacy for startups? If you\u2019re like most people, you\u2019re probably wondering why startups have to be financially literate, especially when much of the conversation around financial literacy has been about personal finance.\n\nAs surprising as it is, even businesses need financial literacy. Most African tech startups are founded by individuals with more technical than financial skills. However, building a business requires more than just technical skills; you have to create a budget, pay salaries, deal with taxes, and allocate scarce financial resources.\n\nWith this in mind, on Friday, April 15, 2022, we had Olumide Adesina, a financial market analyst and Kalu Aja share their thoughts on financial literacy on a Twitter Space titled \u201cDo startups need financial literacy?\u201d\n\nAccording to Investopedia, financial literacy is the ability to understand and effectively use various financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinancial literacy is the application of financial knowledge to processes in our personal lives or businesses. For Adesina, everyone, from companies to individuals, needs financial literacy. However, he pointed out that knowing about financial issues does not equate to financial literacy.\n\nStartup founders, he said, must have some form of financial literacy, especially in the early stages when they may not be able to afford to hire professionals to handle their financial matters. Understanding budgetary processes and knowing how to read a business\u2019 balance sheet are two skills that he advises startup founders to have.\n\n\u201cYou need to understand budgetary processes, for example, how to read balance sheets. You can\u2019t be a founder in today\u2019s world, understand your product, but can\u2019t relay that to investors. Founders who don\u2019t have these skills can always learn the basics within six months.\u201d\n\nKnowing how to allocate resources is another skill that he believes startup founders should have, and he advises that founders should separate their personal finances from business finances.\n\nLearning how to manage a business\u2019 finances and running the business might sound like a daunting task for anyone. Adesina pointed out that startups can hire a chief financial officer (CFO) once they can afford one. Where this is not possible, he advised that startups outsource that aspect of their business but not before mentioning its disadvantages, including the inability to get complete buy-in.\n\nFor Kalu Aja, financial literacy for startups is really about cash management and how a startup can utilise financial resources like debt and equity to build a sustainable business.\n\n\u201cThe first thing you want to do when you\u2019re starting is have a money guy on the team. This could be an accountant or CFO, but you need someone to watch how you invest and use your money. A business can survive with bad ideas, bad sales, and a bad CEO, but a business cannot survive without cash.\u201d\n\nStartups need skilled individuals to build great products. However, they need to be paid, and early-stage startups may be unable to afford them. Fortunately, there are creative solutions, such as giving out employee stock option plans (ESOP).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmployee stock option plans allow an employee to purchase a certain number of shares in a company at no charge, a nominal value, or a price below the fair market value after a specified period during their employment.\n\nThis way, startups can compete favourably with more established companies. Founders also need to be paid, and Adesina advises that they can make money from consulting or other business ventures to take some pressure off the business.\n\nWith many startups opting for venture capital investments, Adesina observed that founders need to be careful while deciding what kind of investment they accept.\n\n\u201cAre you raising money just for the fun of raising money? Are you raising money to scale or to acquire another company? These are fundamental questions to ask before going out to raise money. Also, statistics have shown that companies with significant traction get better valuations when raising from VCs,\u201d he added.\n\nAlthough local banks are not known for providing funds to startups, Aja and Adesina believe that they can give a lot of value to startups. However, they advise that startups identify ways that banks can provide value besides providing financing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nMy day didn\u2019t start well for me yesterday. A few minutes after eating my usual breakfast of bread and beverage, I began to feel ill \u2013 a dizzying sensation that improves with rest. So I knew I needed to rest because I wouldn\u2019t have been able to write today\u2019s newsletter.\n\nIn some workplaces, taking a nap in the morning is frowned upon. But isn\u2019t one\u2019s health and safety important at work?\n\nToday, April 28, 2022, is World Day for Safety and Health at Work. The day raises awareness about the global prevention of workplace injuries, illnesses, and deaths and the pain and financial hardship these events can cause for workers, their families, and employers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople\u2019s ability to perform their jobs in the least harmful way to their health \u2013 known as occupational health \u2013 is just as important as their physical, mental, and sexual health. So, as an employer, put your employees\u2019 occupational health first, and as an employee, prioritise your employer\u2019s occupational health.\n\nToday, while you stay safe and healthy at work or home, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nUnderstanding the Web3 hype\n\nThe Digital Service Act\n\nAnother phishing scheme\n\nUnderstanding the Web3 hype\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an Internet user, I\u2019m sure you know that the term, Web3, is quite popular these days. Plus, you\u2019re probably asking, \u201cVictoria, what exactly does Web3 mean?\u201d Well, I believe by the end of this piece, you should get a fair idea.\n\nThe web has evolved from a tool used only by academics and computer geeks to a necessity we can\u2019t live without over the last two decades. That development has come at a cost, with some tech behemoths dominating the platforms we rely on.\n\nAnd blockchain enthusiasts believe that Web3 will change all of that. But what exactly is Web3? Before we get there, I think it\u2019s critical we understand Web 1 and 2.\n\nWhat\u2019s Web1? Tim Berners-Lee released Web 1.0 \u2013 the first browser \u2013 in 1993, and it provided a new way for people all over the world to access information. But navigation and design were difficult.\n\nSo, tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Amazon, and Facebook sprung up and began to facilitate navigation and design. They gathered data and made searching a breeze. This epoch is known as Web 2.0. That is the era we are currently living in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, you\u2019re asking, \u201cWhy Web3 when searching is easy?\u201d Well, many people today are concerned these tech giants facilitating navigation and design wield too much power. So, Web3 was created to return this control to the end-user.\n\nBilled as the next generation of the web, Web3 focuses on decentralisation using decentralised blockchains. Maybe, your next question is how is Web3 decentralised? Well, the link provides answers to that.\n\nRemember our Twitter Space, Making Sense of the Web3 Buzz? Bolu, our go-to Blockchain person, crafted a brilliant story from the discussion. Don\u2019t forget that we had an investor, a designer, and a founder on that Space who shared their perspectives.\n\nDon\u2019t you think it will be interesting to read their points of view? Catch up on the story here: Making sense of the Web3 buzz through the eyes of an African investor, founder, and designer\n\nAgain, you\u2019re possibly asking, \u201cVictoria, how can I get involved?\u201d Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve got you covered. Please take a look at it in the next story.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nFrom forging a career in blockchain to learning how to make money with NFTs, the Web3 space can be very tricky. That\u2019s why we have created an entire event dedicated to Web3.\n\nLet NFT artists and blockchain devs show you the ropes at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit. Register and get your early bird tickets here.\n\nThe Digital Service Act\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly on Saturday, April 23, 2022, I was at home, relaxing and watching a movie. But the European Commission was in a different mood.\n\nWhat happened? That Saturday, the European Commission announced a political agreement between the European Parliament and European Union (EU) member states on the Commission\u2019s proposal for the Digital Services Act (DSA).\n\nKeep in mind that the DSA was proposed alongside the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in December 2020.\n\nWhy the DSA? The Act will protect against the spread of illegal content and includes additional measures to protect European citizens\u2019 fundamental rights.\n\nAlthough the legislation only applies to EU citizens, the impact will undoubtedly be felt worldwide. But who is subject to the DSA\u2019s regulations?\n\nThe rules of the DSA primarily apply to online intermediaries and platforms like online marketplaces, social networks, content-sharing platforms, app stores, and online travel and accommodation platforms.\n\nIs there a penalty? Noncompliance can result in fines of up to 6% of a company\u2019s annual revenue.\n\nBut what\u2019s the DSA all about? The DSA includes specific requirements for minors, online marketplaces, online platforms, and search engines, with stricter requirements implemented proportionally for very large online platforms\u2019 (VLOPs) and very large online search engines\u2019 (VLOSEs).\n\nIt also contains guidelines for using deceptive interfaces, like Dark Patterns, and for the transparency of recommender systems.\n\nChimgozirim explained how it could work in today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast, and how it may affect the Internet in the future. You can listen here.\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

Before they were stolen, those NFTs were worth $2.7 million.\n\nSound familiar? Yeah. The official Bored Ape Yacht Club Discord channel, and several NFTs Discords, were hacked earlier this month as part of a phishing scam. The hacker tricked users into clicking a link to \u201cmint\u201d a bogus NFT by sending Ethereum (eth) and, in some cases, an NFT to wrap into a token.\n\nHowever, it is still unclear how the hacker gained access to the BAYC Instagram account. In an official tweet, BAYC says, \u201ctwo-factor authentication was enabled and security surrounding the IG account followed best practices.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nEverything You Need to Know About Sleep Terrors\n\nADHD and Hypersexuality: What\u2019s the Connection?\n\nHow mindfulness changes the emotional life of our brains\n\nGen Z\u2019s mental wellness harmed by need to be perfect teen\n\nSleep is your superpower.\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe FT x Cardano Blockchain Challenge is sourcing ventures building or interested in leveraging the Cardano blockchain platform and community.

To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockchain awareness and user education is a background check that must be done to foster blockchain adoption. Bekonta is taking major moves to implement this awareness stage. In a Festival of culture \u2013 an event put together by the Dance and Drama Community Development Service of the FCT National Youth Corps Members at Merit House Maitama FCT Abuja, and driven by the need to encourage blockchain\n\nadoption mainstream, Bekonta is so pleased to announce her honor as sponsor to the Festival of Culture \u2013 an event which staged an aesthetic showcase of the Nigerian cultural heritage in drama, dance, music, poetry and, pageantry.\n\nAs a Cryptocurrency Exchange, Bekonta provides an easy payment gateway for blockchain transactions. You can make direct deposit and withdrawals from and to your Naira wallet as the case may be, from your Bekonta\n\naccount. Being part of the Fintech industry and seeing the sporadic growth recorded overtime, we believe that events such as was organized by the FCT Dance and Drama NYSC CDS, presents an opportunity to sensitize youths about the current stage of the global Fintech which includes:-\n\nExposing Corps Members to the several opportunities in the global Fintech\n\nPromoting the adoption of these opportunities mainstream\n\nFunding new subscribers\u2019 wallet with initial capital\n\nIn a one thousand capacity auditorium, the event was graced with positive turn-ups and top NYSC officials. The presence of the Director Press and Public Relations NYSC, Mr Eddy Magwa, a highly detribalized official and a host of other officials, and corps members in the 6/7 regalia dignified the event with honor and color.\n\nOur involvement as Sponsor to the event was more comely than we expected as Corps members and indeed the audience got engaged in a unique way. Branded items such as the Bekonta caps and stickers were handed out as a token in addition to cash funding of $10- $20 to our first 20 subscribers for an on spot activation bonus.\n\nThe feedback is the part of the narrative we are so excited to share. we almost ran out of gift items plus Bekonta was met with highly active sign-ups. Our Q&A / Red carpet session lit up the event as Corps Members stopped at nothing to engage with positive vibes, taking photos, commentaries as in the pictures below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Festival of Culture with the Bekonta presence engaged Youth Corps Members in a unique way. The Festival emphasized the uniqueness in the Nigerian cultural diversity without leaving a doubt. It also presented an avenue to recognise the similarities the Nigerian ethnic groups share largely in common. Bekonta identifies with the uniqueness in the Nigerian ethic diversities, especially our payment gateway that presents zero regional tolerance and our team members springing from across different regions.\n\nHowever the event drew the team\u2019s attention to notable concerns which could require a plan for a larger event setup. Such cases are quite common but this is unique because cryptocurrency adoption is a future that Fintech can hardly deny, and we see the many opportunities that saccompany its adoption mainstream. Our major concern lies in the need for new subscribers to recognise these opportunities and their use cases.\n\nThe regulatory gap that keeps cryptocurrency and its adoption apart globally, is such that feeds us with much less worries when compared to the level of grounds to be covered in spotlighting the opportunities in the current fintech phase.\n\nNevertheless, Bekonta will continue to make deliberate efforts in this regard through sensitization and sponsorship.\n\nWant to get started on your cryptocurrency journey?

          "title": "Nigerians forgo staple food items as inflation bites",
          "text": "The recent hike in food prices has caused many Nigerians to rethink their food consumption pattern. Some have adjusted it according to their budget realities while others have overhauled their diet completely to fit their income.\n\nFood items such as turkey, fish, beef, sausage, milk and other animal protein sources are fast becoming exempted from families\u2019 diets due to the surge in their prices.\n\nA Twitter user expressed his disdain for the current situation and how he copes with it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy how Nigeria\u2019s food inflation simply forces you to forgo some food items and move on with your life. I haven\u2019t bought turkey since it cost N3200 per Kg. I stopped buying sardine when it became N380.\u201d he said.\n\nOthers expressed anxiety they feel each time they go to the markets as the prices of food always exceed their budget.\n\n\u201cInflation has forced me to stop buying noodles, yam, sardines, spaghetti, eggs, etc. The list is endless. Sometimes I am even scared of going to the market.\u201d said a Twitter user @fynest_fine .\n\nThe table below shows the increase in the average food prices according to the National Bureau of statistics.\n\nQuoting the NBS reports on selected food prices, FBN Quest capital, an investment firm, noted that all 43 food items surveyed increased by about 28.8% year on year average. On a month on month basis, the average price increase was 2.5%.\n\nThe popular food franchise Chicken Republic recently added a new combo \u201cEgg star\u201d to its menu. This new combo contains rice or spaghetti, with stew and boiled egg and it is priced at N500. This was a surprise to Nigerians as the franchise is known to be a strictly chicken menu.\n\nRead also: Inflation is biggest risk to overall political stability in Nigeria says EIU\n\nIn 2020 their \u201cRefuel spaghetti with a spicy peppered sauce and delicious chicken\u201d was N500, the same price as the \u201cEgg star\u201d menu in 2022. This menu belongs to the franchise\u2019s everyday affordable meal, which consists of other affordable meals but the \u201cEgg star\u201d is their most affordable. This is so everyone can afford a meal and so they can stay in business.\n\n\u201cInflation is at work here. The business owners have to constantly improvise. Either they increase the price of their commodity or they substitute. Imagine the cost of chicken 2 years ago to what is now obtainable,\u201d @owolabibosun tweeted on the issue.\n\nPeople now cope with the rise in food inflation by either foregoing a particular food item for a cheaper one or skipping a meal a day all to meet their budget.\n\nGlory Fadipe, head of research FCMB during a conversation with BusinessDay said, \u201cMany families skip meals or take lesser portions, they get the cheaper stuff irrespective of quality they just have to break even and there\u2019s nothing that can be done about it.\u201d\n\nShe spoke of how some food items are fast becoming meals consumed only once in a while.\n\n\u201cStaples are now becoming once-in-a-blue-moon things. Chicken, fishes like Titus are now expensive,\u201d Fadipe said.\n\n\u201cEven for the common man staples have become expensive. I do not even buy snails again and I earn so much.\u201d\n\nOne of the causes of the increase in food prices as indicated in the report by FBNQuest is the increase in insecurity in northern Nigerian states where many agricultural produce comes from.\n\nThe report revealed that another major factor is the pass-through effect from imported food prices due to the Russian-Ukraine war which is being felt globally by way of increasing fuel and soft commodity prices. This is likely to be felt more in the coming months if the war persists. Imported food inflation increased by about 8bps to 17.56%.",

These reserves are used to back liabilities and influence monetary policy. They include foreign banknotes, deposits, bonds, treasury bills and other foreign government securities.\n\nNigeria is considering a bond sale targeted at its citizens overseas to raise funds to help Africa\u2019s biggest economy narrow its budget deficit, according to a Bloomberg report.\n\nPatience Oniha, director-general of the Debt Management Office, said the Federal Government might sell the debt after it repays $300 million of diaspora bonds maturing in June.\n\n\u201cWe are doing both an analysis of a recent research report on diaspora remittances and reviewing offshore regulations for changes that may be supportive of offering products to retail investors,\u201d Oniha was quoted to have said in a text message on Thursday.\n\nIn March 2022, Nigeria issued $1.25bn Eurobond, which was expected to boost its buffers but the reverse was the case due to low oil production.\n\nNigeria\u2019s gross official reserves declined by $317 million (0.8 percent) month/month to $39.5 billion in March 2022, according to a report by FBNQuest, an investment banking and asset management business of FBN Holdings Plc.\n\nThe drop was the fifth in a row as the reserves have been depleting by roughly $451m on average on a monthly basis since November 2021. The gross reserves are calculated on a 30-day moving average basis.\n\nAt its last meeting in March 2022, the Monetary Policy Committee noted the decrease in the level of gross external reserves to $39.44 billion as of March 17 from $40.21 billion on January 25, indicating a decrease of 1.95 per cent during the review period.\n\n\u201cAlthough an expected boost to the buffer is due from Nigeria\u2019s $1.25 billion Eurobond issue in March 2022, we expect this to be properly reflected in the reserves in coming days,\u201d analysts at FBNQuest had said.\n\nThe external reserves rose to $39.811 billion as of April 21, 2022 from $39.537 billion in April 1, 2022, but declined to $39.64 billion as of April 27, latest data from the CBN showed.\n\nNigeria\u2019s external reserves is estimated to grow to about $40 billion by the end of the year, following the latest Eurobond issuance of $1.25 billion in March 2022, according to a report by the FBNQuest.\n\nNigeria\u2019s need for borrowing has increased following additional spending to help the economy recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. The government expects this year\u2019s deficit will widen by an extra N965 billion ($2.3 billion) to N7.35 trillion naira, amounting to about 4 percent of gross domestic product, according to Bloomberg.",

          "text": "The African Development Bank (AfDB) says that Africa currently faces an infrastructure financing gap of between $68 billion and $108 billion annually.\n\nAccording to the bank, this is in spite of collective efforts to close the margin.\n\nThe bank said this in a statement obtained from its website on Friday. The statement quoted Akinwumi Adesina, president of the AfDB, to have said this when the secretary of the United States Treasury, Janet Yellen hosted G-7 ministers and heads of multilateral development banks.\n\nAdesina said the bank, which was the premier financier of infrastructure in Africa, had committed more than $44 billion to infrastructure across the continent in the last six years.\n\nRead also: Funds, asset managers should invest in digital infrastructure \u2013 Tizeti CEO\n\n\u201cThe $44 billion was channeled toward developing critical areas like transportation, energy, water, and sanitation on the continent.\n\n\u201cI propose eight solutions to bridge Africa\u2019s infrastructure finance gap, which includes project preparation and mobilising institutional investors.\n\n\u201cOther solutions are improving public financing for infrastructure, mobilising financing for green infrastructure, attracting the private sector, and dealing with risks, among others,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe AfDB chief noted that institutional investors including pension funds, Sovereign Wealth Funds, and insurance companies held enough resources to scale up infrastructure financing from billions to trillions of dollars.\n\nAdesina said that collectively, the institutions with commercial banks held 103 trillion dollars of assets under management.\n\n\u201cThis pool of capital is so vast that what is needed is only 0.03 percent or up to 0.04 percent to bridge the infrastructure financing gap for Africa.\n\n\u201cMultilateral development banks should take early-stage investment risks in the project development phase, he said.\n\nHe called on governments to focus more on attracting the private sector to infrastructure financing.\n\nAccording to him, governments must improve the policy, legal, and regulatory environment to support public-private partnership (PPP) investments in infrastructure. He said the bank\u2019s board had also approved a new PPP framework for financing infrastructure.",

          "title": "Payment firms, banks in fierce battle for Nigeria\u2019s retail banking market",
          "text": "\u2026as DMBs consolidate hold on corporate banking\n\nBy AYOOLA OLAOLUWA\n\nAn intense and firce battle is currently going on between Deposits Money Banks (DMBs) and payment firms for the control of the nation\u2019s retail banking market, Business Hallmark findings can reveal.\n\nAccording to Investopedia, the world\u2019s leading source of financial content on the web, retail banking, also known as consumer or personal banking, is banking that provides financial services to individual consumers rather than businesses.\n\nThrough retail banking, individual consumers manage their money, have access to credit, and deposit their money in a secure manner. Services offered by retail banks include checking and savings accounts, mortgages, personal loans, bills payment, credit cards, and certificates of deposit, among many others.\n\nAnd for over 100 years, DMBs had dominated the nation\u2019s retail banking space until the incursions of payment firms starting from the early 20s.\n\nWith advancement in digital technologies, many fintech companies started providing all the services as retail banks through internet platforms and smartphone apps.\n\nIn just over ten years, the fintech/payments firms, BH findings revealed, have largely displaced traditional banks as the major players in the retail banking sector. While traditional banks still hold tightly to corporate banking services provided only to small or large companies and corporate bodies.\n\n\u201cThey (payments firms) are not contended with stealing a chunk of the retail market from commercials banks, but are daily displacing the banks and installing themselves as the new retail kings\u201d, lamented an investment banker in one of the nation\u2019s first generation banks.\n\nSome of the payments firms giving traditiomal banks a run for their money include Flutterwave, Opay, Remitta, Kuda, Konga, Paga, Carbon, Paystack, Interswitch, MoMo, Unified Payment and many others.\n\nAccording to available information, the likes of Opay, Flutterwave, Paga, MoMo and others had accounted for over 60 per cent of the nation\u2019s retail transactions in the last two years.\n\nFor instance, in the first quarter of 2020, payments firms accounted for 60% (N102.4 billion) of the total value of mobile transactions of N172.1 billion, with traditional banks accounting for the remaining 40%.\n\nIn contrast, the most successful traditional bank in mobile banking, GTBank, was only able to rake in N5.6 billion in revenue for by the first half of 2020.\n\nThe uncrowned but undisputed leader, Opay, BH findings revealed, currently processes about 80 percent of bank transfers among mobile money operators in Nigeria and 20 percent of non-merchant point of sales transactions.\n\nAnother payments firm, Paga, has been able to corner a major share of the mobile payment business through the deployment of multiple kiosks accross the country, particularly in neighbourhoods where banks or Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) are not available.\n\nWhile a sizeable number of Paga customers who are computer literate use the firm\u2019s mobile app to transact business, thousands of others who are uneducated visit its kiosks to pay bills (including energy and Cable TV) and transfer money by handing over cash to agents. The firm currently has over 15 million users on its platform.\n\nPaga has managed a near-nationwide coverage by partnering with Nigeria\u2019s Postal Service (NIPOST). This partnership affords them an outlet in each of the 774 local government areas in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Paga, another reason for Nigeria\u2019s cash dependency is that banks and telecoms providers don\u2019t want technology start-ups moving in on their turf.\n\n\u201cOperators, particularly mobile operators, were blocking us from having access to their networks because they wanted to be the ones to offer mobile money.\n\n\u201cIn fact, regulations were so tight that you couldn\u2019t transfer amounts over $10 without submitting a paper document.\n\n\u201cThe breakthrough, however, came in 2017 when we finally got access, and I think the story of mobile money has changed and is going to pick up over the next few years,,\u201d noted Tayo Oviosu, Paga\u2019s founder and chief executive officer.\n\nKongapay is another payments platform that has taken the nation by storm. The firm was set up to help merchants and buyers transact more fluidly. The platform had integrations with major Nigerian banks like GTB and Zenith.\n\nWith Konga platform, a buyer could draw money from multiple bank accounts to fund their KongaPay account. Buyers could also pay-out into many bank accounts.\n\nKongaPay has expanded even further by becoming a platform to pay bills. It\u2019s about the earliest second-generation merchant payment-processor after the likes of Interswitch.\n\nApart from taking retail banking like making deposits and withdrawals to the doors of many Nigerians, particularly the unbanked, another factor that is driving the expasion of payment firms into the nation\u2019s retail banking space, is the difficulty experienced by individuals and small businesses in obtaining retail loans from traditional banks, a void the newcomers are filling.\n\nAccording to a report by Proshare, big banks like UBA, Zenith Bank and Union Bank, First Bank, have provided less than 51% of their deposits as loans in the last two years.\n\nWhile it is quite difficult for individuals and small businesses to get loans from traditional banks, fintechs have simplified the lending process, allowing applicants to obtain loans within minutes.\n\nThe battle is expected to intensify with the recent approval granted to three new Payment Service Banks (PSBs) by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nThe three new PSBs given licenses on August 27, 2020. are Hope PSB, a subsidiary of Unified Payments, one of Nigeria\u2019s oldest fintech firms; Moneymaster PSB, a subsidiary of Glo, Nigeria\u2019s second-largest telecom company; and 9PSB, a subsidiary of 9mobile, a telecom company.\n\nNigeria\u2019s largest telco, MTN, currently operates a mobile money service, while waiting for its PSB licence from CBN.\n\nWith the requirement that the licensees must have at least 25% physical access points in rural areas where they must maintain ATMs and point of sale devices, traditional banks are expected to lose more ground.\n\nPayment firms are also riding on the upsurge in e-commerce adoption by Nigerians who make payment through digital platforms. For instance, some of the 27 percent of payments in online retail in the country in 2021 were by cards, with cash and bank transfers the second most common payment methods.\n\nThe nation\u2019s e-commerce has become a major battlefield for payment companies with the players pushing the adoption of online commerce to the limit.\n\nAccording to Statista, revenue in the e-commerce market which peaked at $6.128 billion in 2021, is expected to show an annual growth rate of 11.8 percent, resulting in a projected market volume of $9.567 billion by 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, traditional banks are not just surrendering to the onslaught but fighting back to regain control of the growing payment market currently in the clutches of fintech firms.\n\nFor instance, some banks, including Access Bank, Sterling and GTBank have developed their own digital lending platforms. The leader, GTBank unveiled QuickCredit, a platform that offers instant loans with an interest rate of 1.75% monthly (21% annually) in 2018, while Sterling Bank had also in February 2018, launched its own digital lending platform called Specta.\n\nGTBank also owns a couple of payment offerings in the likes of QuickCredit like GTPay, a payment gateway, GTCollections, a payment aggregator, and Habari, its e-commerce super-app waiting to be repackaged and unleashed on the market. It is also building its own payment infrastructure.\n\nThe bank has also been dominant in payment channels such as Unstructured Supplementary System Data (USSD). Its *737# code brought the technology into the limelight as a payment channel.\n\nAccording to the bank, its USSD segment reached 356.4 million in volume in the first half of 2020.\n\nHowever, the total revenue from USSD service declined by 32.2 percent following the reduction in transfer fees to N10 for transactions below N5,000, by the CBN. In spite of this, GTBank welcomed 600,000 new USSD customers and has seen 356 million unique USSD transactions carried out by 5.4 million active users as of June 2020.\n\nOn the other hand, Sterling Bank\u2019s Specta, which is very popular among Nigerians, employs it own credit scoring engine to calculate the creditworthiness of borrowers and issues loans and accompanying interests based on that engine.\n\nTailored loans ranging from payday loans to rent, wedding loans are available through Specta. Meanwhile, its loans come with interest of between 22% and 28%.\n\nThe icing on the cake is thst loans on the Specta platform is not restricted to Sterling Bank customers, but available to all banks customers.\n\nChecks revealed that Specta has provided over N40 billion ($100 million) loans to customers across the country since it was launched over four years ago.\n\nAlso, traditional banks have expanded their mobile/digital banking platforms. For instance, FirstMonie owned by First Bank presently has over 40,000 banking agents spread across the country.\n\nSpeaking on the development, the Managing Director of Sterling Bank Plc., Abubakar Suleiman, blamed the inability of banks to compete favourably with payments firms in the retail banking sector on the technological gap between them.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, if you (banks) have not digitized the lending process, it is very expensive to lend manually to individuals because the workforce you need would have to be sizeable.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, with manual, the same workforce could be used to do large corporate lending at a cheaper cost per unit.\n\n\u201cAnother reason is absence of real data. We (banks) just did not have authentic data, we just did not have identity system \u2013 and all of these are critical to lending.\n\n\u201cSo if somebody were to take a loan and not pay, the process of trying to recover the loan is so tedious,\u201d Suleiman noted.\n\nAlso speaking, the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Coronation Merchant Bank, Banjo Adegbohungbe, see payment firms as very fierce competitors and possible threat if banks do not respond appropriately respond to the realities of the times.\n\n\u201cThe business model of banking has evolved very rapidly even before the ascension of the licensed payment firms and that evolution is ongoing.\n\n\u201cThe question is whether the pace at which the banks are transforming is strong enough to address the fierce competition brought on by licensed payment firms.\n\n\u201cThis battle is currently being fought particularly in the retail space. I expect that this competition will extend over time into the corporate space as well.\n\n\u201cThe business model of the future is one that can deliver customer satisfaction at the lowest cost to serve and that is the race that both the banks and the licensed payment firms are striving to win.",

          "title": "Stakeholders threaten shutdown of Nigeria\u2019s book industry over non enactment of national book policy",
          "text": "Relevant stakeholders in the book value chain, including authors, publishers, booksellers, printers, librarians, among others, have made a plea to the Federal Government to urgently come to their aid by enacting the long awaited National Book Policy to save the sector from collapse.\n\nThey listed the nefarious activities of pirates, multiple taxation by the three tiers of government, and exorbitant rates charged by respective ministries of education by state governments across the country as unbearable burden undermining the book industry.\n\nThe stakeholders made the plea on Friday in Lagos while unveiling programmes and activities for this year\u2019s Nigeria International Book Fair 2022 scheduled to hold at Harbour Point Event Centre, Ahmadu Bello Way, Victoria Island, Lagos from Thursday, May 12 through Saturday, May 14, 2022.\n\nThis is the second year running when the book fair would be held at the same venue, the first being last year.\n\nSpeaking at the event, the Chairman of the Nigerian Book Fair Trust (NBFT), Mr. Gbadega Adedapo, who is also the CEO of Ibadan-based Accessible Publishers Ltd, said government\u2019s neglect of the book sector was no longer tolerable.\n\nHe threatened that the players in the book value chain might be compelled to shut down the book sector, as the only way to get government\u2019s attention to do what it needs to do to correct the age-long anomalies in the sector.\n\n\u201cWe are adding value to society, but government is only looking at us,\u201d he declared. \u201cIf we shut down everything pertaining to books, government will be forced to sit down and listen. Government should change its ways that are harming the book trade and do their part, then things will change. Triple taxes are killing us, but pirates don\u2019t pay anything \u2013 both overhead and taxes \u2013 because they don\u2019t even have offices you can trace them to. So they can afford to sell (books) at whatever price.\u201d\n\nAdedapo, however, said sheer passion for the business has been the factor sustaining his members otherwise most of them would have wound down their businesses long ago.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t stop but continue doing what we do,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf not for passion, those of us in the book trade would have given up. We need a National Book Policy to right the many wrongs in the industry. Only government can give us that.\u201d\n\nAdedapo debunked insinuation that the yearly book fair that brings all lovers of books together in one spot for business and exchange of ideas is not inclusive enough, saying that that was not the case.\n\nHe said it was why a committee was set up this year to \u201cmanage this inclusivity\u201d, outlined programmes the book fair would offer that also include Spelling Bee, quiz in mathematics and others for school pupils and students alike.\n\nPresident of Nigerian Booksellers Association and Chairman, Fair Management/Award Committee, Mr. Dare Oluwatuyi, said the book fair is the effort designed by those in the book value chain to \u201cencourage and ensure that reading culture is sustained and made to grow. We want to ensure that reading culture does not die or go down.\u201d\n\nPart of why operators in the book value chain urgently need government\u2019s intervention in the area of National Book Policy, Oluwatuyi submitted, was so each sector player knows where its mandate begins and ends, so there is no infringement in other operators\u2019 areas of operation.\n\nFor instance, he accused publishers of undermining booksellers when they sell books directly to schools instead of using the services of booksellers, as had been the traditional practice. By cutting off this vital link, he said, publishers ran many booksellers out of business. Some of these aggrieved booksellers in turn began to pirate publishers\u2019 books just to get back them, adding that such ugly development does not augur well for players in the book industry. Oluwatuyi sued for a saner book environment where each segment plays its statutory role and does not encroach on each other\u2019s area of operation.\n\nHe, however, said sanity was gradually returning to the book sector since he assumed leadership of booksellers, as he\u2019d begun to speak to his members and publishers alike, so each plays within the ambit of his own specified trade area, so everyone goes home happy. He urged publishers not to sell books directly to schools, but deploy booksellers for that purpose. Oluwatuyi stated that with Mr. Adedapo at the helms of affairs, publishers have begun to play by the rules, and urged further cooperation between publishers and booksellers.\n\nOluwatuyi also charged proprietors of schools to stop running bookshops in their schools unless such outfit is a duly registered bookshop and affiliated to Booksellers Association of Nigeria. He said the activity of these illegal bookshops by school owners is endangering the book trade and encouraging book piracy, adding that a National Book Policy would help address some of these anomalies. He disclosed that soon, Nigeria Copyright Commission (NCC) would begin clamping down on schools operating illegal bookshops, saying it is not the job of schools to sell books but make their pupils and students buy from accredited booksellers.\n\nEqually speaking, a consultant to the book fair and CEO of Knowledge Beyond, Mr. Remi Adesokan, said school children would have a great time at the book fair like last year when contests like Spelling Bee, quiz, and mathematics contests were offered with exciting prizes that were won.\n\nIn his remarks, the President of the Network of Book Clubs and Reading Promoters in Nigeria, Mr Richard Mammah, revealed that the NBRP was presently undertaking a preliminary survey of reading spaces in the country as a first step towards providing a practical way out of the challenge of unavailable, inadequate, ill-equipped and underutilised reading spaces in the country.\n\nA report of progress made in this regard, he promised, would be unveiled at the fair.\n\nAlso at the event was a member of National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools (NAPPS), Mrs. Florence Okorji, who expressed excitement at the inclusivity of the book fair, saying it was not an adult-based book fair only, as wrongly insinuated in some quarters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to note that the book fair has programmes for children to look forward to,\u201d Okorji said. \u201cThe MDGs will avail school owners opportunity to interact with those concerned. I look forward to a rewarding outing, as we join hands to sensitise people to make sure that the book fair message goes wide.\u201d\n\nOthers present were the Executive Secretary of NBFT, Mr. Abiodun Omotubi and Mr. Dapo Fisayo, MD of Consolidated Books Limited.",

When concluded, it will signify the return to Nigeria by Germany of all the 1,130 Benin Bronzes in Germany\u2019s public museums. This will be a monumental achievement.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, on the 7th of this month, the Glasgow City Council agreed to return 17 Benin bronzes to Nigeria. The legal issues are in the process of being sorted out.\n\n\u201cOther success stories include the return by the Netherlands in October 2020 of a 600-year-old Ife Terracotta; the return in April 2021 of a bronze piece from Mexico; as well as the repatriation, in November 2021, of two Benin Bronzes and an Ife Bronze head from the Metropolitan Museum, New York,\u201d the President said.\n\nPresident Buhari announced that because of the determined efforts of this administration, Nigeria is now regarded to be in the forefront globally in the struggle to repatriate illicitly-exported artefacts back to their countries of origin.\n\nThe Oba of Benin informed the President that his Royal Court has concluded plans with the NCMM to establish an ultramodern international standard Benin Royal Museum to house the Benin Bronzes and other artefacts for the purpose of preserving history, tourism and education.\n\n\u201cWe want to reassure Mr President that the Royal Court of Benin and NCMM are working closely to ensure safe custody, preservation and enhancement of these Benin bronzes and artefacts not only for their cultural and economic benefits, but more importantly towards the promotion of the tourism industry in Nigeria,\u201d he said",
          "summary": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday gave the assurance that the Federal Government would continue to vigorously pursue the repatriation of looted Nigeria\u2019s artefacts from abroad, including 1,130 Benin Bronzes in Germany\u2019s public museums.\nThe President gave the assurance while receiving the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, accompanied by members of the Royal Court of Benin and the Board of Trustees of the Benin Royal Museum at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\nSpeaking on the return of the artefacts, President Buhari expressed delight that it has brought immense goodwill to Nigeria, the ancient Benin Kingdom as well as happiness to the Oba of Benin.\nWhen concluded, it will signify the return to Nigeria by Germany of all the 1,130 Benin Bronzes in Germany\u2019s public museums.\n\u201cFurthermore, on the 7th of this month, the Glasgow City Council agreed to return 17 Benin bronzes to Nigeria.",

He tendered his withdrawal letter to the APC ward chairman in Langtang South Local Government Area of Plateau State.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Saturday PUNCH in Jos on Wednesday, Dalung who condemned the APC for \u201cundemocratic practices\u201d said he had joined the Social Democratic Party for good.\n\nDalung said \u201cWhen I resigned from the APC and even before my resignation, I had taken a political party, the Social Democratic Party. One of the oldest parties in Nigeria that has contested elections and won majority of them, SDP is a victim of political impunity which has become synonymous with the APC.\n\n\u201cWe can wake up one day in this country and the APC will annul an election, because the way the party is going, it has eliminated anything democracy to gain the ambience of its values. So, I have joined SDP. They have won elections popularly and one of the fairest elections that was annulled by the military.\u201d\n\nOn whether he would contest any political office on the platform of his new party in the 2023 general elections, the former minister said, \u201cNaturally, I don\u2019t plan to run for any elective position. I only respond to calls to run for such elective position because I don\u2019t see a political office as anything of personal benefit. My concept of holding political position is selfless service.\n\nSo, it does not interest me as such to vie for elective office. But even before I resigned from the APC, I was already consulting, based on expectations, for the House of Representatives. The consultation continues in the SDP, the platform on which I will ultimately contest if given the mandate by the party members.",

          "text": "\u2026Gross profit hits N48.8bn, rising by 122.3%\n\nBy Onu Okorie\n\nSeplat Energy Plc, a leading Nigerian independent energy company listed on both the Nigerian Exchange Limited and the London Stock Exchange, announces its unaudited results for the three months ended 31 March 2022, recording a rise in profit before tax by 197.8 per cent to N34.7bn from N10.6bn year-on-year. The company also generated cash from its operations to the tune of N74.4bn from N1.7bn year-on-year, rising by 197.8 per cent.\n\nThe energy Company\u2019s also grew its revenue by 58.6 per cent to N100.6bn from N57.9bn year-on-year; as its gross profit soars to N48.8bn from N20.1bn year-on-year, rising by 122.3 per cent.\n\nIn its operations, Seplat Energy demonstrated a strong safety record, which extended to 26.1 million hours without LTI from operated assets (2.0 million hours in Q1 2022).\n\nCommenting on the results, Mr. Roger Brown, Chief Executive Officer, Seplat Energy Plc, said:\n\n\u201cSeplat Energy delivered a good quarter that benefited from higher oil pricing, which offset lower production owing to continuing problems with the Trans Forcados Pipeline. However, the alternative Amukpe-Escravos Pipeline is mechanically complete and once we have signed the commercial agreements, we expect Chevron to be lifting our oil through the Escravos Terminal in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cOur proposed acquisition of MPNU remains on course. We are awaiting the necessary approvals from government and regulators and expect the transaction to complete in the second half of this year. The effective date of 1 January 2021 means we will benefit from higher recent oil prices and as we have previously reported, the addition of MPNU will nearly treble our production and double our reserves on a pro forma 2020 basis. The acquisition will reinforce our leadership of Nigeria\u2019s indigenous energy sector and enabling us to generate strong future cash flows that will underpin our investment in Nigeria\u2019s energy transition and improve our overall stakeholder returns. It will also bring a significant undeveloped gas resource base which, alongside our ANOH gas project development, will underpin Nigeria\u2019s energy transition and drive domestic and export revenues when developed.\n\n\u201cWe announce the decision to divest the Group\u2019s interest in the Ubima marginal field for a consideration of $55million, which marginally reduces the company\u2019s 2P reserves by 2 MMboe to 455 MMboe.\n\n\u201cWe have proven we have the financial strength and credibility to attract international finance into Nigeria\u2019s energy sector and this will help us in our aim to deliver energy transition and provide cleaner, more reliable and more affordable energy for Nigeria\u2019s young and growing population.\u201d",

          "text": "By Kehinde Ibrahim, Lagos\n\nTHE Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja in Appeal No. CA/ABJ/CV/269/2022 in the case between the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) vs Barrister Jimoh Ibrahim has ruled that all proceedings including the contempt proceedings initiated by Barrister Jimoh Ibrahim and co at the trial court should be stayed pending the hearing, and determination of the substantive appeal.\n\nThe application for stay was argued on behalf of AMCON by their defence counsel A.U. Mustapha SAN & Co on March 30, 2022, and after listening to the arguments, the Court of Appeal delivered its ruling on Friday April 22, 2022. With that ruling, Barrister Jimoh Ibrahim and Co have been again neutralized from executing the said contempt proceedings order, which he obtained under questionable circumstances.\n\nRecall that Jimoh Ibrahim, NICON Investment Limited, NICON Insurance Limited, Nigerian Reinsurance Corporation owe the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) a whopping N69.4billion with no intention whatsoever to pay. AMCON over the years had tried all reasonable and peaceful resolution strategies to recover the debt from Jimoh Ibrahim to no avail.\n\nAs a responsible debt recovery agency of the Federal Government of Nigeria, AMCON approached the Federal High Court (FHC) in Suit No. FHC/ABJ/CS/760/2021 to seek justice, and accordingly received an order of the trial court to take over the businesses of Jimoh Ibrahim. AMCON further received the backing of the trial court to appoint a Receiver/Manager to oversee the businesses on behalf of AMCON.\n\nFollowing the trial court\u2019s ruling, Jimoh Ibrahim, claimed that he was directed by the court on March 9, 2022, to commence contempt proceedings against the Executive Management of AMCON, which led AMCON to challenge the said ruling by filling Notice of Appeal before the Court of Appeal on March 14, 2022.\n\nThe matter between Barrister Jimoh Ibrahim and AMCON has been interminable since the loan was purchased by the government debt recovery agency during the first phase of Eligible Bank Assets (EBA) purchases from Union Bank in the early days of AMCON. AMCON is however not deterred to recover the outstanding N69.4billion debt owed it by Barrister Ibrahim and his companies in the interest of the Nigerian economy and the public in general.",

          "text": "By Asuelimen Osasuyi\n\nNigerian Communications Commission, NCC, has commenced the process of conducting a study to assess the current level of competition in the colocation and infrastructure sharing, CIS, segment of the Nigerian telecommunications sector.\n\nAccording to NCC, seventy-eight licensees are currently operating in that market segment.\n\nThe study is to enable the Commission to have insightful and evidenced-based facts to glean the dynamics at play and ensure the continuous growth of the CIS segment of the telecom market.\n\nThe NCC takes this issue as priority in view of the critical role played by the colocation and infrastructure sharing segment of the telecom ecosystem in ensuring robust services.\n\nAlready, the Commission has engaged the services of Messrs. Price Waterhouse Cooper, PwC, one of the world\u2019s reputable consulting firms, to conduct the study on its behalf, in exercise of NCC\u2019s regulatory functions as provided in the Nigerian Communications Act, NCA, 2003. The study is expected to be concluded between April and July, 2022.\n\nSpeaking at the NCC\u2019s stakeholders\u2019 forum recently organised in Lagos on the commencement of the study, the Director, Policy, Competition and Economy Analysis, PCEA, at NCC, Yetunde Akinloye, who represented the Executive Vice Chairman of the Commission, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, said the forum was hosted to intimate operators in the CIS segment of the telecom market on the study and to secure their buy-in and cooperation with the consultants undertaking the study.\n\nAkinloye reasoned that, in line with its mandate of creating an enabling environment for competition among operators in the industry as well as ensuring the provision of qualitative and efficient telecommunications services, the NCC periodically conducts studies to assess the level of competition in the industry.\n\n\u201cHaving successfully conducted competition assessment studies in 2005, 2010 and 2013, the Commission had issued determinations based on the findings of the studies while outcome of such studies has also enabled the Commission to come up with various regulatory interventions and initiatives to continuously provide a level-playing field for the interplay of market forces. These procedures are emplaced by the Commission to ensure fair, efficient and sustainable competition in the Nigerian telecom industry.\u201d\n\nDespite the measurable progress made by the Commission, Akinloye stated that, since the successful completion of the 2013 study, there had been significant development and activities in some market segments of the industry that had necessitated the conduct of another competition study.\n\nFor instance, at the time the 2013 study was conducted, the CIS market segment was still at embryonic stage and as such, much emphasis was not placed on it. However, \u201cThe CIS segment has recorded significant growth and transformation over the years having about 80 licensees, operating in the segment while its performance and activities continue to impact significantly on other segments of the Nigerian industry. The Director PCEA also informed that activities in the CIS market have also attained the targets set out in the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (2020-2025)\u201d.\n\nAkinloye further declared that the overarching objective of the study is to provide current insights into the level of competition in the CIS market segment and articulate strategies to enhance opportunities in the market, as well as ensure the deepening of competition which will ultimately support the provision of innovative services for the benefits of both market players and the consumers at large.\n\n\u201cTherefore, in line with NCC\u2019s participatory approach to regulation, this initial stakeholders forum has been convened to formally introduce the project and the appointed consultants to the industry\u201d. Akinloye informed participants and asserted that the forum provides opportunities for stakeholders to gain an understanding into the objective, scope and methodology of the study, as well as to ensure that questionnaire or Request for Information (RFI) developed by the consultants to access the level of competition in the market are well understood.\n\nThus, Akinloye rallied the stakeholders to see the forum as an opportunity \u201cto seek and receive clarification based on presentation delivered by the consultant and to make comments on issues relating to the study. She urged all participants to \u201ccommit to the objectives of the study, by providing complete, timely feedback to questionnaires.\u201d\n\nDirector, Technical Standards and Network Integrity at NCC, Bako Wakil, also joined Akinloye in seeking the full cooperation of licensees in the CIS segment of the telecom market whenever they are approached by the consultants for relevant information either through the instrumentality of the RFI or through one-on-one sessions with consultants in the course of the implementation of the study.\n\nAccording to Wakil, the study is in the interest of the CIS licensees, other players and the consumers. It will also provide the Commission with useful and evidenced-based insights necessary to ensure healthy competition and a level-playing ground in the CIS segment and ensure sustainability in the growth of the telecommunication industry.\n\n\u201cAlso, rest assured of the confidentiality of any information provided to the Commission in the course of this study, no matter how sensitive,\u201d Bako said to the enthusiastic audience.\n\nEarlier in her presentation to telecom stakeholders at the event, Partner at PwC, Mary Iwelumo, amplified the voice of the Commission on the objectives of the study and urged them to cooperate with the firm in providing accurate, timely and adequate responses to the RFI or the questionnaire that would be administered. This will ensure that appropriate information are to obtained to address the challenges in the sector.",

Today, April 30, 2022 is all about Nigerian youths. We are supporting Yahaya Bello for this and no one else. That he has the capacity to solve the problem of insecurity and a host of others facing the nation is not in doubt.\n\n\u201cThis is a crucial time in the history of the country. We must give youths a chance, especially one that has demonstrated uncommon capacity, in the person of Yahaya Bello,\u201d he said.\n\nUwazuruike, who is also the Founder of Biafran Independent Movement, said that he does not believe in a president of Igbo extraction, insisting that the contest should be thrown open.\n\nAddressing the mammoth crowd that had come to welcome him at the APC Secretariat last Wednesday, Bello had said, \u201cRight now, what we have ahead of us is a task of canvassing and consulting all party faithfuls, leaders, delegates and stalwarts, members and all Nigerians, at home and even in the diaspora to support us so that we become the flagbearer of this great party come 30 and 31 of May 2022. And by the special grace of God, I am confident I shall become victorious and the party shall become victorious.\n\n\u201cYahaya Bello is coming on the table to restore hope for Nigerians, for the entire black Africans and for the entire black nation across the world. That is the hope that we are coming on board with. To Unite, to secure, and to put the country and our people on the path of prosperity.\u201d",

Doctor Farah Dagogo, from detention.Peterside, who said Hon. Dagogo\u2019s arrest has no locus standi in any known Nigerian Law or Statue, including the Miscellaneous Offences Act, described Wike as a neo-fascist and dictator desperate to gag free speech and democratic rights of Rivers citizens.\n\nHe challenged the governor to justify his reasons for the arrest of the lawmaker other than his quest to remain a political alpha and omega who would not brood any fair contest. While insisting that the police also erred in executing the arrest without a known court warrant of arrest, Peterside vowed that Rivers State would not allow Wike to prosper in his quest to turn the state into an Italy of Benito Mussolini or Adolf Hitler\u2019s Germany where fascism held sway until the world rallied democracy against them. \u201cRivers State cannot become an Italy of Benito Mussolini, or Adolf Hitler\u2019s Germany where fascism and dictatorship contracted an evil marriage of convenience that bestrode and muzzled free speech and fundamental rights of citizens. What Wike is working at is to annex every independent mind and cow every Rivers citizen into sheepish acquiescence. But what he plays ignorant of is that from the times of Dappa Biriye, Melford Okilo, Obi Wali, TImothy Birabi, all nationalists and Democrats, Rivers had never suffered fools to muzzle them. So, we shall keep to that historic attitude and would never surrender to Wike and his goons.\u201d\n\nPeterside, who is the immediate past Director General, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, NIMASA, queried Gov. Wike on how he obtained evidence linking the lawmaker to an alleged disruption of proceedings at the Rivers State Secretariat of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. \u201cWike had lied at several times such that these days his claims must be subjected to forensic investigation before believed. So, Rivers people need know how he proved Dagogo\u2019s link to whatever happened at their party Secretariat\u201d, he added.\n\nWhile calling on lovers of democracy and free speech to condemn Wike and his fascist style of governance, Peterside reiterated his 48-hour ultimatum to Gov. Wike to order the release of the detailed lawmaker. \u201cWike has 48 hours to ensure that Honourable Farah is set free and allowed to continue to pursue his political aspiration. Nothing short of that shall avail. Wike cannot be junketing in pursuit of his presidential ambition using Rivers State resources while wickedly gagging another\u2019s on the altar of ego. He must let Dagogo go\u201d, , Peterside averted.",

          "text": "Russian forces pounded Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donbas region on Saturday but failed to capture three target areas, Ukraine\u2019s military said, while Moscow said Western sanctions on Russia and arms shipments to Ukraine were impeding peace negotiations.\n\nThe Russians were trying to capture the areas of Lyman in Donetsk and Sievierodonetsk and Popasna in Luhansk, the General Staff of Ukraine\u2019s Armed Forces said in a daily update. \u201cNot succeeding \u2013 the fighting continues,\u201d it said.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in remarks published early on Saturday, said lifting Western sanctions on Russia was part of the peace talks, which he said were difficult but continued daily by video link.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has insisted since the Russian invasion began on Feb. 24 that sanctions needed to be strengthened and could not be part of negotiations. He said on Friday there was a high risk the talks would end because of what he called Russia\u2019s \u201cplaybook on murdering people\u201d.\n\nUkraine accuses Russian troops of atrocities in areas near the capital, Kyiv, that they previously occupied. Moscow denies the claims.\n\nLavrov said that if the United States and other NATO countries were truly interested in resolving the Ukrainian crisis, they should stop sending weapons to Kyiv.\n\nIn Washington, U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s proposed $33 billion aid package for Ukraine, including $20 billion for weapons, has received bipartisan support. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Friday she hoped Congress would pass the package as soon as possible.\n\n\u2018CANNOT GET THROUGH\u2019\n\nAfter failing to capture Kyiv in a nine-week assault that has turned cities to rubble, killed thousands and forced 5 million Ukrainians to flee abroad, Russia is now focusing on the east and south of Ukraine.\n\nMoscow hopes to take full control of the eastern Donbas region made up of Luhansk and Donetsk, parts of which were already controlled by Russian-backed separatists before the invasion.\n\nMoscow said on Saturday its artillery units had struck 389 Ukrainian targets overnight.\n\nSerhiy Gaidai, governor of Luhansk, told Ukrainian public television that the Russians were shelling all over the region \u201cbut they cannot get through our defence\u201d. He said civilians would continue to be evacuated despite the difficult situation.\n\nGaidai said two schools and 20 houses were destroyed by Russian attacks on Friday in Rubizhne and Popasna, both in Luhansk.\n\nMykola Khanatov, head of military administration in Popasna, said two buses sent to evacuate civilians from the town were fired on by Russian troops on Friday and there was no word from the drivers. He did not say how many people were on the buses.\n\nThere were also reports of attacks on places outside the Donbas.\n\nMykola Lukashuk, head of the Dnipro regional council, said Russian forces had shelled the outskirts of Velyka Kostromka in the Kryvyi Rih area. A village bordering the Zaporizhzhia region was also shelled. Unverified social media posts reported shelling in the northeastern city of Kharkiv.\n\nReuters could not independently verify the reports from either side on what was happening on the ground.\n\nMARIUPOL RESISTANCE\n\nUkraine\u2019s border guard service posted a video on its Facebook page showing about 16 weary-looking soldiers in battle fatigues, most of them helmeted and holding rifles, singing the national anthem in a small basement room. One was a woman, holding a dog.\n\nThe service said the fighters were border guards helping to defend the Azovstal steel works, the last bastion of Ukrainian forces holding out against Russian invaders in the strategic port city of Mariupol, on the Azov Sea.\n\nReuters could not verify the video.\n\nMoscow calls the war a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to disarm and \u201cdenazify\u201d Ukraine, defend Russian-speaking people from persecution and prevent the United States from using the country to threaten Russia.\n\nUkraine dismisses Putin\u2019s claims of persecution and says it is fighting an unprovoked land grab to fully capture Donetsk and Luhansk, which form the Donbas region.\n\nWestern officials said Russia had suffered fewer casualties after narrowing the scale of its invasion but that numbers were still \u201cquite high\u201d.\n\nBritain\u2019s defence ministry said on Saturday: \u201cShortcomings in Russian tactical coordination remain.\u201d Russia had been forced to merge and redeploy depleted and disparate units from failed advances in northeastern Ukraine, it said in a daily bulletin.\n\nReuters",

Behind them was a group of gunmen standing in a line.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThe abductees are evidently in anguish with some believed to be carrying bullet wounds.\n\nFamilies and relatives are worried that they are being traumatised in the forest, amid mosquitoes, harsh conditions and many other dangers.\n\nSome of the elderly among the abducted passengers are clearly experiencing deteriorating health conditions.\n\nA disturbed relative told THISDAY last Thursday that his uncle was among the abducted passengers and that his health was worsening.\n\n\u201cHe spoke when the second video was released on the need to hasten their release in view of the fact that his health is deteriorating. He was among the elders in one of the pictures,\u201d he said.\n\nThe released Managing Director of the Bank of Agriculture, BOA, Alwan Hassan, while recounting his ordeal, said 41 women, 22 men, 5 kids were with the terrorists.\n\nThe federal government had assured that it would do everything necessary to ensure the release of those still being held hostage but families and friends of the victims said they had not seen anything concrete being done in this direction.\n\nThe spokesman of the affected families based in Kaduna, Dr. Jimoh, during his interview with THISDAY on Friday reiterated their demand that government must go into negotiation with the terrorists to secure the release of their loved ones alive.\n\nJimoh, lamented that they were yet to establish contact with their loved ones or even the hoodlums since the incident.\n\nHe urged the federal government to open a channel of communication with the terrorists.\n\nJimoh restated that affected families remain in serious anguish in the past 34 days and living like corpses.\n\nThe terrorists insist that they are not after a ransom, but an exchange of the abducted passengers with their commanders, who were in government custody.\n\nThe former military governor of Kaduna State, retired Col. Abubakar Umar has also reiterated his call on the international community to intervene and help free the abductees.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe world must know what is happening. This government is trying to cover up this and we all must keep talking about this. Before you know it, these people would spend 10 years, like the Chibok girls. There are thousands of kidnapped victims in northern Nigeria, but the governments don\u2019t want people to talk about it.\u201d\n\nNo fewer than 362 passengers were onboard the train at the time the terrorists struck on March 28.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday backed the planned ultramodern international standard Benin Royal Museum that would house the Benin Bronzes and other artefacts being returned to Nigeria, for the purpose of preserving history, tourism and education.\n\nThe President announced his support while receiving in audience at the State House, Abuja, the Oba of Benin, H.R.M. Omo N\u2019Oba Uku Akpolokpolo Ewuare II, accompanied by members of the Royal Court of Benin and the Board of Trustees of the Benin Royal Museum.\n\nThe Royal Majesty was at the State House to thank the President on the recent return of two important Benin Bronzes to its original place of abode by the University of Cambridge and the University of Aberdeen, both in the United Kingdom, after 125 years.\n\nThe Royal Museum, to be housed in the palace of the Oba of Benin, is in conjunction with the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM).\n\nThe Oba of Benin told the President: \u201cWe want to reassure Mr. President that the Royal Court of Benin and NCMM are working closely to ensure safe custody, preservation and enhancement of these Benin Bronzes and artefacts, not only for their cultural and economic benefits, but more importantly towards the promotion of the tourism industry in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Royal Majesty reassured Nigerians that the Benin Bronzes and artefacts represent the country\u2019s cultural heritage in particular and Africa in general, saying \u201cwe hold these objects in trust as the original owners in conjunction with NCMM for the benefit of all.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the President declared that the federal government would continue to vigorously pursue the repatriation of Nigeria\u2019s looted artefacts from abroad, including 1,130 Benin Bronzes in Germany\u2019s public museums and Ife terracotta/bronze heads in Netherlands and United States museums.\n\nSpeaking on the returned artefacts, Buhari expressed delight that it had brought immense goodwill and acclaim to Nigeria, the ancient Benin Kingdom, as well as happiness to the Oba of Benin.\n\nHe noted that while it was widely acknowledged around the world that some of the best ancient arts belong to Nigeria, including those from Benin, Ife, Nok and Igbo-Ukwu, many of these beautiful works were illicitly taken away, particularly during the colonial period.\n\nAffirming that these great cultural and artistic works were records of history, the President vowed that Nigeria would not permit these great works to become properties of others, adding that this administration had made it an important task to ensure the return of the artefacts.\n\nThe President, therefore, assured the first-class traditional ruler that the federal Government would continue in this great cause with his support and that of other traditional rulers.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn furtherance to these efforts, an agreement between Nigeria and Germany is currently being prepared. When concluded, it will signify the return to Nigeria by Germany of all the 1,130 Benin Bronzes in Germany\u2019s public museums. This will be a monumental achievement.\n\n\u2018\u2018Furthermore, on the 7th of this month, the Glasgow City Council agreed to return 17 Benin Bronzes to Nigeria. The legal issues are in the process of being sorted out.\n\n\u2018\u2018Other success stories include the return by the Netherlands in October 2020 of a 600-year-old Ife Terracotta; the return in April 2021 of a bronze piece from Mexico; as well as the repatriation, in November 2021, of two Benin Bronzes and an Ife Bronze head from the Metropolitan Museum, New York.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari announced that because of the determined efforts of this administration, \u201cNigeria is now regarded to be in the forefront globally in the struggle to repatriate illicitly-exported artefacts to their countries of origin.\u201d\n\nThe President acknowledged the efforts of officials of the NCMM currently working with the Oxford University, the Great North Museum of Newcastle University, Rhode Island School and numerous other places on the modalities for the return of Nigerian antiquities, particularly the Benin Bronzes.\n\nHe expressed optimism that with careful planning and management, Nigeria could generate revenue from the repatriated antiquities.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cWe look forward to a future when these returned antiquities and our arts and culture shall be deployed in generating revenue for the nation.\n\n\u201cI am glad to hear that the Ministry of Information and Culture and the NCMM are already working towards this by reaching out to other nations and cultural institutions on travelling exhibitions to showcase the rich culture of Nigeria through these antiquities.\n\n\u201cThis can happen if officials in charge of these priceless artefacts take due care to maintain and preserve these treasures in good condition at all times.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, affirmed that Nigeria would continue to assert its rights over all its antiquities around the world.\n\nHe added that the country would not hesitate to implore nations, institutions, men and women of goodwill to see the unfairness in the affairs of one body holding on to the cultural property fashioned by the genius of another.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",
