          "text": "\u2026Urges private sector to join advocacy for just global energy transition\n\n\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nVICE President Yemi Osinbajo yesterday said that the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB, as well as Nigeria\u2019s gas initiatives, will help transform Nigeria into a gas-based industrialized nation.\n\nProfessor Osinbajo also said that it would help to create a better-managed petroleum industry with more value addition for both investors and Nigerians alike.\n\nThe Vice president stated this in his remarks at a virtual event to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Sahara (Energy) Group.\n\nRecall that President Muhammadu Buhari signed the Petroleum Industry Bill 2021 into law last week, and has also approved a steering committee to oversee the process of implementation of the newly signed Petroleum Industry Act (PIA).\n\nAlso, the gas initiatives of the Federal Government include the drive to encourage investments in gas production and optimize the nation\u2019s enormous gas potential.\n\nIn addition, Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is being developed into an alternative automobile fuel as a means of affording Nigerians cheaper, cleaner and additional fuel. This way, there will be a reduction in the ecological and economic costs of energy.\n\nThere is also the Gas Masterplan which provides for investment in the necessary infrastructure for gas transportation across the nation. All of these will reduce local crude oil dependency, whilst strengthening the drive for cleaner sources of energy as a nation.\n\nSpeaking on the gas initiatives being implemented by the Buhari administration, the Vice President said, \u201clocally we launch into the brave new world for the oil and gas industry with the Petroleum Industry Act 2021. And this happily converges with the launch of the Year 2020 to 2030 as the \u2018Decade of Gas Development for Nigeria\u2019. This is a follow-up to the highly successful initiative of the Year 2020 as the Year of Gas.\u201d\n\nLast year November, the National Gas Expansion Programme was launched, which focuses on the distribution of Compressed Natural Gas and Liquefied Petroleum Gas across gas stations operated by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nProf. Osinbajo in a statement by his Spokesman, Laolu Akande added, \u201cthe main goal of the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill and the gas initiatives aforementioned is to transform Nigeria not only into a gas-based industrialized nation through enhanced accelerated gas revolution, but also to help create a better-managed petroleum industry where both the people of Nigeria and investors alike can extract value.\u201d\n\nHe said the next 25 years will be defining for the energy industry.\n\nCommending Sahara Group for being \u201ca great ambassador for the Nigerian entrepreneurial brand,\u201d the Vice President noted that the group has demonstrated \u201cbold, innovative, knowledge-driven business models that are designed to seize opportunities in other countries and have done so with remarkable success in many African countries.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated the need for a just transition to zero-emission, as well as more advocacy to stop the defunding of gas and fossil fuel projects in developing countries\n\nExplaining further, he said, \u201calready the wealthier nations and their institutions have banned all public investments in certain fossil projects, including natural gas. Examples include the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom, Germany and Denmark, as well as specific institutions such as the Swedfund from Sweden, Norway\u2019s Sovereign Wealth Fund, the largest in the world, CDC, the development finance institution from the UK, the European Investment Bank, and the Investment Fund for Developing Countries from Denmark.\n\n\u201cThe World Bank and other multilateral development banks are being urged by their shareholders to do the same. The AfDB is increasingly unable to support large natural gas projects in the face of shareholder pressure from their European members.\n\n\u201cBarely two weeks ago, the UN Secretary-General made a strong call, that \u2018Countries should end all new fossil fuel exploration and production, and shift fossil fuel subsidies into renewable energy.'\u201d\n\nOsinbajo said while the Federal Government was building coalitions with other affected countries to urge a just transition as we advance to zero transmission, \u201cI will urge indigenous energy companies such as yourselves to join in the urgent advocacy that is required to prevent the disaster that would result from defunding oil and gas projects.\u201d\n\nProf. Osinbajo noted that the last two decades have brought significant growth of Nigerian oil companies \u201cfrom the days when Nigerian companies were mainly invested in the downstream sector to a situation now where we have Nigerian companies in the downstream, midstream and the upstream.\n\n\u201cNigerian companies have shown capacity in operations and financing of oil and gas assets. Within this group of patriotic local investors, Sahara has consistently blazed the trail as industry leaders in not just the Petroleum sector, but in the Power sector as well,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile congratulating the Sahara Team for its 25 years of achievements in the energy industry, the VP wished them more remarkable 25 years ahead, even as he urged the group and other indigenous energy companies to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the African Continental Free Trade Agreements.\n\nOther speakers at the event included the President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mr. Felix Tshisekedi and President of the African Development Bank, Dr Akinwumi Adesina; while guests included the Director-General of Bureau of Public Enterprises, Mr Alex Okoh, and other top government officials.",

That is all there is to my race for the governorship. I have a dream bigger than me or any one person, and it is the dream to bring a real and positive transformation to Ndi Anambra.\n\n\u201cI pledge to work with the church on programmes in healthcare and education which benefit all people in the society whether they are Catholics or not. That spirit of inclusiveness will permeate my government if I am elected,\u201d Ozigbo declared.\n\nOther notable politicians who attended the August event were the governor of Ekiti State, Dr Kayode Fayemi; the governor of Enugu State, Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi; the former governor of Anambra State, Mr Peter Obi; a former presidential candidate, Professor Pat Utomi; the president-general of Ohaneze Ndi Igbo, Chief Nnia Nwodo; a former aviation minister, Mrs Fidelia Njenze; the interim president, Old Catholic Seminarians of Nigeria, Ambrose Obiora; and the state chairman of the PDP in Kaduna, Felix Hassan, among others.\n\nThe president of the Bishop Conference, Archbishop Augustine Akubeze of the Catholic Archdiocese of Benin City, called on politicians to remain good ambassadors of the Church by \u201cplaying politics of principle, ideology, and with fear of God\u201d.\n\nMost Rev. Akubeze also referred to the 2019 Catholic manual as a guide for politicians and other professionals. He said that the document was produced to shape the minds of Catholic and other politicians and impact a culture of values in service. He exhorted politicians of all denominations and faith to ensure that the masses feel their impact in politics by following the tenets and teachings in the manual.\n\nBishop Mathew Kukah, the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, also spoke at the event on the topic, \u201cAre we politicians who are Catholics or are we Catholics who are politicians?\u201d As he posed the questions to the audience, Kukah maintained that it was a paradox for a Catholic politician to not be equipped with the values and moral fabric that define Catholicism.\n\nThe Bishops commended former Governor Obi for the bold steps he took in returning mission schools to the church during his tenure as Anambra State Governor. They urged other governors to follow in line with that policy, which positively impacted the quality of public education.\n\nOzigbo, who has served as Chairman of Unusual Praise, Africa\u2019s largest Catholic gospel concert, also joined the Bishops on Sunday, August 22, 2021, when they held a Vespers/Benediction Service as part of the annual Bishop\u2019s Conference.\n\nAt the service, held at the Holy Trinity Catholic Church, Enugu, the Bishops held a prayer session that centred on the advancement of the gospel, progress of the Church, and unity in the country.",

All the support they need is available to them 100 percent.\n\n\u201cSince my first day in office, we have been giving them (security agencies) support. Any support they need in technology to do their work, I have provided 100 per cent so far.\n\n\u201cIt is their work to leverage technology. It is not our duty to say this is what to achieve. What they require, we have provided 100 per cent, not even 99 per cent and we will continue to do that.\u201d\n\nOn the 5G technology deployment, the minister said that the Draft Policy would be presented to the federal Executive Council (FEC), after the working Group set up on the it concludes its assignment.\n\nHe said that the government started the process in 2020 but was confronted with the COVID-19 conspiracy theory.\n\nAccording to him, following the confirmation by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) that the two were not related, the conspiracy theory has been destroyed intellectually and scientifically.\n\n\u201cIn spite of that, we set up a Working group to study the effectiveness. Accordingly, people from technology, health, environment and security. They have been working for over a year on the policy of deployment of 5G in Nigeria, so that we can be on the same page and be sure there is no vacuum that others can exploit to the detriment of the citizens of our country.\n\n\u201cSo we are on the same page and I think the policy will soon be presented before the Federal Executive Council. When it is approved, the National Frequency Management Council will assign Spectrum to NCC and NCC will release it to operators for deployment.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier at the book presentation, Dr. Pantami the publication provided insights into Nigeria\u2019s digital economy and his Ministry\u2019s approach towards developing it.\n\nHe observed that digital innovation has led to a shift from the traditional economy into the digitalized one, and this digital transformation of the economy has led to economic prosperity in Nigeria and around the world.\n\nThe minister urged Nigerians to develop the habit of reading, as according to him, \u201cReaders are leaders\u201d and that all noted world leaders were people who spend quality time reading.\n\nThe Editor-in-Chief of PRNigeria who is also the Book Reviewer, Mall. Yushau Shuaib said the book contained eights Chapters, including, \u201cEnhancing Start-Ups; Strengthening Innovative Solutions; Managing Data for Productivity; Protecting Cybersecurity; Accessing E-Learning; Promoting Digital Inclusion; Transforming the Way of Doing things and; Advancing the Digital Economy.\u201d",

Johnson Thomas Aguiyi-Ironsi.\n\n\u201cThe President affirms that Lady Victoria\u2019s incredible strength and exceptional courage during one of the darkest moments in our nation\u2019s history pedestals her as a mother of the nation, God-fearing and a foremost woman of valour\u2026\u201d\n\nConveying his condolence through a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Onyebuchi Ememanka, Governor Ikpeazu said: \u201cWidowed since December, 1984, Lady Adanma Okpara remained a model of good and excellent womanhood. She was a fountain of knowledge from which most women, especially here in Abia, drank freely.\u201d\n\nIn a statement yesterday by his Chief Press Secretary, Oguwike Nwachuku Uzodimma, Governor Uzodimma described the deaths of both women as big losses to the Igbo and other Nigerians.\n\nIn his condolence message yesterday in Abuja, Kalu described the late Lady Okpara as a woman of virtue.\n\nHe added that she was a pillar of support and source of inspiration for the womenfolk.\n\nIn a statement by his Media Adviser, Uchenna Awom, Senator Abaribe, said: \u201cBoth women leaders lived out their roles as worthy pillars of support to their husbands who played pivotal roles in the shaping of Nigeria at various times when they held sway as Head of State of Nigeria and Premier of Eastern Nigeria.\u201d\n\nObi said both women have etched their names on the pages of history of Igbo land and Nigeria.",

          "text": "All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain and former presidential candidate, Mr. Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, has said that for the country to prosper, the fight against corruption must continue beyond 2023.\n\nThe businessman said a good footstep in winning the battle to reduce corruption, if not kill it totally, is to ensure that corrupt people with unexplainable wealth do not get elected at any level.\n\nHe said those who have an explanation to make to anti-graft agencies and are aspiring for public offices must be put to task about their integrity.\n\nIn a statement, titled: 2023: The Fight Against Corruption Must Not Stop! Olawepo-Hashim recalled that when he was growing up, it was the practice then for women to lay their wares by the roadside and indicated the prices of the articles by the number of stones they kept on the ground.\n\n\u201cNo one took the products without dropping the correct sums of money, and no one who passed by took the money and/or the wares away.\n\n\u201cI so much long for a return to the country of simple and honest people that Nigeria was. That is why it was easy for me to connect with the War Against Indiscipline (WAI) message of General Muhammadu Buhari and Maj.-Gen. Tunde Idiagbon in 1983.\n\n\u201cIn Ilorin, Kwara State, where I schooled, we were the disciples of Idiagbon\u2019s campaign against corruption as President of the Dramatic Society in Cherubim and Seraphim College. I was the lead actor in a drama skit against corruption on the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) Ilorin Youth Scene.\n\n\u201cAlso, I busted a pattern of stealing in the college kiosk, perpetrated by students appointed to supervise the kiosk. That is a story for another day that readers would find in my coming autobiography, titled: Sunrise at Midnight, by the Grace of God. The first volume will be released soon,\u201d he said.\n\nThe APC chieftain said the fight against corruption was a major plank of the current Buhari administration.\n\nHe said corruption is among the reasons Nigeria is backward and the underlying cause of the security problems in the country, such as banditry.\n\n\u201cNigeria loses a lot to corruption. According to PricewaterhouseCooper (PwC), a global consulting outfit, if not arrested by 2030, corruption will be costing Nigeria 37 per cent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP); that is, $200 billion, a whooping N100 trillion (Naira), about 10 times our national budget.\n\n\u201cIt will translate to $1,000 per capital; 500,000 by each Nigerian. The significance of this on our lives, in terms of avoidable death, is staggering.\n\n\u201cCorruption in Nigeria is in various dimensions in high places, caused by undisciplined life styles, weak regulatory regimes and institutions, eroding ethics and values and a triumphant feeling of impunity that believes there will be no consequence for wrongdoings.\n\n\u201cAt the lower levels, corruption is rationalised as a result of poor earnings. \u2018Man go survive\u2019, or as that everybody is doing it, \u2018It is our way\u2019, but it is not our way.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe corruption situation is compounded by an increasingly expanding population of people with ethics and value system that have come to embrace corruption as an acceptable standard and become increasingly audacious that they attack men and women of integrity as \u2018failures\u2019 even though most of the attackers come from the ranks of the poorest. They are choristers of those \u2018nouveau riche\u2019, who have helped themselves from the public purse.\n\n\u201cThey have a sizable presence online, venerating corrupt lifestyle.\n\n\u201cThe fight against corruption is a serious business. Law enforcement will not be enough to win it. Regulatory reforms are important but just as well as ethical reform on a mass scale. The role of technology is also central in this fight as we aim to reduce the scope of human manipulation of the system,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "A United States-based Nigerian, Mr Kenny Awosika, has asked the Federal High Court in Lagos to declare him as a promoter/co-founder of Green Africa Airways Ltd, entitled to 55 per cent of its authorised share capital.\n\nHe also prayed the court to compel the first defendant, Babawande Afolabi, to pay him N625million as damages for breach of an agreement.\n\nThe second to sixth defendants in the suit are Green Africa Airways Ltd, Taiwo Afolabi, Kuramo Africa Opportunity II (Mauritius) LLC, Corporate Affairs Commission and the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority.\n\nIn the alternative, the plaintiff is praying the court to order the defendants to pay him the sum of $30,250,000.00 being the monetary value of 55 per cent of Green Africa Airways as at the last valuation in 2019. He made the claims through his counsel Femi Falana (SAN) and D. A. Awosika (SAN) in a suit numbered FHC/L/CS/949/2021.\n\nAwosika, in his statement of claim, averred that he is co-founder and a Director of Green Africa Airways Ltd (registered in Nigeria in 2015) and equally functions as its Director of Information Technology and Innovation of the second defendant.\n\nHe said he is also the founder and co-owner of Green White Group LLC (GWG Maryland), a limited liability company registered in Germantown, Maryland, United States of America.\n\nRead Also; Court suspends Secondus as PDP National Chairman\n\nThe plaintiff averred that on 26 September 2013, he and Afolabi registered GWG, Maryland, with a 55 \u2013 45 per cent ownership ratio in his favour.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe took on most of the responsibilities of GWG Maryland and provided the financial and technical support for the formation and incorporation of Green Africa Airways.\n\nIt was agreed that he should stay back in the US, where he was earning a salary as a US government contractor so that he could financially support the incorporation of the Nigerian entity, while Afolabi would return to Nigeria to arrange for registering GWG Maryland\u2019s airline business.\n\nAwosika eventually resigned from his job, as part of the agreement between both parties, exited his private businesses in the US, gave up his security clearance with the US government and returned to Nigeria to partake in running the business.\n\nAfolabi had, with Awosika\u2019s financial and technical support, returned to Nigeria years earlier and registered the airline with the CAC with an initial N500million share capital.\n\nThe plaintiff averred that unknown to him, \u201cand contrary to the arrangement between the parties, the first defendant listed himself and his brother Taiwo Afolabi (the 3rd Defendant) as the only subscribers and/or shareholders and directors of the 2nd Defendant at incorporation.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the first and second defendants were however cash-strapped and unable to procure the funds required to obtain an Air Transport Licence (ATL).\n\nSo, he (Awosika) \u201cpainstakingly sold his only rental property to raise funds for the procurement of the ATL.\u201d He also withdrew all the funds he had saved and transferred the total funds from both sources to the 1st Defendant for the successful procurement of the ATL.\n\nHe alleged that Afolabi, in negotiations with an investor Kuramo Africa Opportunity II (Mauritius) LLC, misrepresented himself as the sole founder of the business. When he (Awosika) found out in 2018, he demanded the documentation of his full rights as regards their business relationship. He also made several demands before Afolabi effected a change in the list of directors, adding Awosika as a director.\n\nAfolabi was also alleged to have, without Awosika\u2019s knowledge, incorporated GWG Delaware and also deliberately omitted the Awosika\u2019s name from the incorporation documents of GWG Delaware and appointed himself (Afolabi) and his brother as shareholders and directors in GWG Delaware.\n\nOther reliefs being sought by Awosika include an order removing forthwith the name of the 3rd Defendant as Director and Shareholder from the 2nd Defendant.\n\nThe defendants are yet to file a response and no date has been fixed for hearing of the suit.",

          "text": "From Okey Sampson, Umuahia, Stanley Uzoaru,Owerri, Chijioke Agwu, Abakaliki, Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu, Obinna Odogwu, Awka and Jeff Amechi Agbodo, Onitsha and Paul Osuyi, Asaba\n\nResidents of Abia, Imo, Enugu and Ebonyi states, yesterday, stayed at home for the third consecutive Monday despite the suspension of the weekly sit-at-home order by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nThe order began three weeks ago to pressure the Federal Government to release its leader, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nRegardless of announcements by the leadership of IPOB over the week concerning suspension of the order, residents of the five eastern states have continued to stay at home ostensibly for fear of the unknown.\n\nIn Umuahia, many shops remained closed, as commercial bus and tricycle operators were off the streets. Banks and other corporate offices did not open for business.\n\nGovernment offices were opened in obedience to directive of the state government but few workers were at work as many found it difficult to trek to their offices.\n\nReports from Aba said though there were no cases of molestation by hoodlums, residents stayed at home out of fear. Major markets, banks and other public institutions were shut.\n\nIn Imo, the usual traffic jam and commercial activities in Owerri and other urban centres were absent as banks, business centres,markets, filling stations, schools, health centres, mobile food vendors and the hospitality industries were shutdown.\n\n\u201cOur people will continue to stay at home on Mondays until Nnamdi Kanu is released from detention, that is the only way we can stop the Sit-at-home order,\u201d a resident told Daily Sun in Owerri.\n\nLike Owerri, Abakaliki, capital of Ebonyi State was deserted.Our correspondent who moved round the city observed that filling stations and commercial banks did not open for services.The popular Margret Umahi International Market, the building materials market and spare parts market were also shut.However, government offices at the Ochudo Centenary City Secretariat and Old Government House were opened while security agents patrolled the capital city to ensure people were not harassed by hoodlums.\n\nOn Sunday, Commissioner of Police, Aliyu Garba, had urged residents to go about their normal and legitimate businesses without fear of attacks from any group.\n\nIn Enugu, banks, fuel stations and street shops were locked as people were afraid of attacks.\n\nSome supporters of Kanu and IPOB who spoke to Daily Sun said it would be difficult to end the lockdown every Monday except the order comes directly from the IPOB leader.\n\nIn Awka, Anambra State, while some stayed back out of fear, others willfully continued with it. Some shops opened for business while others did not.Many roads were deserted even as some major markets did not open. At the popular Eke Awka Market, some traders came around but did not open their shops while some displayed their wares. There were also some others who simply stayed back at home.\n\nOur Correspondent who monitored the situation in Onitsha reports that all the major markets including Main Market, banks, parks, some filling stations were shutdown due to fear of unknown. Also major roads leading to Main Market Onitsha such as Old Market, New Market, Venn Roads were deserted as young boys turned the roads to football pitches.\n\nAt Upper Iweka and Bridgehead Onitsha most of motor parks were shut while few vehicles were seen going in or out of Onitsha to Asaba.\n\nA trader, Mr. Uche Nwogah, said the exercise has been hijacked by hoodlums to rob and maim innocent citizens in the name of enforcing the sit-it-home order.\n\n\u2022Go tough on IPOB members \u2013IG\n\nInspector General of Police (IGP), Alkali Baba Usman, has charged officers of the Delta State command to deal decisively with any IPOB member.\n\nHe handed down the charge in Asaba while on a one-day working visit to the command.\n\nReacting to challenges raised by the Commissioner of Police, Ari Muhammed Ali during a welcome address, Usman said the proximity of Asaba to Anambra would make it susceptible to aggressions from the eastern part of the country.\n\n\u201cIt is expected that whatever affect Anambra State may likely affect, especially Asaba. It is just the bridge that is separating the towns.\n\n\u201cThere are always spillover of agitations and demonstrations from Onitsha to Asaba.\n\n\u201cThat is why you need to get prepared to deal with any crime or criminality to ensure that those trouble makers are brought to book.\n\n\u201cYou (officers) need to brace up to the IPOB challenge because it is a proscribed organisation, and treat them as such.\u201d\n\nThe IGP was, however, silent on the challenge of incessant farmers/herders clashes in the state.",

          "title": "PIA, Gas Initiatives Will Transform Energy Sector, Says Osinbajo",
          "text": "Deji Elumoye\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo has expressed optimism that the recent signing of the Petroleum Industry Act, as well as Nigeria\u2019s gas initiatives, will help transform Nigeria into a gas-based industrialized nation.\n\nHe said this will also create a better-managed petroleum industry with more value addition for both investors and Nigerians alike.\n\nOsinbajo made this known Monday in his remarks delivered at a virtual event to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Sahara (Energy) Group.\n\nRecall that the gas initiatives of the Federal Government include the drive to encourage investments in gas production and optimize the nation\u2019s enormous gas potential.\n\nSpeaking on the gas initiatives being implemented by the Buhari administration, the Vice President said, \u201clocally we launch into the brave new world for the oil and gas industry with the Petroleum Industry Act 2021. And this happily converges with the launch of the Year 2020 to 2030 as the \u2018Decade of Gas Development for Nigeria\u2019.\n\nThis is a follow-up to the highly successful initiative of the Year 2020 as the Year of Gas.\u201d\n\nLast November, the National Gas Expansion Programme was launched, which focuses on the distribution of Compressed Natural Gas and Liquefied Petroleum Gas across gas stations operated by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nAccording to Osinbajo, the main goal of the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill and the gas initiatives aforementioned is to transform Nigeria not only into a gas-based industrialized nation through enhanced accelerated gas revolution, but also to help create a better-managed petroleum industry where both the people of Nigeria and investors alike can extract value.\n\nHe added that the next 25 years will be defining for the energy industry.\n\nThe Vice President reiterated the need for a just transition to zero-emission, as well as more advocacy to stop the defunding of gas and fossil fuel projects in developing countries.\n\nHe further said: \u201cAlready the wealthier nations and their institutions have banned all public investments in certain fossil projects, including natural gas. Examples include the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom, Germany and Denmark, as well as specific institutions such as the Swedfund from Sweden, Norway\u2019s Sovereign Wealth Fund, the largest in the world, CDC, the development finance institution from the UK, the European Investment Bank, and the Investment Fund for Developing Countries from Denmark.\n\n\u201cThe World Bank and other multilateral development banks are being urged by their shareholders to do the same. The AfDB is increasingly unable to support large natural gas projects in the face of shareholder pressure from their European members. Barely two weeks ago, the UN Secretary-General made a strong call, that \u2018Countries should end all new fossil fuel exploration and production, and shift fossil fuel subsidies into renewable energy.'\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that while the Federal Government is building coalitions with other affected countries to urge a just transition as we advance to zero transmission, \u201cI will urge indigenous energy companies such as yourselves to join in the urgent advocacy that is required to prevent the disaster that would result from defunding oil and gas projects.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo noted that the last two decades have brought significant growth of Nigerian oil companies \u201cfrom the days when Nigerian companies were mainly invested in the downstream sector to a situation now where we have Nigerian companies in the downstream, midstream and the upstream.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigerian companies have shown capacity in operations and financing of oil and gas assets. Within this group of patriotic local investors, Sahara has consistently blazed the trail as industry leaders in not just the Petroleum sector, but in the Power sector as well,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "UN Report Exposes Secret Programme for Repentant Terrorists\n\n\u2022Intelligence agencies probe authenticity of recent surrender of 1, 200 insurgents\n\n\u2022How they\u2019re given houses, paid monthly stipends\n\nKingsley Nwezeh\n\nin Abuja with agency reports\n\nA United Nations (UN) publication has detailed a secret government programme tagged, Suhlu, designed to pull commanders of terrorists groups, including Boko Haram and the Islamic State for West African Province (ISWAP) out of the forests, rehabilitate them and provide them a means of livelihood.\n\nThe development is coming as intelligence agencies have begun investigation into the recent surrender of over 1,200 terrorists and their families in the last three weeks.\n\nThe investigation, THISDAY learnt, seeks to ascertain whether the surrender was genuine or a ploy to activate and coordinate terror sleeper cells across the country.\n\nNorth-east communities and traditional institutions have protested the potential reintegration of the insurgents into their communities.\n\nGovernor Babagana Zulum of Borno State and Shehu of Borno, Alhaji Abubakar Umar Garbai El-Kanem, had also raised concerns that the communities where thousands of people were killed by the terrorists and houses destroyed might not be in the right frame of mind to accept the surrendered insurgents, who recently sought the forgiveness of Nigerians.\n\nHowever, the report by a United Nations\u2019 publication, The New Humanitarian, said a clandestine Nigerian government programme was reaching out to senior jihadist fighters in the bush to encourage them to abandon their goal of building a caliphate by force of arms, and to defect.\n\nIt said the report was based on six months of reporting and research.\n\nGovernment officials, former jihadists, analysts, journalists, displaced people, and civil society workers were interviewed, but nearly all asked to have their names withheld or altered due to security concerns.\n\nSome have almost certainly committed atrocities but are unlikely to be prosecuted.\n\nThe Bama massacre in 2014 killed hundreds of civilians, but one of the commanders involved is now living free on the government\u2019s payroll.\n\nSecurity officials believe sulhu could open the door to a peace deal, ending a stalemated conflict that is now in its twelfth year. But critics argue such a deal would reward mass killers.\n\nOne of the former commanders and beneficiary of the programme, Aliyu, has a new life now. The old was the decade he spent fighting with Boko Haram and then with the breakaway Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) in the scrubland of the North-east.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the two wives and four children he left behind when he defected, and the power he once wielded as a jihadist rijal-literally a \u2018man\u2019 \u2013 in zones under the insurgents\u2019 control.\n\n\u201cIn his early thirties, with a wispy goatee, Aliyu has remarried to a forthright woman from the northeastern city of Maiduguri. She is also former Boko Haram, and they have been set up with the rent-free house in Kaduna, a business license, and a small monthly stipend provided by Nigeria\u2019s domestic spy service, better known as DSS\u201d.\n\nThe price of this largesse: to work for DSS to turn other jihadists under a clandestine project known as sulhu \u2013 Arabic for peacemaking. It\u2019s so controversial that no government representative would go on record to discuss it, and given Abuja\u2019s increasing hostility to independent reporting on security matters, few Nigeria-based civil society figures wanted to be named either.\n\nSulhu is applauded by its supporters as smart warfare \u2013 a means to remove senior jihadists from the battlefield more effectively than the stuttering orthodox military campaign.\n\n\u201cWe have a proof of concept; it\u2019s working,\u201d said an Abuja-based analyst, who wouldn\u2019t agree to be identified beyond that description. \u201cIt\u2019s depleting the enemy\u2019s fighting force.\u201d\n\nBut the men on the Sulhu programme are almost certain to have been involved in atrocities. They have not been granted a formal amnesty, but neither have they been held to account for any crimes committed in a brutal conflict that is now in its twelfth year.\n\nIt\u2019s a war that has killed 35,000 people \u2013 350,000 if you include the victims of the accelerating humanitarian crisis \u2013 and upended the lives of millions more, according to the UN.\n\n\u201cThese are mass killers, yet on a programme sponsored by Nigerian taxpayers,\u201d explained a former government-Boko Haram intermediary.\n\nHe has been in touch with the movement almost from the start, when it was still a local religious sect led by a young cleric, Mohammed Yusuf, before it declared war on the Nigerian state in 2009.\n\nSulhu grew out of the behind-the-scenes attempts to free the more than 270 Chibok schoolgirls seized by Boko Haram in 2014.\n\nAfter years of painstaking contact-making through a network of mediators, it dawned on the negotiators that not only did they have an opening to secure the release of some of the schoolgirls, but there were also Mujahideen signalling they might be open to dialogue \u2013 a potential breakthrough in a deadlocked conflict.\n\nA total of 150 Mujahideen have surrendered their weapons and crossed over since 2019, according to people familiar In the last few weeks, there has been a separate surge, related to internal feuding within the jihadist movement following the death this May of Abubakar Shekau, who had led Boko Haram since 2009.\n\nSome of those Mujahideen, like Aliyu, were commanders, known as qaid \u2013 in charge of several districts. Such was the importance attached to the initial group that they were invited to Abuja, where they met representatives of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nUnder Sulhu, defectors are enrolled in a six-month \u201cderadicalisation\u201d course in the military\u2019s demobilisation and reintegration centre in Mallam Sidi, in northeastern Gombe State.\n\nAfter promising to renounce violence and be good citizens, they are issued with a graduation certificate, signed by a high court judge \u2013 and some have then gone on to set up businesses, from cap-making to chicken-rearing.\n\nSulhu is run by DSS and the military, but is separate from the army\u2019s much larger disarmament, demobilisation, and reintegration initiative, known as Operation Safe Corridor (OSC) and also based in Mallam Sidi.\n\nOSC is aimed at low-risk former combatants, although as many as 75 per cent of those on the programme may never have held a weapon \u2013 just villagers snagged in the military\u2019s catch-all dragnets, with years spent in detention without trial.\n\nThose on the Sulhu initiative are the turbaned rijal seen in the low-res YouTube videos, exultant in victory, killing without remorse.\n\nBefore joining ISWAP, prior to the 2016 split from Boko Haram, these men had been obedient to a maximalist \u201ctakfir\u201d creed, promoted by then-leader Shekau, who declared that anybody living outside their zone of control was an infidel, punishable by death or enslavement.\n\nMore than 1,000 Boko Haram fighters have surrendered to the army in the last few weeks \u2013 handing over the weapons they carried.\n\nISWAP is militarily on the front foot, but there can be exhaustion with the years of conflict for any number of reasons, explained a Nigeria-based researcher, who asked not to be named so they could speak freely.\n\n\u201cSome [defectors] have lost faith in their leaders, accusing them of corruption; some have even forgotten why they were fighting; others just want their children to go to school.\u201d\n\nBut allowing jihadists to return to civilian life is clearly problematic. The military\u2019s far more limited OSC initiative, resettling low-risk Boko Haram, has run into a wall of criticism \u2013 including from some senior politicians, who misrepresent Mallam Sidi as a holiday resort, where \u201ckillers\u201d are pampered.\n\nAnd there\u2019s no appetite from the government to even begin to publicly discuss Sulhu.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of buy-in and a lot of pushback from sections of the military and political office holders, who don\u2019t see the need for this process,\u201d said an Abuja-based lawyer.\n\nYet almost 60 per cent of people surveyed across the northeast in 2018 said they could agree to reconciliation with repentant jihadists if that was a path to peace: though acceptance was far lower in areas hardest hit by the conflict, and among women \u2013 the victims of so much sexual violence.\n\nAliyu feels relatively comfortable in big cities like Kaduna and Maiduguri. But there are places where he knows he would receive a far rougher reception. \u201cPeople suffered,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cThey lost a lot [because of us].\u201d\n\nFor DSS, Sulhu makes strategic sense. Aliyu, for example, is a so-called \u201cpioneer\u201d, an early member of Boko Haram as well as a qaid \u2013 this means he has a deep and intimate knowledge of the movement and the men he fought with.\n\nThe Humanitarian said, \u201cSince he crossed over two years ago, his job has been to find other rijal wavering in their commitment to the jihadist cause. He says he has personally persuaded more than 20 of them to slip into frontline northern towns like Geidam, make pre-arranged contact with the military, and then start their journey into the Sulhu programme.\n\n\u201cAll he needs is a cell phone and recharge card. When his connections pop up, sometimes in Cameroon, Chad, and Niger \u2013 the rear bases of the insurgency \u2013 he pumps them for news and gossip. Then, when he judges the time is right, he badgers them to quit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy conversation. Uppermost in any potential defector\u2019s mind is the fear of being sent to Giwa Barracks, a notorious detention facility on the edge of a quiet Maiduguri suburb.\n\n\u201cEveryone is afraid of that place, and the people in the lake [Chad] don\u2019t trust the government [won\u2019t send them there],\u201d said Aliyu. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Giwa, more would come \u2013 [the abuse that happens there] is the biggest mistake the military has made.\u201d\n\nThe conversations aren\u2019t one-way, either. Aliyu\u2019s former comrades bait him, reminding him of the life he led in the Dawla \u2013 the territory ISWAP administers under shariah law and regards as independent from Nigeria.\n\nIn this zone, in the far north of Borno and Yobe States, beyond the reach of the military and aid agencies, rijal have almost total power over at least one million villagers they refer to as awam \u2013 or \u201ccommoners\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey say when you were in the lake [a region controlled by ISWAP], you were somebody important, now you have nothing,\u201d Aliyu explained, and you can feel the loss of prestige irks him.\n\nThe logo on his otherwise clean t-shirt is loose, and the seam in the crutch of his faded black trousers is coming apart. But there is still an air of entitlement about him.\n\nHe was mock scandalised by the price of a bottle of water in the quiet restaurant, where The New Humanitarian first interviewed him, and he feigned outrage that motorbike taxis were not allowed into the middle-class district.\n\n\u201cI will always fight injustice wherever I see it,\u201d Aliyu said grandly, seemingly the qaid \u2013 in his own mind at least \u2013 he once was.\n\nMothers and Sons\n\nThe publication noted that it\u2019s unclear why Aliyu chose to run. There was a suggestion by some close to jihadist networks that he and some of his men had rustled cattle in the Lake Chad region and he was about to be punished.\n\nISWAP considers stealing from Muslims a crime. Unlike the more predatory Boko Haram under Shekau, it has tended to think more about civilian hearts and minds.\n\nAliyu denied he was at fault. Instead, he described a falling out with ISWAP\u2019s then-commander of the army, Mustapha Kirimima, whose aggressive hardline stance persuaded others to also leave.\n\nKirimima is reportedly in detention after a leadership shuffle earlier this year that made Abu Musab al-Barnawi \u2013 the eldest surviving son of the founder of Boko Haram \u2013 the interim leader.\n\nAliyu is trying to rebuild his life. He\u2019s in school, learning to read and write English, and keen on it. He attends a regular mosque \u2013 nothing radical \u2013 and is close to his new wife.\n\n\u201cOne day, they [the community] will find out we are Boko Haram, but if we are together, we can bear [the stigma],\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf all mothers could welcome their sons, those in the forests, tell them no harm will come to them, they will come home\u201d, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, intelligence agencies have begun investigation of the surrender of over 1,200 terrorists and their families.\n\nThe investigation, THISDAY learnt, seeks to ascertain whether the surrender was genuine or a ploy to activate and coordinate terror sleeper cells across the country.\n\nNorth-east communities and traditional institutions have protested the potential reintegration of the insurgents into their communities.\n\nGovernor Babagana Zulum of Borno State and Shehu of Borno, HRH Abubakar El-Kanemi, had raised concerns that the communities where thousands of people were killed by the terrorists and houses destroyed might not be in the right frame of mind to accept the insurgents, who recently sought the forgiveness of Nigerians.\n\nA source told THISDAY that there were concerns and the need to be certain that the repentant insurgents had good intentions.\n\n\u201cThere is the need to be sure of what we have on our hands. Do we have people, who are eager to give up or is it a strategy to spread across the country and continue the spread of terror\u201d, a source said.\n\nAttempts to access the reaction of the military high command was unsuccessful.",

          "text": "\u2022Backs CBN\u2019s move against BDCs\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Managing Director/Chief Executive, Jaiz Bank Plc, Mr. Hassan Usman, has disclosed that the federal government utilised Islamic financing instruments, particularly the Sukuk, to raise over N350 billion within the past three years to execute road projects across the country.\n\nSpeaking on Arise News Channel, a sister broadcast arm of THISDAY over the weekend, Usman also said that the bank has been able to expand credit to the real sector of the economy, financing Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) as well as working with women, vulnerable groups and those at the bottom of the pyramid to deepen financial inclusion.\n\nAlso, commenting on the recent decision by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to work with commercial banks rather than Bureau De Change operators in administering foreign exchange to customers, the Jaiz Bank boss said the banks have the traditional mandate to engage in forex transaction.\n\nHe pointed out however, that the apex bank in a bid to bring forex services closer to customers decided to use the BDCs, a privilege which he said, had been abused by the latter.\n\nOn the growing appeal for ethical financing option, he said, \u201cThis mode of financing for public expenditure means you cannot divert the resources, you cannot use the monies raised except for that which you have intended. So it gives credence to the utilisation and also ensure that this resources are earmarked for specific developmental projects.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cNow if you look the other side where you are looking at the SMEs, Islamic finance tends to be more risk bearing and sharing with the SMEs and so encouraging this type of financing or banking means that the SMEs sector can grow with the support of this type of financing which shares risks and reward of whatever business is done.\u201d\n\nUsman, while backing the CBN\u2019s decision to engage the deposit money banks to undertake foreign exchange transactions going forward, said, \u201cAs you know, traditionally, it\u2019s the banks\u2019 job to provide all of these anyway but in other to bring this very close to the customer that\u2019s why the central bank was using the Bureau De change.\n\n\u201cBut as you know, this process had been abused and it\u2019s becoming a very huge hole for leakages in the system. I think that the banks, if you watched over the last couple of years have been trying to be very responsible and very conscious of the need of the nation and banks have come to participate in every issue and every situation that requires our help under the leadership of the governor of the central bank and the bankers\u2019 committee.\u201d\n\nHe said further, \u201cThey tried to do almost everything that is possible to support the community and the government to deliver whether it is social services or some national issues to intervene where necessary.\n\n\u201cAnd this is also a case where the bankers\u2019 committee has taken this assignment very seriously not only to ensure that foreign exchange is available to customers but also to strengthen the system so that those who are gaming this system would be checked out and be dealt with.\n\n\u201cAnd so that the nation will be better for it because few people should not be gaming our system and making policy strategies of the fiscal and monetary authorities impossible.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that Islamic financing tends to be more involving and therefore ensures extra disciple in the utilisation of resources to guarantee delivery.\n\nHe said the financing instrument also further creates the right environment for Public-Private Partnerships where the private sector using Islamic banking products could work with the government to develop long term infrastructure as the profit sharing arrangement allows that to happen.\n\nHe added that since 2012 when the bank started operations, it has been able to grow its activities around financing the real sector of the economy as well as financing and nurturing new companies and industries amidst the challenging business environment.\n\nHe said, \u201cRather than a loan, we give them equity and share in their profits and the downside, if it happens, we also are ready to do that by controlling the risk environment and ensuring that people do not take advantage of that product with the type of discipline through the group arrangement.\u201d\n\nThe Jaiz Bank MD attributed the company\u2019s recent positive financial performances to its commitment to customer base to create value and, \u201cshare that value between us with very high level of equity around it and that makes them to patronise the organisation the more.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cWe\u2019ve also tried to consolidate and expand to cover many areas of the commercial centers in Nigeria in addition to the fact that with the introduction of the Sukuk, our treasury function has improved because if you know that for more than six years of our life as a bank, we didn\u2019t have instruments to invest our surplus liquidity into until the Sukuk came in 2017.\u201d\n\nHe said through a number of initiatives, the bank had been able to grow profits at over 50 per cent annually as well as the size of the organisation which had grown at over 30 per cent within the last three to four years.\n\nThe Managing Director further stated that the bank grew its balance sheet by about 40 per cent in 2020 while its risk assets/financing also increased by 54 per cent while customer deposits also grew by about 40 per cent.\n\nHe added that despite the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the bank experienced a relatively successful year adding that this positive trend had persisted.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The Muhammadu Buhari-led government has been funding another secret programme aimed at rehabilitating and integrating the \u201crepentant\u201d Boko Haram terrorists into the society.\n\nThe program titled \u201cSulhu\u201d was exposed in a report by The New Humanitarian.\n\nThe media outlet stated that the programme was to pull the top commanders of terrorist groups such as Boko Haram and the Islamic State for West African Province (ISWAP), rehabilitate them and provide them with a means of livelihood.\n\nThe report dates the start of the Sulhu program back to 2014, after the abduction of over 270 Chibok schoolgirls seized by Boko Haram. During negotiations for the release of the abducted girls, the government recognised a potential opening for dialogue.\n\nThe report noted that 150 terrorists had dropped their arms and surrendered since 2019.\n\n\u201cA total of 150 mujahideen have surrendered their weapons and crossed over since 2019, according to people familiar with the programme. In the last few weeks, there has been a separate surge, related to internal feuding within the jihadist movement following the death this May of Abubakar Shekau, who had led Boko Haram since 2009.\n\n\u201cUnder sulhu, defectors are enrolled in a six-month \u201cderadicalisation\u201d course in the military\u2019s demobilisation and reintegration centre in Mallam Sidi, in northeastern Gombe State. After promising to renounce violence and be good citizens, they are issued with a graduation certificate, signed by a high court judge \u2013 and some have then gone on to set up businesses, from cap-making to chicken-rearing.\n\n\u201cSulhu is run by DSS and the military, but is separate from the army\u2019s much larger disarmament, demobilisation, and reintegration initiative, known as Operation Safe Corridor, and also based in Mallam Sidi,\u201d The New Humanitarian report said.\n\nThe report links the Sulhu programme to the recent surrender of terrorists to the Nigerian government.\n\nBrig Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, the army public relations director, had stated that depleting numbers of ISWAP members reduced the group\u2019s fighting capacity.\n\nA subject of the report is named as Mallam Aliyu, a former Boko Haram member involved in the Bama massacre of 2014.\n\nAs part of the Sulhu program, he now lives in a rent-free house in Kaduna State, has a business license, and is given a monthly stipend provided by Nigeria\u2019s SSS.\n\n\u201cSome of those mujahideen, like Aliyu, were commanders, known as qaid \u2013 in charge of several districts. Such was the importance attached to the initial group that they were invited to Abuja, where they met representatives of President Muhammadu Buhari,\u201d the report says.\n\nAfter six months of investigation, The New Humanitarian said that Sulhu had been reaching out to senior jihadists to try and convert them.\n\nThe programme is supposed to bring peace between the government and the terrorist groups in the long term but New Humanitarian said the program is so controversial that no government representative has agreed to speak publicly on it.",

As at August 21, 4,387 positive cases are currently being managed actively in community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOver the course of managing the COVID-19 pandemic, about 5,551 patients have been admitted into our various COVID-19 care centres in Lagos, with 506 registered fatalities. Of these deaths, 135 have sadly, happened in this current third wave.\n\n\u201cI commiserate with all residents who have lost loved ones to the pandemic. We share in your pain and grief. As a society and as a government, it is for us to redouble our efforts to defeat this devastating pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the state has seen a surge in severe cases, adding that the number of oxygen cylinders used rose from 75 per day to 400 within the third wave.\n\n\u201cIn terms of treatment of severe cases, we have seen a gradual increase in the uptake of oxygen during the current wave. Utilisation has increased from 75 cylinders per day at the beginning of this third wave, to over 400 cylinders per day currently,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWith our modelling suggesting that we may be requiring even more oxygen supply over the next few weeks, we are exploring several ways of increasing our oxygen capacity.\n\n\u201cOne of the major pillars of our mitigation strategy for the third wave is vaccination. We are seeing that countries that have vaccinated a large percentage of their population are recording drastic reductions in the numbers of COVID-19 related deaths.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the reasons why we have not spared any cost to ensure that the vaccines that have been provided by the federal government are made available to every resident that meets the requirements for the vaccination programme.\u201d\n\nAccording to the state ministry of health, Lagos has, so far, confirmed a total of over 70,000 positive cases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, more than 60,000 recoveries have been recorded \u2014 over 80 percent of the recoveries were recorded outside the state\u2019s isolation centres.",

          "text": "A Nigerian hacker recently tried to use disgruntled employees of an organisation to run a cyberattack scheme.\n\nAccording to cybersecurity firm Abnormal Security, on August 12, they intercepted a number of emails sent earlier in the month to some of their customers offering. The emails came with a $1 million offer, in bitcoin, to assist in a ransomware scheme.\n\nThe would-be attackers said they have ties to the DemonWare ransomware group, also known as the Black Kingdom or DEMON. This group has been around for a few years. In March, the ransomware was in the news for trying to exploit a significant Microsoft Exchange vulnerability.\n\nInitial email sent by the hacker | Image Credit: Abnormal Security\n\n\u201cIn this latest campaign, the sender tells the employee that if they\u2019re able to deploy ransomware on a company computer or Windows server, then they would be paid $1 million in bitcoin or 40% of the presumed $2.5 million ransom,\u201d Abnormal Security said.\n\nHow Ransomware works\n\nRansomware is a form of malicious software (malware) that encrypts a victim\u2019s files. It converts the information in the files into a secret code that hides the information\u2019s true meaning.\n\nHistorically, ransomware has been delivered via email attachments or, more recently, using direct network access obtained through things like unsecure VPN accounts or software vulnerabilities.\n\nOnce the malware has been deployed, the victim loses access to their files and then the attacker demands a ransom from the victim to restore access to the data upon payment.\n\nVictims of ransomware attacks are shown instructions for how to pay a fee to get the decryption key. The ransom in question can range from a few hundred dollars to millions, often paid to cybercriminals in Bitcoin.\n\nThe initial response from hacker reiterating offer on Telegram | Image Credit: Abnormal Security\n\n\n\nOver the course of five days, the team at Abnormal Security engaged with the hacker via Telegram pretending to be an employee that was willing to cooperate.\n\nThe hacker shared the file containing the malware and even reduced the ransome price upon hearing that the fake company\u2019s annual revenue was $50 million.\n\nHacker providing link to ransomware file | Image Credit: Abnormal Security\n\nHow did the hacker get the contact details of the people he contacted? He mentioned that he got their emails from LinkedIn. This, in addition to other commercial services that sell access to similar data, is a common medium scammers use to gather employees\u2019 personal data and information. He also stated that he had planned to target only senior level executives but when that plan failed, he pivoted to a ransomware scheme.\n\nHacker stating how he got the information| Image Credit: Abnormal Security\n\nLater in the conversation, he revealed that he was a Nigerian building a social networking platform.\n\nAbnormal security also ran an independent check that confirmed he was a Nigerian.\n\nHacker confirming he\u2019s a Nigeria| Image Credit: Abnormal Security\n\nInformation found on a Russian social media platform website connecting the hacker to Nigeria.\n\n| Image Credit: Abnormal Security\n\nDue to the pandemic and lockdown restrictions in the past year, the digital world has experienced a rise in cyber attacks. A number of these attacks are made possible via social engineering which relies on the oversight or negligence of people.\n\nThis story is coming at a time when the Nigerian government has allocated \u20a61.93 billion ($4.6 million) for a solution that will monitor and intercept WhatsApp messages. The solution is reportedly aimed at protecting Nigerians from cybercrime and terrorism perpetrated through such messaging platforms.\n\nHowever, media stakeholders and activists consider it as another attempt to restrict civil liberties.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "Grace Kouassi, an Ivorian construction retailer, goes through a lot of hassle when she has to pay employees their monthly salaries.\n\nHer challenges are not due to a lack of cash but stem from how best to disburse the funds. She has three options \u2013 use bank transfers, mobile money, or cash. In countries like Nigeria or South Africa, the first option, to an extent, is effective for business payments but not in Ivory Coast.\n\nCharges on real-time gross settlement (RTGS) interbank transfers can be as high as CFA17,000 ($30) and most times, the transfers take longer than expected \u2013 up to three days instead of a few hours \u2013 while also being prone to transaction issues.\n\nMany small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), like Kouassi\u2019s, grapple with costly and sluggish interbank transfers when paying employees or suppliers. They also can\u2019t use mobile money due to its limitations and are often forced to rely on inefficient and dangerous cash-based transactions.\n\nThese challenges are not limited to SMBs; they affect government institutions and even multilateral development organizations.\n\nEnter, Julaya.\n\nDigitising trade payments\n\nFounded in 2018, Julaya is a startup that provides businesses in Ivory Coast with mobile-based digital accounts to make money transfers.\n\nBefore launching Julaya, co-founders Mathias L\u00e9opoldie and Charles Talbot worked on the expansion of LemonWay \u2013 a marketplace payment solution \u2013 into Burkina Faso and Mali.\n\nIt was during their time at the France-based fintech firm they were introduced to the world of mobile money in francophone Africa and realised how businesses in Ivory Coast could reach a huge unbanked population faster via mobile phones.\n\nIn a country with around 26 million people, only 20% own bank accounts. But thanks to mobile money, millions of Ivorians can access basic financial services today.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Ivory Coast is one of the largest mobile money markets in francophone West Africa and continental Africa. Up to 75% of the adult population own a mobile money account.\n\nJulaya\u2019s platform.\n\nTackling the fragmentation problem\n\nA 2015 decision by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to allow nonbanks operate mobile money set the stage for a transformation in Ivory Coast\u2019s financial inclusion story.\n\nMobile money adoption has expanded since then, driven by all three of the country\u2019s mobile network operators (Orange, MTN, and MOOV) who share the market with two over-the-counter institutions, CelPaid and Qash Services.\n\nThere have been significant investments in digital finance products, building agent networks, and pushing for acceptance. Presently, Ivory Coast has the highest mobile money penetration rate in West Africa.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2018, mobile money transactions in the country rose from CFA4.5 trillion ($7.7 billion) to CFA6.3 trillion ($10.8 billion).\n\nBut like other markets in Sub-Saharan Africa, there is no interoperability between mobile money providers in the country. This means users can\u2019t send money to wallets from another provider.\n\nGiven the penetration of mobile money, some businesses make use of agents to initiate payments, with cash, to digital wallets. But using this method for payroll disbursements can be a hellish task.\n\nKouassi, for example, has 24 employees who have mobile money accounts from five different operators. Whenever she opts for this option, there are always accounting and reconciliation problems to deal with after.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nJulaya solves this pain point by helping businesses disburse money electronically to several mobile money and mobile banking wallets via a single platform, faster than wire transfers or cash transactions.\n\nThe startup works with telecom operators and other mobile money players, integrating their APIs into its platform and allowing businesses make easy transfers to digital wallets from different providers.\n\nBy reducing the reliance on cash, Julaya enables companies to streamline their accounting processes and improve operational efficiency.\n\n\u201cAn understanding of these payment challenges in the market was essential to developing a solution people would use,\u201d L\u00e9opoldie told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity was to translate a payments ecosystem designed for B2C payments (mobile money) into a solution that could offer a better corporate end-user experience of mobile transacting.\u201d\n\nToday, Julaya has onboarded eight mobile money services through direct connections with telcos and aggregators.\n\nThough the platform is built for business payments, it focuses on lower-value transactions. This is because the foundation of its product is designed for small payments, hence, higher-value transactions are not always feasible.\n\nStill, the startup has been able to onboard a wide range of clients, from SMBs to large corporates and government institutions \u2013 including the World Bank, Ivory Coast\u2019s Ministry of Education, and pan-African e-commerce company, Jumia.\n\nAs of July, it processed over $2 million monthly for 50 customers.\n\nThe Julaya team.\n\nJulaya\u2019s expansion plans\n\nJulaya plans to deepen its market penetration in Ivory Coast, in the face of competition from the market-dominant telecom operators, other mobile money players, and banks. There are also plans to roll out the service across the francophone West Africa region, where eight countries, including Ivory Coast, share a single currency and central bank.\n\nThe expansion will be driven by a $2 million pre-Series A secured by the startup recently and announced late July. Julaya had previously raised $250,000 in 2018 and $550,000 in 2019, both of which were from angel investors.\n\nPresently, Julaya operates out of two offices; its R&D and IT teams in Paris and a regional office in Abidjan. Across both locations, it employs 16 people.\n\nFinding the right talent to join the team is one of the major problems the startup is facing, according to L\u00e9opoldie, in addition to unreliable APIs from telecoms and a lack of trust in digitised payments, which makes customer acquisition costs high.\n\nBut Julaya\u2019s ambitions remain undeterred, with its expansion on schedule to start with an entry into Senegal this year.\n\nSome of the new investment will also be deployed into product development \u2013 specifically the addition of new digital wallets to Julaya\u2019s disbursement offering and possibly integrating the platform with its customers\u2019 enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "title": "Zambian election: How hunger, debt burden cost Lungu return bid",
          "text": "It is a new dawn in Zambia today, a Southern African nation, as citizens, with high optimism, await the inauguration of a new president elected on August 12, 2021.\n\nWith external debt burden analysts say is in the region of 30-40 percent (which grew from $21.73bn in 2019) of the entire annual revenue of the country, Zambians are eagerly looking forward to a new manager of the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nWhile the people groaned under intense hunger and poverty, the outgoing President Edgar Lungu, in the last electioneering, campaigned on the crest of infrastructural investment.\n\nBut it would appear that the people believed Hakainde Hichilema and his campaign promises to grow the economy to alleviate the people\u2019s suffering, restore the rule of law and end corruption; hence, the landslide he recorded against the incumbent.\n\nTaking a holistic look at the reasons for the electoral victory of Hichilema, Lungu\u2019s ouster and lessons for Nigeria, Bola Akinterinwa, a professor and former director-general, Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA), said the election had to be understood in context.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, the Zambian people were already much bent that enough is enough and they sent out signals that this time, whosever wants to rig the election will not find it easy. And what is this \u2018enough is enough\u2019? One, there is no food on the table for most Zambians and they want food; they are hungry.\n\nRead also: Nigerias 2023 election and the challenge from Zambia\n\n\u201cSecond, the incumbent president, Lungu was campaigning on the basis of infrastructural investment; so you want infrastructure; fine, but the people who would make use of the infrastructure are hungry. So, hunger must first of all be quenched before you talk about somebody putting a vehicle on the road, putting electrical infrastructure, and all those things,\u201d Akinterinwa said.\n\nAccording to Akinterinwa, \u201cAnother point is that Zambia is currently servicing its foreign debts to the tune of 30 to 40 percent. Now, even if you take 30 percent only, not to talk of 40, then the 70 percent of what is left is not much to divide between and among health demands, educational demands, security demands, administrative demands, pension demands and many others.\n\n\u201cNow, Lungu wants increase in governmental control on mining. The mainstay of Zambian economy is Copper. So, copper accounts for more than 70 percent of foreign exchange earnings. So, Lungu doesn\u2019t want any relationship/understanding with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other Bretton Woods Institutions.\n\n\u201cIn this case he does not enjoy international support, whereas the challenger, Hichilema, holds a contrary position. He wants to relate with the IMF, and he wants to address the foreign indebtedness issue. Zambia is really indebted. So, because of his position, he enjoys, to a great extent, domestic and international support.\u201d\n\nHe also said the Zambian youth, especially in terms of the total number of registered voters, were on Hichilema\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cThe youth account for more than 54 percent of the total registered voters and all these youths that have registered are of 34 years of age and less. So, if they account for 54 percent and they are behind Hichilema strictly against Lungu, then you can understand why the margin is wide. But perhaps, most importantly, above all, Hichilema had contested five times and failed, so, in the 2015 election, he only narrowly missed being elected,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the lessons Nigeria can glean from the Zambian experience, Akinterinwa said: \u201cAt the individual level of presidential candidate, if you win election, thank God. If you do not win, continue to struggle; that is the message, without planning to go and meet the African \u2018juju\u2019 man to kill your enemy as it is done in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe second lesson there is that Zambians electoral commission several times would give instructions, some would comply, and some would not. For instance, in June, the Commission asked all political parties not to go out and campaign for reason of COVID-19, most unfortunately, the incumbent government under which the statement was made did not comply with the regulation and the opposition party too did not comply.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, it is all about political chicanery. The parties do not have any ideology of whatever type. In Nigeria here, you saw what happened in the National Assembly; we are talking about electronic voting and result transmission; you know what transpired \u2013 that is one major issue.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that the incumbent president did not stoke violence by rejecting the outcome of the election, despite his earlier threats.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that President Lungu threatened that he would not resign. He complained and threatened violence when Hichilema was said to be moving above and making progress, but now he is not talking about violence. He readily conceded defeat, because the vote cast clearly shows it was free and fair. In Nigeria, people don\u2019t normally, quickly accept defeat. We must begin to change that attitude,\u201d the former NIIA DG said.",

Hameed Ali, told the committee that the service proposed to generate the sum of N1.33 trillion in 2022.\n\nAli said the service came up with the figure after analysing the average revenue collection in the previous and was trying to be as realistic as possible.\n\n\u201cWe are expecting in 2022, N1.33 trillion, that is what we are proposing; we are hoping that things will improve, importation do fluctuate and we do not have any constant measurement.\n\n\u201cSo, we take the average of what we collected in the previous year and compute it and come up with a figure that is realisable.\n\n\u201cWhatever comes thereafter, it is our hope that we will surpass it by far but we are trying to be as realistic as we can in our proposal,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAli, however, said should any extra money be generated, it would go straight into the federation account and that the service had no intention to defraud the government.\n\n...",

To eliminate this notion, the process for the on-going plans has been inclusive and participatory, involving not only state actors.\n\n\u201cBut the Organized Private Sector, Civil Society Organizations, Women and Youth groups, including People with Special Needs.\n\n\u201cThe Plans are anchored on the Government\u2019s desire to address the prevalence of poverty by lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years,\u201d he said.\n\nAgba said further that the exercise would also put in place strategies to tackle Nigeria\u2019s increasing population growth.\n\n\u201cThe country will hit the 411 million mark and become the third most populous country in the world by 2050, after China and India.\n\n\u201cThese plans will ensure economic stability, national development and good governance\u201d, Agba said.\n\nAgba also appreciated KAS for its numerous support towards policy making and implementation process in Nigeria, adding that the training for Aides of Ministers is apt.\n\nHe also urged participants to apply lessons learnt from the workshop into the implementation of the National Plans for the benefit of the country.\n\nMr Vladmir Kreck, Resident Representative of KAS to Nigeria said KAS was keen on supporting Nigeria\u2019s Ministries, Departments, Agencies, legislatures, Civil Societies towards ensuring sustainable democracy and governance in line with its mandates.\n\nKreck, who was represented by Mr Samson Adeniran, KAS Programme Manager, said KAS was training Aides to Ministers considering their key role in administration and governance.\n\n\u201cWith these workshops and capacity buiding, KAS wishes that contributions from all of us will flow into the eventual implementation of the long term Development plan of the nation.\n\n\u201cWe as a foundation that stands for good governance everywhere in the world where we are active, hope that efforts will lead to respect for the rule of law, transparency, accountability, efficiency and equity.\n\n\u201cAll these are what can make a nation to develop quickly,\u201d Kreck said.\n\n...",

          "text": "The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has denied claims by the Comptroller-General of Nigerian Customs Service, Hameed Ali, that it refused to cooperate to end the smuggling of petroleum products across Nigeria\u2019s borders.\n\nMr Ali, a retired colonel, had alleged that the DPR, an agency in charge of regulating the downstream sector, had been giving licences to petrol stations around the land borders in violation of existing laws.\n\nThe Customs boss also accused the DPR of failing to provide the list of all the fillings stations within 20km of the land borders, \u201cboth legal and illegal stations\u201d.\n\nBashir Sodiq, the DPR Head of Downstream, while speaking on Monday at the ongoing interactive session on the Medium Term Expenditure Framework organised by the House of Representatives Committee on Finance, said the Customs boss had been supplied with all the information he asked for.\n\nHe promised to provide the committee documents as an evidence to back up his claim.\n\nMr Sodiq disclosed that following the policy to restrict the supply of PMS to border communities within the 20km corridor, \u201cit was NCS and the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) that were recommending filling stations for exemptions\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cI am not sure that the information that the CG has is correct. I have the record here. I can remember that when the issue of smuggling of petroleum products was brought up to the DPR, It was by the GMD of the NNPC, in April 2018, he sought a meeting between NCS and ourselves, which we held in the office of the CG customs on April 2018.\n\n\u201cWe agree to set up a committee to look at PMS smuggling across the border, and one of the things that the customs requested of us was the list of all the filling stations near the border, which we gave to them. I have the copy of the communication we sent to them. We gave them the list of all the illegal petrol stations. I have a copy stamped in his office. We will send you a copy.\n\n\u201cAfter that joint border drill initiated by the office of the National Security Adviser, we were directed to stop supplying to filling stations 20km to the border, which we did. I have the circular that we sent to all our offices.\n\n\u201cHowever, as time goes on, we had a series of communications both from the ONSA and the NCS requesting exemptions. None of these was initiated by the DPR, why? Because of security issue, we felt that smuggling was more of a security issue.\n\n\u201cWhenever we get any request from them, we approve. We have never given any licence to any filling station since. We did an analysis of supply to the border area in the country, it does not amount to three per cent of the daily consumption.\u201d\n\nMr Ali, had during his appearance before the committee, also informed the committee that the DPR and the NNPC could set up PMS retail outlets in other neighbouring countries, in a bid to curb smuggling.\n\nHe noted that the responsibility of ending smuggling is a matter of security, hence, it is the responsibility of Customs, not DPR.\n\n\u201cThe responsibility of stopping smuggling rests on the shoulder of the Nigerian Customs Service. Smuggling is not something that is reported.\n\n\u201cIt is true that NNPC had a lot of concerns about the quantity of PMS they are importing. They believed that because of price disparity, some are being smuggled. Of course, that makes sense, considering that our prices are lower than our neighbours,\u201d he said.\n\nGas flaring\n\nHe also explained that the government has reduced gas flaring by 68 per cent with its commercialisation of gas that ordinarily would have been flared.\n\nThe DPR was commended by the committee for its revenue performance in the current 2021 fiscal year.\n\nThe agency has a revenue performance of N1.5 trillion as of June, against the target of N2 trillion for the year.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCommittee to probe daily consumption- Faleke\n\nSpeaking to journalists at the end of Monday\u2019s session, James Faleke (APC, Lagos), said the committee would invite the Nigerian Communications Satellite Limited, to supply it with satellite images of the land borders.\n\nHe said the figure of smuggled PMS is about 40 million litres daily,\n\nAccording to him, it will take 1,000 of 33,000 litres trucks to convey the products daily.\n\nMr Faleke said the trucks would have been captured by the NICOMSAT satellite.\n\n\u201cWe are taking the opportunity of MTEF to ask critical questions, because if about 40 million litres of PMS are being smuggled out per day, the question is, how many trucks of 33,000 litres do we need to convey this volume out of the country?\n\n\u201cWhen we did small arithmetic, we discovered that we will need 1,000 trucks. If it is true that the volume goes out of the country, it means 1000 trucks go out to neighbouring countries. Ad they come back to load, if that is true.\n\n\u201cSatellite images should have captured these. We have invited NICOMSAT. DPR is saying about 48 million, contrary to the number being circulated by the NNPC. We have asked the Petroleum Equalisation Fund to provide us with data on fuel consumption,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NNPC is scheduled to appear before the committee on Wednesday.",

We have seen mass surrender from Boko Haram members. I must say Boko Haram is coming to an end.\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m optimistic that Boko Haram not only Boko Haram, the insurgency because in addition to Boko Haram ISWAP, and probably other tangential groups like that, I\u2019m sure the new strategy by the current leadership of the armed forces are working on Boko Haram heavy losses leader and probably have a lot so many commanders.\n\n\u201cSome of them think they should just throw in the towel.

We have to be prepared for the human resources that we have to make available.\n\n\u201cWe need to screen to ensure that Those who are genuine and those who may just follow in for some reasons, but I don\u2019t subscribe to the idea of saying forget about people who are surrendering all of them are criminals and the rest of it in the law of wars or something when somebody surrenders, you have something to surrender.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, maybe you\u2019ll do some profiling and find out whether this is someone genuine. So I believe that we should give people the benefit of the doubt.\n\n\u201cBut we should also be very circumspect on those who may not be genuine in this, but we should accept people when they come and take the appropriate measures, get the right strategies on how to deal with the integration of such people into the community.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t throw them just into the community like that, because you need to do some other things to ensure that everybody is sanitized, so to speak, before they are introduced into the society,\u201d he added.",

We have to be prepared for the human resources that we have to make available.\n\n\u201cWe need to screen to ensure that Those who are genuine and those who may just follow in for some reasons, but I don\u2019t subscribe to the idea of saying forget about people who are surrendering all of them are criminals and the rest of it in the law of wars or something when somebody surrenders, you have something to surrender.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, maybe you\u2019ll do some profiling and find out whether this is someone genuine. So I believe that we should give people the benefit of the doubt.\n\n\u201cBut we should also be very circumspect on those who may not be genuine in this, but we should accept people when they come and take the appropriate measures, get the right strategies on how to deal with the integration of such people into the community.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t throw them just into the community like that, because you need to do some other things to ensure that everybody is sanitized, so to speak, before they are introduced into the society,\u201d he added.",

He is also anticipated to sign the remaining eight\u2019s Release Order after their 16 sureties have been completed.\n\nWhen the DSS \u201craided\u201d Igboho\u2019s Ibadan residence in a Gestapo-style raid around 1 a.m. on July 1, 2021, all of the detainees were arrested.\n\nIn a \u201cgun duel,\u201d the secret police claimed to have killed two more of the activist\u2019s associates.\n\nThe court had been approached by the 12 detainees who wanted to be released.",

The programme commenced in the Office of the Vice President back in June 2016 when the application portal was first opened.\n\n\u201cOver 750,000 applications were received, out of which, 200,000 beneficiaries were screened and selected into the first batch called Batch A. The portal was opened again in June 2017 where over 2.5 million applications were received, from which another 300,000 volunteers were selected into the programme as Batch B.\n\n\u201cI thank His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari for his administration\u2019s unwavering efforts in eradicating poverty in our country and for supporting and sustaining the National Social Investment Programme. With the creation of the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and the relocation of the NSIP from the OVP to the Ministry, it is worthy to note that Mr. President recognized the creativity and impact of the NPower and has graciously approved the expansion of the programme from 500,000 to 1,000,000 beneficiaries, to enable more young people to benefit.\n\n\u201cBased on this approval, the portal was again opened in June 2020, and over 6 million new applications were received. 1,000,000 beneficiaries will be mined from this as the NPower Batch C.\n\n\u201cThe batch C is divided into 2 streams.

And the OSU was dedicated to the deity that ruled over the shrine.\n\n\u201cIt was believed that the OSU would bear any evil burden that was supposed to come upon the land and the people; whether sickness, disease or death. By virtue of the ritual, the OSU was regarded as one that was cursed, abominable, and untouchable. Hence he was ostracized.\n\n\u201cThe UME was believed to have been cursed to die prematurely by the gods. Over the generations, it has been established however that the people tagged UME were simply individuals with a history of sickle cell in their family background.\n\n\u201cThe OHU was of the slave class made up mostly of people used as collateral for debts and individuals sold by their kinsmen. A lot of the OHU were captured in battles, whereas some were drawn from the OSU class.\u201d",

Despite their position, there have been calls from some members of the party demanding the resignation of the PDP national chairman.\n\nOn August 3, seven national officers of the main opposition party resigned from their roles, alleging that they were being side-lined and treated unfairly by Secondus.\n\nThis, among several other events, forced an emergency meeting of members of the PDP Board of Trustees who sought ways to resolve the crisis in the party.\n\nHowever, the controversy has taken a new twist with the court order restraining Secondus from parading as the PDP national chairman, pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice for interlocutory injunction.\n\nJustice Gbasam made an order granting leave to serve by substituted means the originating summons, motion on notice, all orders made by the court, as well as all subsequent processes on Secondus by pasting them on the gate of his house in the state capital, and by publishing same in a newspaper.\n\nHe also granted the request to serve by substituted means all orders made by the court on the respondents and by publishing same in a newspaper.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nA deep distrust of the Federal Government\u2019s ability to implement its promises is behind the prolonged strike of resident doctors across the country, the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) said on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe problem we face is that when agreements are signed, everybody goes to sleep,\u201d NMA President, Innocent Ujah, said during his appearance on Channels Television\u2019s Sunrise Daily.\n\n\u201cSo there is this distrust among workers. And this is not good for the country; because we expect that those who work for our President should be truthful, honest and should comply with the agreement.\u201d\n\nThere were indications that the three-week-old strike would soon be called off after the doctors, under the aegis of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) met with Federal Government representatives in Abuja over the weekend.\n\nThe meeting was brokered, in part by the NMA, which is the parent body of all doctors in the country.\n\nBut the resident doctors refused to sign the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) produced at the end of the meeting, citing the government\u2019s decision to institute a court action over the strike.\n\nThe resident doctors also said the government must reverse its \u2018no work, no pay\u2019 policy.\n\n\u2018Impoverished\u2019 Doctors\n\nMeanwhile, a NARD spokesperson, Julian Ojebo, has said the resident doctors will not resume unless their benefits have been paid.\n\nOjebo, while speaking on Sunrise Daily, said resident doctors have been left \u2018impoverished\u2019 by the government\u2019s inability to meet its demands.\n\n\u201cWe are not on strike for added allowances; we are not on strike for any other thing,\u201d Ojebo said. \u201cWe are on strike for our normal due salaries that you have not paid from January to July.\n\n\ufeff\n\n\u201cWe are talking about salary shortfalls that you have not paid from 2014 to 2016. We are talking about monies you have not paid for our medical residency training program. These are the issues on the table, and these issues have not been resolved.\u201d\n\nHe noted that signing MoUs was an academic exercise that does nothing to address the doctors\u2019 demands.\n\n\u201cPayment of our benefits are the only actionable plans that can actually make us sign any memorandum of agreement of terms,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOther than these, I don\u2019t think we are being fair.\u201d\n\nA recurring problem\n\nThe resident doctors had earlier embarked on a strike in April.\n\nThe strike was suspended within ten days after the doctors met with Federal Government representatives and an agreement was signed for implementation.\n\nBut nothing was done to implement the agreement, NARD has said, prompting the resumption of the strike action.\n\n\u201cTwenty-one days of strike action in this country is unacceptable,\u201d the NMA chief Ujah said on Monday. \u201cBut the problem is that some people are not doing their work.\n\n\u201cThis strike is avoidable. In April, we were able to convince our colleagues to suspend the action, and nothing happened anymore.\n\n\u201cThey gave a period of notice to government, again nothing happened.\n\n\u201cThe issue is about distrust. So government has to implement at least some of the demands.\n\n\u201cIf the government does its own bit, there is no reason why resident doctors should not go back to work. They are not happy that when issues are raised, implementation becomes a problem.\u201d",

We do not want to have a cross mix of vaccines within facilities so that those designated to offer Pfizer will offer Pfizer, those designated to offer Moderna or AstraZeneca will do so. This will enable people to choose which post to be vaccinated at,\u201d she explained.\n\nApproximately 2.9 per cent of the adult population in Kenya has since been fully vaccinated.",
