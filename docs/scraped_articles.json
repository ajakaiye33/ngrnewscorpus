          "title": "APC: A congress of crises",
          "text": "By Omeiza Ajayi, ABUJA\n\nIn spite of its determined efforts to stave off crisis in the lead-up to the conduct of its Ward Congresses across the states and the FCT, the Gov. Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee CECPC of the ruling All Progressives Congress APC now has its hands full with the controversies that have trailed the exercise in some states of the federation.From Delta, Osun, Kwara, Enugu to Lagos and many other states, events of last weekend can best be described as a congress of crisis rather than a congress of all progressives.\n\nOn the eve of the event, the national leadership of the party had threatened to wield the big stick on any of its members who conduct parallel exercises or open parallel party secretariats.\n\nThe party hierarchy through the National Secretary of its Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee CECPC, Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe also moved to ward off a possible resort to litigations in the aftermath of the exercise.\n\nHe specifically reminded party members of the December 8, 2020 resolution of the National Executive Committee NEC of the party which directed all aggrieved members to withdraw cases from the courts and warned others not to institute litigations against the party.\n\nThe NEC had ordered that \u201call pending litigations instituted by members against the party should be withdrawn forthwith, and going forward, no member should institute matters against the party, without exhausting the internal mechanism for conflict resolution, as enshrined in the party\u2019s constitution\u201d.\n\nThe party therefore insisted that all activities that may be carried out by persons to put the party and its officers in bad light, before, during and after the congresses should be jettisoned.\n\nThe party added that \u201call activities or processes leading up to the congresses and thereafter which do not have the approval of the CECPC are exercises in futility. This is to say that: any purported; parallel congress, parallel party organ and or parallel party office, is to say the least a nullity\u201d.\n\nThe APC leadership vowed to dish out maximum punishment to offenders in accordance with its constitutional provisions.\n\n\u201cThese divisive activities will not be tolerated. For the avoidance of doubt, the party shall deploy the full weight of the law as stipulated in section 21(D) of our party\u2019s Constitution on any one who perpetrates such unlawful Act(s) and also on their sponsors\u201d, the party said\n\nIn spite of the above warnings however, there have been protests in some states of the federation regarding the conduct of the exercise.\n\nDelta\n\nEven two days before the exercise in Delta state, there was a fracas at the state secretariat of the party where the three-man committee sent for the conduct of the congresses narrowly escaped being lynched by aggrieved aspirants, but for the intervention of some party members.\n\nForms for the exercise were in short supply as most of the aspirants who had paid in the bank could not be issued forms when they presented their bank tellers.\n\nHead of the three-man committee, Mr George Ojong Egbe said; \u201cas at today 29th July, thousands of tellers were presented to me and there were no forms to issue out. In the course of explaining, violence erupted, but for the intervention of the State Deputy Chair, Organising Secretary and other party members, we would been lynched.\u201d\n\nSome stakeholders of the party in the state have however kicked against the exercise, accusing the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege of hijacking the process.\n\nThose who are aggrieved include the Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Mr Festus Keyamo SAN; Executive Director in charge of Projects at the Niger Delta Development Commission NDDC, Dr. Cairo Ojougboh, and former governorship candidates of the party, Olorogun O\u2019tega Emerhor and Chief Great Ogboru.\n\nOsun\n\nIn Osun state, it is a battle of wits between the state governor, Gboyega Oyetola and his predecessor and incumbent Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola. A group within the party, Progressive Minded People PMP had accused the \u201cIlerioluwa faction\u201d of the party of buying up the over 18, 000 forms dispatched to the state for last weekend\u2019s Ward Congresses of the party.\n\nConvener of the PMP, Sunday Oriolowo who is a loyalist of Aregbesola said \u201cmajority of party members in the state had proceeded to the bank to pay for the forms as directed by the party guidelines.\n\nHowever, we were surprised when on Wednesday, 28th July 2021 \u2013 the day the payment for the forms was supposed to close- we still hadn\u2019t seen the officials who were sent to Osun for the assignment.\n\n\u201cFindings revealed that the national party officials who were sent to the state had actually arrived Osun, but were held incommunicado by officials loyal to the governor. Many members of the party were then forced to pick up their form from our national headquarters in Abuja.\n\n\u201cOf course, it is true that the Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Committee for Osun State Ward Congress, Hon. Gbenga Elegbeleye arrived the state less than 12 hours to the congress and held a meeting with selected individuals inside the governor\u2019s house, however, we would like to know if he asked about the whereabouts of the officials sent ahead from Abuja to sell forms to majority of the party members.\n\n\u201cBy the way, we have it on good authority that over 18,000 forms given to the party officials from Abuja were paid for in bulk on a single teller and collected from the officials by an official loyal to the governor as against our party\u2019s Ward Congress Guidelines.\n\n\u201cThis information is verifiable and evidence exists to back this up when the time comes\u201d, he added.\n\nThere had been several protests by different groups against the outcome p the exercise.\n\nHowever, the Osun State Government has debunked the allegations, saying no such thing happened.\n\nChief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr Ismail Omipidan disclosed this in response to the allegations. He said; \u201cThe truth is, no such thing happened and you can cross check with your man here. The committee\u2019s chairman also addressed the issue during the stakeholders\u2019 meeting held on Friday evening shortly after their arrival.\n\nKwara\n\nIn Kwara, where there has been no love lost between the state governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq and the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, loyalists of the minister have also kicked against the exercise.\n\nWhile the Mohammed group had opened a parallel state party secretariat, the party leadership in Abuja had threatened sanctions against the minister. Mohammed\u2019s loyalists have also complained about the processes leading to the Congresses and the actual exercise itself.\n\nEnugu\n\nIn Enugu, some chieftains of the party have faulted the inauguration of ward executives by state chairman, Dr Ben Nwoye in alleged violation of congress guidelines. Nwoye had on Tuesday, inaugurated a five-man party executives in the 260 political wards at the party\u2019s state secretariat, claiming that there was no provision in the APC constitution that forbids him from inaugurating them.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe leadership of the party gave us the go ahead to conduct the congress and there is nothing in our constitution that prohibits me from inaugurating you.\u201d\n\nHowever, APC chieftains \u2014 General Chris Eze, retd; an APC BoT member, General JOJ Okoloagu, retd, and former governorship aspirants \u2014 Chief Tagbo Ogara, Chief Ben Eche and Mrs Ginika Tor as well as other party leaders like Ejike Njeze described the action of the chairman as \u201ca show of rascality.\u201d\n\nLagos\n\nA splinter group within the Lagos APC, Lagos4Lagos which has been trying to upstage the Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu political structure also claimed to have held a parallel congress. The claim was however dismissed by the chairman of the party in the state.\n\nOgun\n\nDespite warnings from the national leadership of the party, loyalists of Governor Dapo Abiodun and those of his predecessor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, held parallel congresses across some wards in the state.\n\nThough the governor has debunked the claims but news reports indicate that there were parallel exercises in some parts of the state.\n\nOyo\n\nWhile the situation in Oyo was not too pronounced, party members loyal to the Minister of Sports and Youth Development, Mr. Sunday Dare, and those loyal to former governor, Mr. Adebayo Alao-Akala held different ward congresses in Ogbomoso North Local Government Area.\n\nEkiti\n\nSeen as a battle for supremacy between the supporters of the National Leader of the party, Senator Bola Tinubu, and those of Governor Kayode Fayemi, the exercise in Ekiti was one of the most rancorous following the reported killing of one person in Ado Ekiti, the state capital.\n\nAkwa Ibom\n\nLoyalists of the National Secretary of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the APC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe including the state chapter of the party have declared the exercise as successful.\n\nHowever, supporters of the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, have on their part accused Akpanudoedehe of manipulating the process through officials sent from the national secretariat to conduct the exercise.\n\nImo\n\nIn Imo, it was a walk over for the state governor, Hope Uzodinma as loyalists of Senators Rochas Okorocha and Ifeanyi Ararume, reportedly boycotted the exercise.\n\nRivers of controversy\n\nThe situation was not any different in Rivers where the state chapter of the party have been enmeshed in persistent crisis. In the state, loyalists of Senator Magnus Abe boycotted the congress which was seen as favouring the Minister of Transportation, Mr Rotimi Amaechi.\n\nWhile the CECPC of the party awaits report from the states, it is left to be seen how it intends to resolve these issues in the lead up to the party\u2019s national convention.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Emmanuel Iheaka\n\nHe is at the moment companioned by anguish, sorrow and sense of helplessness. For 25-year old Jonadab Onuchukwu, life has turned sour. And the sum of N15 million can restore the sweet taste of life, at least so says an Indian hospital.\n\nHis situation elicits empathy and pain, and can melt even a stone-made heart. It lives one wondering how much of a dose of cruelty life can offer at a time.\n\nThe young Jonadab is currently fighting what could be described as the toughest and one of the deadly battles of life, as he has been held down by stroke and complete paralysis for two years.\n\nHandsome, vibrant and hardworking, but the last two years period has changed the course for a young man who was ever ready to confront challenges of life and weather the storm unto a breakthrough. Within two years, sickness could be said to have made a ghost out of Jonadab.\n\nVanguard gathered that Jonadab, a graduate of Microbiology, Imo State University in 2017, was full of dreams about how to navigate the storms of life. Upon graduation, owing to financial challenge, he decided to pick up a secretarial job to raise some money which was needed to begin the process of being mobilized for the compulsory national youth service. A Disc Jockey, he combined the secretarial job with the contracts of being source of musical sounds at weekend ceremonies.\n\nThe beginning\n\nHaving raised some money, Jonadab planned to present himself for the commencement of mobilization for the compulsory national youth service on 20th October, 2019. It was same day the life threatening sickness came calling. Today, he is confined to a wheelchair and can neither walk, nor pass urine and faeces, with a sore that has eaten up to his spinal cord.\n\nTimothy Onuchukwu, a pastor with The Apostolic Church Nigeria and native of Umuegwu Mpam, Ahiazu Mbaise Local Government Area of Imo State, is the father of Jonadab. He told our correspondent that the tormenting experience began with a shocking sensation on Jonadab\u2019s feet, the same day he planned to commence clearance and process of being mobilized for service by the National Youth Service Corps. From the sensation, the body packed up.\n\n\u201cOn the 20th of October, 2019 which was the day he planned to begin his clearance for NYSC, he felt a shocking sensation under his feet. He thought it was a random shock that would stop with time but instead the whole shock got worse.\n\n\u201cFew days later, his hands stopped moving, other parts of his body took turn to pack up. We began to run helter skelter moving him from one medical centre to another in the east, all to no avail.\n\n\u201cA brain scan was done as he was unable to urinate or pass feaces on his own. At this point, his health deteriorated and it happened so fast.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t talk or eat because the muscles of his mouth were down and weak.\n\n\u201cAfter weeks at Federal Medical Centre Owerri without improvement and medical bills pilling up, he was discharged\u201d, the father narrated.\n\nBedsore\n\nNot ready to give up, they resorted to herbal remedy to see if respite or total cure could come the way of Jonadab. It was then the microbiologist by training developed serious bedsore, resulting in discontinuation of the remedy. \u201cWe had exhausted all we had in such a short time at the hospital, so, we resorted to using some herbs.\n\nWe suddenly noticed some life threatening bed sores on every strategic parts of his body. The bedsores were so deep that it touched his spinal cord and this resulted in rushing him back to the hospital which made no difference as he was close to almost giving up. The sores are healing so slowly\u201d, the father submitted.\n\nExperience at FMC Owerri\n\nAt the Federal Medical Centre, Owerri where Jonadab was first taken to, his father said the centre abandoned his son and later used him as a learning tool. He stated that it was at FMC that the situation deteriorated.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about the experience at FMC Owerri until my son recovers. We took him to the place when he was yet to have any deformity. They said there was no bed.\n\n\u201cLater on, they sent me to pay for series of tests; could you believe that as at 1AM, I was still running around for about 12 tests. By then, not even paracetamol was given to him.\n\n\u201cThey said they were waiting for consultants and for more than one week, no consultant came. At the end, what we saw was a student doctor who was learning with my son.\n\n\u201cI later learnt that the consultants come on special arrangements. People were dying anyhow. When he ran shortage of blood, there was no blood. He was about to die at FMC before I took him out of there.\n\n\u201cIt was one Dr. Njemanze Onyegbu that later restored him\u201d, the cleric told our correspondent.\n\nIndian connection\n\nA friend of the family contacted an Indian hospital that has assured of reviving Jonadab. Pastor Timothy said they have concluded the processes but needed the total sum of N15 million to fly Jonadab to India to save his life. He appealed to individuals, politicians, churches and groups to come to their rescue by way of raising the money.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m appealing to the Imo State governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma, governors of South East, politicians, churches, individuals to help save the life of my first son. Let this boy not die please. God will surely reward anybody who contributes, no matter how small\u201d, he appealed.\n\nHe provided the following account details for donation:\n\nJonadab Onuchukwu \u2013 0083434641 (Sterling Bank); Pst Onuchukwu Timothy/Bibian -2044675239 (UBA); and phone number \u2013 07036419952\n\nWhen contacted, the Public Relations Officer of FMC Owerri, Jacintha Achonu, submitted that the claim by Jonadab\u2019s father cannot be verified since the patient had left the hospital.\n\nAchonu however, insisted that a consultant must have attended to such patient with such magnitude of ailment.\n\n\u201cThe issue is that people expect to see a grey-hair doctor before they believe he is a consultant. These days, we have young consultants in their various fields.\n\n\u201cA consultant must have attended to him; no house doctor can be assigned to attend to such case. And it is not possible for one to stay for more than one week without seeing a consultant\u201d, the FMC spokesperson maintained.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "\u2022Southern govs\u2019 demand not enforceable but necessary for unity\n\n\u2022It\u2019s morally wrong for another northerner to succeed Buhari\n\n\u2022There\u2019s need to douse fears of northern domination of politics\n\n\u2022Other regions must be given sense of belonging\n\nBy Dayo Johnson, Akure; Samuel Oyadongha, Yenagoa; Egufe Yafugborhi, Port Harcourt; Rotimi Ojomoyela, Ado Ekiti; Peter Okutu, Abakaliki; Ike Uchechukwu, Calabar; Chioma Onuegbu, Uyo; Ozioruva Aliu, Benin; Shina Abubakar, Osogbo; James Ogunnaike, Abeokuta & Deola Badru, Ibadan\n\nGovernors from the 17 states in the southern part of the country, under the aegis of Southern Governors Forum rose from a meeting recently insisting that the presidency of the country should be rotated between the north and the south and that the next president should emerge from the south in 2023 after President Muhammadu Buhari must have completed his second term in office.\n\nThere were oppositions to this resolution especially from the northern leaders who argued that their southern counterparts were going about it the wrong way and that the northern voters would not be intimidated to support a southern candidate.\n\nThe demand by the southern governors however enjoyed the support of several groups in the country particularly lawyers who contended that though it may not be enforceable by our constitution, it was however their right to ask for it as the current situation in the country necessitate their stand. Some of the lawyers submitted that it would be morally wrong for another northerner to succeed President Buhari in 2023.\n\nOpponents of restructuring can not eat their cake and have it\n\nChief Sola Ebiseni, legal practitioner and the Secretary General, Afenifere argued that \u201cThere is nothing unconstitutional in the southern governors insisting that the presidency be rotated between the north and the south which is aimed at giving the constituent nationalities of the federation a sense of belonging in the governance of the polity at the topmost level. Section 14 (3) and (4) of the constitution provide that the composition of the Government of the Federation or any of its agencies and the conduct of its affairs shall be carried out in such a manner as to reflect the federal character of Nigeria and the need to promote national unity, and also to promote national loyalty, thereby ensuring that there shall be no predominance of persons from a few states or a few ethnic or other sectional groups in that government or any of its agencies. Rotating the office of the President will prevent its monopoly by any part of the country engendered by the tyranny of number procured by the shenanigans of manipulation of the demographic and attendant warped democratic processes. The southern governors were, in fact, merely reinforcing a conventional political practice since 1999.\n\nAt the 2014 National Conference, in which I was a Delegate, it was resolved by consensus, that office of the President be rotated between the north and south and among the zones. Same for the governorship among the senatorial districts of the state so that you do not have a monopoly of a particular tribe brought about by the discriminatory creation and awards of local governments by the military.\n\nIt is absurd and utterly inconsistent that those who pursue federal character and sense of belonging to the extent of being allowed admission into schools with less than 10% scores will reject promotion of sense of belonging to the office of the President of the federation. If Nigeria is genuinely structured along federal principles, so much that each state or zone could manage its own affairs, the clamour for zoning of positions at the federal level may simmer. Those who make restructuring impossible, cannot eat their cake and have it.\n\nRotational presidency between north/south will strengthen our democracy\n\nA private legal practitioner in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, Barr Michael O. Odo, stated that rotating the country\u2019s presidential slot between the North and South geo-political zones would strengthen the nation\u2019s democratic tenets and practices. According to him: \u201cIt is not a constitutional matter. If there is anything constitutional in the issue, it is the fact that the southern Governors have the constitutional right to freedom of association and freedom of speech. They have the Constitutional right to gather together and deliberate on issues affecting Nigeria as a whole and southern Nigeria in particular. They also have the Constitutional right to express their views or opinions and make demand for the next president to come from southern Nigeria. I believe that rotating the president of Nigeria between the north and south will strengthen our democracy and give the people of southern Nigeria especially the Igbos a sense of belonging in Nigeria. There is nothing wrong in the governors meeting in different groups but a lot of things will be wrong if the southern governors keep quiet and the next president comes from Northern Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s commendable southern governors have woken up to think aright\n\nThe Member representing Ivo State Constituency at Ebonyi State House of Assembly, Barr. Oliver Osi noted that \u201cthe Southern Governors forum came to be because of the overlord of those who think they are the owners of Nigeria; for long the people of the South thought they were building a nation, but it is now obvious that they were wrong.\n\nFor long, the governors of the north were meeting and foisting their agenda on the south, the south were naive in 2014; all the Northern elites with their governors came together and rigged Jonathan out. The north/south drums were beaten by them. They cannot come now and begin to cry foul. He that wants equity must do equity. If the southern governors have woken up from a long nightmare to think aright, nothing is wrong with that\u201d.\n\nCurrent situation in the country makes zoning inevitable\n\nChief Mba Ukweni, Senior Advocate of Nigeria, submitted that though the demand by southern governors may not be enforceable by our Constitution, it was within their right to make such demand within the provision of our laws. He said, \u201cthough zoning is not enshrined in our constitution on who takes over an elective position be it president or governor, all that is within the internal understanding of a political party, the governors as a unit or forum can make such demands and it is not out of place. It would be wrong to say their demand is unconstitutional, but you can only say that it is not enforceable within our constitution because it is not justiciable.\n\nAs a person, I don\u2019t believe in the zoning of political offices, I believe in merit, but the current situation in the country has necessitated a lot of agitation and has made that stand on zoning inevitable because a lot of people no longer feel safe when their people are not in certain offices or hold some positions. So, it has become inevitable for the position to rotate between regions, geo political zones as well as ethnic nationalities so that people can have a sense of belonging in the country. It doesn\u2019t matter whether we have an elaborate body like the Governors Forum, it is all about a sense of belonging\u201d.\n\nSouthern president important to douse fears of northern domination of politics\n\nBarrister Osom Makbere, a former Publicity Secretary, PDP, Bayelsa State chapter said: \u201cthe constitution is a supposed charter of our unity. Unfortunately, it is replete with lacunae, thus rather occasioning inequities and imbalances in the geometric composition of the adjoining units, in addition to one section placed on a convenient hypotenuse, much to the discomfort of the other units. The \u201cnorth\u201d in the hegemonic reference is always reluctant to let political power orbit round and in fact, there is this palpably age-long fear of the northern dominance of others and the issue of \u201crestructuring\u201d, amongst others that has assumed the front burner of discussions on our continuing future unity, but which the north has been lethargic about, thus compelling the \u201csouth\u201d to fire the first major salvo of the questions about our continuing unity.\n\nThus, the demand for \u201crotational\u201d presidency is a very healthy one as any matter reached with consensus can suffice as \u201cdemocracy\u201d. Most constitutions usually flourish on the \u201cpeople sovereignty\u201d in the preamble. This particular suggestion by the southern people ought to inform immediate amendment of [it], if the fears of the south about northern domination of the politics is to be doused. There must be a \u201cpeople\u201d element in every constitution and the call for a \u201crotational\u201d presidency is no doubt \u2018democratic\u2019 as same may help in the restructuring of our Fundamental Directives and Principles of State Policy and exalt same to an effective \u2018power sharing\u2019 clause under political objectives.\u201d\n\nIt will be morally wrong for another northerner to succeed Buhari\n\nDouglas Ogbankwa, a legal practitioner, said \u201cthe constitution actually does not provide for rotational presidency, however to the major political parties, their constitution provides for rotational candidature; like the APC and the PDP, they have provisions in their constitutions that say that if a presidential candidate from a region of Nigeria has finished eight years that the presidency can revert to another candidate from another region. Then again, the constitution cannot provide for everything; some things are just morally right or morally wrong.\n\nWhen you look at the whole issues, at times you consider what will be in the overall interest of the people. Will it be for the interest of this country, will it be for the continuous existence and the indivisibility of the country for the presidential candidate of a party to come from the zone where the outgoing president comes from? I think that will not be fair at all because Nigeria is a multi-ethnic country and has very many tribes, religions and interests so it will be proper for us to accommodate all the interests of the country at every point in time so that the country can continue to exist peacefully.\n\nI actually think that when the southern governors said the next president should come from the south, the northern leaders will agree and people will actually say yes these people actually want us to live together; if you really want us to live together, that is the way to go, not a situation where one part of the country will be feeling as if it is a colony of another.\n\nIt is this feeling that has aggravated secessionist agitation in the country. Before now, it was just the easterners that were agitating for secession but now, we have it all over; so the only thing that can bring about the kind of synergy in the country is if they are able to accommodate the aspirations and fears of other parts of the country.\n\nThe demand not unusual to preserve the unity of the country\n\nBarr Bukola Onifade said that \u201c the demand of the southern governors, seeking the presidency to move to the south, is not illegal though it is also not a constitutional arrangement but in the interest of the country\u2019s unity. Since the advent of democracy in Nigeria, the trend has been a north, south, east rotation of the presidency within and among the political parties, hence, if the Southern Governors Forum is making such demand to preserve the unity of the country, then, it is not unusual. In the first republic, the country was run on regional basis and that was the time the country witnessed progress the most, there was healthy rivalry between the three regions.\n\nSo, the existence of the southern and northern governors forums is strictly voluntary, even the bigger forum, the Nigeria Governors Forum, is also a voluntary organisation. They are all like pressure groups and it is an integral part of democratic governance. Nigeria can progress and will continue to progress only when we have diverse views on issues of national interest.\n\nThere\u2019s need to give others a sense of belonging\n\nHon. Barr. Victor \u2018Dotun Fasanya said that \u201cThere is nothing wrong with the Southern Governors\u2019 demand for a Southern President in Nigeria come 2023. By the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigerai, 1999 (as amended), any Nigerian who has attained the age of 35 can vie for the office of the Presidency irrespective of his/her region, religion or race.\n\nPlease recall that the two Protectorates that were amalgamated in 1914 by Lord Lugard into what we have today as Nigeria were the Northern Protectorate and the Southern Protectorate, which were, prior to the amalgamation, two different countries administered by different British Authorities. Since amalgamation however, the Northern/Southern dichotomy did not fizzle out. Instead, it became more pronounced as each of these regions used same to negotiate for offices, power, infrastructure, etc. So, this has been historical and may not be removed from our political structure.\n\nToday, there are six recognised geo-political zones in Nigeria, namely: North West, North Central, North East, all in the northern part of Nigeria and South West, South South, South East in the southern part of the country. There is an unwritten understanding or convention that presidency shall rotate between the southern regions and the northern regions. And this has been followed since emergence of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, a south westerner, in 1999, although, President Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s death scuttled this arrangement as he had barely spent two years when he died in office.\n\nNigeria is a federation of numerous ethnic nations and minority groups. The rotational presidency understanding is therefore very key to make every constituent that make up the federation to have a sense of belonging. Rotational presidency is not documented in the constitution; it is just a gentleman agreement between the north and the south to maintain the unity on Nigeria and give others a sense of belonging in the management of our commonwealth.\n\nAny of the major parties must field a southern candidate for unity, cohesion of Nigeria\n\nPresident, Ijaw Professionals Association, Barrister Iniruo Wills, said \u201cIt is a political convention or custom for managing the pluralism of Nigeria or any polity with similar circumstances, and to avoid inflicting an irreparable sense of alienation on any part of the country. It is not and does not have to be a constitutionally stipulated practice. Any of the major parties, particularly PDP and APC, that doesn\u2019t field a Southern candidate can\u2019t claim in good conscience that it cares about the unity and cohesion of the country. But ultimately the voter is king, so the electorate will make the final decision of where the next President comes from, knowing well the benefits or repercussions of that.\u201d\n\nEmphasis should be on merit, competence\n\nA legal practitioner and former member of the Oyo State House of Assembly Barr. Fatai Adesina, said: \u201cthere is no place in the constitution where a particular region is mentioned for presidential position. Zoning is entirely a party arrangement not a constitutional requirement. It can not promote the unity, it will rather divide us. We should lay emphasis on merit and competence rather than southern or northern presidency. It should be about ability to run the country well and have programmes and policies that will lift the citizens out of poverty. The best should be elected into various political offices.\u201d\n\nNothing constitutionally wrong with Southern governors demanding 2023 presidency\n\nA lawyer and former Speaker of Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Linus Umoh, wondered why a meeting of the Southern governors to take a stand on certain national issues should annoy the north, whereas Northern governors have been doing same since the creation of Nigeria.\n\nUmoh who is a one- time member of the House of Representatives said, \u201cThe issue bordering on Southern governors coming together to demand that the next president comes from the Southern part of Nigeria is not something that should annoy anybody. It is on record, and everyone knows it, that the Northern Governors have been meeting since the creation of Nigeria, and no one complains because freedom of association is under the Nigeria constitution.\n\nSo whoever complains about the Southern governor\u2019s meeting, and them taking position on certain national issues should think twice. So I advise our brothers from the northern part of the country not to take it the way they are taking it; they are taking it in a bad light which is not fair. What looks like the arrangement in Nigeria is that the presidency should be in the North for eight years, then it comes down to the South for another eight years, and they (northerners) know this.\n\nNo one should deny the fact that President Muhammadu Buhari also came into office through the north -South agenda. Why did they dump Goodluck Jonathan in 2015? It was because they felt that Jonathan was eating into the opportunity that would have been for the north through late President Yar\u2019Adua. By 2023, President Buhari would have spent eight years in office, therefore, the next president should come from the Southern part of the country. It is now left for all the political parties that will produce presidential candidates for 2023 to ensure that they pick their candidates from the South. So it is important that our governors speak out, and speak the truth\u201d\n\nPresident can come from anywhere\n\nNBA Vice Chairman , Ikere-Ekiti Branch, Temitope Kolawole said that \u201cPresident can come from anywhere, everybody has right of expression. If we see somebody coming from the north, saying he wants to be president, what do we do, are we going to say it\u2019s unlawful or unconstitutional? They said it is their interest, they have right to express it but if it does not materialize there is no crime. They can not forcefully make it to materialize\u201d\n\nZoning is a party affair\n\nA legal practitioner and chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Chief Victor Iyanam, submitted that the issue of zoning of the presidency was a party affair. The former Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Akwa Ibom State, under Godswill Akpabio\u2019s administration, said, \u201cEverybody is demanding something. It is politically, constitutionally correct for them (Southern governors) to make any demands. People must build a consensus to get what they want. And that issue (presidency) is even based on political party.\n\nThere are about a hundred political parties in Nigeria, if you go to the PDP and it zones the presidency to the South so be it, and if APC zones it to the North so be it. It is the entire country that will vote, if majority decides to vote for a Southern presidential candidate or a northern president candidate, there is nothing anybody can do\u201d\n\nWe need a change of value and orientation to make progress\n\nPrince Nyekwere, Chairman, Nigeria Bar Association, Port Harcourt Branch, Rivers state said, \u201cI don\u2019t fancy the cosmetic solution we proffer to a fundamental problem. The present Constitution of Nigeria is fundamentally flawed and a deviation from the agreement of the various nations that agreed to form the Nigeria Federation. Most of our politicians are rapacious and have no sense of statemanship. We need a change of value and orientation to make progress. Having a northern or southern president without addressing the flawed structure of the Nigeria Federation and our warped value will be of no moment.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "\u2026Says corruption worse now than in our time\n\n\u2026I once sacked a governor for misappropriating N313,000\n\n\u2026There would have been a violent coup if June 12 was not annulled\n\n\u2026Says insecurity is problem of leadership\n\n\u2026Asks DSS to obey court orders\n\n\u2026As Nigerians react\n\nBy Dayo Johnson; Anayo Okoli; Levinus Nwabughiogu; Rotimi Ojomoyela; Dirisu Yakubu; Chimaobi Nwaiwu; Shina Abubakar; Chinonso Alozie\n\nFormer military President, General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, IBB has said that the corruption index in the country is worse and more pervasive at the moment than what it was like in his time in power. He said they could be likened to saints compared to is happening now.\n\nIBB was a military leader who ruled Nigeria from 1985, when he staged a palace coup that ousted General Muhammadu Buhari, the current President of Nigeria from office, to 1993 shortly after he annulled June 12 Presidential election that produced late MKO Abiola as the winner.\n\nIBB spoke to Arise Television on Friday during its breakfast programme \u201cMorning Show\u201d to mark his 80th birthday anniversary which comes up on the 27th of this month.\n\nHe recalled sacking an unnamed governor during his regime for misappropriating N313,000, an amount which could in the present times be described as paltry.\n\nThe former military President said that it was in the place of the opposition political party and Nigerians at large to assess the government of All Progressives Congress, APC on its campaign promises especially on the anti-corruption fight.\n\nReacting to a claim during the interview that corruption was regarded as very pervasive during his administration, Babangida said: \u201cYou can\u2019t compare it with the facts on the ground now. From what I read, from the analyses, I think we are saints when compared to what is happening under a democratic dispensation. I sacked a governor of a state for misappropriating less than N313,000. Today, those who have stolen billions and are in court are now parading themselves on the streets. Who else is better in fighting corruption?\u201d\n\nOn assessment of APC govt\n\n\u201cAPC made promises on three planks; Nigerians voted for them on the three planks: economy, corruption and security. So, it is for Nigerians to decide, have these been met? I will rather wait and see how other Nigerians will react. If they convince me that they (the government) didn\u2019t succeed in these and they show me proofs, I will go for them.\u201d\n\nOn the kind of president Nigeria needs in 2023, IBB detailed the qualifications of the persons who should aspire to lead the country in 2023.\n\nOn zoning the Presidency amongst the regions in the country he said: \u201cYou allow the process to continue but it\u2019s through the process that you will be able to come out with a candidate that will lead the country. His qualifications, his beliefs should be known to Nigerians before somebody ever throws his hat into the ring regardless of where he comes from.\n\nIdea of zoning\n\n\u201cWhether we do it now or we don\u2019t, a time will come when somebody will emerge in this country, (whether) he is from Okpela or from Minna, the thing is that everybody knows him, everybody tends to accept what he believes in and then, if he throws his hat, and you say, yes, I have heard that name before. Why not? I have started visualizing a good Nigerian leader.\n\nA person who travels in this country and has friends virtually everywhere he travels to. He knows at least one person that he can communicate with. A person who is very vast in economic development and a good politician who should be able to talk to Nigerians. I have seen one or two or three already who are in their 60s\u201d, the former military leader said.\n\nAnnulment of June 12 election\n\nBabangida also revealed that if he had not annulled the June 12 1993 presidential election, a coup d\u2019etat would have occurred. He said \u201cYou want me to be honest with you? If it had materialized, there would have been a coup d\u2019etat which would have been violent. That\u2019s all I can confirm. It didn\u2019t happen. That\u2019s the engineering, the maradonic way we handled you guys in the society. But that could have given room for more instability in the country\u201d. He said the pressure was from both within the military and outside the military. \u201cThe military can do it because they have the weapons to do it, and others (civil society groups) can use agitation,\u201d Babangida said.\n\nRecall that he was called the \u201cEvil genus\u201d, and Maradona but the former president said the names came from the media and the society.\n\n\u201cI never called myself evil genius. The media did. Maradona, that\u2019s a very good thing about the Nigerian media, about the Nigerian people. You have to anticipate them. They call me evil. I marvel at it that. I say it\u2019s a contradiction. You can\u2019t be evil and then be a genius. Maradona, again, I got it from the definition of the media which means deft political moves. That\u2019s what the media described it.\u201d\n\nLingering insecurity caused by bad leadership\n\nIBB further said that the lingering insecurity problem in Nigeria was caused by bad leadership.\n\n\u201cThe problem is leadership. There is a disconnect between the leadership and the followership. When people related with each other at various leadership levels and talk about the community, the state and federation, then, we will not have problem whatsoever. We don\u2019t have core values in the country that everybody defends all the time. You are a Nigerian and this is what you defend and anything short of that, it is not going to be acceptable. When we were in the military, we talked about certain issues about Nigeria: the unity of Nigeria as far as we were concerned was a settled issue, presidentialism was a settled issue. Free market economy, not socialism was a settled issue. The Federation itself was also a settled issue. No body will come and say that Nigeria was no longer a federation or something\u201d, he said.\n\nOn restructuring, he said, \u201cWe decided to be one about 51 years ago and we have been in that position for the last 51 years. Why should we keep on repeating it? You can have not less than 100 conferences in this country that Nigerians themselves sat down and talked about how to remain one, how to work with the federating units, operate locally and so on. I think, there are issues we shouldn\u2019t be talking about now.\n\nWe should be talking about how to strengthen what we agreed upon. If we agreed that we are going to be a united Nigeria since 51 years ago, we should now be talking on how to strengthen that unity. If we are going to have federating units, we should now be talking about how to strengthen it. If we are talking about the local government whether they should have free funds, govern themselves, we should be talking on how this could be achieved. It is talkshop. That\u2019s what it is. You went to the shop, you talked and then came home and abandoned it.\n\nAnd then, somebody says oh we need that conference. Again, it\u2019s been done. Political Bureau has laid down everything. But I think the tyranny of the elites is what is the main problem. The way out is that the leadership should understand Nigeria and Nigerians. Restructuring means different things to different people. We don\u2019t have a common interpretation. That\u2019s the first basic problem we are going to have. We have defined it. Give the people from the lowest level to the highest level opportunity to participate on how they are governed or in governance.\n\nOn agitations\n\n\u201cIt is always good to agitate but because there is this belief that this country should be one, when they make the noise, they find out that it won\u2019t get support because Nigerians generally don\u2019t believe on anything that will disturb their piece of mind. They wouldn\u2019t do it.\n\nDSS must obey court orders\n\n\u201cI think they are fairly well trained and as far as flouting court orders is concerned, I don\u2019t think it is the right thing for them to do. They should obey court orders. That\u2019s why we ought to have strong institutions that obey the due process. I don\u2019t share their flouting of court orders at all.\u201d\n\nNigerians react\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerians have reacted to former President Babangida\u2019s claim that corruption is worse under the present civilian dispensation compared to the period he was in power. While many agreed with the former ruler that corruption is worse at present they however argued that corruption was prominent in the military era.\n\nMilitary laid foundation for corruption\u2014ADF, COASYL\n\nA Senior Advocate of Nigeria, SAN, Mike Ahamba, in his reaction said,\u201don corruption they were saints in his time compared with what is happening now.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking the leader of the Coalition of Southeast Youths Leaders, COASYL, Goodluck Ibem said: \u201cI agree with IBB that the corruption level is higher now compared to that of their time, he is not far from the truth. But may I remind him that it was the military that laid the foundation of the corruption we are seeing now. However, looking at it now, you can see that the civilians have overtaken the military in terms of corruption.\u201d\n\nIgbo elite body Alaigbo Development Foundation, ADF, in its reaction said: \u201cthe fact remains that IBB\u2019s regime laid the foundation for the capitalist liberalisation policies in Nigeria. The privatisation of industries and devaluation of the currency were started by IBB. He was no doubt a charismatic leader.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, the Pan Yoruba socio-political organisation, Comrade Jare Ajayi said that on the face of it, the assertion by the former military president on corruption \u2018is absolutely correct\u2019. Ajayi however added that the foundation for monumental corruption was exacerbated by military administrations.\n\n\u201cSo if one looks at the matter from that point one would be tempted to say that he was not competent to pass judgment in that respect. But doing so would be tantamount to our excusing the monumental corruption going on presently. For example, a national newspaper of this Friday published a story of several billions of Naira government has been spending on the Turn Around Maintenance of the refineries that have been moribund for years.\n\nThe money President just approved for the purpose was greater than the total capital for education or health for the past years, according to the report. Money disappeared yet no barrels of fuel were refined for the benefits of Nigerians. The most pitiable aspect of this is that nobody is being sanctioned for this indefensible and disgraceful waste. Babangida was right.The challenge for the present administration now is to make good its promises of stamping out corruption in our land\u201d.\n\nAlso reacting, the General Secretary of Afenifere, Chief Sola Ebiseni said, \u201cit is no gain saying the fact that the present administration has made saints of all previous administrations in every aspect of governance.\n\nThe Buhari government has failed, even in the areas of his promises to Nigerians on security, economy and anti corruption. Nigeria has been rendered a failed state in its obvious inability to secure life and property. The Babangida administration cannot be accused of sectional and sectarian disposition which is the hallmark of the Buhari Government. Rather than indulging in comparing any government with the present, those who still have faith in the unity of Nigeria are only fervently praying and counting days for this evil cup to pass over.\n\nComparing the two administration is odious, but they seem the same \u2013 Farounbi\n\nNigeria\u2019s ex-envoy to the Philippines, Dr Yemi Farounbi argued that comparing General Ibrahim Babangida\u2019s regime with the present administration was a bit difficult because of the different circumstances around the two governments. Although, he describe the level of corruption witnessed under President Muhammadu Bubari\u2019s administration as cancerous and threatening the corporate existence of the country, he added that the seed was planted during the military era\n\n\u201cComparisons are very odious simply because during General Ibrahim Babangida\u2019s time there was no EFCC, there was no ICPC, so it cannot be said the grundnorm for fighting corruption has been made. It is quite true that maybe one one governor or administrator misbehaved and dealt with, but there was no deliberate infrastructure provided to fight corruption. It is also equally true that the kind of loot that occurs now we have not seen before, I think this is because of the cancerous growth of corruption over the years.\n\nBut what most Nigerians would say is that the seed for corruption was probably laid when we had civilian administration with the Military administration of Babangida days. Some people think that monetisation of politics started at that time. It is perhaps true that the seed that was sown then has already grown to a cancerous tree that is threatening the existence of the country. But if we are looking at the dimension of corruption we have now, you would think that under Babangida regime they were saints. But if you look at the fact that whether the corruption is one naira or one billion naira, any misuse of public fund or misallocation of public fund, then you will say both administrations are the same\u201d.\n\nBabangida can\u2019t be compared with Buhari\u2014Babatope\n\nFormer Minister of Transportation, Chief Ebenezer Babatope in his own submissions said, \u201cI agree that General Babangida\u2019s administration was a saint compared to what we have now. Yes, he annulled electoral process but for how long do we want to dramatise that action. We were not this divided as a country, we were much more secured as a people, Babangida has done his best. We cannot compare Babangida and Buhari. Presently, election was, and is still being rigged under Buhari. If Buhari wanted to be compared with General Babaginda, he should up his game as President, unite the people and stop dividing the country through his nepotistic disposition to national issues\u201d, he said.\n\nIt\u2019s like comparing elephant with goat\u2014Chief Anaekwe\n\nElder statesman and former President General of Onitsha Markets Amalgamated Traders Association, OMATA, Chief Ozoh Anaekwe, agreed with former President Ibrahim Babangida that his administration was a saint when compared with the level of corruption in the president administration. He said, comparing the corruption in present administration with that of Babangidas regime is like comparing elephant with goat, corruption during Babangida\u2019s administration did not come near or close to what we have now.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with Saturday Vanguard, Chief Anaekwe said, during Babangida\u2019s regime, he carried everybody in Nigeria along, he never discriminated against any section of Nigeria, he carried Igbo, Hausa and other sections of Nigeria along. He appointed people into positions based on merit even when he had opportunity as a military president to appoint whoever he liked without anybody challenging him.\n\nBabangida\u2019s administration favoured many people irrespective of where you came from, he did not corner anything to his tribe or friends as we are seeing in the present administration, neither did he appoint only his relations, friends and men into juicy positions, he gave appointment based on merit.\n\nBabanngida can beat you with right hand and pet you with the left hand, what he said in Arise Television is totally correct, there is no comparison between corruption in the Bagabdiga administration and the present administration, unfortunately they are the one that has shouted the loudest against corruption in Nigeria, but generally the military brought corruption in Nigeria. If it is only corruption we are witnessing in the present administration, Nigerians will not bother, but the wanton killings and I don\u2019t care attitude of the present administration in bringing the perpetrators to book because they are from a favoured ethnic group is what is frightening and giving Nigerians sleepless night\u201d.\n\nMilitary not same as democratic government\u2014Anthony Sani\n\nImmediate past Secretary General of the Arewa Consultative Forum, ACF, Mr. Anthony Sani has said the instruments of governance in a military setting are world apart from what obtain in a democracy and as such, comparing the two systems of government becomes untenable.\n\nThe ACF chieftain said, \u201cit is difficult to compare what happened under military and democratic regimes precisely because they operate under different circumstances. For example, appointments and discipline of public officers under military are done without due recourse to obstacles posed by legal and legislative processes while in democracy, the processes can encounter a lot of challenges.\n\n\u201cEven removal of under performing public officers is easier done under military than in multi-party democracy where those they represent cry foul over such removal. Again, the cost of governance during military is less than in democracy. Even though power under President Babangida may be regarded by most Nigerians as more humane in spirit and wise in its uses, I am not sure the same can be said that the power was moral in its purpose, considering IBB\u2019s regime did not have programs to fight corruption.\n\nNo basis for comparison\u2014\u2014Yoruba Council of Elders\n\nThe Secretary-General, Yoruba Council of Elders, Dr Kunle Olajide, said, \u201cThere\u2019s no basis for comparing the two, one was purely a military dictatorship, while the other one is a coersive dictatorship which is supposed to be a constitutional government. Babangida government was purely dictatorship but we must credit it with assembling best technocrats in his cabinet but it was still a dictatorship.\n\nPresident Buhari is a democratic constitutional government but it is inaccessible to the people who elected him. He doesn\u2019t talk to us, so the constitution that brought them to power is a fraudulent document. So it is as if we are still in one form of dictatorship or the other. For me there is nothing to be between six and half a dozen\u201d, he said.\n\nAlso speaking, the Organising Secretary of Afenifere, Apagun Kole Omololu said that that\n\n\u201cProgressively Nigeria has witnessed worse management of corruption since 1966 especially with a military government and with people with military backgrounds as head of government in a democracy. Under General Babaginda government, scammers, dupers known as 419 were like in their embryo, Gen Abacha government was an open armed robbery led by the head of state himself. President Obasanjo\u2019s eight year tenure recorded miniature level of corruption like the 3rd term saga . Political corruption was at its peak, rigging of election, Political assassination. Financial corruption was insignificant.\n\nThe President Goodluck Jonathan witnessed uncivilised stealing. Very sectional pilfering.\n\nSince 2015, at the coming on board of General Buhari, it was like grand strategic plan to steal, to rape and to destroy. It is an assemblage of sophisticated thieves. Just be a member of their party as an armed rubber from someone where else, your sin will be forgiven .\n\nCorruption has graduated to evil phenomenon. Financial corruption, political corruption, economic corruption, nepotism corruption. It is like a plan to make sure Nigeria must not exist after Buhari.\n\nCorruption has destroyed the psyche of the citizens especially the young ones who has stooped believing they have a country called their own. They believe they are on their own. Buhari regime is in class of its own in the field of corruption it has no comparison. The regime is mean, satanic, wicked and unprecedented.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Finally, IBB reveals June 12 secret",
          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nNigeria\u2019s former Military President, General Ibrahim Babangida (retd), has opened up on why he annulled the June 12, 1993 the presidential election won by the late Chief MKO Abiola of the Social Democratic Party.\n\nIn an interview with Arise TV on Friday, the former head of state admitted that there was a lot of pressure from within and outside the military and noted that if the true results of the election had been declared, the army would have staged a coup which would have turned very bloody and set the country backward.\n\nThough the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari had declared June 12 Nigeria\u2019s Democracy Day, Babangida said that it took the manoeuvring of his regime to stabilise the country at the time to avoid a bloody coup.\n\n\u201cIf June 12 had materialised, there would have been a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat which could have been violent,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is all that I can confirm. It didn\u2019t happen thanks to the re-engineering and the way we manoeuvred. It could have given room for more instability. There was pressure from outside and within the military. The military could have done it because they had the weapons to do it.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the agitation for secession by separatist groups like the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) and Ilana Omo Oodua, he said even though everyone has the right to agitate, the issue of breaking up should not come up because according to him, it has been long established that Nigeria\u2019s unity is non-negotiable.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe always believe that the person who should run the country must believe in Nigeria and that is why we supported Olusegun Obasanjo for President. If he didn\u2019t believe in Nigeria, we would not go for him at all. Even if it is democratically or militarily imposed, you must have that core belief. It is good to agitate for what you want but because there is this belief that this country should be one and when you talk about war, you see that Nigerians usually don\u2019t want anything that would disturb their peace of mind.\n\n\u201cWhen we were in the military, we talked about certain issues and the unity of Nigeria was one of them. As far as we were concerned, the unity of Nigeria, free market, federalism were all settled issues. The unity of Nigeria for us was non-negotiable. We decided to be one many years ago. Why should we keep on repeating conferences on how to remain one? There are issues we should not still be talking about now. We have already decided that Nigeria will remain united, so what we should be talking about is how to strengthen the unity of the country.\u201d\n\nOn the high rate of insecurity across the country, especially in the North East, he attributed it to the failure of leadership. He said that there is disconnect between the leadership and the followership and that we don\u2019t have core values that everyone defends. He also said the problem with restructuring is that it means different things to different people and until there is a unified definition and understanding of the concepts, it will not be actualised.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe problem of insecurity is due to leadership. If there is no disconnect between the leadership and the followership, when people relate with each other at various leadership levels, then we would not have problems. We don\u2019t have core values in the country that everyone defends.\n\n\u201cConferences have been done but the tyranny of the elite is the main problem. The leaders should understand Nigeria and Nigerians. Anyone who wants to lead Nigeria should be able to use his intellect. Nigerians are very resilient people, so if you want to lead them, you have to take a lot of things into consideration.\n\n\u201cThe problem with restructuring is that it means different things to different people. We don\u2019t have a common interpretation; we have not defined it. My definition is to give the people from the lowest level of governance to the highest, the opportunity to participate in how they are governed.\u201d\n\nThe former military ruler also gave his opinion on the crisis rocking the two major political parties in Nigeria while dismissing fears that the country is gradually slipping into a one-party state. He said Nigerians will never allow a one-party system and would protest if anyone supports it.\n\nAlso speaking on zoning the presidency in 2023, he said the qualifications and competence of whoever will emerge president should be the most important rather than where the person comes from.\n\n\u201cNigerians would never allow a one-party state to happen. Whoever would attempt to do that will not be allowed to succeed and this is the good thing about this country. They will talk, demonstrate and engage you so that you don\u2019t do the wrong thing. I am not involved in any party because I am an elder statesman right now. However, I still maintain that a two-party state is the best thing for the country. We set up a committee to tell us why things went wrong and it was very revealing. We found out that up to the first and second republic, everybody was gravitating towards a two party system even though there were a lot of other parties. Now we have over 70 parties but no one is talking about them except the APC and PDP. During Obasanjo\u2019s time, we came up with five parties but they all gravitated towards a two party system, so Nigeria can do well with a two-party system.\n\n\u201cOn the zoning of the 2023 presidency, we have to make a choice. Do we want to practise democracy the way it should be practised or the way it is being practised? Or, do we define it according to our whims and caprices? If we are going to do it the way it is being done all over the world, we should allow the process to continue because it is through the process that we would be able to come up with a candidate that would lead the country. His qualifications should be more important regardless of where he comes from. I have started visualising a good Nigerian leader, a person who travels and has friends everywhere he travels, a person who is vast in economics and a good politician. I have seen one or two already who are in their 60s,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked about his regime\u2019s performance in the aspect of the economy and the fight against corruption, he said what happened during his administration cannot be compared to the level of corruption today. According to him, those in his regime were \u2018saints\u2019. He also said he has no regrets on the economic policies of his regime, insisting that those who followed his policies are the \u2018towers of industry\u2019 today.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t compare what happened during my administration with the facts on the ground now. From what I read in the media, I think we were saints when compared to what is happening under a democratic dispensation. I sacked a governor for misappropriating about N313, 000. Today, those who have stolen billions are parading themselves in the streets. So who is better at fighting corruption? Nigerians voted for APC based on what they promised on the economy, corruption and security, so it is also Nigerians that would decide for themselves and know if these promises have been met.\n\n\u201cHaving left office for the last 28 years, I think the decisions that my administration took were right. A lot of things have been happening since then which convinced me that we didn\u2019t do badly; it is just that we were misunderstood. I told Nigerians that those who will take advantage of Structural Advancement Programme (SAP) would succeed in life, but those who couldn\u2019t would go under. Today, I\u2019ve been proven right. People who took advantage of what we did are today the towers of industry. I think I made a contribution in society on how to make it better.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t declare war on the media, rather, I liberalised it. Today, you have private televisions and newspapers. I believe that the media is an essential part of society, and they should play their role for the country. The media and the public would not allow the government to clamp down on them.

          "title": "North suffering in silence under Buhari -Tanko Yunusa, Ex-NCP presidential candidate",
          "text": "To curtail the insecurity pervading the country, President Muhammadu Buhari has been advised to put a halt to the perceived marginalisation of some sections of the country by his government and carry all Nigerians along. Dr Yunusa Tanko, former presidential candidate of the National Conscience Party (NCP) during the 2019 general elections who stated this, also lamented that the North has been passing through hard times under the current administration. He spoke on these and other issues with TUNDE THOMAS\n\nWhat\u2019s your view on zoning or rotation of the presidency to the South in 2023?\n\nThe truth of the matter is that the Nigerian constitution doesn\u2019t recognise zoning or rotation. But in the spirit of equity, and fair play, it is better we have a Southern President in 2023, as this will foster togetherness, and unity among Nigerians. But this can\u2019t be done under duress. Even the majority of the people in the North have already agreed that the President should come from the South in 2023. It is now left for the South to go and do its homework on the issue. But having a President from the South in 2023 should not become a subject of threat, intimidation or blackmail. It is something that has to be negotiated through dialogue, and consensus.\n\nBut we should not forget that there are other tribes apart from Hausa-Fulani, Igbo and Yoruba who deserve to rule this country, and this is why we should start talking about a Nigerian President. We should have a president that can come from any part of the country. But as it is now, the North want a unifying president from the South. Even now that we have a serving president from the North, has it added any value to the region? No. The North is suffering more under Buhari.\n\nThere is so much poverty in the North, and yet we have a northerner as president. In fact, Buhari\u2019s presidency has not been of benefit to the North. What is even most painful to us in the North is that while we are suffering this much, people in the South are accusing us of marginalising them while we are in actual fact suffering. School children including toddlers were recently abducted in Niger State, and some of them are still being held. Same thing also happened in Kaduna,and in Zamfara. But if this has been in the South imagine the noise and uproar that would have been taking place. People in the North have been suffering in silence, and this is what many Nigerians don\u2019t know. Kidnappings and abductions are still taking place in many states in the North. Schools are in shambles. People can no longer go to their farms. Many people in the North have become prisoners in their homes as a result of insecurity. My own take on all these is that we should no longer be looking at each other as if this person is from the South or the North but rather we see ourselves as one Nigeria.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on the present high level of insecurity across the country, and efforts being made by the Federal Government to tackle it?\n\nThe truth is that while we try to identify the insecurity problem as being internal, it also has external coloration. We can\u2019t also talk about insecurity without mentioning other factors that may have fuelled it. At the moment, the way the economy is being handled has led to a lot of problems in this country. The signs of division and nepotism in government have also led to a lot of problems in this country. It is some of these problems that have created the problem of insecurity, and it is when we start identifying how to solve some of these problems that we can now talk about how to tackle insecurity.\n\nApart from insecurity, there are other problems to be solved and if we don\u2019t solve these problems, all efforts being made to tackle insecurity will amount to nothing. Some of these problems include the way people are being appointed to political offices. Contrary to what we are seeing now, Nigerians want to see appointment being made to government offices across tribal, religious, and political divides, and if it is done that way, anybody being appointed into government will know that he or she is being carried along in governance. But where you are being marginalised or feel alienated, you won\u2019t have a sense of belonging and may therefore not have interest in being part of efforts being made to find solutions to challenges confronting the nation.\n\nOne of the ways to tackle insecurity is to involve the people, to carry the people along, especially people at the grassroots, to listen to the hues and cries of the people, and in the process, our leaders will be able to extract valuable information that will help in solving the problem. Government needs to find out the reasons those involved in kidnapping, banditry, and insurgency are doing so. Were they able to listen to some of those being arrested? If they listen to them, then they will be able to find causes as to why they are involved, and from there they can now start talking about finding solutions. I have been saying it from time to time that this government lacks communication skills, and have not found the right way to communicate with Nigerians. This government has not been able to communicate correctly with Nigerians.\n\nTherefore the perception that many Nigerians have about Buhari\u2019s government is that it is not carrying people along, that the government has a hidden agenda, and that it has nepotism in mind. When government involves the people or relates with them in a way that will make them to have confidence in those in authority, then it will be easier to deal with insecurity, and other challenges. It is the people that are living in the local government areas, in the villages, and hamlets. If they see the impact of government coming closer to them, they will be the first chief security officers in their areas.\n\nThey know those who are perpetrating crimes, and they can pass on the vital information about them to those in authority. It is when they are able to work with the local people that it will then be easier to tackle those external forces. But if the internal mechanism is weak, then it will be difficult to contain forces coming from outside. So our leaders must provide that particular strength for Nigerians to feel generally that we are all working together. This can only be done if our leaders put trust in the system, and not for Nigerians to see them as if they are favouring a microscopic few or certain clan in their own community. President Buhari should convene a meeting of past leaders of this country, including other stakeholders like religious and political leaders to advise him on how to tackle insecurity and other challenges. Then the issue of people feeling being marginalised by this government has to be addressed.\n\nAre you saying this government is marginalising Nigerians?\n\nThat is the perception in which people are seeing this administration. People see this APC led government as marginalising Nigerians. Not only that, they see Buhari marginalising Nigerians with impunity. Although the Federal Government has recorded some notable achievements across the country, the negative perception some Nigerians have about this government has overwhelmed its achievements, especially in the area of infrastructural development.\n\nHow would you react to the arrest and on-going trial of the IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho?\n\nNnamdi Kanu sounds intelligent but he is not putting his intelligence into practical condition, and I\u2019m saying it with all level of modesty that our people in the South- East are basically God-given talents to our country. The level of intelligence God has given them is amazing, they are very industrious and you see them in every part of the country. What I expect Kanu to do is to use his intelligence for local politics by trying to field candidates for elective positions in the South-East, and if he has done that I know that he would have won with a landslide. He would also have used that opportunity to reach out to other parts of the country, and today we would have been singing a different song about his leadership. This is what he should have done instead of asking for secession, and putting people\u2019 s lives in danger. But here for him to be asking for secession may plunge Nigeria into another civil war, and this we don\u2019t want. No government will sit and fold its hands when an individual is calling for secession. What I would have advised Kanu to do as an activist myself would have been for him to use the numerical strength he enjoys among his people to transform the South-East. My advise generally on this Kanu and Sunday Igboho issue is that people should gravitate towards a society that will make everybody comfortable, and asking for secession will not guarantee that. If you are asking for secession, you are not asking for governance. But the way government is going about Kanu\u2019s issue is wrong, and the way Kanu is also going about it is wrong, even though it is the right of any Nigerian to champion the cause of his own people.\n\nThe way the government has been handling the issue from the beginning is wrong. If the government has been doing the right thing for the people, people like Nnamdi Kanu and Sunday Igboho would not have come out to agitate against the country. Nor would we have Boko Haram agitating against the country. We are having all these problems because of government\u2019s inefficiency, and ineptitude. As an activist, late Gani Fawehinmi taught us that we don\u2019t run away from our country. I\u2019m a product of late Gani, Balarabe Musa,and Arthur Nwankwo, and we were taught to fight for a united Nigeria, and therefore I will not in any way support secession. Kanu\u2019s trial should however be free and fair, so that there won\u2019t be accusation of witch-hunting. While the Federal Government has the right to defend the sovereignty of this country, so also Kanu has the right to agitate for the rights of his own people but the way he goes about it also matters.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on restructuring? Some say it\u2019s the only way to make Nigeria work while some disagree.\n\nHad it been that our leaders have done the right things, or are doing the right things, there wouldn\u2019t have been all these calls for Restructuring. Those clamouring for restructuring are doing so because of the decay in our socio-economic system. They are doing so because of the structural defects in our political setting. In the past, we\u2019ve organised series of conferences to address some of the issues, but has any of these ever been implemented? No, and this is why calls for restructuring has refused to go away. So what do we do now? The National Assembly, which is calling for the amendment of the constitution, should ask people from the nation\u2019s six geo-political zones to submit documents, and memos stating what their people want. The lawmakers should now debate it, and then implement the wish of the people. They should not doctor memos submitted to them so that what we will have at end of the day will not be a mockery of the whole exercise.\n\nIf they do that, it will not be acceptable to Nigerians. The National Assembly is in a position to make restructuring possible but the problem is that some Nigerians don\u2019t have confidence in the National Assembly, and that\u2019s why they are calling for a brand new constitution. Since we are all working towards achieving the same goal of having a just and united Nigeria, if restructuring will make that goal a reality, then let\u2019s do it. If restructuring is the way out, if it is the panacea to our challenges then let\u2019s have it. And it should be done immediately so that Nigerians will have a sense of belonging, and have a peaceful general election in 2023. If the right people are in the right places, many of these agitations will fizzle away. But if you have a crooked electoral amendment that is not acceptable to the people then the agitations for restructuring will continue. Although we still have some good people in government, we need to have them in larger numbers so that they can overwhelm those who don\u2019t have business in governance. Our ultimate goal as a nation is to ensure that equity, and justice prevail in the country.\n\nThe National Assembly recently voted against electronic transmission of election results. What\u2019s your take?\n\nIt is the worst thing the National Assembly has done to this country. How can you subject INEC to the whims and caprices of the National Communications Commission (NCC) and the National Assembly? INEC has been trying to improve the electoral process, and I give kudos to INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmoud Yakubu and I praise his courage for boldly saying that the election results can be transmitted electronically. The man is saying the truth with what we saw in Edo and Ondo states during the gubernatorial elections there. In Edo State, I was an observer, and I saw INEC doing it. Members of the National Assembly should be ashamed of themselves for saying that there is no network in some of their villages. Which village? If it is money they want to transfer to their villages, won\u2019t they send it? The National Assembly members want to put the country in danger over their position on this issue. The National Assembly members\u2019 action is not only anti-people but also a setback for our democracy. They are being selfish and unpatriotic.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "Seven profitable businesses you can start with N100,000 or less",
          "text": "By Ayo Alonge\n\nAmidst the so-called \u201charsh economy\u201d which has necessitated a poor living condition for most Nigerians, suffice to say that there are still small businesses which can yield an appreciable return on investment (ROI) when viewed against the backdrop of lucrative startups in the country.\n\nHowever, in the day-to-day running of business, players in small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) are often bedeviled by a litany of challenges, ranging from financing to the diminishing purchasing power from the part of prospective buyers, necessitating some entrepreneurs to shift the blame on government at all levels, since they play a major role in the decision of how businesses are run, through certain regulatory processes, with respect to the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA).\n\nMiffed by the economic upheaval which has taken its toll on SMEs, Tochukwu Ubochioma, who owns a printing press startup in Lagos, explained to our correspondent that the challenges faced by startups in the country range from lack of enabling environment and infrastructure to inaccessibility to funds and poor power supply.\n\n\u201cNigeria is one of the world\u2019s leading business locations on the African continent. But when it comes to doing business in Nigeria, there are several challenges that confront a typical Nigerian business. In 2016, out of 189 countries, Nigeria was ranked 169th in the World Bank\u2019s Ease of Doing Business Report.\n\n\u201cFinance and funding is a major aspect of starting or setting up a business. Money is needed to buy materials, suppliers, equipment, pay staff and lots more. In Nigeria, funding is a major problem, especially if an entrepreneur does not have enough money to kick start the business.\n\n\u201cGetting access to constant electricity and power supply is a major concern for business in Nigeria. As of June 2018, an average household in Nigeria can only have access to 6 hours uninterrupted power supply out of the 24 hours that exist in a given day. This is why the use of generators as an alternative power source is so common in Nigeria,\u201d he said. It, however, behoves any wise entrepreneur to invest in ventures that deal in basic humans needs or other essential services, since purchasing power is on a continuous decline, as occasioned by the lingering COVID-19 pandemic and global recession. All things being equal, if your personality speaks of one who is hardworking, focused, passionate and possessing other entrepreneurial skills, a startup of N100,000 or less can, invariably, metamorphose into a much bigger enterprise, in no distant time. Thus, if the golden question that keeps popping up for you is \u2014 what business can I run with N100,000 or less with good profit? \u2014 then, here are some of such ventures, in no particular order.\n\nOne: Food vending\n\nIt is nothing but an absolute truth to assert that, with the necessary managerial skills put in place, one is sure to make good money from this line of business, considering the fact that people eat every day, even if not three times daily.\n\nAside establishing a roadside food stand, suffice to say that with the advent of modern courier services, any investor can choose to connect with residents, workers and students, for food delivery. In most cities, residents often prefer to order food (soup bowls inclusive), in a bid to satisfy a special craving for a particular meal they are too busy to prepare on their own. Similarly, anyone can choose to deal in raw food items. That is lucrative too. For instance, a 50kg bag of rice, when sold in cups, can yield at least 60 per cent return on investment.\n\nTwo: Poultry farming\n\nPoultry farming is one business which makes investors smile to the bank, any day. Despite its attendant challenges, a popular specialist in poultry farming, Rilwan Raji, while speaking with Saturday Sun, said: \u201cFarming business is very profitable. For instance, poultry farming is a business that does not need too much introduction.\n\nThe funniest thing is that it can still be referred to as untapped because the few ones we have in the country are badly managed. It is a highly profitable business. The rate of poultry egg consumption is very high in Nigeria, being one of the cheapest sources of protein. Any farmer who goes into egg business will never regret it. It is another goldmine. Poultry birds processing is another super business in poultry which is still not tapped yet. About 75 per cent of what is consumed is still being smuggled into the country. With the smuggling plus locally produced ones, it still has not met up to 30 per cent of what is required.\u201d\n\nThree: Laundry\n\nWithout a second thought, this is one business that any wise entrepreneur can go into and won\u2019t regret. In major cities, residents are always in dire need of getting their laundry done for them, due to their busy schedule. Hence, every business-minded person may want to explore this business opportunity.\n\nPerhaps one thing that makes the business very interesting is that it yields over 200 per cent return on investment. To get started, one can even make use of one\u2019s spacious residence, get a washing machine and other few equipment which won\u2019t even cost an arm and a leg. Eureka! You are in business already!\n\nFour: Skincare\n\nYet another business one is sure to have a very appreciable profit margin from is the skincare business. In today\u2019s Nigeria, many people, especially females, do not joke with taking care of their skins, using both organic and inorganic skincare products. Tosin Babalola, a seller of organic skincare products in Lagos, who runs her own startup named Finest Beauty Skincare noted: \u201cSkincare business has the tendency to grow wide across this nation, especially if you produce by yourself. With a small amount of money, you can start the business and then you grow it as time progresses. You can start with as low as N100,000 and still make over a 100 percent profit on each product sold. All you need is to produce in small quantity at a time. You also need a clean environment for your production. The necessary equipment needed to start your skincare business are everywhere in the market and quite affordable for any startup.\u201d\n\nFive: Organic drinks production\n\nIncreasingly, people are getting aware of the health implications of carbonated drinks because of the high risk of stroke, diabetes, and high blood pressure. This has caused a constant drift from soft drinks to naturally made drinks and fruit juices, without sugar and additives. So, anyone who goes into production and sales of naturally made drinks now is in it to make a lot of profit. Some examples of naturally made drinks are zobo, kunu, fruit juice, fura da nunu and tiger nut drink. With a N100,000 budget or less, all you need to transform this business idea into a profitable venture is a blender, desired fruits, ingredients, plastic bottles and a refrigerator. If you don\u2019t have a refrigerator yet, you may start with buying blocks of ice. You may then begin to supply your well branded product to malls and local markets.\n\nSix: Palm oil retailing\n\nPerhaps one of the most lucrative businesses that can be started with N100,000 or less is the palm oil retailing business. Yet most people are oblivious of this. Since the price of palm oil fluctuates seasonally, one could buy when it is cheaper in gallons of 20 litres and sell at retail prices during the period of scarcity which automatically results in a hike in price.\n\nSpeaking with our correspondent, a key player in the business, Olumide Adelugba, disclosed that within few months, any investor can cash out not less than 100 per cent return on investment.\n\n\u201cPalm oil business is a very lucrative business. Asides the fact that the business is lucrative, it is also one of the very viable businesses that one can start with as low as N100,000, even less.\n\n\u201cPalm oil business does not have any technicality. For a small scale starter, all you need do is buy a keg of Palm oil from any of the palm oil producing states in Nigeria during the palm oil boom season. Palm oil boom season is between March and June. At this time, 25 litres of palm oil sells for as low as N8,000. With N80,000, you can buy 10 kegs. \u201cThe real deal is that you buy the 10 kegs, store them appropriately for three to five months. By then, the price in the market would have risen by over 100 per cent. The demand for oil is very high. It is one of the most demanded household commodities.\n\nSeven: Phone charging venture\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the fact that unstable power supply has been a key challenge in the country, particularly in most rural communities where people can\u2019t afford acquiring a generator set for personal use, it has become exigent to venture into this line of business.\n\nAll you need to start is a power source, a wide wooden board with lots of electric ports to accommodate as many phones.

          "title": "Aftermath of Igboho\u2019s arrest: Agitation for Yoruba Nation loses steam",
          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nIn the past one month, the agitation for self-determination for Yoruba nation, from all indications, seemed to have lost its steam, as little or nothing has been heard about the struggle.\n\nA lot has happened within the past one month, during which the prominent Yoruba nation agitator, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho, was arrested in Cotonou, Benin Republic, when he attempted to travel to Germany, having escaped from Nigeria. Igboho\u2019s residence was raided in the early hours of July 1, this year by operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) in collaboration with other security agencies. Two persons were killed in Igboho\u2019s house during the operation, while 12 persons were arrested in his house on that day and were taken to Abuja. Since then, DSS took them to court for the first time this week and they have been granted bail with conditions.\n\nIt is also on record that the last Yoruba nation rally that was held at Ojota in Lagos on July 3, this year, was another case that probably weakened the agitation for self-determination for the Yoruba Nation. Dozens among the participants in the rally were arrested, taken to court and granted bail. Some of them were sprayed with hot water by the police and a young girl, Jumoke, was also hit by a stray bullet in front of a shop in Ojota. She died immediately.\n\nInvestigation revealed that the Lagos rally by the agitators was a total departure from what they experienced, even with security agencies when similar rallies were earlier held in Ogun, Oyo, Osun, Ondo and Ekiti States, with active or passive participation of Igboho. There was an insinuation that a number of Yoruba nation agitators might have slowed down on the struggle as a result of an alleged clampdown on them by the Federal Government. The force with which the government went after Igboho, as gathered, sent shivers down the spines of many agitators and they have gone back to the drawing board on how to outwit the government.\n\nIt was further argued that the Federal Government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari is achieving its aim of weakening the agitators.\n\nOpinion polls conducted revealed that the fact that more than 100 groups under the umbrella of Ilana Omo Oodua (IOO), agitating for self-determination Yoruba nation, have not been holding activities like they used to do it before the total clampdown.\n\nBefore the clampdown, there was a fierce and consistent social media agitation for the Yoruba Nation. Apart from that, the agitators, under the leadership of an Emeritus Professor of History, Banji Akintoye, held many rallies and created a lot for awareness for the agitation.\n\nCommunications Manager to Prof Akintoye, Mr. Maxwell Adeleye, was confronted with the arguments. On that allegation that their activities had gone down, he stated: \u201cNo, the agitation has not gone down. In fact, it is becoming more popular. Maybe what you meant by saying going down is because of some special rallies that we held in the past. But agitation is not all about rallies.\n\n\u201cBut you have to watch the body language of the state actors and strategize and re-strategize. You would remember the rally we held at Ojota in Lagos on Saturday July 3 and how the police clamped down on us. This has made us to review our strategies. So, we have changed strategies and nothing has gone down. We are working underground. We have not been holding rallies, but we have been doing house-to-house mobilisation.\u201d\n\nAdeleye stated further that the struggle would not die because Igboho was arrested and because some of the agitators had been purportedly harassed, intimidated and molested by security agencies.\n\nHis words: \u201cHave you seen a struggle that died because of the arrest or death of its leader? If you consider Boko Haram insurgency, when the government killed Yusuf Mohammed, what happened? When the leader of Ogoni people, Ken Saro-Wiwa was killed during the era of the late Gen Sani Abacha, what happened in Niger Delta thereafter? So, the arrest of Igboho has emboldened many Yoruba to continue with the agitation. Then, the harassment of agitators has rather continued to popularise the agitation.\n\n\u201cWe thank the Federal Government for doing the popularisation for us. We want to thank the Federal Government of Nigeria for publicising the Yoruba Nation rallies for us. They thought they are harassing us, but the government is helping us to create more awareness for the Yoruba nation agitation.\u201d\n\nAdeleye further stated that plans were on-going for Igboho\u2019s associates that were arrested and taken to court by DSS in Abuja to perfect their bail conditions before the end of this month. He added, however, that Igboho is in safe hands in Cotonou, even as he refused to comment on the strategies being put in place to rescue him. He said: \u201cWe will not discuss our plans and strategies in the media. But we will be glad to discuss our success stories.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "IBB on Corruption: With the Fact on Ground Now, My Govt a Saint",
          "text": "*Wants next President to be versed in economics, able to talk to the people\n\n*Says military overstrained in war against terrorists\n\nAhamefula Ogbu\n\nFormer military President, Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida has described his regime as a saint, when compared to the level of corruption being witnessed today in the country under a democratic government, and further denied the notion that he popularised corruption in Nigeria.\n\nBabangida, who spoke in an exclusive interview on Arise News Channel yesterday from his Minna Hilltop Mansion, also wants the next Nigerian president to be an acceptable person who has contacts across the country, and given the peculiarities in our economy, should be well versed in economic matters, and be in his 60s in terms of age.\n\nAnswering directly on the allegation that he popularised corruption, Babangida, who was head of state between 1985 and 1993, said: \u201cWell, you can\u2019t compare it with the fact on the ground now. From what I read, from analysis, I think we are saints when compared to what is happening under a democratic dispensation.\n\n\u201cI sacked a governor for misappropriating less than N313, 000; today billions are there in the streets. Those who have stolen billions are in courts, and are now parading themselves on the streets. So, who is better in fighting corruption?\u201d\n\nOn the kind of President Nigeria deserves in 2023, Babangida ruled out former vice president, Atiku Abubakar and a former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, because they would be in their 70s by the next election.\n\nAlthough IBB, as Babangida is fondly called, did not in any way mention their names as ineligible for the nation\u2019s number one seat, he however suggested that individuals in their 60s should be the focus of Nigerians as potential presidential candidates in 2023.\n\nBy the next general election in 2023, Atiku, who is 75 this year, would be 77, while Tinubu, who marked an official 68th birthday in March, would have turned 70 years.\n\nSpecifically on the importance of leadership in nation-building and where he thought the likes of Atiku and Tinubu no longer fit the bill, IBB said: \u201cIf you get a good leadership that links with the people and tries to talk with the people; not talking on top of the people, then we would be okay.\n\n\u201cI have started visualising a good Nigerian leader. That is, a person, who travels across the country, has a friend virtually everywhere he travels to and knows at least one person that he can communicate with.\n\n\u201cThat is a person, who is very verse in economics and is also a good politician, who should be able to talk to Nigerians and so on. I have seen one, or two or three of such persons already in his sixties.\u201d\n\nBut when asked if the person could emerge victorious in the 2023 presidential election, the Minna-born former military leader said, \u201cI believe so, if we can get him.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question on whether or not he still believed in the future of Nigeria, IBB, who turns 80 on August 17, 2021, said: \u201cI do believe in the future of Nigeria, but Nigerians don\u2019t believe in the future of their country. They created and they destroyed.\u201d\n\nReiterating his belief in the future of Nigeria and urging Nigerians to remain patriotic, Babangida, who claimed to feeling good as he was about to turn 80 years, with gratitude to God for sparing his life, advised Nigerians to go for the person that has what it takes to transform the country when the time comes.\n\nHe also stated that the need to avoid a bloody coup, which would have set the country back several decades, informed the annulment of the 1993 Presidential election presumed to have been won by late Moshood Kashimowu Abiola.\n\nBabangida said: \u201cYou want me to be honest with you? If it materialised, there would have been a coup which would have been violent, that\u2019s all I can confirm. It didn\u2019t happen thanks to the engineering and Maradonic way we handled you guys in the society; but that could have given room for more instability in the country.\u201d\n\nProdded further on whether the sentiment was among the military or cut across civilian population, he said, \u201cBoth. The military, they can do it because they have the weapons to do it but the other society members will agitate.\u201d\n\nOn insecurity, he admitted that the military needed to be better equipped, trained and offered improved leadership, adding that \u201cthey are not overwhelmed but overstretched\u201d because of the expansive areas of coverage arising from spread in insecurity.\n\nBabangida regretted that the stultified system of things in the country was due to what he described as tyranny of the elites who had made no efforts to harness the positive qualities naturally embedded in the multi-ethnic composition of the country.\n\nAccording to him, Nigerians are too intelligent, resourceful and hardworking not to be able to pull the country back from the brinks, but regretted that poor leadership had been the bane which had divested the nation of a rallying point.\n\nWhile proffering solution to the myriad problems of the country, he pulled his weight behind resource control but warned that some people who either misunderstood the working principles of the proposition would call for the head of whoever propounds such.\n\nApparently not backing zoning and power shift, he was insistent that unless the country wanted to introduce its own whims and caprices in the practice of democracy, there was need for politicians to allow the principles of democracy, as globally practiced, to choose its leadership, insisting that it would be done now or in the future.\n\nHe argued that with time, people with the finest qualities of leadership, that had popular appeal, would emerge no matter what part of the country such would come from which would be immaterial once things start working fine.\n\nTo him, the economy was being overregulated as he called for freeing it, while arguing that production and export would be the twin redeeming principles for the sliding Naira, pointing out that Nigerians had the capacity to achieve it.\n\nHe denied being anti-media, claiming that he libralised it, leading to the birth of many private media, both print and electronic. He further dismissed as silly, trying to muscle the press as it would be an exercise in futility.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t fear the media, I libralised it, you don\u2019t forget. Today, you have private televisions, private newspapers and so on, so I have no fear of the media; I believe they are an essential part of the society and they should play the role for the society. So, I have no fear of the media whatsoever,\u201d he said.\n\nOn moves to muscle the media, he pointed out: \u201cThe media and the public will not allow that to happen and it is even silly to start trying clipping them. I said Nigerians are very wonderful people, you cannot intimidate them.\u201d\n\nAn ebullient Babangida described the relationship between him and President Buhari, whom he had a hand in his overthrow, as normal and cordial and accused the media of manufacturing a bad relationship between them, adding, \u201cOur relationship is still very good and I am happy we relate good but the seeming bad relationship was the creation of your people the media.\u201d\n\nAppearing unfazed about the agitation for secession he said, \u201cWell, my thoughts are: it is always good to agitate but because there is this belief that this country should be one, when they make the noise, they will find out that it won\u2019t get support because Nigerians don\u2019t generally believe on anything that will disturb their peace of mind.\u201d\n\nOn restructuring, he said it had as many meaning as the number of people speaking on it, adding that there was no general consensus on what it was and how to go about it but opined that it could start with allowing the people at the grassroots to determine and have more participation in how their affairs were run.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says operations now reinvigorated, optimistic about positive results soon\n\nFrancis Sardauna in Katsina\n\nThe Nigerian Army yesterday said it had reinvigorated its operations and strengthened them to enable the troops take the war to the enclaves of insurgents, bandits and other criminals terrorising the country.\n\nThe Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lieutenant-Gen Faruk Yahaya, disclosed this shortly after addressing troops at the Fort Muhammadu Buhari Forward Operating Base, Daura, Katsina State.\n\nHe reiterated that the Nigerian Army would carry out its operational battles to the enemies\u2019 enclaves both in the North-west and North-east where most of their operations were being conducted to pave the way for peace and development to thrive.\n\nWhile admitting that there were challenges afflicting the war against insecurity in the country, the Army chief said with determination and the right efforts by all and sundry, \u201cthe Nigeria security challenges are surmountable.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cThe essence of my visit is to reinvigorate our operations and strengthen them to ensure that the troops take the fight to the enclaves of these criminals and destroy them.\n\n\u201cThat is what we are doing and this is what we will continue to do. For every place that I pass, that is my message. We must carry the battle to the enemies\u2019 enclaves both here in the North-west and even in the North-east where we are conducting them.\n\n\u201cThis is done in synergy with other services and other security agencies and indeed other stakeholders. We are all partners and together with this synergy we will achieve result, like we have seen, it has started gaining ground.\n\n\u201cThere are challenges. Sometimes, you see them, but they are not unsurmountable. With the support we have from the President and Commander-in-Chief, and with the cooperation of other service chiefs, we will get there\u201d.\n\nThe Army Chief called for effective inter-agency collaboration between civil-military and paramilitary organisations to checkmate the activities of the hoodlums within their respective areas of responsibilities in order to ward off insecurity.\n\nThe COAS, who also paid homage to the Emir of Daura, Dr. Umar Faruk Umar, appealed to traditional rulers to support the military and other security agencies by providing actionable intelligence to combat security challenges besetting some parts of the country.\n\nThe Chief of Army Staff explained that traditional and religious institutions had vital roles to play in the fight against insecurity in the country.\n\nHe added that giving security operatives vital and actionable information on the whereabouts and movements of insurgents, bandits and kidnappers would help the authorities in containing the situation.\n\nHe however noted that the worrisome situation in the North-West was already improving, due to steps taken by officers and men of the Nigerian Army in synergy with other security agencies.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe need more cooperation and synergy from other security agencies and relevant stakeholders, particularly traditional and religious institutions as well as community and opinion leaders to curtail or bring to the barest minimum the issue of banditry and kidnapping\u201d.\n\nOn his part, the Emir of Katsina, Dr. Abdulmumini Kabir Usman, while in audience with the Army chief, attributed the spate of insecurity pervading the nation to the activities of informants whom he termed dangerous elements fueling banditry and kidnapping in the state.\n\nThe traditional ruler also opined that lack of credible information sharing and synergy among security personnel \u201care responsible\u201d for the security challenges afflicting the country, especially the North-west region of the country.\n\nThe emir vowed to support the Nigerian Army to achieve the desired goal in its ongoing war against insecurity in the country.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Government is not telling us anything. We had made several attempts to engage government over our children that are still in the hands of bandits but we were turned down. We wanted to know what they are doing to rescue them. Their continued stay with the bandits is not good at all. We as parents are willing to do what the parents of abducted students in other places did if that will make the bandits release our children.\u201d\n\nAnother parent adds: \u201cI think it\u2019s time government engages the bandits. We are worried about our children staying with terrorists for this long. The bandits have not made any demands from us, we wouldn\u2019t know if they are making any demands on government. But we don\u2019t think it is right for government to be silent on our children\u2019s abduction. It\u2019s taken longer than expected; we don\u2019t even know what might have happened to them. We are worried.\u201d\n\nA top Niger State Government official, who spoke to our correspondent under condition of anonymity in Birnin Kebbi, said the federal government \u201cis working with the state government to rescue the students from the bandits. \u201c\n\nThe official adds: \u201cBoth the state and federal governments are working together to secure the students. I think it will not be right, and for security purposes for government, to disclose its strategy on its engagement with the bandits.\n\n\u201cSure the government is working hard to rescue the students from their abductors and I can assure them that soon their children will be reunited with them. They should just keep supporting the government in its efforts to get the students safely back home.\u201d\n\nGovernor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu met with parents at the premises of the school a day after they were taken by the bandits, assuring them that the state and federal governments were collaborating to rescue the students.\n\nThe distraught parents are still waiting for Bagudu to fully actualise his promise.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Dike Onwuamaeze\n\nThe management of Wema Bank yesterday hinted that \u201cit is considering\u201d the acquisition of a fintech firm or a merger with another commercial bank, as part of its growth plans.\n\nSpeaking in Lagos during the company\u2019s half-year 2021 investors/analysts presentation (virtually), the bank\u2019s Deputy Managing Director, Moruf Oseni, said a merger and acquisition (M&A) was part of its plan to ensure organic growth.\n\nOseni said the acquisition \u201cis not limited to the financial sector space.\u201d\n\nOseni said: One of our pillars is inorganic growth. It is either you merge or acquire. It is not limited to acquiring from the Nigerian financial space or with a fintech. We are looking at all possible options this time around\n\n\u201cA merger and acquisition in terms of inorganic growth could be with another financial player in the Nigerian bank or it could potentially be with a fintech or it could be the acquisition of the smaller fintech. But as time goes on, we will engage the market on that.\n\n\u201cWe are looking at all possible options, whether you like it or not, no matter how efficient you are. In this game, we are playing skill to skill, and we also have huge aspirations to scale up in the shortest possible time.\u201d\n\nOseni also announced Wema Bank\u2019s plan to sell shares to existing shareholders to raise additional capital of N40 billion by September.\n\nHe said the capital raise would give the bank an expanded base of business over the coming years to compete favourably in the industry.\n\n\u201cThe rights issuance is expected to hit the market in September, this month of August is for us to have a court-ordered meeting to get shareholders together and agree on the scheme of the arrangement,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the bank would embark on a road show from next week to sensitise shareholder groups and associations on growth plans.\n\nOseni explained that the bank would reduce its shares in issue before embarking on the rights issue to ensure enhanced growth for shareholders.\n\n\u201cWema Bank today has a large number of shares in issuance, but before we float the right issue, we need to get the shareholders to reduce the shares in issue and on the back of that we then issue those rights.\n\n\u201cThis will not change the shareholding structure of the shareholders. We just want to manage the number of shares in issue, and that will impact on our ratios. It makes sense to have more efficient shares in issue before doing the rights issuance,\u201d Oseni said.\n\nHe also said that regulatory cost was among the issues that keep the bank awake at night and explained that Wema Bank \u201cis capable of containing\u201d the regulatory risk: \u201cAre we able to navigate around it? The answer is yes. The whole thing (regulatory risk) is to make sure that the Nigerian economy is bootstrapped and that there is growth in the economy. Our job is to navigate them as they are part of the business.\u201d\n\nThe bank said its operating cost moved from N17.6 billion to N20.8 billion largely due to regulatory costs like AMCON levy and NDIC premium.\n\nOseni said: \u201cThe AMCON levy grew around 50 per cent and the NDIC premium by almost 90 per cent. Between 2019 and 2020 we grew our deposit by almost 50 per cent. We will use revenue to cover the increase caused by regulatory cost. Also, costs were driven by inflation, forex and energy costs.\n\n\u201cWe believe we have started well and will end this year very well. Although the external environment is very tough we believe the opportunities are numerous and will continue to focus on growing our businesses across retail and corporate segments as we continue to execute our three year strategy to capture all the values in it and will continue to play on our digital domain.\u201d\n\nThe Chief Finance Officer of Wema Bank, Mr. Tunde Mabawonku, said during the virtual event, that the bank had started a process that would hopefully grow its capital base to N100 billion.\n\nMabawonku said: \u201cWhen the CRR dropped below 15 per cent the board approved immediate implementation of the bank\u2019s capital management plan to bring shareholders capital from existing N60 billion plus to above N100 billion mark.\u201d\n\nHe also shared insight into the bank\u2019s performance. According to him, the bank\u2019s profit before tax improved from N1.7 billion in half year 2020 to N4.3 billion in 2021 half year, while its total assets crossed the N1 trillion mark and \u201cthe margins are better than this time last year.\u201d\n\nThe chief finance officer also said that the bank had grown its deposit base to N808 billion with hope of reaching N1 trillion deposit mark\n\nHe said: \u201cGrowth is less than N500 billion in the first half of the year. But the interesting thing is that retail deposit has grown by 10 per cent.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Kassim Afegbua, spokesman of Ibrahim Babangida, has given reasons for campaigning against the reelection of Godwin Obaseki, governor of Edo, during the 2020 gubernatorial election in the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview with THE NATION newspaper, Afegbua said he never regretted his decision to work against the Obaseki despite serving together in the same cabinet during the administration of Adams Oshiomhole.\n\n\u201cIn Edo state where I come from, Godwin Obaseki, the current governor, was part of the cabinet where we served under comrade Adams Oshiomhole. When he was brought forward as a gubernatorial candidate, I publicly objected that I was not going to support him in 2016. In 2020, he left the APC for Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) where I belong, and I said no, that the party imposed him on us. I openly campaigned against him. But others would pretend and hide and benefit from the largesse that he\u2019s bringing, I said no,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy own is that the morality of your coming is subject to questioning. Everyone knew I worked assiduously for the opposition party. For me, it\u2019s about the state and not about individuals, and I believe very strongly that members have a role to play in keeping the philosophy and ideology of a political party. If there is an aspirant, and you brought someone because he\u2019s a state governor with state funds to spend, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right thing to do. So I said no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI am consistent. I left the APC because of the same issue in the past. You said you were going to do restructuring, create jobs and all of that, but since you came on board, the country has collapsed right under your feet. So that means you deceived Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAfegbua said joining politics is one of the worst decisions he ever made.\n\n\u201cI have gone through a lot of challenges. I have survived two assassination attempts on my life. Those scenarios were close shaves and I have scars all over my body to show for them. Oftentimes there are still threats because I criticise government for not doing the right thing,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor me, joining politics would rank as one of the worst decisions of my career. I found out that it is not for people of my orientation, but I am already in it.\n\n\u201cIf I tell you half of what I have seen in politics, it will amaze you really. But I\u2019m sure that I will be able to put it all out when I am writing my memoirs. I am a very honest person even if I have to say so myself.\n\n\u201cI remember how the party ditched Donald Duke then. But if you try it here, they will say you are doing anti-party activities. I don\u2019t like to swallow everything hook, line and sinker. And that\u2019s why oftentimes I like to follow the dictates of my conscience, and most times it has led me aright. I\u2019m not materialistic. One thing I have come to realise is that politics is not a vocation for people who are honest.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like shortchanging people.

          "title": "Olumide Soyombo: The journey from startup founder to investment mogul",
          "text": "\u201cWhat turns me off is when someone just tells me they have this idea and they haven\u2019t done anything but want me to invest. I always say you have to take a risk on yourself before anybody can take a risk on you.\u201d\n\nUp until October 2020 when Nigerian fintech startup Paystack was acquired by Stripe for $200m, Olumide Soyombo was still relatively investing in the background. He was mostly known by a few as the co-founder of Bluechip technologies, a company that provided data management solutions to companies.\n\nWhat changed? Word got out that he was one of the earliest investors in Paystack. Beyond that, his investment portfolio showed that he had also invested in over 20 notable startups. As a result of these revelations, requests by others to co-invest along with him increased.\n\nHe tried to keep up with the requests but it soon became impossible to carry others along effectively without setting up a more formal structure. So last week he announced that he was launching Voltron Capital, a pan-African venture capital fund.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of FOMO (fear of missing out). Everybody\u2019s keen on having tech in their portfolio. The whole idea of Voltron was to bring people together to form the \u2018Defender of the Universe\u2019,\u201d he told me.\n\nOver a call, we talked about Soyombo\u2019s early influences, building his company and what he\u2019s most excited about right now.\n\nThe early days\n\nAt first, being a doctor was all Soyombo wanted to be until he was given a personal computer.\n\nHe grew up in the 90s with access to a personal computer and to the internet, at a time when most people didn\u2019t have access to such.\n\n\u201cAt first I wanted to be a medical doctor but in secondary school, I got exposed to using the computer and then I knew I was going to do something in technology.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, he got into the University of Lagos (UNILAG) to study Systems Engineering. Notably, he was part of the first set for the newly launched degree program in UNILAG. The degree was less about computers and more about systems, which equipped him with the ability to oversee and understand the different aspects of a project or a system.\n\nWhile pursuing this degree, he enrolled in professional exams such as MCSE, MCP, CCNA and CCNP and passed them before he was 19. He passed the CCNA exam \u2013 a networking exam \u2013 before even seeing a router.\n\n\u201cThis helped build my profile and knowledge of tech. Back then, tech wasn\u2019t as sexy as this but it was still a profession that many aspired to get into.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarly bird or worm?\n\nAmerican psychologist Adam Grant is credited with saying that while it\u2019s true that the early bird gets the worm, the early worm also gets caught. For Soyombo, was being a part of the pioneer set of a newly created degree a case of the early bird or worm?\n\n\u201cThe good part about being the first set was that a lot of focus was placed on us because they needed the success of the first set to generate more interest in the department. We were one of the few people in the UNILAG at that time that had their lectures delivered via PowerPoint.\u201d Clearly, the case of the early bird here.\n\nAfter his first degree, Soyombo went on to get a master\u2019s degree in business and information technology from Aston Business school. During his time in Aston, he learned how to use technology to solve business problems. Upon completion of his master\u2019s degree, he returned back to Nigeria, where for the next year he was a consultant for a bank that needed to build a data warehouse.\n\nWhile on that job he met his future business partner, Kazeem Tewogbade, who was then the lead consultant on the project.\n\nBuilding solutions for banks and telcos\n\nThe two decided to focus on building data warehouses and business intelligence solutions for banks and telcos. In 2008, they founded Bluechip Technologies which has gone to build those solutions and partnered with a number of companies like Oracle and Microsoft.\n\nAt the core of Bluechip technologies, products is business analytics \u2014 bringing data from disparate sources and building models from that data to help businesses to predict things like customer churn, lifetime value of the customer and help the business make better decisions. The company also provides enterprise solutions like voucher management systems that the telcos use.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re buying any airtime from one of the telcos, it\u2019s likely running from one of our solutions. We are basically just looking for problems within businesses and solving them with technology.\u201d\n\nBluechip Technologies is in its 13th year and has expanded beyond Nigeria to four other African countries \u2014 Kenya, DRC Congo, Zambia and Ghana.\n\nWhat has been the driving force behind this growth and expansion? Referrals.\n\n\u201cReferrals are the building blocks for success in the B2B world. For example, we deliver a data warehouse in bank A, when the chief information officer leaves there and goes to bank B, he remembers that we delivered a project successfully for him and he reaches out to us. The price of failure in enterprise startups is high. If you fail on a large project you\u2019re out. So everyone tries to rely on a vendor who can deliver consistently.\u201d\n\nEvery business faces competition. Despite many competing companies coming into the business intelligence space, Soyombo believes the market is big enough for others to come in.\n\n\u201cSometimes people say, when someone says the market is big enough you shouldn\u2019t listen to them, but in this case I can tell you that we can\u2019t do everything ourselves. The market is truly big enough.\u201d\n\nLife outside of work\n\nCredit: Olumide Soyombo\n\nWhen he\u2019s not working, Soyombo can be found at the Lagos Polo Club, where he\u2019s the social secretary. He doesn\u2019t play but enjoys watching others play \u2014 there\u2019s a Bluechip polo team that competes during tournaments \u2014 and meeting new people.\n\nThe world of investing in startups\n\nIn 2014, when Soyombo and his business partner Tewogbade noticed the buzzing tech scene in Lagos, backed the increase in internet penetration and clusters of talents in Yaba, they knew they had to be a part of it.\n\nSo they created Leadpath as an investment vehicle to invest in startups, at first the approach was to invest $25,000 \u2013 $100,000 in local tech startups, similar to the Y-combinator accelerator model. But this didn\u2019t work out as planned, as there were no other investors to further invest in the companies.\n\nThey ditched the accelerator model and started investing individually as angel investors. And finally, in 2021 Voltron Capital was launched to bridge the gap of angel investing between his corporate friends and colleagues who have not typically invested in tech and startups that need their money.\n\nAs an influential figure in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem, Soyombo has access to almost any important deal in the market but he\u2019s had to pass up on a few.\n\nHe could have invested in Flutterwave but decided not to because of a personal relationship with one of the founders of Paystack.\n\n\u201cSometimes you put personal relationships with super founders ahead of personal financial gain.\u201d\n\nAnother investment opportunity he passed up on was that of a new startup whose founder didn\u2019t handle the winding down of his previous company well. The bitter taste of how the founder handled the first company didn\u2019t allow Soyombo to invest in the second company.\n\nWhen he thinks about the future, Soyombo is excited about the fact that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting seeing that employees, former product leads and engineers, from maturing startups are going on to start their own companies because they\u2019ve seen how things work in high growth companies. Mono\u2019s founder is ex-paystack, Brass\u2019 founder is ex-paystack and Kudi. Now think about what the current employees in different logistics, eCommerce and healthtech companies would build in the next few years.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s MTN Group has repatriated its last year\u2019s dividend of around $280 million (R4.2 billion) from its local unit in Nigeria. The company reported the payout on Monday during the release of preliminary financial results for the six months to June 30, 2021.\n\nThe funds from Nigeria are part of approximately $650 million (R9.3 billion) in cash the pan-African telecoms giant returned from its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Johannesburg-based group had been struggling to get dividends out of its subsidiaries due to the challenges of securing foreign currency in Nigeria and some other markets where it operates.\n\nAs a result, MTN was forced to suspend dividend payout for the 2020 financial year. The company also cited other reasons for the suspension, such as the timing of proceeds from an ongoing asset realisation programme (ARP) and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnnounced in March 2019, the ARP seeks to simplify the group\u2019s portfolio, reduce debt and improve returns. Over a three-year period, the programme is expected to bring in proceeds of at least R15 billion ($1 billion).\n\n\u201cCash upstreaming from Nigeria remained challenging in terms of securing foreign currency in the market. During 2020, we upstreamed the equivalent of approximately R286 million from Nigeria, with approximately R4.2 billion yet to be repatriated as of 31 December 2020,\u201d the company said back in March.\n\nThe group has now fully secured its cash dividend from Nigeria, in what is one of the two positive developments concerning MTN that will come as a relief to shareholders.\n\nRespite in U.S. court case\n\nIn addition to the news from Nigeria, MTN also revealed \u201cpositive developments\u201d in a United States court case related to the group and its subsidiaries, MTN Afghanistan and MTN Dubai.\n\nAccording to the company, the magistrate assessing complaints of alleged violations of U.S. anti-terrorism regulation had recommended the dismissal of the case.\n\nThe Group had argued that the court has no jurisdiction over the company given it does not operate in the U.S. It also claims the complaint \u201cdoes not allege any conduct by MTN defendants that violated the Anti-Terrorism Act.\u201d\n\nAfter the news of repatriating money from Nigeria and progress in the U.S. court case, MTN shares reportedly finished 6% higher on Monday at R111.30 (around $7).\n\nThe group\u2019s complete half-year results are expected to be released on August 12 and it has told investors to expect between 75% to 85% drop in profit or earnings per share (EPS). This is due to an impairment charge involving its Yemeni business and the decoupling of its operation in Syria.\n\nThe sale of MTN Group\u2019s 75% stake in MTN Syria is part of ongoing attempts to exit markets in the Middle East over the next three to five years, with a plan to fully focus on core African markets.\n\nMTN plans to raise about R15 billion ($1 billion) from shareholding sales in markets outside Africa, proceeds which will be used to reduce its huge debt of nearly R50 billion ($3.5 billion) for the year to December 2020 as well as allocate more capital investments in Africa by 2025.\n\nIn Nigeria, MTN, through its local unit, has earmarked \u20a6600 billion ($1.5 billion) over the next three years to expand broadband access in Africa\u2019s most populous economy.\n\nMobile subscribers decline in Nigeria\n\nFor MTN Nigeria, half-year 2021 results show that service revenue increased by 24.1% year-on-year, despite the number of its mobile subscribers declining by 7.6 million (nearly 10%).\n\nIn December 2020, Nigerian authorities ordered telecom companies to suspend the sale of SIM cards (until April this year). The directive was part of efforts to verify the identities of all mobile subscribers, who were asked to link their phone numbers with national identity numbers.\n\n\u201cOperationally, our mobile subscribers closed H1 at 68.9 million, down 9.9% from December 2020. This was due to the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations, which was lifted on 19 April 2021,\u201d MTN Nigeria\u2019s CEO, Karl Toriola, said on an analyst call.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile user numbers fell, MTN Nigeria company managed to increase service revenue to \u20a6790.3 billion (about R27 billion, $1.9 billion) driven by a surge in data usage.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 27.6% to \u20a6417.2 billion ($1 billion) while transaction volume for mobile money increased by 280.8% year-on-year to 55.6 million. Its total MoMo active subscribers reached 6.1 million.\n\nMTN Nigeria aims to sustain \u201cdouble-digit service revenue growth ahead of inflation, driving 4G and rural network expansion,\u201d Toriola said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Can mobile applications help solve Africa's healthcare access problem?",
          "text": "In 2019, Abubakar Yusuf saw his medical condition deteriorate rapidly. The 43-year old carpenter in Nigeria\u2019s Borno State has been suffering from Malaria and experiencing a deadly mix of fever, chills, headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n\u201cI would go to the only public health centre in the area but I just don\u2019t think I can wait. There\u2019s likely going to be 20 or 30 people before me and they often attend those that arrived first. So there\u2019s no guarantee I will even see a doctor on time.\u201d\n\nAfter staying indoors for days, the bedridden Yusuf was visited by one of his closest clients who eventually told him about a mobile app that can help him find a doctor and get easy access to treatment.\n\nHe downloaded Zuri Health, booked an appointment for the day after with one of the doctors listed on the platform, and received confirmation by SMS. Through the app, Yusuf was instructed to take some initial measures to help alleviate his condition after which he met with the doctor with a wait time of just 10 minutes. He recovered fully a week later.\n\nYusuf is a fictional figure but his predicament is as real \u2013 for many Africans \u2013 as Zuri Health is. Without discovering the mobile app, he could easily have been one of the more than 400,000 Africans malaria killed in 2019.\n\nAfrica carries a disproportionately high share of the global burden of deaths from diseases: in the same year, the continent accounted for a troubling 94% of all malaria cases and deaths. Approximately 1.6 million Africans died of tuberculosis, malaria, or HIV-related illnesses in 2015 alone.\n\nWhat is even more worrisome is the fact that with proper medication, these diseases can be prevented, treated, or even cured. But there\u2019s a well-documented lack of access to healthcare in Africa.\n\nLess than 50% of people in Africa can access modern health facilities and 80% rely on the chronically underfunded public health services, which suffer from a shortage of everything from drugs to power blackouts.\n\nZuri Health mobile app.\n\nMobile-based healthcare to the rescue\n\nA number of startups have come up with innovative ways to solve the key challenge of accessing healthcare in Africa using technology. One such is Zuri Health, a relatively new player in the continent\u2019s nascent telemedicine (the use of digital devices such as mobile devices and computers to deliver health care) space.\n\nZuri Health is a mobile application that gives patients the opportunity to chat with a doctor, buy medication from a pharmacy, book labs and diagnostic tests or have a doctor visit them at home.\n\nThe company launched in Kenya earlier this year and aims to provide affordable and accessible healthcare solutions via mobile technology with dedicated apps, wap, and SMS services.\n\n\u201cZuri Health is very personal to me,\u201d said founder and CEO Ikechukwu Anoke, in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThe app is named after my daughter, Zuri, who was born in 2012. Despite being at one of the best hospitals in Kenya, we could not get a doctor to attend to my wife on time while she was in labour.\u201d\n\nThe incident made Ikechukwu realise that even if an individual could afford medical care, the distribution and logistics of healthcare in the country still posed a challenge. But it wasn\u2019t until eight years later, when he himself had a life-threatening experience in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, that he started working on Zuri.\n\n\u201cI had personal health issues before the pandemic which made me even more vulnerable to the virus. With an underlying health problem in a Covid environment, it was vital to think about the provision of healthcare in a different way,\u201d Ikechukwu recalled.\n\nWith most hospitals shut and doctors unavailable in the heat of the pandemic, he says telemedicine and remote care became extremely important at that point.\n\n\u201cIt made sense to build an app through which people could get basic tests done without leaving the comfort of their home and further risk their lives. If we had known earlier, maybe we would have built apps and launched them during the pandemic. The experience of Covid helped what we\u2019ve built today.\u201d\n\nZuri Health launched a beta version in November 2020 and rolled out officially in Nairobi two months later. Since January, Zuri has onboarded more than 250 doctors, who earn extra income from the service they provide, onto its platform.\n\nArthur Ikechukwu Anoke and Daisy Isiaho, co-founders of the mobile app, Zuri Health.\n\nThe opportunity to chat with a doctor and receive diagnoses remotely helps thousands of subscribers that currently use the application save transportation and other logistical costs while receiving necessary medical care.\n\n\u201cZuri Health gives doctors a wider and easier platform to reach patients who need them while the underserved populace can now access affordable and sustainable healthcare,\u201d Ikechukwu said.\n\nThe company, at the end of July, launched an updated version of its app, called Zuri 2.0, which comes with improved features.\n\nZuri Health has also secured partnerships in multiple African countries, which is expected to pave the way for a planned continental expansion. Over the next few months, Zuri wants to enter other markets \u2013 including Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Zambia, Cote D\u00cdvoire, Mozambique, Angola, and Senegal.\n\nAfrica\u2019s e-health industry on the rise\n\nIncreasing mobile penetration and a thriving tech startup scene give hopes that technology can make a big impact in improving access to medical care in Africa.\n\nThe continent is slowly witnessing a proliferation of healthcare apps, which include South Africa\u2019s Hello Doctor, ChanjoPlus and M-Tiba in Kenya, Benin Republic\u2019s GoMedical, and mTrac in Uganda; and more recently, Zuri Health.\n\nThere are clear signs of a coming explosion in the use of mobile technologies in African healthcare similar to the one that\u2019s been seen in financial services. However, recurring key challenges still need to be addressed.\n\nPrevailing issues such as prohibitive smartphone costs for Africans, the majority of which live on less than $1.90 a day, could pose as barriers to the uptake of digital health. Phone penetration in the region stands at just 44% compared to the global average of 66%.\n\nThere is also a large rural-urban digital divide with the greater part of rural Africa suffering from low connectivity and low levels of digital literacy among dwellers in such areas.\n\nFixing healthcare is beyond just tech\n\nHealth sectors in Africa stand to benefit hugely from digital solutions. But more than just the technology is needed for these innovations to scale and make a significant impact across the continent.\n\nThe increasing number of apps that aim to make healthcare widely accessible have to be integrated into public healthcare systems and national health strategies. This is where support from the government is needed.\n\nBeyond just funding, public authorities have to come up with inclusive telemedicine or mobile health (mHealth) policies that address regulatory and data governance issues. Governmental policies will help hold digital healthcare companies accountable and protect the information and data of citizens that use the technologies.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAs the field of mHealth matures, effective policy will become increasingly important, according to a World Health Organisation report.\n\n\u201cThere is an urgent need to drive more meaningful conversations in relation to frameworks around telemedicine because in Africa very few countries have these. Yet it\u2019s fundamental if we should achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,\u201d said Daisy Isiaho, Zuri Health Co-founder and Chief Product Officer.\n\nWhile thousands of Africans like Yusuf continue to have their lives saved by mobile health applications, going forward, governments will have to \u201cplay an active role through regulation and setting up legal frameworks in the growing telemedicine space.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

All musings are hers and not attributable to TechCabal or any organisations she is serving, working or affiliated with.\n\nFirst of all, introduction\n\nIt has taken many years for me to put pen to paper \u2013 in this form. Why? Well I focused and hoped \u2018those\u2019 who have the expertise, the skills to write etc, etc, etc would get round to doing this. But\u2026the impactful change one seeks truly does begin with one. So here goes\u2026\n\nI write as I speak \u2013 painting pictures with words, sometimes rambling and stopping at bus stops to share an extra nugget, insight or to detour completely. And sometimes I will enter the rabbit hole of writing in formal academic language to address a specific issue.\n\nYou see, this \u2018column\u2019, my writing is not your typical treatise or intellectual exposition on the what, why and how of policy making in the digital economy. It\u2019s a peek into my perfectly imperfect policy wonk mind. A sharing of my thoughts in progress around shenanigans in this space \u2013 the good, bad and ugly.\n\nMusings.\n\nMy goal? Tripartite (that means in three parts!). First is to let the words out of my head beyond when I take the \u2018stage\u2019 and speak to a select few who know; second is to normalize conversations on policy implications of all the innovations happening \u2013 and if just 0.1%, get more innovators thinking on this before and when they hit the market! Third, and for me the most important is to bring this discourse to you \u2013 the end user, the customer, the target of all these innovations. So you understand, get it \u2013 and use the power to influence in an informed way. You see that latter? Well You have the power to be the instigator of the change you want to see.\n\nSo here goes: this first piece is like a get to know you more, more information gathering before a possible first date (I hope we make it to the latter ;-))\n\nBefore we go on though \u2013 what is Policy making? Again no assumptions made right?\n\nSee, Policy making is far from \u2018sexzy\u2019 work \u2013 except for wonks like me :-). It is typically a long and arduous \u2018figuring out\u2019, drafting, negotiations, convincing and consensus building. In plain english: It takes a good amount of time to get close to having the right policy backed by law \u2013 from development to influencing process to adoption, influencing, implementation and then impact tracking (and its measurement).\n\nThe policy making process\n\nIt can seem like it\u2019s overnight, that hardly the case \u2013 but it does happen. [For instance, the Murambatsvina policy and the \u2018look East\u2019 policy in Zimbabwe]. The thing you don\u2019t know, having not paid attention or invested time, resources or built a network, is that it\u2019s likely been brewing under the surface (think lava, volcano eruption; or an underlying like that catches you unawares). Or you have done all this yet still\u2026\n\nLet\u2019s make this practical\u2026use our imaginations (for some reading this is a reality I know).\n\nImagine: You are a startup in some city or town in a tier 2 African country. You practice some solid frugal innovation and come up with a needed product and or service. You worked hard (alone or with a small team) and hit the market. You have a frugal marketing and reputation building strategy that harnesses the power of social media across jurisdictions. You begin to see a return on investment, just a trickle at first and then it steadily (or maybe not \u2013 dips are normal!) and then wham! The government \u2018sees\u2019 you.\n\nJisoos!\n\nWell that imaginning is a reality lived by many businesses across our continent \u2013 in these times seemingly targeting Tech enabled StartUps. The world more than ever before is at terms with the fact that digitisation is important for the growth of the economy and society. For the economically disparate economies on our continent however it seems players are working in different directions \u2013 albeit looking to reach the same goal of a thriving digital economy, apart. With the Covid-enabled growth of the last 18 months these \u2018high IQ toddler\u2019 businesses have faced stiff regulatory actions and inconsistent policies, \u2013 regardless of the intentions behind them. This at a time when African startup ecosystem is garnering global recognition and investor confidence.\n\nHere are a few examples of shifts in policy based on laws (sometimes not!) across our continent in the last 18 months.\n\nFintech in Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya\n\nNigeria\u2019s technology sector was its second-fastest-growing sector from Q1 2018 to Q4 2019. A look at the well appraised Nigerian fintech sector reveals the recently released regulatory directory of the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which states that \u201cby the provisions of Sections 67-70 of the Investments and Securities Act (ISA), 2007 and Rules 414 & 415 of the SEC Rules and Regulations, only foreign securities listed on any Exchange registered in Nigeria may be issued, sold or offered for sale or subscription to the Nigerian public. Accordingly, CMOs who work in concert with the referenced online platforms are hereby notified of the Commission\u2019s position and advised to desist henceforth.\u201d\n\nThe South African Reserve Bank\u2019s (SARB) cautious attitude towards virtual currencies like Bitcoin, as stated in Article 5.1 in its Position Paper on Virtual Currencies NPS 02/2014 that \u2018the Bank does not oversee, supervise or regulate the VC (virtual currencies) landscape, systems or intermediaries for effectiveness, soundness, integrity or robustness. Consequently, any and all activities related to the acquisition, trading or use of VCs (particularly DCVCs) are performed at the end-user\u2019s sole and independent risk and have no recourse to the Bank.\u2019\n\nIn 2015 Central Bank of Kenya(CBK) with regard to the legal status of virtual currencies, issued a public notice cautioning the public that \u201cBitcoin and similar products are not legal tender nor are they regulated in Kenya. The public should therefore desist from transacting in Bitcoin and similar products\u201d. On 18 December, 2015 the CBK again issued Banking Circular No 14 of 2015, which cautioned, \u2018all financial institutions against dealing in virtual currencies or transacting with entities that are engaged in virtual currencies. Financial institutions are expressly advised not to open accounts for any person dealing in virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. Failure to comply with this directive would lead to appropriate remedial action from the Central Bank\u2019.\n\nJust like South Africa, Kenya also has no specific legal framework tailored specially for its Fintech sector. One therefore sees the fintech sphere being regulated by a variety of statutes and rules governing various financial products, services and market participants, as well as other provisions of more general application.\n\nThe lack of specifically tailored regulations to govern the fintech sector, seen in Kenya and South AFrica, leaves regulators at each point, responding to issues that arise individually. This leaves a gap for potential conflicts in regulating fintech, and reveals a situation where the regulatory environment would keep lagging behind technology.\n\nThe ban by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) negatively impacted thousands of Nigerians who have lately been drawn by technology to investing in foreign securities. Untoward hardship to fintech platforms such as Bamboo, Trove, and Risevest who work with local and foreign brokerage firms in allowing Nigerians to invest and trade in stocks listed on the Nigerian and foreign stock exchanges.\n\nLogistics policies in Nigeria\n\nThe Lagos State Government on 27 January 2020 enforced a regulatory ban which restricted the operation of commercial bikes and tricycles on major roads within the state, stating that \u201cafter consultations with stakeholders, the State Security Council, in compliance with the extant Transport Sector Reform Law 2018, has decided to commence enforcement of the law which bans the operation of Okada and Keke in six Local Government Areas and nine Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs)\u201d. This ban forced unplanned pivots and total shutdowns of services for hitherto thriving local organisations like Gokada and ORide. The regulatory blizz also extended to the regulation of online ride-hailing companies like Uber and Bolt with the enforcement of the requirement for a service entity regulatory permit provisional application/renewal \u2013 \u20a610 million licence fee for service entities with 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; \u20a625 million for those with more than 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; with the provisional license subject to an annual renewal with a renewable fee of \u20a65 million for every 1000 and \u20a610 million for every 1001 and above unit of e-hailing taxi. It also mandated that 10% of every transaction by the passenger to the ride-hailing operators must be paid to the state government. At the national level the new guideline for the regulation of logistics and courier companies which increased the license fees for logistics companies and courier services was also approved on July 23, 2020. The amount mandated as licensing and renewal fees is shocking, as it creates an impediment for most players in the sector, who are mostly struggling MSMEs without the economic wherewithal to afford the fees.\n\nAn immediate implication of the ban of commercial bikes and tricycles was the drastic unemployment it resulted in across a broad base of lagos. Unemployment directly correlates to an upsurge in crimes and insecurity.\n\nData and Infrastructure in South Africa and Kenya\n\nThe draft National Policy on Data and Cloud which is generally aimed at \u201cexploiting opportunities presented by the digital economy, through the development of policy frameworks that harness the economic and social potential of data and cloud computing\u201d was recently released (April 1 2021) .\n\nThe Draft Data Protection (General) Regulations 2021 of Kenya also introduces data localisation, while among other provisions, requiring countries or territories to which personal data is transferred, to have ratified the African Union Convention on CyberSecurity and Personal Data Protection. This provision apart from restricting the free flow of data needed for a digital economy to thrive, includes a requirement for ratification of a convention which Kenya itself is yet to ratify.\n\nAlthough the goal of the policies might be applauded, their restriction on cross-border transfer of data through local storage and processing of data is capable of affecting productivity and innovation, and ousting the countries\u2019 startups.\n\nDigital Tax policies in South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda and Kenya\n\nSouth Africa was the first, in 2014, to tax digital services by imposing a 14% value added tax (VAT) on digital imports. Several African countries have since followed its steps.\n\nThe Nigerian Finance Act for instance imposes 5% VAT on online transactions.\n\nIn Uganda 74% of businesses reported a reduction in earnings following the imposition of digital tax \u2013 excise duty on over-the-top services over the internet \u2013 in the country. This same proposal for digital tax was only shut down by the Benin Government after a peaceful protest was staged by its people.\n\nIn 2013, the National Treasury of Kenya introduced a 10% excise duty on money transfer services.\n\nGovernments rightly claim taxing digital services helps to raise revenue for ailing economies \u2013 totally plausible IF funds raised were channeled into providing infrastructure and enabling more innovation. This has not been the case however \u2013 digital tax policies and laws have mainly been used to restrict digital activity of citizens, infringing on their digital rights.\n\nSo why should YOU care, I hear you ask? This long story, we know all about it \u2013 it\u2019s not stopping bread from getting to my table.\n\nQuestion is: is it not?\n\nFrom an increased cost in basic services you have come to take for granted \u2013 from hailing a bike by app, phone call or on the side of the road to the inability to afford to continue to feed your family with premium turkey or listen to your favourite artiste due to new Copyright rules that don\u2019t support Fair Use principles.\n\nWhy? Because hey you can no longer ride uber at an affordable rate (Hi, Hackney permit), through to it getting harder to shop for that item from Senegal since the taxes on it are higher (that\u2019s if the customs barriers are surmounted by AfCFTA) and it becoming significantly harder (if at all possible) for you to get timely help by raising a social media cry for help.\n\nSo you see, it matters. It touches you. Not just the \u2018big businesses\u2019 or the start ups \u2013 You. As Nigerians like to say, \u201c\u2026 o di kwa serious?!\u201c\n\nOver the next few \u2018musings\u2019 I will ponder on what we should be prioritising and why. If the data allows and my brain strings the words I will project on the impact \u2013 possibly speak to the future.\n\nTill next time \u2013 keep musing \ud83d\ude09\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Cabal | Author @techcabal",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It also plans to train and connect them with their dream jobs and funding.\n\nKepple Africa and Timon Capital led the round, with investments from Paul Kokoricha \u2014 ACA Managing Partner \u2014 and Tokyo-based UNITED Inc.\n\nAdditionally, it has raised a $25 million student loan financing facility. The funding was made possible by a partnership between the financier, Sterling Bank, and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nThe startup claims to operate as an intersection of edtech, fintech, and the future of work. It specialises in software and mobile application development, website creation, UX design, and product marketing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFounded in 2018 by Chika Nwobi (CEO), Decagon trains and connects engineers to work remotely with local and international companies.\n\nPer TechCrunch, Nwobi said that tech giants like Microsoft, Facebook, and Google have established engineering offices in Nigeria. Decagon helps companies unable to afford such offices to reach top talent willing to work as remote engineers.\n\nThe startup runs a six-month paid software engineering programme that costs $4,000.\n\nHowever, if the trainees cannot afford the programme, student loan financing will cover the cost. Students who choose this option are expected to repay approximately $6,000 over three years.\n\nThis allows the company to offer a Pay-After-Learning plan that includes laptops, housing, Internet, meal allowance, and a stipend. According to the company, no upfront payment is required.\n\nDecagon claims to be the first in Nigeria to provide students with such merit-based loan financing. It also claims to have accepted 440 candidates from a pool of 80,000 applicants for its programme.\n\nNwobi stated that the company has a 100% placement rate for its trainees, a 100% loan repayment rate, and a 410% salary increment made by its software engineers after placement.\n\nThe IT company plans to address the global underrepresentation of black people in the tech space, beginning with Nigeria. It also wants to promote gender inclusion by increasing female participation in its cohorts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe funding will also be used to scale the company\u2019s efforts in edtech, fintech, and the future of work.\n\nReacting to Nwobi\u2019s claim that Decagon, a tech talent catalyst, is sustainable and growing at a rate of 500% per year, Timon Capital Partner, Chris Muscarella, said they are excited to collaborate with Decagon to identify and connect with vetted engineering talent in Africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, Africa has gradually become home to exciting innovations. Startups, raising capital in billions, are birthing disruptive models across sectors, and global tech giants are extending their tentacles to the untapped markets in the continent.\n\nSeamless connectivity is essential to help businesses and individuals reap the rewards of the disruptions happening across the continent. Still, the lack of the required infrastructure to effect this has caused slower growth in Africa.\n\nAs of March 2021, Africa had a 37.42% average Internet penetration with wide gaps between juggernauts like Kenya at 85% and smaller countries like Eritrea at 6.9%.\n\nA map showing Internet penetration rates in Africa. Hover your mouse on each country map to see the numbers\n\nIn the early 2000s, Africa\u2019s policymakers made significant strides to tackle this issue, but the game changed in 2009 with the launch of the MainOne cable on the West African coast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPropelled by CEO Funke Opeke\u2019s passion for connecting Africa to the Internet, MainOne\u2019s feat initiated a boost to Internet speeds that seemingly aided the proliferation of startups and tech-enabled businesses in Nigeria, one of Africa\u2019s most developed tech ecosystems.\n\nRecognising another apparent gap, the company subsequently launched a series of data centre facilities, through its subsidiary, MDXi, in Lagos, Nigeria, to support the myriad of businesses popping up in the nation\u2019s commercial capital.\n\nMainOne is not resting on its laurels, as MDXi announced its data centre facility expansion to Appolonia City in Greater Accra, Ghana.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering, data centres are facilities that house computer systems and other components like telecommunications and storage systems.\n\nLike fibre optic cables, and base transceiver stations (telecom masts), data centres are a critical part of the global Internet infrastructure.\n\nThese centres process large amounts of data and host websites, manage emails, and even help instant messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram run effectively. Data centres are grouped in tiers, with tier 1 being the simplest and Tier 4 being the most advanced.\n\nA 2020 researchandmarkets.com report titled Data Center Market in Africa \u2013 Industry Outlook and Forecast 2021-2026 reveals that Africa has invested up to $2 billion in data centres and will reach $5 billion by 2026.\n\nThe report argues that the rise in data traffic caused by COVID-19 will further increase African businesses and governments\u2019 demand for data centres.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, few African countries are cloud-ready, considering constraints from a lack of inland and submarine fibre and power availability.\n\nResearchandmarkets.com states that economic heavyweights like Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Egypt, and Ethiopia will witness significant growth in data centre activities. Still, several countries with those constraints could miss out on this growth.\n\nSo what\u2019s the attraction in Ghana?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMainOne\u2019s data centre launch in Ghana\n\nMainOne\u2019s past initiatives suggest launching its data centre in Ghana as a natural progression that aligns with its connectivity ambitions.\n\nIn 2019, the company launched its second data centre \u2014 the first outside Nigeria \u2014 in Ivory Coast, one of West Africa\u2019s major economic hubs. Through this move, MainOne solidified its intention to oil the engine of Ivory Coast\u2019s digital economy.\n\nIn an exhaustive chat with Techpoint Africa in July 2020, Funke Opeke hinted that MainOne would be expanding its data centre footprint to Shagamu, Ogun State \u2014 Nigeria\u2019s second most industrialised state \u2014 and other West African countries.\n\nTrue to her words, MainOne has seemingly set its sights on Ghana.\n\nBacked by a large population, a vast economy, and increasing digitisation, Nigeria has grabbed the major headlines for West Africa\u2019s tech-related activities.\n\nHowever, past events also suggest that African tech companies planning to expand nearly always have Ghana in their sights. Recent examples include Nigeria\u2019s GIG Logistics and Cars45, and Kenya\u2019s Quickbus.\n\nWhy?\n\nGhana is West Africa\u2019s second-largest economy, and about 57% (17.6 million) of its 31 million population are below the age of 25, while over 14 million out of 18 million adults are literate. The country is home to startups like mPharma, Jetstream, Bace Group, OZ\u00c9 , and Nvoicia.\n\nIn 2019, Google launched its 5th Artificial Intelligence (AI) lab in Accra, Ghana and in 2021, Twitter surprisingly chose Ghana to launch its first African office.\n\nBesides, the Ghanaian government recently started introducing forward-thinking digital projects.\n\nFollowing the pandemic\u2019s onset, in July 2020, it began building a digital template for elections using the African Union\u2019s proprietary technology \u2014 the PanaBIOS online platform.Seven months later, in February 2021, it piloted a regulatory innovation sandbox for financial services companies.\n\nAs recently as June 2021, it commenced West Africa\u2019s first digital census.\n\nSuch digital activity requires fast and reliable Internet access, which is only possible with the presence of basic and advanced telecommunications infrastructure.\n\nWhat does Ghana\u2019s Internet space look like?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPer Speedtest\u2019s global Internet index, Ghana currently has the fastest fixed broadband speeds in Africa at 51.93 Mbps, ahead of South Africa (47 Mbps) and Egypt (42 Mbps).\n\nThe Speedtest Global Index is a service owned by Ookla, a US-based Internet analytics company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhana has the fastest broadband speeds in West Africa. It, alongside Cote d\u2019Ivoire, and Senegal, lead the region by a wide margin.\n\nHowever, just 0.3% of Ghana\u2019s population has access to fixed broadband services, hinting at low adoption.\n\nFor mobile Internet, the numbers are slightly different. Internet World Stats reveals that, in December 2020, Ghana had a 46.5% mobile Internet penetration rate. While this is higher than the continental average of 37.42%, it falls behind 27 other African countries.\n\nAs of January 2021, Ghana reportedly has 15.7 million registered mobile Internet users. It, however, only has a mobile Internet speed of 13.8 Mbps.\n\nWhile Internet penetration has been increasing, Ghana\u2019s 79th and 132nd positions globally for fixed broadband and mobile Internet show there\u2019s significant room for improvement. Like other African countries, infrastructure remains a major challenge.\n\nHow Africa has improved its Internet speeds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA glut of Internet cables in Africa. Source:\n\nDespite immense growth in recent years, several Africans still don\u2019t have access to the Internet. The continent has the slowest Internet speeds and the highest costs relative to income. This gap has presented opportunities and challenges.\n\nSince MainOne\u2019s cable launch, other submarine cables have landed in Africa to give it a combined capacity of 100 terabits, and upcoming initiatives from Google and Facebook could add 280 terabits. Still, cables are only one layer as several other challenges plague African countries.\n\nCountries like Nigeria and Kenya have taken it a step further by improving the usage of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs).\n\nPer the Internet Exchange Society, websites load slowly in Africa since several of them have servers outside the continent. Encouragingly, local IXPs resolve this problem by lowering the cost and latency of accessing content from foreign websites.\n\nBetween 2012 and 2020, Nigeria and Kenya have localised 70% of Internet traffic through local IXPs, which has helped them save a combined $46 million. Other African countries have seemingly not witnessed as much success.\n\nCould MainOne push Ghana even further?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nSince Ghana decentralised its telecom sector in the late 90s, MTN, Vodafone, and Airtel have provided healthy competition to drive Internet adoption.\n\nHowever, MainOne plans to take this a step further. The newly launched data centre will offer open access connectivity options to Ghana\u2019s leading telecom operators and direct access to the MainOne cable and other submarine cable systems.\n\nIt also offers access to Internet exchanges like the GIX (Ghana), IXPN (Nigeria), LINX (London), DE-CIX (Frankfurt/Lisbon), C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire Internet Exchange (CIVIX), and the West Africa Internet Exchange (WAF-IX).\n\n\u201cThis creates shorter routes for internet traffic with direct access to content providers, which enables better internet resilience, reduced latency, and improved customer experience for internet users in Ghana,\u201d MainOne says.\n\nIn a nutshell, Ghana could well be on its way to localising Internet traffic, boosting its speeds, and saving millions of dollars in the process.\n\nEven more business benefits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoosting Internet speeds affects individuals and businesses in Ghana, but the MDXi\u2019s other features shoot its business value up a notch.\n\nIt reportedly features private data centre suites, precision cooling, and enterprise-grade 24\u00d77 multi-level security and video surveillance. It also has safety and fire suppression systems with multiple redundancies built into the power, cooling, and security infrastructure.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to eliminate the challenges businesses face with setting up IT infrastructure in-house, by presenting a shared Data Center model, which optimises cost, and improves performance and efficiency.\u201d\n\nMainOne reveals that enterprises, government agencies, multinationals, and startups can now subscribe to colocation or cloud services, which allow them to focus on their core businesses.\n\nAfricanus Mensah, Chairman, MainOne Ghana, believes that the data centre will impact Ghana\u2019s business growth and human capital development. He believes the facility will \u201cexpand the frontiers of the digital revolution and transformation in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe MDXi Appolonia Data Center will contribute to the growth of the local economy by providing jobs, enhancing capacity development, and serving more businesses in Ghana as the region continues to grow its digital economy.\u201d\n\nThe company reveals that as Ghana\u2019s digital economy keeps growing, the data centre facility will contribute to its growth by creating jobs and enhancing capacity development.\n\nWhile MainOne\u2019s data centre could offer several benefits for businesses and individuals in Ghana, this is only one part of the puzzle. Factors like ease of doing business, terrestrial Internet infrastructure, and a skilled workforce will prove a solid foundation for Ghana\u2019s digital economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Website Writer, Narrator, tech, business and policy analyst.

Source TechCrunch\n\nNigerian digital freight company, MVX, has raised a $1.3 million seed round to scale its operations, hire staff, and improve its technology.\n\nWho participated in the round? Kepple Africa Ventures, The Continent Venture Partners, Founders Factory, Launch Africa Ventures, and Oak Capital.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy MVX? Per Techcrunch, Tonye Membere-Otaji, CEO and Founder of MVX, was fascinated by the lack of an online marketplace for vessels while working in the maritime industry in 2016.\n\nHowever, he couldn\u2019t launch because it was challenging to find the right partner and team. But, in 2019, he established MVX with Tobi Amusan (CTO) after raising a $100,000 pre-seed round.\n\nBecause its business model centred around offering a support vessel booking platform that linked vessel chartering requests, MVX was previously referred to as MVXchange.\n\nHowever, this changed in 2020 because of the uncertainty of oil prices and the economic impacts of COVID-19.\n\nThe freight company launched MVXtransit, a digital freight booking platform that helped cargo owners find deals on moving containers. And in April 2021, it launched MVXpay, a finance and payment solution to provide trade finance for freight operators.\n\nWhat\u2019s new? The two products are now rolled into MVX. Also, the startup plans to make freight shipping and trade finance easier for African businesses by bringing booking and deployment processes online.\n\nThe startup claims it has expanded beyond Nigeria and that merchants from the West African country and Kenya, South Africa, Ghana, and Rwanda can use its platform to move freight in and out of their countries.\n\nRead this for context.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCellulant\u2019s licence approval in Ghana\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Dignited\n\nWhat happened? Kenyan African payments company, Cellulant, has launched Tingg in Ghana. Tingg is a digital payments network that allows businesses and their customers to accept and make payments easily.\n\nThis announcement is coming after Cellulant was granted a Payment Services Provider (PSP) licence by the Central Bank of Ghana (CBG).\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that Cellulant is now one of the PSPs supported by the Bank of Ghana to provide digital payment solutions throughout the country.\n\nAlso, the PSP licence allows Cellulant to aggregate merchant services and payments for banks, institutions, and the general public, process financial services, acquire merchants, and build PoS systems.\n\nAnd there\u2019s more. The licence permits establishing a third-party payment gateway, and a marketplace for fully regulated financial service providers. It also allows merchant acquisition and aggregation, the printing and display of EMV cards, and the limited usage of closed-loop virtual cards.\n\nWhy the licence? The licence is required under the Payment Services Act 2019, which requires any fintech or digital payments company to be licenced by the Bank of Ghana before operating in the nation.\n\nIn July 2021, Cellulant received approval-in-principle from the Bank of Tanzania (BOT) to operate as a Payment Solution Service Provider (PSSP) in the country, having met all the requirements.\n\nAccording to Cellulant, Tingg helps businesses to digitise their payments using different options.\n\nCellulant\u2019s new approval will enable consumers\u2019 merchants to pay for products and services using regionally appropriate payment options.\n\nRevio raises over $1 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth African billing startup, Revio, has raised more than $1 million in a seed round. International venture development firm, The Delta, led the round.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Brent Maropis (CEO) and Louis Buys (Co-founder), Revio is dedicated to assisting startups, particularly those in the Software as a Service (SaaS) space, get the most out of their billing subscriptions.\n\nAccording to Buys, the company improves client loyalty and makes it easy to avoid unsuccessful payments and customer loss. Essentially, it enables organisations to communicate with customers in real-time through the intelligent use of machine learning and analytics.\n\nRevio claims it supports all currencies and integrates with the African payments startup, Flutterwave, to allow its SaaS clients to sell their products to all African customers.\n\nExpansion plans? Though it\u2019s currently focused on the South African market, Revio plans to expand to East Africa in 2022.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nFlutterwave to drive US expansion as it appoints Silicon Valley veteran as head of US growth.

          "text": "As part of efforts towards achieving zero hunger in Nigeria by 2030, six young Nigerian entrepreneurs have received N120 million to support their ideas.\n\nThe beneficiaries, whose innovations are targeted at improving food production, packaging and distribution, among others, were winners of a competition organised by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP).\n\nThe competition was also in partnership with Nigeria\u2019s Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, with support from private investors.\n\nAccording to a statement issued on Friday by the UN agency, the competition was tagged zero hunger sprint and shared with PREMIUM TIMES by its national communications officer, Kelechi Onyemaobi.\n\nThe winners include Jerry Oche, with his Zowasel product, an online marketplace and crop testing service that connects smallholder farmers with premium buyers. He was rewarded with N42 million.\n\nThe next big winners were Adepeju Jaiyeoba, Tosin Ayodele and Ayoola Dominic, who won N21 million each.\n\nMs Jaiyeoba\u2019s Colourful Giggles, described as a natural affordable and readily available baby food company; Mr Ayodele\u2019s Agrorite, a company that helps smallholder farmers to access credit and data-driven advisory services; and Mr Dominic\u2019s Koolboks, an eco-friendly refrigeration solution powered by solar energy and equipped with payment technology, won them the cash prizes.\n\nMeanwhile, Luther Lawoyin\u2019 Principally, a digital food cooperative enabling families or small businesses to share bulk food items or buy food in bulk directly from farmers or wholesalers, and Michael Ogundare\u2019s Crop2cash, which creates reliable credit scores and risk profiles for farmers to unlock finance for improved productivity and income, were rewarded with N10 million and N5 million respectively.\n\nAbout zero hunger sprint\n\nThe head of WFP Nigeria\u2019s capacity strengthening and policy coherence unit, Fabienne Moust, described the initiative as a platform for \u201cempowering existing social innovators with additional resources to accelerate their ideas to eliminate hunger in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn a piece shared on WFP\u2019s website, she said if well handled and supported by stakeholders, \u201cit is our best chance to reach zero hunger by 2030.\u201d\n\nShe said; \u201cThe Zero Hunger Roundtable is a platform facilitated by WFP Nigeria and the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs in Nigeria, where we bring everyone together \u2014 the private sector, development agencies, Government \u2014 to look at collective solutions that can contribute to zero hunger in the country. It was created as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it goes way beyond that. There are lots of sustainable solutions needed for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThat became the big thinking behind the Zero Hunger Sprint; a competition calling on Nigeria\u2019s innovators to bring forward concrete ideas that help us find solutions to hunger. Nigeria\u2019s landscape for entrepreneurship is very unique, which is what inspired this initiative.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, according to WFP\u2019s statement, the funding for the competition was provided by five large corporations \u201cwho are passionate in supporting innovative ideas in the food security and nutrition sector, under the zero hunger roundtable.\u201d\n\nThe five corporations are listed as Promasidor, Guinness Nigeria, TGI, Nigerian Breweries and Tolaram Group.\n\nEndorsements\n\nSpeaking on the innovation, the corporate affairs director of Nigerian Breweries Plc, Sade Morgan, said the sprint pitch confirmed that Nigeria has abundant innovators and young entrepreneurs in the agriculture and food processing sector.\n\n\u201cNigerian Breweries Plc is committed to supporting the selected start-ups to provide exciting and sustainable solutions that will boost the agricultural value chain in line with our sustainability agenda,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso, Promasidor\u2019s chief executive officer, Bruno Gruwez, said his firm is proud to partner WFP on the project, saying; \u201cAs a leading food company, this forms part of our efforts to bolster backward integration initiatives and accelerate local food production in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the country director of WFP Nigeria, Paul Howe, said; \u201cWhat we saw at the Zero Hunger Innovation Sprint was amazing. The pitch showcased the incredible talent, energy and dynamism of young Nigerian entrepreneurs\u2013 and the Zero Hunger Roundtable is trying to harness this energy in a way that is socially beneficial and sustainable in addressing hunger challenges.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

          "text": "A joint report by the International Committee on Nigeria and the International Organisation for Peace Building and Social Justice has said Nigeria is currently experiencing religious genocide.\n\nThe report, titled, \u201cNigeria\u2019s Silent Slaughter,\u201d described the country as \u201ca failed state,\u201d noting that no fewer than 43,242 Nigerians have been killed by Boko Haram and Islamic State insurgents while 18,834 others lost their lives in the hands of killer Fulani herdsmen over a 20-year period.\n\nThe report said 34,233 other Nigerians were killed extrajudicially by state actors, including the police, military and others.\n\nThe report regretted what it described as the \u201cbreakdown of the rule of law, spiraling violence, atrocities against targeted religious groups and innocent civilians and the apparent impunity of the perpetrators\u201d in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the report seen by PUNCH, the combination of these factors contributed to transform Nigeria into \u201clargely a failed state and regional epicentre for terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe authors of the report added that their assertion found support in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 1948 United Nations Convention on Genocide.\n\n\u201cThere is strong evidence and a compelling legal argument that over the past decade or so, and increasingly under the current Fulani Muslim-dominated Nigerian government of Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria is experiencing what could be seen as targeted religious genocide, or what, at the very least, is widespread and often coordinated religious persecution campaigns being conducted against Christians,\u201d the report stated in its introduction overview signed by the Executive President of ICON, Stephen Enada, and Executive Director, PSI, Dr Richard Ikiebe.\n\nIn its foreword, the report published a November 24, 2019 letter by a member of the House of Lords, United Kingdom, Baroness Caroline Cox, calling on the international community to recognise the crisis in Nigeria as typical genocide, while accusing the Nigerian government of pampering killer Fulani herdsmen.\n\nCox wrote, \u201cWhile the underlying causes of violence are complex, the asymmetry and escalation of attacks by well-armed Fulani militia upon predominantly Christian communities is stark and must be acknowledged.\n\n\u201cWhile the Nigerian administration has taken steps to counter Boko Haram insurgency, it has not demonstrated the same commitment to tackle the escalating violence perpetrated by Fulani militants.\n\n\u201cFinally, given the Nigerian government\u2019s apparent complicity in the persecution of Christians, international aid should be curtailed until they protect and provide for their own citizens of any belief.\u201d\n\nAlso in the foreword, a retired American congressman, Frank Wolf, urged the world to pay attention to Nigeria, noting that Boko Haram insurgents, in their decade-long Jihadist campaign, had killed over 27,000 civilians. A figure, he said, was more than the number killed by ISIS in Iraq and Syria combined.\u201d\n\nWolf expressed the fear that Nigeria could implode with dire consequences for neighbouring nations and the world.\n\n\u201cAn implosion would destabilise the surrounding countries and send millions of refugees into Europe and beyond,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNigeria, with a population of 195 million, is the largest country in Africa. I believe that so goes Nigeria, so goes western Africa.\u201d\n\nStill, Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Jos, Rev A.B. Kwashi, in the foreword, said the report captured the details of atrocities and abuse in Nigeria, describing it as timely.\n\nKwashi said, \u201cIncidents of violence towards Christians, many of whom are farmers, by Islamic militants have been allowed to continue for too long.\n\n\u201cIt is a common development and an everyday occurrence across Nigeria to kill Christians, meanwhile offenders are not being prosecuted and the leaders are unresponsive.\u201d\n\nA Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Prof Joash Amupitan, who wrote the report\u2019s legal brief, among other recommendations, called for the setting up of a United Nations-backed tribunal in Nigeria to try perpetrators of crimes \u201cas was the case in former Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Sierra Leone pursuant to the powers of the UN Security Council in Chapter V of the Charter of the UN.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe UN Security Council can be pressured by the major powers to refer the case of Nigeria, by virtue of its referral powers under Article 13 of the Rome Statute, to the ICC in respect of which the court could not otherwise exercise jurisdiction,\u201d Amupitan added",

          "text": "Afenifere, the Yoruba socio-cultural group, said former Nigerian president Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (IBB) has lost the opportunity to be the father of a new Nigeria.\n\nAfenifere stated this on Saturday while reacting to the excuse given by IBB for annulling the June 12 election won by M.K.O Abiola.\n\nBabangida, in an interview on Friday, had said he annulled the election to prevent a violent coup d\u2019etat.\n\nHowever, Afenifere described his comments as an insult on the intelligence of Nigerians.\n\nAfenifere, in a statement issued by Sola Ebiseni secretary-general of Afenifere, described Babangida\u2019s comment as \u201ca sour taste in the mouth.\u201d\n\nThe statement said:\n\n\u201cBabangida has not said a new thing worthy of any reaction in respect of his treasonable acts of the annulment of the adjudged freest and fairest election in the country\u2019s political history.\n\n\u201cNigerians are not interested in any excuse being given by IBB. It is even most preposterous that IBB will only now be insulting the intelligence of Nigerians that he annulled their mandate to forestall a violent coup, which, by reasonable inference, he was aware of.\n\n\u201cHe lost the opportunity of being the hero of democracy and father of a new Nigeria, an eternal regret that no whitewashing on television can redeem.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is no gainsaying the fact that the present administration has made saints of all previous administrations in every aspect of governance.\u201d\n\nBabangida, also confirmed yesterday that he had started scouting for the person he will endorse for the 2023 presidency.\n\nAccording to him, the person will be in his sixties.\n\nHe said: \u201cI have started visualizing a good Nigerian leader. That is, a person, who travels across the country and has a friend virtually everywhere he travels to and he knows at least one person that he can communicate with.\n\n\u201cThat is a person, who is very versed in economics and is also a good politician, who should be able to talk to Nigerians and so on. I have seen one, or two or three of such persons already in his sixties.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if the person could emerge victorious in the 2023 presidential election, IBB said, \u201cI believe so if we can get him.\u201d",

John Joseph Hayab, said that the bandits are now demanding N1 million from each parent of the remaining 80 students in their custody, for a total of N80 million in ransom.\n\nAccording to one of the abducted students\u2019 parents, who requested anonymity, it is the school\u2019s parents who are bearing the brunt of the state\u2019s student abductions.\n\nAnother parent of the freed students revealed that he and other parents went through hell before they could afford the kidnappers\u2019 demands for their children\u2019s release.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI had to sell our family farm and other valuable assets at our disposal.

          "text": "The Force Criminal Intelligence and Investigation Department, Abuja, has invited Israel Balogun, a YouTube user who disclosed a money miracle\u2019session\u2019 done by Apostle Johnson Suleman, founder of Omega Fire Ministries.\n\nBalogun was summoned by ACP Y.Y Abubakar, Special Enquiry Bureau, Force Criminal Intelligence and Investigation Department, in a letter dated 3 August 2021 with the reference number CR:3000/FHQ/SEB/ABJ/T3/VOL.3 signed by ACP Y.Y Abubakar, Special Enquiry Bureau, Force Criminal Intelligence and Investigation Department.\n\nThe letter reads, \u201cThis office is investigating a case of Criminal Defamation and Cyberstalking in which your name features prominently. In the light of the above and in the spirit of fair hearing, you are requested to interview the undersigned in room 408, 3rd floor, Force CIID Complex Area 10, Garki, Abuja on 11th August 2021, 1000hrs unfailingly.\u201d\n\nBalogun\u2019s attorney, Inibehe Effiong, acknowledged the invitation in a letter made available to SaharaReporters on Friday.\n\nAccording to Effiong, Balogun\u2019s police summons indicated that he should go to the Force headquarters on Friday, August 13 for a claimed case of \u201cCriminal Defamation and Cyberstalking.\u201d\n\nHe mentioned that his client had been threatened by lawyers for his investigation into a money-miracle scheme.\n\nThe lawyers set a seven-day deadline for him to retract the publications and apologize for the purported offense.\n\nInibehe, on the other hand, said that his client received an invitation from the police just 24 hours after receiving the letter.\n\nA statement from Inibehe read, \u201cOur client, Mr. Israel Goodnews Balogun, has received an invitation from the Special Enquiry Bureau, Force Criminal Intelligence and Investigation Department, Nigeria Police Force Headquarters, Abuja signed by ACP Y. Y. Abubakar, to report for interview on 13th August 2021 over an alleged case of \u201cCriminal Defamation and Cyberstalking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe invitation follows a threat issued to our client by lawyers to Apostle Johnson Suleman, the Founder of Omega Fire Ministries, over the views expressed by our client in which he disavowed the baseless, false, unsubstantiated and ridiculous miracle money claims repeatedly made by Apostle Suleman during his ministrations in Atlanta, United States of America and in Auchi, Edo State, Nigeria.\n\n\u201dApostle Suleman during the said ministrations claimed that he commanded Angels to send money mysteriously to worshippers. In a comical display, some worshippers came out with their phones to meet him in the pulpit to \u2018testify\u2019 that they had received credit alerts from the unseen \u201cAngels\u201d as commanded by Suleman.\n\n\u201cAs a true believer of the undiluted gospel of Jesus Christ, our client found the miracle money claims to be contrary to Biblical doctrines and the tenets of Christianity and came out to disavow the claims of Apostle Suleman by debunking same.\n\n\u201cEnraged by the views of our client, Mr Suleman briefed his lawyers to write to our client to demand that our client should apologize within seven (7) days. Although the letter from his solicitors is dated 27th July 2021, it was sent to our client via WhatsApp on 3rd August 2021.\n\n\u201cWe have responded to the demand letter from Suleman. If he decides to go ahead to institute a civil action against our client for \u201cdefamation of character\u201d, we will be happy to meet him and his miracle money Angels in court.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is important to alert the public, civil society, media and the international community that barely 24 hours after the solicitors to Mr Suleman had written to our client, an invitation letter was received by our client from the Nigeria Police Force.\n\n\u201cWe have advised our client as law-abiding citizens to honour the police invitation; while hoping that the police will act professionally and respect the constitutional rights of our client.\n\n\u201cWe call on the Inspector-General of Police to save the country from the ensuing embarrassment and the damage the actions of the police, in this case, may do to the image of the country before the international community.\n\n\u201cNigeria is currently facing severe financial and economic challenges, Apostle Suleman should help the country out of her predicament by commanding his \u201cAngels\u201d to assist the country with his so-called miracle money.\n\n\u201cThe Angels should credit the Federation Account with enough funds to help the country meet its urgent financial obligations.\n\n\u201cWe hope responsible and God-fearing Christian leaders in Nigeria will have the courage to speak out against the desecration of their faith.\n\n\u201cThe eyes of the nation and the world are on the Nigeria Police Force.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that the M.S Amune & Co (Omega Chambers), solicitors to Apostle Suleman, threatened to sue Balogun for posting the video.\n\nBalogun, in one of his videos on Wholeness African Initiative, condemned a miracle service organised by Suleman where the cleric was heard telling members that he would command angels to drop money into the bank accounts of those who believe.\n\nThe programmes were held in Edo, Nigeria and Atlanta, the USA in June and July, 2021 respectively.\n\nIn reaction, Suleman\u2019s solicitors sent a letter dated 27th July to Balogun demanding a retraction of the posts (video and write-ups) alongside a written apology to the minister.\n\nThey stated that Balogun\u2019s action was a case of defamation of character against Apostle Suleman whose church, Omega Fire Ministries has members in 52 countries of the world.\n\nIn the letter, Balogun\u2019s statements were described as \u201chate speech, cybercrime terrorism, unsubstantiated and threat to his (Suleman\u2019s) social and religious image.\u201d\n\nThey stated explicitly that failure to do as requested will attract a full lawsuit against Balogun.\n\nThe video of the controversial programme shows Suleman saying, \u201cThe Holy Ghost just whispered to me, I\u2019m going to pray and make declarations, after that you will check your account.\u201d\n\nAnother voice said, \u201cPapa (a term used by church members for Suleman), there is a miracle alert here, she just got her alert of $1,000.\u201d\n\nSuleman said again, \u201cMiracle alert, as you get it, run here. Angels begin to put money in your account.\u201d\n\nIn his analysis that has now brought about threats, Balogun had said, \u201cApostle Suleman is destroying the gospel of God, why would a man begin by telling people there will be miracle money in their accounts, you are using the name of Christ to do Miracle or Magic?\n\n\u201cThis is not the gospel, this man stood in the midst of the people, in the church in Atlanta and in his church in Nigeria asking people to bring out their phones and there would be miracle money in their account. You must not fold your arms and allow such a thing to continue, Nigerian Christian leaders must dissociate themselves from something like this, they must tell the world that they are never part of the gospel that this man is preaching.\n\n\u201cThis is not Christ, this is not Christianity, this is voodoo, this is magic, this is not from God and it can never be from God. God does not deposit money in people\u2019s accounts, angels do not share money. It is either this guy has some people behind the scenes who have pre-collected people\u2019s bank details, who do not even know they wanted to use it for anything.\u201d",

I have seen one, or two or three of such persons already in his sixties. I believe so if we can get him.\n\n\u201cThose were the major qualities the new Nigerian President must possess,\u201d former Military President, said on Friday, as the country prepares to elect another leader to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari, who was incidentally shoved aside close to 40 years ago.\n\n\u201cIf you get a good leadership that links with the people and tries to talk with the people; not talking on top of the people, then we would be okay\n\n\u201cI have started visualising a good Nigerian leader. That is, a person who travels across the country and has a friend virtually everywhere he travels to, and he knows at least one person that he can communicate with. Competence above ethnicity should be of utmost importance when choosing the next President.\n\n\u201cEither we want to practise democracy the way it should be practised or we define democracy on our own whims and caprices. If we are going to do it the way it is done all over the world, you allow the process to continue.\n\n\u201cIt is through the process that you will come up with a candidate that will rule the country. His beliefs and qualifications should be considered before he throws his hat into the ring, regardless of where he comes from.\u201d\n\nBabangida, described himself as a \u201csaint\u201d compared to Buhari in terms of corruption, saying: \u201cWell on that, you can\u2019t compare it with the facts on the ground now. You can say it. From what I read, from analysis, I think we are saints when compared to what is happening under a democratic dispensation.\n\n\u201cI sacked a Governor for misappropriating less than N313,000. Today, those who have stolen billions and are in court are now parading themselves on the streets. Who else is better in fighting corruption?\u201d\n\nThe former military leader, whose eight years in government brokered a transition government that ended in the fiasco of the June 12, 1993 election, won by business mogul, Moshood Kashimawo Olawale (MKO) Abiola, also falted politicians for trying to undermine Nigeria\u2019s unity.\n\n\u201cTill today, unfortunately, the political class are not really into this seriously and say how do we build a nation,\u201d Babangida, said, while weighing in on the contentious debate about resource control, saying, Nigerian people should be given more control over their affairs and resources.\n\n\u201cI believe you should give people more control over their affairs, over their resources. There is too much control in the way the economy is being run. We should open it further. If we do that, I think we will go far. But mention it to some people in this country, but mention it to a lot of people in this country and somebody will cut off your head,\u201d he said.",

Nkeiruka Onyejeocha, said it was meant to address the challenges of soil erosion and flooding that had dealt severely with the communities for many decades.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that the successful completion of the project will ensure the safety and wellbeing of the people of the communities and also improve their standard of living.\n\n\u201cIt will mitigate the dangers, losses and damages associated with soil erosion and seasonal flooding of unpredictable intensity, which had plagued the communities for years.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the project would provide ample opportunities for the socio-economic growth of the natives,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nOnyejeocha, representing Isuikwuato/Umunneochi Federal Constituency, who attracted the project, paid glowing tribute to the president for approving the project for her constituency.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe approval of the project is in tandem with the president\u2019s pledge that no part of the country will suffer neglect, owing to its geographical location or political affiliation because every part of Nigeria is dear to him.\u201d\n\nOnyejeocha, who defected from the Peoples Democratic Party in August 2018, expressed joy that she could realise the project within the short period she joined the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nShe thanked the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, the contractors and consultants \u201cfor their doggedness in ensuring quality and timely completion of the project.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the Permanent Secretary, EFO, Dr Habiba Lawal, gave credit to Onyejeocha for initiating the project \u201cthrough a request for an urgent Presidential Intervention\u201d to check the ecological devastation in the area.\n\n\u201cIt is our conviction that this intervention will provide the enabling environment for enhanced socio-economic activities among the benefitting communities,\u201d Lawal said.\n\nHe enjoined the communities to take ownership of the project and ensure its maintenance and sustainability.\n\n\u201cThese will help to ensure that the resources committed to the project by the federal government were not a waste,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Chairman, Isuikwuato Traditional Rulers Council, Eze Anthony Ihemeje, and the President General of Isuikwuato Development Union, Chief Chukwuemeka Oluoha, expressed profound gratitude to Buhari and Onyejeocha for successfully executing the project.\n\nThey recalled the trauma the natives suffered due to the erosion and flood menace in the area, saying that the affected portions of the road provided hideouts for armed robbers and kidnappers.\n\nAccording to them, travelling on the road became a nightmare due to the hoodlums, who were regularly robbing, kidnapping and raping our girls and women.\n\nThey expressed joy that security had improved appreciably in the area since the completion of the project.\n\nThe highlights of the event included the conferment of the chieftaincy title of \u201cAda-dioha nma\u201d (the maiden, in whom we are well pleased) on Onyejeocha by the Oguduasaa Traditional Rulers to further demonstrate their gratitude to her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "\u2018\u2026Wearing face masks uncomfortable\u2019 \u2026Third wave\u2018ll be more severe \u2013 Don \u2018\u2026Govt should raise awareness, enforce rules\u2019 \u2026More variants may come in future if \u2026 \u2013 Virologist \u2026Nigeria expecting 41,282,770 vaccines \u2013 FG\n\nNigeria is currently experiencing a spike in the Covd-19 pandemic with the discovery of the new deadlier Delta variant of the disease in some parts of the country. BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report examines the dangers of abandoning safety protocols amidst rising cases.\n\nThe federal government had last year placed the country on a lockdown among other stringent measures as part of efforts to contain the pandemic. The policy caused changes in personal hygiene among Nigerians as they tried to protect themselves from being infected by the virus.\n\nDeadlier variant\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) had in July detected a confirmed case with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, also known as Lineage B.1.617.2.\n\nThe Centre, in a statement, disclosed that the variant was detected in a traveller to Nigeria, following the routine travel tests required of all international travellers and genomic sequencing at the NCDC National Reference Laboratory, Abuja.\n\nThe deadlier Delta variant is recognised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a variant of concern, given its increased transmissibility. The variant has been detected in over 90 countries and is expected to spread to more countries, according to the NCDC.\n\nThe NCDC Head of Communications, Dr. Yahya Disu, in the statement, said the variant had also been linked to a surge in cases in countries where it is the dominant strain in circulation.\n\nHe said, \u201cTaking into consideration the continued Covid-19 pandemic in Nigeria, especially the current finding of the very infective Delta variant of the virus in Nigeria, it is noted that the Delta variant is currently wreaking havoc in many African, Asian and Western countries. The variant has overwhelmed the health systems in countries such as South Africa.\n\n\u201cThe Delta variant has been reported to be responsible for the current emerging third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThreats\n\nPublic health experts have warned that the Delta variant of Covid-19 first detected in India remains a big threat to Nigeria, noting that it could spark a surge of the viral infection that will be difficult to contain.\n\nA pharmaceutical research scientist, Dr. Uche Enemalu, said the government should immediately begin to put in place measures to contain the variant confirmed to be responsible for a massive resurgence of Covid-19 infections, as well as deaths, in many countries of the world in the last few weeks.\n\n\u201cIn fact, it is 60 per cent more transmissible than other variants and the faster the transmissibility, the more difficult it is to contain.\n\n\u201cAsk people in Europe, see the situation in the USA, follow the figures from South Africa, Uganda and other African countries, and you will see we are dealing with an invasive, evasive and elusive variant that is transmitted rapidly and causes serious illness.\n\n\u201cTo be forewarned is to be forewarned. A warning is not enough anymore; arming ourselves with masks, safe distance and a vaccine is the way to go. Enough of reactive red alert warnings; we must move to combat readiness,\u201d he said.\n\nPerception, abandoning protocols\n\nDespite the detection of the Delta variant and a surge in the number of cases, checks by Blueprint Weekend revealed that many Nigerians have thrown caution to the wind.\n\nThis reporter who visited markets, motor parks, shopping malls and other public areas observed that while the use of hand sanitisers was no longer a common practice, only a few Nigerians wear face masks in public. Many of those with face masks hung them on their chins.\n\nSpecifically in Nyanya, a suburb of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), various worship centres, event centres and drinking joints have also been going about their businesses without adhering to safety measures.\n\nA trader at Nyanya market, John Ugwu, said he was struggling to adhere to non-pharmaceutical preventive measures because of the public perception that a third wave of the pandemic was not real.\n\n\u201cWhen Covid-19 entered Nigeria last year, everybody was conscious about wearing their face masks, but now, we think it is not real. I am not used to covering my face or wearing a face mask. It makes me uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cI have five face masks in my house, but I usually forget to wear one each time I leave my house for a business trip. I am still trying to make it a habit.\u201d\n\nLikewise, a resident of Mararaba in Nasarawa state, Hassan Abubakar, told Blueprint Weekend that it was not important to use face masks, adding that the Delta variant would go as the previous strains went down in the country.\n\nExplaining the behavioural change and why many Nigerians may have returned to their old ways regarding personal protection, a psychologist, Dr. Martin Agwogie, said, \u201cRecall that at the initial stage of the Covid-19, there was tension everywhere, people were afraid and people took the lockdown measure, to a large extent, seriously. After a time, people thought Covid-19 might not be as deadly, especially in Nigeria and Africa, as it is in other parts of the globe, due to the mortality rate.\n\n\u201cPeople thought some persons that contracted Covid-19 went into isolation and recovered from it. They thought it was not as serious as they initially thought. There is also the misconception that it is more of a disease of the rich; that only the rich were dying from Covid-19. That affected the level of risk people attached to Covid-19. What that simply means is that their perception of harm from the disease is possibly low.\n\n\u201cPeople survived the first and second waves; people have actually got to a stage where they said there was no Covid-19, so going back to taking precautionary measures was like going back to what they thought was over. Some had dropped their face masks and other preventive measures. For them, going back to it would be a challenge, especially because they don\u2019t see it as a risk.\u201d\n\nThird wave\n\nGiven the disregard for non-pharmaceutical protocols by Nigerians, a professor of virology at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Luke Ukonu, told Blueprint Weekend a third wave is imminent.\n\nHe said, \u201cA third wave is a high possibility. We see the number of lab positive cases climbing and the positivity rate rising. With the reported detection of the Delta variant in Nigeria, and the near abandonment of non-pharmaceutical interventions by most Nigerians, I believe we are getting set for a third wave.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes, it is likely to be more severe than the second wave, just as the second was higher than the first wave. It is, however, hard to make any detailed projection because the elusive Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus keeps surprising us.\u201d\n\nPoor vaccination\n\nHowever, a virologist, Musa Yusufu, said the federal and state governments should double their efforts in expanding vaccination campaigns to provide protection for Nigerians and prevent mutations.\n\nHe also encouraged Nigerians to make themselves available for vaccination to prevent further mutations and the spread of the virus. According to him, more variants of Covid-19 could emerge in future if the gap of infections was not closed with vaccination.\n\n\u201cPolio, for example, has a variant called vaccine-derived poliovirus that can also cause infection. The same polio vaccine that was manufactured a long time ago is still in use; another vaccine was not manufactured to take care of that mutant. It is the same way that the Delta variant is a mutant and a common characteristic of the RNA virus is to mutate as they move from one individual to the other.\n\n\u201cMore variants may come in future if we don\u2019t close the gap with vaccination. Don\u2019t let anyone deceive you; before any vaccine is released for emergency use, it serves the primary purpose of protecting. The more the people are vaccinated, the more the virus would be handicapped to mutate and the fewer the opportunities for variants to emerge,\u201d he said.\n\nWay out\n\nThe executive director of Unity Advocacy Forum, Mrs. Jumoke Ayoola, speaking with this reporter on the ways of checking the development, urged Nigerians to adhere to all the safety protocols prescribed by the NCDC.\n\nShe said, \u201cI will encourage people to observe all the preventive measures because by doing so, they are not only protecting themselves against coronavirus, they are protecting themselves against other respiratory and virus infections as well as those that can cause gastroenteritis.\n\n\u201cThe face mask will prevent the spread of other respiratory infections. Wearing the mask on the chin is a waste of time and energy because it will not serve any purpose; the real places that the mask needs to cover are the nose and the mouth.\u201d\n\nAlso, the chairman, Expert Review Committee on Covid-19, himself a virologist, Prof. Oyewale Tomori, said disregarding the preventive measure against contracting and spreading the virus would put many in danger.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is unfortunate and a danger not only to those refusing to wear face masks but also to their families, friends, and loved ones. Covid-19 is still around and being transmitted on a daily basis. The fact that we are not testing efficiently and effectively does not mean it is not around. The person locked up in a room with windows shut says the sun is not shining on a sunny day but those outside in the sun know better.\n\n\u201cHalf a loaf is better than no loaf. The partial protection of the vaccine may be the difference between getting exposed, infected, and surviving or dying. Getting vaccinated and immunised may be the difference between being alive or dying or dead. So, please get vaccinated.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe expert stated further that the third wave might double the number of cases recorded during the second wave.\n\n\u201cFirst, the second wave lasted as long as the first wave, about eight months. However, the first wave produced 62,830 cases and the second wave made 104, 730 people sick. For every sick person in the first wave, we had 1.6 times the number in the second wave. From what we have seen the Delta variant doing in other countries, and should the third wave come in Nigeria, it will be a miracle if we do not see a doubling of the number of cases as we saw in the second wave. See the number of cases we are now reporting in the last two to three weeks; from zero to three-digit numbers.\n\n\u201cKeep persuading, while diligently and actively implementing the non-pharmaceutical interventions. We must all work with each other to encourage people to wear their masks. Establishments, public and private institutions, offices must enforce the guidelines in their spaces. We, as individuals, must persuade, encourage and insist on others complying with guidelines on NPIs.\u2019\u2019\n\nSimilarly, a consultant public health physician, Dr. Hannatu Mohammed, said the face mask had become a necessity now more than ever to keep the Delta variant of the virus at bay.\n\nMohammed said, \u201cThe Delta variant stays more in the atmosphere compared to the previous variants we have had. The implication is that the number of people that could get infected could be more. A person infected with the previous variant could infect two or 2.5 persons at a time. But this new variant can get four to five people infected at once because it stays more in the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cWe need more face masks now than ever before. The important thing now is how to protect oneself with a face mask. The implication of that is we should not be tired of using face masks now. We need it more because of the peculiarity of the new variant we have now.\u201d\n\nAgwogie, however, urged the government authorities to lead the awareness campaign against Covid-19 by showing example, through public adherence to preventive measures so that the citizens would understand the seriousness and follow suit.\n\nHe said, \u201cI think the government also needs to increase the level of awareness and enforce the rule; it is not a case of \u2018do what I say and not what I do,\u2019 because you see people, even those in government still behaving as if there is nothing serious about the pandemic. If those who are respected in society do not adhere to the Covid-19 protocols, it throws caution to the wind.\n\n\u201cWhat I would suggest is persuasion. Let Nigerians know why they need to adhere to the protocols. There is a difference between adhering to protocols and the use of force. When you preach to their conscience, through different channels, it becomes more effective. But that is not to say some measures cannot be used to curtail excesses when there is a breach. But I believe in persuasion and communication as against the use of force.\u201d\n\nAdditional doses\n\nMeanwhile, the executive-director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Faisal Shuaib, disclosed that Nigeria would be expecting 41,282,770 Covid-19 vaccine doses this year. He advised Nigerians to embrace non-pharmaceutical means of curbing the Delta variant of Coronavirus.\n\nFaisal, who disclosed this during a press briefing in Abuja, noted that the Ministry of Health and its agencies were working towards supporting the local production of vaccines in the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe country has officially ended the first phase of its strategic Covid-19 vaccination plan and is now preparing to commence the second phase in the next few weeks. We have also received communication for the delivery of the following vaccine shipments in the coming months.\n\n\u201c3,924,000 doses of Oxford/AstraZeneca by end of July or early August 2021 from the COVAX facility, 3,930,910 doses of Pfizer-Bio-N Tech Covid-19 vaccine in August from the COVAX facility donated by the United States Government, 3,577,860 doses of Pfizer-Bio-N Tech Covid-19 vaccine in Q3 from the COVAX facility, 29,850,000 doses of Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine by the end of September, that will arrive in batches from the African Union Commission.\n\nFaisal added that the federal government had procured equipment for the preservation of the vaccines.\n\n\u201cWe are making every effort and are confident that, with your continued support, Nigeria will be able to make more significant utilisation of the vaccines that would be supplied to the country.\n\n\u201cThe National Primary Health Care Development Agency is putting in place all necessary logistics for storage, distribution, security, and accountability for the range of vaccines we are expecting.\n\n\u201cTo this end, the federal government of Nigeria has procured 60 units of U701 ultra-cold chain equipment, and as we speak, no fewer than 37 of them have been deployed to all the 36 states and FCT in preparation to receive all Covid-19 vaccines that would require ultra-cold.\u201d",

We earnestly await the result and plead that nothing should be said to pre-empt whatever the outcome might be,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the alleged staff of the school that was sent on indefinite suspension and dismissal, he noted that the dismissal of the staff was \u201c based on a careless talk with a student; that\u2019s part of our commitment in making the school safe for our students and earn the confidence of our parents.\u201d\n\nHe described reports that their students have sworn to an \u2018oath of secrecy\u2019 as very disturbing, stating that \u201chow can secondary students take an \u2018oath of secrecy; this is nothing but blackmail and an attempt to divert the minds of the public from the truth.\u201d\n\nHe assured the general public that \u201cas a school established to train future leaders, we will never give in to spineless, chinless and directionless individuals who are all out to cause people to have a negative opinion of the school.\n\nSpeaking further on Keren\u2019s demise, he said upon her \u201cadmission to the Queen\u2019s Hospital, Wuse Zone 11, Abuja on early Monday, 21st June 2021, the school\u2019s representatives went there to visit her and her mother.\n\n\u201cWe reached out to the family on the very Tuesday, 22nd of June, when we were informed of her demise at the hospital, all activities for that day in the school were shut down. The Management staff and some members of staff went to commiserate with her.\n\n\u201cThe following day, 23rd June, the visit was repeated with a Board member and some staff to deliver a condolence letter, even though she was not in, we delivered it. On the 24th June, 4 members of staff went again, but they were denied entry right from the gate of the Estate. The PTA Executives of the school went on the same day and were equally prevented from entering from the gate of the Estate.\n\n\u201cKeren\u2019s mother denied granting any interviews, yet media houses, publications, social media, and bloggers have been quoting her. A valedictory Service was conducted in memory of Keren Akpagher in the Academy on Monday, 12th July, 2021.\n\nAkinsowon was responding to an earlier press conference held on Wednesday, in which the leader of the Coalition of Gender-Based Violence Responders, Lemmy Ughegbe, alleged that Premiere Academy was one of the schools engaging in the ignoble act of sexual harassment.\n\nUghegbe accused the FCT police of acting like image-makers of Premiere Academy by defending the action and role of the school and failed to release, Katen\u2019s medical report to the mother.\n\nHe said \u201cThe FCT Deputy Commissioner of Police, Fom Pam Joseph, has held on to the medical report of the deceased and refused to give it to the biological mother of the girl. The idea is if she gets it, she will share it with the press. Is the Police PRO of Premiere Academy? What is the business of the police with what the mother does with the information on the medical report?\n\n\u201cOf course as an investigative journalist working with a coalition, we have gotten the medical report that corroborates the fact that this girl was raped with a condom left inside of her. That condom eventually caused sepsis which led to her untimely death.\u201d\n\nHe alleged that a preliminary report of an autopsy conducted on Keren by the official doctor appointed by the police, Dr. Desmond Ike Okonkwo of Maitama General Hospital, revealed that she was raped.\n\nUghegbe challenged the school management to a \u2013 media dialogue to discuss the rape and death of Keren-Happuch and other cases of sexual molestation, which it has the record of covering instead of handing pedophiles to the police.\n\nDuring the press conference, Keren\u2019s mother, Mrs. Vivian Akpagher, who has passed through psychological trauma following the death of her daughter, for the first time, narrated how condom and sperm discharge were found in the deceased\u2019s private part before her death.\n\nThe grieving mother who could not hold back her tears made the revelation while addressing journalists on Wednesday in Abuja said she rushed her daughter to the hospital shortly after picking her from the school following the complaints of pains and weakness.\n\nShe said the doctor while trying to administer drips on her decision to insert a urinary catheter because of her weakness, but surprisingly found sperm discharge and condom left in her private part after a medical test.",

This could be due to deliberate ignorance, mischief, or pure hatred.\u201d\n\n\u2018Hate Their Own Country\u2019\n\nThe President\u2019s spokesman stated that it was not new as his position had been confirmed by the Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya, on the day he was decorated with his new rank.\n\nHe reminded critics of the President\u2019s directives to the nation\u2019s security forces to crush all violent criminals and those sponsoring insurrection in the country.\n\nAmid the continued outcry that the Nigerian leader had been softer on bandits than separatists, Adesina insisted that President Buhari\u2019s order was carried out without fear or favour.\n\nThose who keenly follow the war against insurgency and banditry in the North, according to him, will honestly admit that every effort is being made to extirpate the evil from the nation.\n\nThe presidential spokesman insisted that the present administration was cleaning the country of vermin.\n\n\u201cThe baby that swears that his mother will not sleep, will himself keep forceful vigil. All over the country, terrorists, bandits, kidnappers, all types of criminals are being spoken to in the language they understand.\n\n\u201cAnd the victory of good over evil is sure, inexorable. Yet some people say they see nothing that the government is doing. Pitiable souls. Of all men most miserable,\u201d he said.\n\nAdesina added, \u201cMay God bless our troops. May He protect them, reward their labour of love. As for the cynics and skeptics, may God have mercy on them, open their eyes, and help them not to hate their own country any longer.\u201d",

Gen.

The whole of Gambia has an important guest in Gen.

The signing of this MoU between NDLEA and DLEAG is a clear indication that Nigeria is more than willing to partner with us.

It was the second time the two teams had met in the competition, with France having inflicted the USA\u2019s first Games loss since 2004 in the group stage.\n\nHowever, Gregg Popovich\u2019s favourites, who under-performed in the build-up, hit their stride when it mattered most.\n\nKevin Durant was the USA\u2019s standout player yet again, scoring 29 points.\n\nFrance made a late, fourth-quarter run, but came up just short as the US made their shots at crucial moments to claim a seventh gold medal out of the last eight on offer.\n\n\u201cThe first time we played together as a whole roster was France [in the group] and lost to them,\u201d said Jrue Holiday. \u201cSo we just felt like it was only right to meet them in gold and to get our win back.\u201d\n\nTeam USA\u2019s preparations for the Olympics got off to the worst possible start with surprising losses against Nigeria and Australia in warm-up matches.\n\nBack-to-back victories against Argentina and Spain seemingly put them on the right path, but they looked shaky in the opening game as France ended their 25-game winning streak in Olympic basketball.\n\nWhile they bounced back with comfortable wins over Iran and the Czech Republic, the USA\u2019s problems were far from over.\n\nDuring their quarter-final against Australia, they found themselves down by 15 in the first half before they managed to put a run together and take a 30-point lead.\n\nIt was another slow start against France in the final as they struggled to deal with Rudy Gobert\u2019s size and physicality in defence.\n\nOn offence they were cold, struggling to make open shots, and Gobert\u2019s presence around the basket made it hard for the Americans to score inside.\n\nPopovich\u2019s team eventually took command, but could never really pull away from their opponents as Nando de Colo made it a three-point game with 10 seconds left.\n\nBut the final free throws would fittingly fall to Durant, who made both to put the game beyond France\u2019s reach.\n\nDespite failing to live up to their billing, one player who consistently shone for Team USA was Brooklyn Nets star Durant.\n\nThe 32-year-old led by example throughout the tournament and scored 23 points in their final group game against the Czech Republic to surpass Carmelo Anthony as Team USA\u2019s all-time leading scorer.\n\nIn the knockout phase, Durant averaged 27 points per game in wins over Australia, Spain and France as he claimed a third personal gold medal after being part of triumphs in 2012 and 2016.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou realise, you know, you finished the job, you get the gold medal, you get the trophy, but when you go through that journey, it\u2019s just incredible to be a part of something so special. I\u2019m bonded to these guys for life.\u201d\n\nLauren Holiday, a two-time Olympic gold medallist in women\u2019s football, expressed her pride as husband Jrue added to his NBA title success with Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nThere was also high praise for Durant from Stephen A. Smith who described him as \u201cTeam USA\u2019s Captain America\u201d.",

          "text": "Hundreds of fully vaccinated people in England have been hospitalised with the highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant, scientists said on Friday.\n\nIn its latest COVID-19 update, Public Health England (PHE) also warned there were early signs that people who have been inoculated may be able to transmit the Delta strain as easily as those who have not received any jabs.\n\nFrom July 19 to August 2, 55.1 percent of the 1,467 people hospitalised with the Delta variant were unvaccinated, PHE said, while 34.9 percent \u2013 or 512 people \u2013 had received two doses.\n\nDubbed \u201cfreedom day\u201d, July 19 was the date England significantly eased lockdown restrictions.\n\nAll vaccines in use in the United Kingdom \u2013 those produced by AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech \u2013 require recipients to receive two doses to be fully inoculated.\n\nAbout 75 percent of the UK\u2019s adult population has received two shots to date.\n\n\u201cAs more of the population gets vaccinated, we will see a higher relative percentage of vaccinated people in hospital,\u201d PHE said.\n\nJenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said the hospitalisation figures showed \u201conce again how important it is that we all come forward to receive both doses of the vaccine as soon as we are able to do so\u201d.\n\n\u201cVaccination is the best tool we have in keeping ourselves and our loved ones safe from the serious disease risk COVID-19 can pose,\u201d Harries said in a statement.\n\n\u201cHowever, we must also remember that the vaccines do not eliminate all risk: it is still possible to become unwell with COVID-19 and infect others.\u201d\n\nPHE\u2019s findings chime with those from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which last week raised concerns that vaccinated people infected with Delta could, unlike with other variants, readily transmit it.\n\nVaccines have been shown to provide good protection against severe disease and death from Delta, especially with two doses, but there is less data on whether vaccinated people can still transmit it to others.\n\n\u201cSome initial findings \u2026 indicate that levels of virus in those who become infected with Delta having already been vaccinated may be similar to levels found in unvaccinated people,\u201d PHE said.\n\n\u201cThis may have implications for people\u2019s infectiousness, whether they have been vaccinated or not. However, this is early exploratory analysis and further targeted studies are needed to confirm whether this is the case.\u201d\n\nThe Delta variant has become the dominant form of coronavirus circulating globally, sustaining a pandemic that has already killed more than 4.4 million people, including more than 130,000 in the UK.\n\nIt now accounts for 99 percent of all COVID-19 infections in the UK, PHE said.",

          "text": "A woman who accused Gov. Andrew Cuomo of groping her breast at the governor\u2019s state residence has filed a criminal complaint against him, the Albany County Sheriff\u2019s office said Friday.\n\nThe complaint, filed Thursday with the sheriff\u2019s office, is the first known instance where a woman has made an official report with a law enforcement agency over alleged misconduct by Cuomo. Its filing is a potential first step toward bringing criminal charges.\n\n\u201cWe take every complaint seriously,\u201d Albany County Undersheriff William Rice said Friday.\n\nIt\u2019s possible the Democratic governor could be arrested if investigators or the county district attorney determine he committed a crime, Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple told the New York Post.\n\n\u201cThe end result could either be it sounds substantiated and an arrest is made and it would be up to the DA to prosecute the arrest,\u201d he told the newspaper, which was the first to report on the complaint. \u201cJust because of who it is we are not going to rush it or delay it,\u201d Apple said.\n\nApple didn\u2019t return a phone message from The Associated Press.\n\nThe Cuomo aide who filed the report has accused him of reaching under her shirt and fondling her when they were alone in a room at the Executive Mansion last year. The woman also told investigators with the attorney general\u2019s office that Cuomo once rubbed her rear end while they were posing together for a photo.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office didn\u2019t immediately provide a copy of the complaint.\n\nCuomo\u2019s lawyer, Rita Glavin, didn\u2019t immediately address the criminal complaint in an online briefing with reporters, but said the groping allegation \u2014 which was also outlined in newspaper articles and in a report released by the New York attorney general\u2019s office \u2014 was fabricated.\n\n\u201cHe is 63 years old. He has spent 40 years in public life and for him to all of the sudden be accused of a sexual assault of an executive assistant that he really doesn\u2019t know, doesn\u2019t pass muster,\u201d Glavin said.\n\nThe Albany County district attorney would not confirm that they received a complaint, saying they had no plans to release any information because \u201cthis is an ongoing matter that is under review,\u201d spokesperson Cecilia Walsh said in an email.\n\nCalls for Cuomo\u2019s resignation or impeachment soared this week after an independent investigation overseen by the state attorney general\u2019s office concluded that Cuomo sexually harassed 11 women and worked to retaliate against one of his accusers.\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s report describes a series of times Cuomo allegedly acted inappropriately with the aide described as Executive Assistant #1, culminating with the groping encounter at the mansion in November 2020.\n\nAccording to the woman, Cuomo pulled her in for a hug as s\n\nhe prepared to leave the governor\u2019s office at the mansion. Told that \u201cyou\u2019re going to get us in trouble,\u201d Cuomo replied, \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d and slammed the door shut. He slid his hand up her blouse, and grabbed her breast over her bra, according to her account.\n\n\u201cI have to tell you, it was \u2014 at the moment, I was in such shock that I could just tell you that I just remember looking down seeing his hand, seeing the top of my bra,\u201d she told investigators.\n\nShe said she pulled away from Cuomo, telling him \u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d\n\nCuomo has adamantly denied touching her breasts, saying \u201cI would have to lose my mind to do such a thing.\u201d\n\nRecords confirm that the woman was at the mansion for several hours on Nov. 16 and had at least one interaction with the governor, but Glavin said she also sent emails to staff while she was in the building that didn\u2019t mention that anything upsetting had happened.\n\nMariann Wang, an attorney for two other accusers, said the governor\u2019s lawyers are ignoring any fear the employees had of being punished by Cuomo if they complained.\n\n\u201cThe fact that any assistant might try to continue with her day or act \u2018normal\u2019 even after being harassed brutally is something many women who have been harassed at work understand,\u201d Wang said. \u201cThese women are trying to survive.\u201d\n\nThe woman told investigators she had initially planned to take the harassment claims \u201cto the grave.\u201d\n\nProsecutors in several New York counties have said they are interested in investigating claims of inappropriate touching by Cuomo, but all had said they needed the women involved in the allegations to make a formal report.\n\nThe Albany Police Department, the primary law enforcement agency for the city, had been informed of the woman\u2019s allegations regarding the encounter at the mansion several months ago and had spoken to her lawyer, but didn\u2019t open an investigation at the time because she didn\u2019t make a report.\n\nThe criminal investigation comes as lawmakers were moving toward a likely impeachment proceeding over the allegations.\n\nLawyers working for the state Assembly sent a letter to Cuomo Thursday giving him until Aug. 13 to respond to the allegations against him or provide documents to bolster his defense.\n\nThe state Assembly\u2019s judiciary committee plans to meet Monday to discuss the possibility of impeachment proceedings. Nearly two-thirds of the legislative body have already said they favor an impeachment trial if he won\u2019t resign.\n\nGlavin and a lawyer representing the governor\u2019s office, Paul Fishman, criticized the attorney general\u2019s office for not providing its findings to them ahead of time and claimed the investigators didn\u2019t take a strong enough look at the accusers\u2019 credibility. They also demanded an opportunity to see transcripts of interviews witnesses gave to investigators.\n\nAttorney General Letitia James\u2019 spokesperson, Fabien Levy, said the office will be providing interview transcripts to the Assembly, and said the women\u2019s accounts were \u201ccorroborated by a mountain of evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo attack this investigation and attempt to undermine and politicize this process takes away from the bravery displayed by these women,\u201d Levy said.",
