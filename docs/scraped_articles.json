          "title": "FG has surrendered to terrorists, citizens should defend themselves \u2013 CNG",
          "text": "The Coalition of over 52 Northern Groups, on Sunday, called on residents of Sokoto, Zamfara, Katsina and Niger states, currently grappling with the unprovoked killings, to protect themselves against terrorists, who might want to attack or impose levies and taxes on them.\n\nThe body, which puts the number of northerners killed in the last four weeks at 500, also observed that there had been reports of upsurge in killings, abductions, maiming and exploitation by AK-47-wielding terrorists in the four states.\n\nThe National Coordinator, CNG, Balarabe Rufa\u2019i, who stated these during a press conference after the meeting of the body to review the security situation in the North, said it was high time the citizens rose up to \u201cdefend themselves against aggressors.\u201d\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe Coalition of Northern Groups has reviewed the resurgence of violent attacks across some northern states in recent days with deep concern.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply disturbed by the despicable and irrepressible decimation and elimination of our people; the destruction of their livelihood; raping and exploitation of our women; and extortion of our poverty-stricken villages and towns by terrorists.\n\n\u201cIn the last few days, armed bandits/terrorists across four northern states of Sokoto, Zamfara, Katsina and Niger have killed scores of helpless and defenceless citizens in addition to multiple kidnappings and other forms of exploitation. Regrettably, these killings, abductions, maiming and exploitation have been going on incessantly with no respite in sight.\n\n\u201cThe CNG has gathered shocking and frightening information that suggests that some of our villages are firmly under the control of bandits, where levies or taxes are imposed on our people, subjecting our poor people to further economic deprivation and devastation. The stories are condemnable and demoralising as over 500 innocent, defenceless and impoverished northerners were killed systematically in the last four weeks.\u201d\n\nRufa\u2019i added, \u201cIn view of the above happenings, the CNG observed that government at all levels, particularly the Federal Government, has surrendered their rights and privileges to the bandits/terrorists as the bandits operate parallel governments in villages and communities in Sokoto, Zamfara, Katsina and Niger states where they impose taxes and levies on the villages and kill people at will.\n\n\u201cThe government and its functionaries lack the political will and determination to decisively deal with the problems once and for all.\n\n\u201cThe security forces are grossly understaffed, ill-equipped and poorly motivated to confront the monstrous terrorists in an aggressive manner to eliminate them from their hideouts. It is also alleged that top security personnel are siphoning the little resources earmarked for the purpose of prosecuting the war.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the CNG calls on traditional rulers to stand with their people in this difficult and scary situation to confront the challenge for our collective survival.\n\n\u201cCommunities must work together under the traditional institutions, religious leaders and community leaders to source an alternative method of preserving and protecting their lives, properties and communities as our security architecture proves incapacitated and or reluctant to decisively and resolutely deal with the problem.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the political leaders, who are supposed to protect our lives and properties, are busy with their politicking without showing an iota of sympathy and empathy for the plight of our people.\n\n\u201cThe CNG, therefore, advocates concerted and strategic efforts to create an independent community-based security outfit that can be funded through community efforts, donations from wealthy individuals, friends and associates of the North, among others, to take the war against this eminent existential threat to the hideouts of the hardened criminals.\u201d\n\nThe CNG added, \u201cWe reiterate our call to the traditional and religious leaders because of their proximity to the people and the trust they enjoy from our people that they must lead from the front by setting an example; they should create and manage a special trust fund to support the community-based outfit.\n\n\u201cHence, our people must rise up in an organised manner and defend themselves from the systematic annihilation, plundering of their resources and extortion by their terrorist-enemies.\u201d\n\nThe CNG also condemned as totally unacceptable the suspension of the Idon Mikiya programme of Vision FM and its subsidiary, Farin Wata TV, by the Federal Government, describing it as an affront to freedom of speech and expression as contained in Nigeria\u2019s constitution.\n\n\u201cWe call on the Federal Government, as a matter of urgency, to rescind this unpopular and dictatorial decision that has no place in democratic governance. It is important we remind the government that it rode on the fundamental right of freedom of expression to capture power. It is, therefore, expected that the government will reciprocate by championing the freedom of speech and expression for all Nigerians without fear or favour,\u201d Rufa\u2019i emphasized.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Hijab protest\u2019s victims: CAN blames Kwara for ignoring peace offer",
          "text": "The Kwara State branch of the Christian Association of Nigeria has alleged that the failure of the state government to heed the warning and appeals it made earlier to the governor triggered last Thursday\u2019s clash on the wearing of hijab by female Muslim students of the Baptist High School, Ijagbo, in the Oyun Local Government Area of the state.\n\nA parent, identified as Habeeb Idris, was killed during the fracas, which left 11 others injured outside the premises of the school during a protest by Muslim parents.\n\nThe state branch of CAN in a statement jointly signed by the acting Chairman and Secretary, Bishop S. T. G. Adewole and Rev Reuben Ibitoye, respectively, on Sunday said, \u201cThe unfortunate saga that occurred at the Oyun Baptist High School, Ijagbo, on February 3, 2022, should have been averted if the state government had yielded to CAN\u2019s earlier appeal\n\n\u201cIt is noteworthy to mention that the Kwara CAN had written a letter of appeal to the executive governor on January 25, 2022, to urgently look into this matter. The letter was titled, \u2018The ongoing hijab crisis at Oyun Baptist High School and other mission schools in Oyun and Offa Local Government Areas: Calling for an urgent intervention\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe said letter was delivered and received at the Government House. To the surprise of the Christian community, the appeal was neglected and the matter unattended to by the state government.\n\n\u201cTo put the record straight, precisely on February 2, 2022, some Muslim fanatics with some Muslim female students of the OBHS, Ijagbo, staged a protest in Ijagbo town and later came to Ilorin to continue the protest at the Government House chanting slogan like, \u2018No school tomorrow except with hjab\u2019 and the following day, they were mobilised with weapons to unleash mayhem on the innocent Christian proprietors; these weapons were freely used by these fundamentalists.\n\n\u201cThe report at our disposal indicates that an innocent passerby was also attacked and dealt machete blows by these Muslim fanatics. The individual was not a Christian as wrongfully claimed. The fellow reappeared, reinforced with his fellow thugs and retaliated; this led to serious fracas with the Muslims protesters. It was the timely intervention of security agents that restored normalcy at the school gate.\u201d\n\nCAN said at no time did it agree with the state government that hijab should be worn by students in Christian mission schools in the state.\n\nIt added, \u201cConsequently, we reiterate for the umpteenth time that at no time did Kwara CAN and stakeholders sign/concede to any agreement or policy with the Kwara State Government on the use of hijab as it is being claimed by the Commissioner for Education and Human Capital Development, Hajia Sa\u2019aadatu Modibo Kawu. The usage of hijab in Christian mission schools in Ilorin metropolis was forcefully implemented and imposed.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the Commissioner for Education and Human Capital Development is undiplomatic in her ways of handling the matter at stake. Her action has continued to generate religious tension and she was not proactive enough when an earlier protest was staged on February 2, 2022 by some Muslim fanatics. Perhaps, a prompt response would have rescued this ugly situation.\n\n\u201cThe Kwara CAN\u2019s efforts to sit and reason with the government on how to foster lasting peace on the issue have yet to yield any result.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at a press conference held on Friday, the Ijagbo branch Chairman of CAN, Rev Samuel Ajayi, said the Memorandum of Understanding submitted by the state branch of the association since June 2021 had yet to be implemented by the state government.\n\nIt added, \u201cIt has been said times without number that we cannot and will not allow the use of hijab in our mission schools.\n\n\u201cThe mission schools were not taken over by the state government in 1974. There was an agreement between the government and the school proprietors. Each has their own part to play in the running of the schools.\u201d\n\nHe, however, appealed to the state governor to fulfil his promise of returning all mission schools to their owners and allow their running to be done by the management.\n\nCAN also appealed to the Christian community in the state to be calm and peaceful, stating, \u201cAs Christians, you are all urged to remain calm, peaceful and be law-abiding in the face of any provocation, believing that all issues will be resolved soonest. The perpetrators of this heinous crime that occurred at the OBHS, Ijagbo, should be made to face the full wrath of the law.\u201d\n\nHowever, at a news conference addressed by Muslim Stakeholders\u2019 Forum in Ilorin on Friday, the Chairman, Alhaji Isiaq Abdulkareem, called on the police to investigate the circumstances surrounding the crisis with a view to bringing the perpetrators to justice.\n\nThe Legal Adviser of the forum, Ibrahim Agbaje, said CAN lost the two cases it instituted at both at the lower and appellate courts on the issue of hijab wearing by Muslim schoolgirls in the state.\n\nAgbaje said as of Friday, there was no case instituted at the Supreme Court by CAN on the earlier judgments delivered by a Kwara State High Court and the Court of Appeal.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

However, the beckoning of my kinsmen and time makes it more imperative than ever that I offer myself for service at this time.\n\n\u201cOn 3rd November 2021, my kinsmen at Mbakena, Mbayongo in Vandeikya Local Government Area invited me home to a unique reception. During that reception, the elders informed me that, they had received repeated divine revelation to anoint me as \u2018the chosen one\u2019 to contest for the governorship election.\n\n\u201cQuoting the scriptures from the book of 1 Samuel 16:1, the elders, supported by the entire community, comprising of elders, women, and youths, said my choice for this mission was not only divinely revealed, but also met the wishes of the people.\n\n\u201cFollowing that uncommon encounter, I took several weeks and engaged in a quiet introspection, fasted, and prayed for discernment and spiritual guidance and I am assured that it is the right thing to do. Therefore, I have now accepted to run for the office of governor of our dear state, as this is God\u2019s will for me and the state.\n\n\u201cAs many people have already known, I have always had a penchant for service, especially selfless service that requires selfdeprivation and sacrifice for the common good. Therefore, my decision to run for the governorship is solely informed by my undying desire to be of service to our people.\n\n\u201cI strongly believe that through my exemplary leadership, the citizens of our beloved state will experience remarkable improvement in their daily lives and, above all, God will be glorified and honored. \u201c\n\n\u201cI should stress that in accepting to contest in the next governorship elections, I am conscious of the challenges and responsibilities which that office entails, but I am also cognizant of the wonderful opportunity to be of service.\u201d",

Shina Peller, seeking to scrap the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC). We also note that the bill has passed the first reading at the Nigerian House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cWe strongly condemn this bill. It is ill timed and brought in bad faith, especially at a time when Nigeria is grappling with several security issues and there is even a louder call for the establishment of state policing, recognition of vigilante groups, and the formal recognition of the Peace Corps through an Act of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe argument that the Nigerian Police and the NSCDC performs the same function is misconceived and laughable. Beyond the general security functions, it is important to state that the NSCDC is charged with the specific role of protecting our pipelines and training private security guards.\n\n\u201cWhile the security of our pipelines can be tied directly to the security of our economy, as the bulk of our national income comes from oil production, the training and vetting of private security guards cannot also be jettisoned, especially at this time when individuals are taking proactive measures to protect themselves against kidnapping, banditry, and other vices.\n\n\u201cIn any event, it is even ironic that Hon. Peller has proposed this bill at time the National Assembly is considering state policing in its constitutional amendment process. Rather than scrap the NSCDC, we should be calling for more funding and training for the agency, to enable them effectively perform their roles.\u201d\n\nThe statement also mentioned that insecurity in the land has been a nightmare to Nigerians, which primary school pupils are not spared.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that there has been an upsurge in kidnapping of school students by Boko Haram, bandits and other undesirable elements. Rather than scrap the NSCDC, its officers should be posted across all the schools in the federation.\n\n\u201cAgain, we reject the proposal by Hon. Peller to merge the NSCDC with the Nigerian Police.\n\n\u201cIt is common knowledge that the Nigeria Police is one of the most corrupt agencies in the country.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, merging the NSCDC with the Nigerian police will do more harm than good to the nation and its security challenges.\n\n\u201cAll over the word, there are several security agencies within a particular country, with different functions. For example, in the United States of America, there is the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Central Intelligence Agency, Department of Homeland Security and several others with myriad of functions. No one has called for the scrapping of the agencies\u201d, it pointed.\n\nThe statement concluded by calling on NASS to jettison the bill without delay.\n\n\u201cWe therefore call on the National Assembly to reject this bill, while urging Hon. Peller to channel his energy towards more important issues bedeviling Nigeria\u201d, it added.",

Obidike Chukwuebuka, APC National Youth Leader aspirant.\n\nObidike made the promise in Daura, Kastina state, during the turbaning ceremony of Rt Hon. Rotimi Amaechi, the Honorable Minister of Transportation as the \u2018Dan Amanar Daura\u2019 (Trusted Son of Daura Emirate) by the Emir of Daura, HRH Faruk Umar Faruk.\n\nHe said he is pleased with the recent development in the party all of which demonstrated the wisdom, willingness and objectivity of the party\u2019s National leadership to truly deliver a better and transformed APC to the next generational leadership.\n\nHe said that Senator Abdullahi Adamu\u2019s National Reconciliation Committee can be generously appraised for their commitment at mitigating major indifferences amongst state party stalwarts. Their over 90% success and report submission on the 31st of last month (January) proved that the fruits of Gov. Mai Mala Buni\u2019s administration to unify the APC was never in vain.\n\nAccording to Obidike, the recent inauguration of APC State Chairmen ahead of the National Convention, the Gov. Buni led Caretaker /Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee has added another feather of honor to their cap as achievements in service to the All Progressives Congress.\n\nHis words: \u201c Despite the minimal setback recorded from three (3) states; Enugu, Sokoto and Kano, the majority state leaderships inaugurated is a testament that the APC is on track to redeem it\u2019s image both nationally and globally. \u201c\n\nHe calls for a speedy resolution of the remaining factional misunderstanding to ensure the needed unity amongst members of the APC in all states in the federation, adding that , \u201cour unity is paramount in driving home the message of our party\u2019s strength, reliability and oneness as exemplified in our \u2018broom philosophy\u2019; that united by the bond of reason, our constitution and tolerance we shall continue to stand unequivocally as Nigeria\u2019s most trusted and relevant political institution. \u201c\n\nObidike congratulated all newly installed state chairmen of our party, describing the inaugurated chairmen as guiding light and beacons of direction for the party where it really mattered, the state levels of the party, especially as the 2023 elections fast approaches and the progress of the APC is concerned. He urged them to show firm resolve in building the party to full capacity in their respective state chapters as the National leadership of our party consolidates their various efforts.\n\nWhile describing every member of the APC as very significant to the development of the party, the APC Chieftain said he \u201cbelieves that the grassroots support of our party needs greater attention, hence his willingness to categorically ensure the addition of over 5 million more youths to the party when elected as APC National Youth Leader ahead of the National Convention this February.\n\n\u201cIn his analysis, Obidike said that his target is to drive seven thousand(7000) youths per local government in Nigeria who will be drown from the grassroots to increase the youth membership of the party. \u201c\n\nHe equally notified well meaning stakeholders of his intentions to serve the grassroots in a National capacity and therefore seeks the support of everyone in making the youths top priority in the next administration of the APC in Nigeria.\n\nObidike Chukwuebuka is also the current Director General \u2013 Conference of APC Support Groups and member of the Party\u2019s National Youth Strategic Lobby Committee",

          "title": "Financial Times hits Buhari, says Nigeria has sleepwalked closer to disaster under his watch",
          "text": "By Nwafor Sunday\n\nThe Financial Times has lampooned the administration of President Muhammdu Buhari. In its latest publication the newspaper based in London, England, lambasted Buhari\u2019s administration, noting that Nigeria has sleepwalked closer to disaster under him.\n\n\u201cCampaigning has already begun for presidential elections that in February 2023 will draw the curtain on eight years of the administration of Muhammadu Buhari, on whose somnolent watch Nigeria has sleepwalked closer to disaster\u201d, David Pilling the author of the article titled \u2018What is Nigeria\u2019s government for?\u2019, said.\n\nIn the article, David accused Buhari of not finding the solutions to the country\u2019s economic quagmire, insecurity and electoral malpractices having spent two terms.\n\nIn his words: \u201cBuhari has overseen two terms of economic slump, rising debt and a calamitous increase in kidnapping and banditry \u2014 the one thing you might have thought a former general could control. Familiar candidates to replace him, mostly recycled old men, are already counting their money ahead of a costly electoral marathon. It takes an estimated $2bn to get a president elected. Those who pay will expect to be paid back.\n\n\u201cThere are some promising candidates. If Yemi Osinbajo, the technocratic vice-president, were miraculously to make it through the campaign thicket and emerge as president, the hearts of Nigerian optimists would beat a little faster.\n\n\u201cBut that may be to underestimate the depth of Nigeria\u2019s quagmire. The problem is not so much who leads the government as the nature of government itself.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s administration is fuelled by oil \u2014 though not its economy; more than 90 per cent of output is generated from non-oil activities. But for decades, the business of government \u2014 whether military or, since 1999, democratic \u2014 has been to control access to oil revenues and earn patronage by spreading petrol-dollars to federal and state supplicants.\u201d\n\nReacting, Garba Shehu, via his Twitter account wrote a letter to the editor of Financial Times, addressing the points highlighted in the article.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cWe wish to correct the wrong perceptions contained in the article \u201cWhat is Nigeria\u2019s Government For,\u201d by David Piling, Financial Times (UK), January 31, 2022.\n\n\u201cThe caricature of a government sleepwalking into disaster (What is Nigeria\u2019s government for? January 31, 2022 ) is predictable from a correspondent who jets briefly in and out of Nigeria on the same British Airways flight he so criticises.\n\n\u201cHe highlights rising banditry in my country as proof of such slumber. What he leaves out are the security gains made over two Presidential terms.\n\n\u201cThe terror organisation Boko Haram used to administer an area the size of Belgium at inauguration; now, they control no territory.\n\n\u201cThe first comprehensive plan to deal with decades-old clashes between nomadic herders and sedentary farmers \u2013 experienced across the width of the Sahel \u2013 has been introduced: pilot ranches are reducing the competition for water and land that drove past tensions.\n\n\u201cBanditry grew out of such clashes. Criminal gangs took advantage of the instability, flush with guns that flooded the region following the Western-triggered implosion of Libya.\n\n\u201cThe situation is grave. Yet as with other challenges, it is one that the government will face down.\u201d\n\nRead the full article from the Financial Times below:\n\nOn the British Airways flight between London and Nigeria\u2019s administrative capital of Abuja, one of the airline\u2019s most profitable routes, nearly all the space is taken up with flatbeds. The unfortunate few making their way to a crunched economy section at the back must trudge through row after row of business class.\n\nEvidently, there is plenty of money to be made in Abuja\u2019s corridors of power. Nigeria\u2019s economy may be flat on its back, but the political elite flying to and from London will spend the flight flat on theirs, too.\n\nNext year, many of the members of government will change, though not necessarily the bureaucracy behind it. Campaigning has already begun for presidential elections that in February 2023 will draw the curtain on eight years of the administration of Muhammadu Buhari, on whose somnolent watch Nigeria has sleepwalked closer to disaster.\n\nBuhari has overseen two terms of economic slump, rising debt and a calamitous increase in kidnapping and banditry \u2014 the one thing you might have thought a former general could control. Familiar candidates to replace him, mostly recycled old men, are already counting their money ahead of a costly electoral marathon. It takes an estimated $2bn to get a president elected. Those who pay will expect to be paid back.\n\nThere are some promising candidates. If Yemi Osinbajo, the technocratic vice-president, were miraculously to make it through the campaign thicket and emerge as president, the hearts of Nigerian optimists would beat a little faster.\n\nBut that may be to underestimate the depth of Nigeria\u2019s quagmire. The problem is not so much who leads the government as the nature of government itself.\n\nNigeria\u2019s administration is fuelled by oil \u2014 though not its economy; more than 90 per cent of output is generated from non-oil activities. But for decades, the business of government \u2014 whether military or, since 1999, democratic \u2014 has been to control access to oil revenues and earn patronage by spreading petrol-dollars to federal and state supplicants.\n\nOutside oil, government raises a petty amount of revenue, proportionally much less than other African states. Since the provision of services is so dire, no one who can afford to pay taxes is willing to do so. Nigerians with money opt out of the system. They send their kids to private school, attend private hospitals, employ their own private security and generate their own power. The state borrows ever more heavily to fund what little capital expenditure there is and service mounting debts. Like a giant leech at the top of the body politic, government is essentially there to fund itself.\n\nThis thwarts the aspirations of millions of highly capable Nigerians. Officials extract \u201crent\u201d by controlling access to business opportunities. The objective thus becomes to slow down investment not speed it up.\n\nAlmost all the energy, drive and wealth creation in Nigeria happens outside government. New unregulated businesses in the booming tech sector, fashion, design and the creative arts are flourishing. Every day, tens of millions of Nigerians somehow get by, despite the efforts of those supposedly looking out for them.\n\nAs is said of India, Nigeria grows at night while the government sleeps \u2014 hardly surprising that some libertarian tech entrepreneurs want the government to withdraw and leave the private sector in charge.\n\nIn reality, the government is not too big. It is too small. The federal budget \u2014 not counting money transferred to states \u2014 is about $30bn, derisory for a population of more than 200m people. Only trust in government \u2014 and a willingness to pay taxes \u2014 can redress this balance.\n\nNigeria desperately needs an administration whose energies go not into preserving its own privilege but into providing public goods \u2014 basic education and health, rule of law, security, power, roads and digital infrastructure. It must remove distortions and subsidies that direct entrepreneurial activity from production to arbitrage.\n\nThe chances of a corrupt system reforming itself are slim. But if Nigeria\u2019s ruling class cannot manage it, any remaining faith Nigerians have in their system of government will evaporate. That way lies disaster.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Net capital gains by investors in Nigerian equities have risen to N2.38 trillion as bargain-hunters flooded the stock market with open orders ahead of the impending release of dividend recommendations by major quoted companies.\n\nYear-to-date analysis yesterday showed that average return so far this year stood at 10.68 per cent, equivalent to net capital gains of N2.38 trillion within the past 24 trading sessions.\n\nNigerian equities continued their strong rally so far this year with average gain of 2.33 per cent last week, nudging the average year-to-date return to 10.68 per cent. The market had recorded average gain of 9.15 per cent for January 2022.\n\nThe All Share Index (ASI)- the value-based, common index that tracks all share prices at the Nigerian Exchange (NGX), closed weekend at 47,279.92 points as against its opening index of 46,205.05 points for the week. It had closed January 2022 at 46,624.67 points.\n\nThe ASI is generally accepted as Nigeria\u2019s sovereign equity index, a barometer for measuring pricing trend and investors\u2019 mood at the stock market.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAggregate market value of all quoted equities at the NGX also rose from the week\u2019s opening value of N24.898 trillion to close weekend at N25.477 trillion, representing net capital gains of N579 billion in the five-day trading week.\n\nSectoral analysis indicated a near market-wide rally with oil and gas, manufacturing and banking stocks leading the rally. The NGX Oil and Gas Index recorded the highest return of 7.69 per cent last week, pushing its average return so far this year to 22.52 per cent. The NGX Banking Index appreciated by 0.83 per cent last week to close average return for the year at 9.12 per cent while the NGX Industrial Goods Index rose by 3.41 per cent last week with average return for the year now at 6.41 per cent.\n\nThe NGX 30 Index- which tracks the 30 largest quoted companies, closed with a weekly and year-to-date return of 2.92 per cent and 4.95 per cent.\n\nPensioners and ethical investors have also earned considerable returns, underlining the diversity of the market returns. The NGX Pension Index, which tracks stocks specially screened in line with pension investment guidelines, posted average return of 2.30 per cent last week, pushing year-to-date return to 4.32 per cent. The NGX Lotus Islamic Index- a broad measure for ethical stocks screened in line with Islamic rules, recovered by 3.14 per cent last week, reversing its year-to-date return to average net gain of 1.24 per cent.\n\nHowever, the NGX Insurance Index and NGX Consumer Good Index remained negative with weekly return of -3.60 per cent and -0.81 per cent. These pushed the year-to-date returns to -7.58 per cent and -3.05 per cent.\n\nTotal turnover at the NGX last week stood at 1.785 billion shares worth N19.614 billion in 27,822 deals compared with a total of 1.448 billion shares valued at N19,080 billion traded in 22,557 deals two weeks ago. Total turnover in January 2022 had stood at 5.4 billion shares worth N76.6 billion.\n\nSegmental analysis showed that financial services sector remained the most active, with a turnover of 1.094 billion shares valued at N10.506 billion traded in 13,580 deals last week; representing 61.29 per cent and 53.56 per cent of the total equity turnover volume and value. The conglomerates sector followed with 144.172 million shares worth N253.262 million in 1,077 deals while the information and communication technology (ICT) sector placed third with a turnover of 122.193 million shares worth N1.719 billion in 1,661 deals.\n\nTrading in the top three equities namely Fidelity Bank Plc, Transnational Corporation Of Nigeria Plc, Guaranty Trust Holding Company Plc, (measured by volume) accounted for 415.095 million shares worth N3.205 billion 3,556 deals, contributing 23.25 per cent and 16.34 per cent to the total equity turnover volume and value respectively.\n\nNigerian equities had closed January 2022 with average year-to-date return of 9.15 per cent; equivalent to net capital gains of N2.04 trillion in January 2022. The January 2022 rally extended the two-year consecutive rally of Nigerian stocks, which had closed 2021 with average return of 6.07 per cent, equivalent to net capital gains of N1.278 trillion.\n\nNigerian equities had in the throes of the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 recorded average return of 50.03 per cent, representing net capital gains of N6.483 trillion.\n\nThe ASI closed January 2022 at 46,624.67 points as against the year opening index of 42,716.44 points. It had opened 2021 at 40,270.72 points. Aggregate market value of all quoted equities at the NGX rose from its year\u2019s opening value of N22.297 trillion to close January at N25.124 trillion, representing a face value increase of 12.68 per cent or N2.83 trillion. However, the difference between the ASI and aggregate market value growth rate was due to unadjusted share capital changes, especially the listing of the BUA Foods Plc, which added N720 billion to primary market value.\n\nMost market pundits have predicted continuing rally at the stock market, despite emerging political risks.\n\nPresident, Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers (CIS), Mr Olatunde Amolegbe, said two years of positive returns show that the market is reflecting its function as the barometer for the economy.\n\n\u201cWe also expect the positive movement for the first half of 2022 on the back of good corporate performance, implementation of some part of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) and intense focus on infrastructural development and resultant increased capital raising by government and corporate entities,\u201d Amolegbe said.\n\nAccording to him, the implementation of the PIA has potential to raise government revenue, which may elicit a positive response from the market while infrastructural development would likely boost market activity.\n\n\u201cThese, however, depend on stable macroeconomic policy, increased security and stable polity,\u201d Amolegbe, who doubles as Managing Director of Arthur Steven Asset Management Limited said.\n\nManaging Director, APT Securities and Funds, Mallam Kasimu Garba Kurfi also said the market would remain positive in 2022, although the second half would be determined by the politics of succession by the largest political parties.\n\n\u201cWe expect the bullish rally to continue in first and second quarters but the continuity to the third and fourth quarters depends on the outcome of the primary election of the APC and PDP if they are able to succeed in electing the right candidates for the presidency. Acceptability will lead to bullish rally throughout the year, otherwise, the market may suffer a reversal,\u201d Kurfi said.\n\nGroup Head, Research, GTI Capital Group, Mr. Emmanuel Onoja, said there was strong possibility of the market running through a third positive year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s most likely we see a third year of positive return given the potential liquidity buildup next year as a result of increased borrowing, election spending and falling yields,\u201d Onoja said.\n\nA full-year review of the 2021 performance showed that all major sectoral indices also closed 2021 positive, with the exception of the benchmark for the industrial goods sector. The NGX Oil & Gas Index led the rally with average return of 52.52 per cent. The NGX Insurance Index posted a full-year return of 4.54 per cent. The NGX Banking Index recorded average gain of 3.32 per cent.\n\nThe NGX Consumer Goods Index rallied net gain of 2.78 per cent. The NGX Pension Index, which tracks stocks specially screened in line with pension fund investment guidelines, rose by 16.96 per cent. The NGX Lotus Islamic Index, which tracks stocks that comply with Shari\u2019ah rules, returned 5.74 per cent while the NGX 30 Index, which measures performance of Nigeria\u2019s 30 largest quoted companies, closed with average return of 5.01 per cent.\n\nNigerian equities had played the full contrarian to close 2020 with net capital gain of N6.48 trillion. The ASI recorded average full-year return of 50.03 per cent in 2020, representing net capital gain of N6.483 trillion. The recent highest return was 42.3 per cent recorded in 2017. The ASI had closed 2020 at 40,270.72 points, 50.03 per cent above 26,842.07 points recorded as opening index for the year.\n\nAlso, at the NASD OTC Securities Exchange, the over-the-counter (OTC) market for trading in unlisted securities, the bulls directed the market in 2021. The number of deals, volume and value of activities rose by 233.42 per cent, 63.29 per cent and 158.88 per cent respectively in 2021. Turnover stood at 4,988 deals for 12.95 billion shares valued at N32.845 billion in 2021 as against 1,496 deals for 7.93 billion shares worth N12.69 billion in 2020. At 742.85 points, the NASD Security Index posted a year-to-date returns of 1.34 per cent while the OTC market capitalisation closed at N629.03 billion.\n\nHowever, total transactions at the Nigerian equities market dropped by 12.4 per cent to N1.899 trillion in 2021.\n\nOfficial full-year trading report released by the NGX showed that total transactions at the equities market declined from N2.168 trillion in 2020 to N1.899 trillion in 2021. The decline was majorly due to continuing decline in foreign portfolio investments (FPIs) participation in the Nigerian market.\n\nA breakdown of the transactions showed that total turnover by domestic investors increased to N1.465 trillion in 2021 as against N1.439 trillion in 2020, thus the percentage contribution of domestic investors increased from 66.37 per cent in 2020 to 77.12 per cent in 2021.\n\nHowever, FPIs dropped from N729.20 billion in 2020 to N434.5 billion in 2020, indicating 11 percentage points decline in contribution to total transactions from 33.63 per cent in 2020 to 22.88 per cent in 2021.\n\nDomestic institutional investors remained upbeat about the market, with institutional investors increasing their participation in the equities market. Domestic institutional trading rose from N820.14 billion in 2020 to N886.61 billion in 2021, underlining the increasing inflows of pension funds into the stock market. However, retail domestic trading stood at N578.12 billion in 2021 as against N618.79 billion in 2020.",

          "title": "2023 presidency: APC plots to dump S\u2019East, S\u2019West",
          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThere are strong indications that the All Progressives Congress (APC) may have concluded arrangements to micro-zone its 2023 presidential ticket to the South-south geopolitical zone, thereby foreclosing the possibility of the Southeast zone getting the ticket.\n\nThis is coming on the heels of looming fresh crisis in the party following the decision of the leaders and stakeholders to endorse former governor of Nasarawa State, Alhaji Tanko Al-Makura, as the consensus candidate for the national chairman of the ruling party in the forthcoming February 26 national convention.\n\nA credible source in the ruling party who craved anonymity told Sunday Sun that after the northern leaders of the party conceded the presidential ticket to the South, the likelihood that the party would micro-zone the presidential ticket to the South-south emerged last weekend.\n\nThe source maintained that the fate of presidential aspirants like Owelle Rochas Okorocha, Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu, Senator Orji Uzor-Kalu, and others from the South that have declared their interest for the plum job under APC may have been sealed.\n\nThe source revealed that going by the current dynamics in the party, the South-south will likely get the ticket.\n\nReacting to the zoning arrangement the ruling party may opt for, the source said: \u201cThe possibility of zoning the APC presidential ticket to the Southeast is almost a forgone conclusion. The possibility of the North getting the ticket is also a forgone conclusion. What I can confidently tell you is that APC will not certainly throw the ticket open because the party leaders are unanimous and in agreement that the ticket will be zoned to the South.\n\n\u201cI can also inform you, on good authority, that the most likely beneficiary of the micro-zoning option is not even Southwest as many envisaged, judging by the interest it is generating, but will likely be the South-south. And I can also inform you again that for now, the lot may fall on two persons from that zone.\u201d\n\nOn the possibility of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) zoning its presidential ticket to the North affecting the APC zoning arrangement, the source argued: \u201cWe have told the party leaders that the North must sacrifice their presidential ambition regardless of the permutation of the opposition party. It will be a negation of equity, fairness and justice for the North to contest again after ruling eight years under Muhammadu Buhari. They have to sacrifice that ambition regardless of PDP\u2019s zoning arrangement.\u201d\n\nThe source equally dismissed the speculation that the crises rocking many state chapters of the party will pose serious threat to the proposed February 26 primary, arguing that once a consensus candidate for the national chairmanship emerges, statutory delegates may be used during the convention especially the states riddled with crisis.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, the convention would have been delayed more to enable the party more time to conclude some reconciliation moves, however, Governor Buni and his committee members have tried. They also know that diminishing returns can set in if they continue to hang on to power more than necessary.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cYes, I have heard that the state chairmen want to endorse the continuation of the Governor Buni-led Caretaker Committee especially to enable the party more time to reconcile more aggrieved members. However, we can conduct the convention in the states rocked by crisis by using statutory delegates to vote.\n\n\u201cWe can no longer take chances because we know that the PDP is lurking around the corner to wrestle power from us. With the new election technology like the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) that may be our greatest undoing. As I said, we cannot wait again especially as the APC leadership can use the statutory delegates to replace those states where there are crises,\u201d the source argued.\n\nMeanwhile, the choice of the former Nasarawa governor as the consensus candidate for the national chairmanship position ahead of other aspirants for the post has continued to generate tension and acrimony.\n\nWhile the stakeholders hinged their choice of Al-Makura on product of the legacy parties, the Congress of Progressives Change (CPC) which has not presided over the ruling party since formation, others claimed that the party leaders have since discouraged the possibility of electing any former governor with a sitting APC governor after the lamentable incidence in Edo State between Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and Governor Godwin Obaseki.\n\nOur source further claimed that former Governor Al-Makura did not only win the endorsement of party leaders and major stakeholders, but also many APC governors and more importantly President Muhammadu Buhari, declaring that; \u201cit is 80 per cent certain that Al-Makura will emerge a consensus national chairman of the APC.\u201d\n\nReacting to the plans ahead of the party\u2019s convention, our source said: \u201cWe are still exploring the option of a consensus candidate for the chairmanship of our party because apart from other reasons, it will even reduce the current tension within the party.\n\n\u201cFrom all indications, the former Nasarawa State governor, Al-Makura, may emerge as a consensus candidate, especially as he is of the CPC stock that has not yet produced the national chairman of our party. I can confirm to you that President Buhari and even many of the progressive governors have not only endorsed him, but are also rooting for him too.\n\n\u201cI can equally confirm to you that it is even 80 per cent certain that a consensus candidate may emerge ahead of the convention and once we achieve that, the controversial issue of state delegates to vote during the convention would be circumvented.\u201d\n\nDismissing the claim, Ray Murphy, an adviser to former National Chairman of the party, Chief Odigie-Oyegun, told Sunday Sun that if there is any person to be fronted as a consensus candidate, the former governor of Benue State, George Akume stands at a more vantage position to be so endorsed.\n\n\u201cAkume has the experience as a two-term governor and the network. Don\u2019t forget that he is a serving Minister with unrestrained access to Mr President and if there is any of the aspirants to get such favour, Akume who attends the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting should be considered before others. From all indications, the party may have zoned the ticket to the North-central and it favours all of them coming from that zone and Akume stands the chance of winning the position,\u201d he argued.",

          "text": "An Abuja multi-billion-naira International Cancer Centre (ICC) is yet to take off 12 years after the project was established.\n\n\n\nMrs Turai Yar\u2019Adua, the wife of the late former president, Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, was the brains behind the establishment of the centre that is located on Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport Road in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nIt was said that her aim was to build a cancer centre in the nation\u2019s capital that would cater for people, especially the poor.\n\n\n\nThe project was designed to be fully private driven and meant to provide comprehensive cancer diagnosis, management, treatment and care, as well as promote excellence in cancer education, training and research.\n\n\n\nHowever, funds were raised for the project on July 18, 2009, in Abuja, where financial pledges were made by the rich and powerful to actualise her dream amounting to N6.8 billion, hence the ICC was born.\n\n\n\nTwelve years after, the centre has been abandoned, with the multi-billion-naira equipment and mini-buses already procured for the project rusting away, The Guardian reports.\n\n\n\nIt was learnt that no fewer than 200 mini-buses parked at the open space in the middle of the compound were moved to a hidden side of the premises.\n\n\n\nThe Guardian reports that there was no sign of activity there except one white utility vehicle, Hilux, seen driving into the facility when the location was visited.\n\n\n\nThe entrance gate was said to be locked, noting that it took several knocks before a policeman guarding the place opened to find out who the visitor was and what their mission was.\n\n\n\nAfter exchanging greetings, the correspondent told the officer that she was there to find out whether the centre was already accepting patients and would like to see any of the staff who could provide information on procedures for booking an appointment, to which the policeman replied: \u201cOh, they have not started, but I believe they will start soon.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Guardian gathered that the centre\u2019s inability to take off is a concern, not only to Nigerians but also to the government.\n\n\n\nThe report also revealed that the Federal Ministry of Health had reached out to the former First Lady through the Director-General that would be in charge of the facility to have a meeting with her but the plan never worked out.\n\n\n\nA reliable source close to the health ministry who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: \u201cWe were made to understand that the centre belongs to her NGO. At a point, the government tried to get across to her but it didn\u2019t work out. Even now, the legal department has been directed to find out how she acquired the land and whom the land was allocated to, let\u2019s start from the basis.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe raised a memo, we want to know about the land allocation but it seems they are having problems sorting it out. Even the Abuja Geographic Information Systems (AGIS) couldn\u2019t verify the land too. The concern has been coming from the public on why the centre has not become fully functional. Most Nigerians think it belongs to the Federal Government.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn September 2017, the former First Lady had told Nigerian students in Uganda, led by their president, Mubarak Yahaya Adamu, who presented her with a merit award, that the cancer centre had not commenced operations because those who made big financial pledges during its fundraising absconded after the death of her husband.\n\n\n\nShe said: \u201cBefore my husband died, I intended to have a hospital. We had a launching, some people made pledges but after my husband died, they just vanished. But we have finished the first phase of the hospital, it\u2019s a very big project.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to Turai Yar\u2019Adua, the first phase consists of about 200 rooms, four theatres and other administration offices.\n\n\n\nOne of the security guards at the ICC said there has been no activity to actualise the centre, as envisioned by Turai, adding that Turai came twice in 2016 to the site and had not been seen around the area since then.\n\n\n\nThe guard said some bandits invaded the ICC last year to dispossess them of their valuables, adding that a few items belonging to the centre were also stolen.\n\n\n\nHe said that after the incident, some policemen from the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) have since been deployed to secure the ICC against further attacks.\n\n\n\n\u201cSix of us were employed to secure this place and we do alternate shift, but because the bandits were fully armed, they overpowered us and beat the security guards,\" the guard said.",

          "title": "Saudi Arabia: A new home for Nigerian startups?",
          "text": "For Nigerians who want to start or already run their businesses, there\u2019s a constant concern about access to supporting infrastructure, funding, and talent. These concerns are the primary causes of high failure among startups on the continent.\n\nThe startup failure rate in Nigeria reportedly stood at 61% in 2021, meaning only 39% survive. This is similar across Africa where startup failure rates range from 75% in Ethiopia and 74% in Ghana to 58.3% in Senegal and 58.7% in Kenya.\n\nIn a bid to increase the success rate and accelerate the transition to a digital economy, the Saudi Arabian government is partnering with Nigerian authorities to provide Nigerian entrepreneurs with expedited entry and support via Digital Cooperation Organization (DCO) Startup Passport.\n\nThe Startup Passport initiative, which will ultimately be between the 8-member DCO countries, rolled out initially in Saudi Arabia and Nigeria. This announcement implies that Nigerian startups building products that primarily serve the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region are invited to build their companies from Saudi Arabia with support from the government.\n\nThis initiative was launched at LEAP, a global event for future technologies being held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from February 1 to 3 and attended by leading technology corporations, global start-up pioneers, and venture capitalists.\n\nFaris AlSaqabi, Saudi Deputy Minister for Future Jobs and Capabilities, explained that the bond between Saudi Arabia and Nigeria is fueled by the country\u2019s movement to a digital economy.\n\n\u201cNigeria is one of the key players in the digital economy. We\u2019ve noticed you cannot do it alone, so we have to partner with other countries.\u201d\n\nAt LEAP, \u201cThe Garage\u201d, a world-class innovation hub to support emerging and disruptive technology-based startups was also announced. The name is inspired by the origin stories of many of the world\u2019s top tech companies that famously started from inside garages.\n\nAlongside other business leaders who were present at the event, Nigerian Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami; Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Communications Commission, Umar Danbatta, and other delegates were attendees.\n\nNigerian Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami in conversation with a representative of the Digital Cooperation Organization. Source: DCO\n\n\u201cOne lesson we can pick from Saudi Arabia\u2019s success is that we should take away the word impossible. We should be optimistic about any plans we have for transforming Nigeria,\u201d Pantami told TechCabal. \u201cWhoever comes to Saudi for the first time after some years and sees the changes will appreciate what\u2019s going on in the digital economy. Their institutions are no longer obsolete. They\u2019re not just advanced but proactive.\u201d\n\nHe further said that his presence at the conference is to connect with potential investors, government officials, tech giants, and even startups. \u201cWe\u2019ve been having a series of meetings with investors on how they can come to Nigeria and invest. Some of the global tech giants are willing to come to Nigeria and establish their manufacturing plants.\u201d\n\nPantami pointed out that Nigeria\u2019s large economy, youthful population, and its exit from the recent recession are some reasons why investors are excited about the country, despite there also being a few areas to improve on.\n\n\u201cThe first meeting I had, they were surprised that Nigeria has 6 successful unicorns and still many are coming. The fastest-growing economy is the digital sector, which played a pivotal role in exiting the country out of recession.\u201d\n\nAlongside the Nigerian delegation, Domineum, Tanadi, Rice Afrika and 7 other Nigerian startups were also present at the event.\n\nAll roads lead to Vision 2030\n\nSo far, investments worth about $10 billion in technology and startups were announced at LEAP.\n\nThe investments and initiatives include the launch of Aramco Venture\u2019s Prosperity7 fund with $1 billion, and a billion dollar investment from NEOM Tech & Digital Company with a focus on future technologies. The Saudi Telecom Company announced MENA HUB, a $1 billion investment in regional connectivity and infrastructure.\n\nIgnite, a $1.1 billion investment targeted at the creative industry, was also launched. This new program is expected to transform Saudi Arabia into a leading digital entertainment and media production hub.\n\nTo provide better internet service, WiFi 6E was launched, supported by the largest amount of spectrum available for WiFi of any country worldwide. This is accompanied by other connectivity-boosting initiatives, including the first regional trial of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite technology to extend reliable coverage to remote areas of the Kingdom.\n\nThese announcements are all connected to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030, a drive to reduce dependence on oil and diversify its economy.\n\nSince the drive to achieve the Vision 2030 began in 2016, there\u2019s been considerable changes in Saudi Arabia, notably the liberalisation of its entertainment sector, provision of tourism visas and relaxing its rules for tourists as well as lifting the ban for women to drive in 2018\u2014the last country in the world to do so.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking about the emerging technologies and the future of jobs for our people because soon millions of current jobs will be replaced by technology,\u201d AlSaqabi said. \u201cThis means we\u2019ll lose millions of dollars if we don\u2019t adopt emerging technologies. There is no excuse to wait for the future to come, we have to go to it.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "TechCabal is surging ahead in 2022 and beyond \ud83d\ude80",
          "text": "Hello everyone, welcome to February.\n\nYou probably already know this \u2014 because we\u2019ve mentioned it a few times \u2014 but TechCabal started off in a small room in Lagos many years ago. 2013 to be specific. It is safe to say that, nearly 9 years later, TechCabal has grown to become much more than a predictable technology blog or website. We\u2019ve gone from reviewing gadgets to talking to Meta\u2019s VP MEA and Turkey about facebook\u2019s plans to transition into the metaverse. We are still optimistic about Nigerian founders and the Nigerian tech ecosystem. Still, we\u2019ve covered high-impact entrepreneurs from other regions like Sudan, Egypt, Morocco, Senegal, and The Gambia in the last two years.\n\nAnd we have no plans of slowing down. This year, we are hyper-focused on fine-tuning our editorial standards and establishing TechCabal as one of Africa\u2019s most reputable technology and media publication. We will lead compelling conversations on hot-button topics such as decentralized communities, digital nomads, remote work, talent migration, and the new internet. Furthermore, expect us to spotlight more African founders innovating around draconian policies, internet shutdowns, and social media bans. Our coverage will expand into lesser-known regions, cities, and startup hubs.\n\nFor us, 2022 is about executing our goals, delighting our readers, and putting Africa\u2019s technology ecosystem on the global stage. We hope we can count on you to support us along the way.\n\nWhat is new?\n\nAdegoke \u201cGoke\u201d Oyeniyi is no longer TechCabal\u2019s editor-in-chief and has moved on to pursue some personal goals and interests. Goke joined the newsroom in January 2021 and hit the ground running almost immediately. He provided high-level oversight of TechCabal\u2019s objectives, worked closely with our senior reporters, and drove editorial training weekly. He also contributed some well-researched articles to the newsroom; read his insight into rising Nigerian fintech startup, TeamApt.\n\nFollowing Goke\u2019s exit from the newsroom, I am stepping up to become TechCabal\u2019s acting editor-in-chief, reporting directly to Tomiwa Aladekomo, CEO, Big Cabal Media. My new role comes with many responsibilities, but I am motivated by my team and goals this year. I also know I have the full support of Big Cabal Media\u2019s leadership team and the entire organization.\n\nAbraham Augustine is the most recent addition to our newsroom. He resumed on January 17th as a senior reporter. Abraham is a growth marketing specialist and creator who operates at the intersection of growth, marketing & startup enablement in Africa. Abraham manages a Substack newsletter called Money Myths Africa.\n\nWhat has changed?\n\nLast year, we brought in our first East Africa correspondent. Alexandria Williams joined the newsroom as a remote contract reporter. She wrote about Uber\u2019s showdown against Kenya\u2019s high court and a Kenyan comedian\u2019s rise to digital fame during her time with us. Alexandria was accepted into one of DW\u2019s journalism traineeship programs in December, so she will not be continuing as our East Africa reporter this year.\n\nFor your information:\n\nKelechi Njoku joined the newsroom as senior editor in November 2021. He\u2019s an experienced editor with a literary and fine arts background. One of his most significant achievements was fine-tuning TechCabal\u2019s style guide.\n\nMuyiwa Olowogboyega joined Lemonade Finance as their content manager in October 2021. He was a senior staff writer at TechCabal for 1 year and 8 months. Muyiwa co-authored TC Daily with Daniel Adeyemi.\n\nAlexander Onukwue joined Quartz Africa as their West Africa correspondent. He was a staff writer at TechCabal for almost 2 years. He also wrote TechCabal\u2019s Next Wave newsletter for an extended period.\n\nStorytelling and coverage (TechCabal 3.0)\n\nOn storytelling and reporting, TechCabal is still committed to capturing the players, human impact and business of technology on the continent. We are even more dedicated to covering more regions, including North Africa, South Africa, and francophone Africa. TechCabal Insights team will continue to provide up-to-date content, reports, data, events, and context to help the world understand how technology is changing Africa. We will publish deep dives on cryptocurrency, the metaverse, DAOs, decentralization, policy, regulation, and big tech operators in Africa.\n\nWhat is coming soon?\n\nNewsletters\n\nTechCabal has plans to launch some new newsletter products. Sadly, we cannot reveal the details, but keep your eyes peeled for more information in TC Daily or Next Wave.\n\nFlagships\n\nKelechi Njoku will revive My Life in Tech (MLIT) in the coming weeks. MLIT is a flagship launched by Kay Uguwede, a former TechCabal staff writer. After Kay\u2019s exit from the newsroom, Edwin Madu took over MLIT during his time as senior editor in the newsroom. He is currently Zikoko\u2019s editor-in-chief.\n\nSultan Quadri and Timi Odueso will revive Digital Nomads by the end of February this year. Digital Nomads was launched and exclusively written by Olumuyiwa, a former senior staff writer at TechCabal.\n\nExtra hands\n\nIn 2022, we will recruit senior editors, reporters, and regional correspondents. In addition, we will report on more countries outside Nigeria, Ghana, and West Africa. Nigeria has quickly become the poster child for fast-growing startups and the top recipient of foreign investments. But Kenya, Egypt, and South Africa are following closely behind. Egypt is home to the most accelerated startups and founders on the continent. By bringing in analytical thinkers and on-the-ground reporters, we\u2019ll be able to tell more compelling stories about the impact of technology in these newer regions.\n\nThank you!\n\nWell, that\u2019s about it from the newsroom. As always, we are immensely grateful for supporting and betting on us through the years. Thank you for falling in love with our newsletters, reviews, flagships, columns, tweets, and contributions. We hope to delight you even more in 2022 and beyond.\n\nTechCabal is a pan-Africa media and technology publication. We cover the human impact of technology in Africa and how innovation is changing the business landscape on the continent. Our current coverage areas include West, East, and North Africa.\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Facebook.

          "title": "Detty December: New data identifies Lekki Phase 1 as Lagos\u2019s COVID-19 hotspot",
          "text": "Adaobi* is a 24-year-old software engineer living with her 49-year-old mother Oge* at Lekki Phase 1, in Lagos, Nigeria. On the morning of January 1 this year, she complained of a sore throat and took some Strepsils for it. By the next morning, however, her sore throat got worse\u2014and her mother began to feel an itch in hers as well.\n\nBoth women went to the hospital and there tested positive for COVID-19. They were then placed on medication and advised to self-isolate. Now, their gateman Bosun*, who must have caught the virus from them, thought he had malaria and got on antimalarial medications. But, after a week, his symptoms persisted, so he decided to switch medicines to honey, ginger, and turmeric mixed in hot water, as advised by a friend.\n\nAccording to the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Nigeria entered the 4th wave of COVID-19 in December, reporting 223,887 cases and 2,985 deaths in its 36 states and federal capital Abuja. This is an over-500% increase.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe surge in COVID-19 cases during the December festive period may be attributed to 2 major factors: the mass of unquarantined people that came into Nigeria from abroad, especially into Lagos; and the several crowded gatherings where social distancing practices were not observed.\n\nIn the case of Adaobi and her mother, Adaobi had attended several crowded outdoor activities in December and her mother had just returned from a business trip in Europe, so it\u2019s difficult to determine who infected who.\n\nLike Bosun, many Nigerians are ignorant of the symptoms of COVID-19. On top of that, many people do not see a doctor whenever they feel sick, preferring instead to self-medicate, with the belief that they have \u201cordinary malaria\u201d. This is what\u2019s currently happening in Lagos and, according to Remedial Health, a healthtech startup that improves access to original medicines by creating a direct supply chain between retailers and manufacturers or registered distributors, Lekki Phase 1\u2014one of the highbrow areas of Lagos\u2014is at the center of it all.\n\nRemedial Health founder and CEO, Samuel Okwuada, told TechCabal over a call that their company saw a 250% increase in orders for anti-malarial drugs in December last year from pharmacies and chemists in Lekki Phase 1.\n\n\u201cIt started around November but peaked in December. We noticed that customers in Lekki Phase 1 that would normally order 20 packs of antimalarial drugs for sale within 3\u20134 days were now ordering 60\u201370 packs every 1\u20132 days,\u201d said Okwuada. \u201cWhen we asked the manufacturers for more products and they told us they\u2019d reached their production limit, we realised this is more serious than we thought.\u201d\n\nDrugs like Artemether & Lumefantrine and Vitamin C saw about 250% and 130% increase, respectively, in demand. This continual spike in demand of antimalarial drugs\u2014which is still happening\u2014led Remedial Health to investigate the cause. Their conversations with pharmacists on the frontline suggests that some of the symptoms reported by customers are more consistent with COVID-19 than malaria.\n\n\n\n\n\nA sore throat is not indicative of malaria but it is one of the major symptoms of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThe number of COVID-19 cases in Lekki is overwhelming. When these people come to the clinic, they always complain of malaria but test positive for COVID-19,\u201d said a lab scientist who works at a testing centre in Lekki and who spoke to TechCabal anonymously.\n\nAnother resident of Lekki Phase 1 jokingly said he suspects everybody in Lekki has the virus already. \u201cThat\u2019s an old story now. It\u2019s just another malaria symptom,\u201d he said.\n\nThe importance of data in combating the virus\n\nIt\u2019s no more news that healthcare institutions around the globe are using data to design better pandemic responses and train frontline staff. Without appropriate data, misinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus will flood the media and undermine efforts to sensitise the public.\n\nThe World Health Organisation\u2019s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, once said, \u201cWe\u2019re not just fighting a pandemic; we\u2019re fighting an infodemic.\u201d\n\nGovernments across the world are using data to drive COVID-19 innovation to mend the economic stress, misinformation, and division the virus has unleashed on the world. In Nigeria, the Global Partnership UNECA worked with the country\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) to create a comprehensive data hub to show where cases of COVID-19 were occurring and what support might be needed.\n\nIn Togo, the government is using artificial intelligence, via GiveDirect-Novissi COVID-19 Aid, to collect and collate data of the poorest communities in order to provide them with contactless financial aid through mobile money.\n\nAccording to a Reuter data, COVID-19 infections are decreasing in Nigeria, with 94 new infections reported on average each day. That\u2019s 5% of the peak\u2014the highest daily average reported on December 27. Okwuada, the lab scientist and some Lekki residents that spoke to TechCabal believes that these numbers are underreported and that is evident from the case of people like Bosun. Where\u2019s their own number? However, even though data is not a direct antidote to the virus and not always correct, Okwuada believes it\u2019s a strong fighting instrument. He said data is essential to curbing the spread of the virus and, possibly, ending the disease altogether.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAfrobeats is the movement; it\u2019s the underdog, a mongrel that had no home and somehow, has managed to use global platforms to manoeuvre and invade the world with that melody that comes from our music.\u201d \u2014 Obi Asika.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObi Asika, Founder of Storm 360 Records and Co-founder of Social Media Week Lagos\n\nThere is no doubt that African music, especially Afrobeats \u2014 the melting pot of West African music styles blended with American Jazz \u2014 has gone global. It has become a norm to see non-Africans identifying with Afrobeats and enjoying the African rhythm.\n\nHowever, it didn\u2019t happen overnight. With the help of media companies focused on music and the Internet, Afrobeats has travelled across the globe as an internationally recognised sound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoey Akan, Founder and CEO Afrobeat Intelligence. Moderator of the Afrobeats session\n\nTechnology has played an outstanding role in the popularity of Afrobeats. From tools that create the melody Obi Asika describes as the \u2018sweet spot\u2019 to the platforms that have pushed those melodies across hemispheres and into the hearts of people with no ties with Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe early days\n\nObi Asika has been in the Nigerian music industry for several decades; he has watched the industry mature from the homeless mongrel to the behemoth that it is now. He is the Founder of Storm 360 Records and Co-founder of Social Media Week Lagos, one of the most significant new media and technology conferences in Africa.\n\nSpeaking at Techpoint Build 2021, during the panel session themed: Afrobeats to the World: Nigerian Domination, Asika explained the journey of Afrobeats from the beginning to where it is now and the opportunities that artistes and everyone in the music business should be leveraging.\n\n\u201cI remember then when you tell people in the West, \u2018I\u2019ve got some guys in Lagos that can rap better than anyone in the world,\u2019 they\u2019ll look at you like you\u2019re mad and ask who is interested in whatever young Africans have to say or do?\u201d Asika said.\n\nAccording to him, people in the West imagined Afrobeats as traditional music. Still, the sound has evolved through the years, retaining its African origins while mixed with sounds from different parts of the world.\n\nAmerican online education platform, MasterClass, traces the history of Afrobeats to the early 20th Century when Ghanaian musicians merged West African regional music with Western Jazz and Calypso to create highlife music. This was then fused with Western influences to create Afrobeats.\n\nAfrobeats continued to evolve, but its power was still unknown, not just to the West but to the Africans wielding it. A problem, Asika said, was solved by Channel O, a South Africa-based music channel.\n\n\u201cIn the mid-90s, young Africans were seeing people that looked like them on Channel O, doing amazing things. That generated a spur of energy for the next decade.\u201d\n\nAfter Channel O opened the eyes of Africans and the world of what was possible with Afrobeats, MTV Base Africa, a 24-hour music channel, continued the spur of energy. Social media took on from there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMTV Base Africa changed the level in terms of quality. By the late 2000s, we had Myspace, then Facebook, followed by YouTube,\u201d Asika noted.\n\nMusic streaming platforms changed everything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddy Awofisayo, Head of Music, Sub-Saharan Africa at YouTube,\n\nAddy Awofisayo, Head of Music, Sub-Saharan Africa at YouTube, agreed with Asika on how these platforms have helped Afrobeats.\n\nShe said, \u201cWhen people ask me the reason why Afrobeats is going global, I say it\u2019s the platforms. Not just YouTube, but Spotify, Apple Music, and TikTok.\n\n\u201cBack in the days, if you didn\u2019t live in Nigeria and wanted to listen to 2Face, you\u2019d need someone from Nigeria to bring you a CD. But now, you just go on YouTube and search for it.\u201d\n\nAwofisayo also added that platforms such as hers \u2014 YouTube \u2014 try to create initiatives that can amplify the voices and talents created in Africa. An example is Foundry, a programme that helps artistes grow their presence on YouTube and \u201cbreak them outside of their market.\u201d\n\nHowever, artistes are not the only ones who need support. Awofisayo pointed out that \u201cfor an artiste to be successful, they need an army of people around them. A great producer, songwriter and manager.\u201d\n\nIn light of this, YouTube also created a programme to support songwriters and producers. It was through this program Awofisayo got to know P.Priime, the producer behind the hit song, Infinity.\n\nThe importance of music platforms can also be exemplified through the amount of money they generate. Streaming services, for example, generated about $300 million for African artistes in 2021. This number is estimated to reach $500 million by 2025.\n\nWhile Asika believes that several platforms played a significant role in making Afrobeats go global, the talents that create the music play the biggest part.\n\n\u201cThat melody from our music is what drives everything!\u201d\n\nThe future of Afrobeats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Okpala. Spotify\u2019s West African Artist and Label Partnerships Manager\n\nSeeing music beyond art but as a product is what Victor Okpala, Spotify\u2019s West African Artist and Label Partnerships Manager, projects for African and Nigerian music.\n\n\u201cMusic is not just art; it\u2019s a product. It goes through a life-cycle as most products.\u201d\n\nThe reason Okpala wants music to be seen as a product is to see more investors coming into the space. Despite the growth that has been seen in the Nigerian music industry, there are still a lot of issues when it comes to funding.\n\nAccording to Okpala, the cost of producing high-quality videos is skyrocketing, and as Nigerian music goes global, it has to deliver world-class content. As it becomes increasingly challenging to create content that can compete internationally, we \u201cneed people to come into the space and fund the product called music.\u201d\n\nFor Henry Cocobassey, a Nigerian music executive and NFT collector, the future of Afrobeats is on the blockchain. Cocobassey told a story of how he collaborated with a Nigerian music artist, Challex D\u2019 Boss, to sell 10 thousand copies of minted non-fungible token (NFT) music in two weeks.\n\nHe said NFTs are like \u201ca new revolution where the artiste isn\u2019t the only one earning money off music but the fans too.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Cocobassey is a Nigerian music executive, NFT collector, and CEO of Unique Sirius.\n\nThis is only the beginning\n\nWith a 51.44% Internet penetration rate in Nigeria, Awofisayo believes Afrobeats has barely begun to scratch the surface of what it is capable of.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot more people out there that are not able to access the Internet and able to consume music on platforms like YouTube and Spotify,\u201d Awofisayo submitted.\n\n\u201cOnce we see the Internet no longer becoming a barrier, we\u2019re truly going to see how African music will blow up. Though we\u2019re going global, there\u2019s still so much opportunity on the continent that is unrealised, and I think the Internet is the barrier and once that goes away, what we\u2019re going to see will completely blow our minds!\u201d She added.\n\nObi Asika\u2019s future for Afrobeats lies in the home of Afrobeats \u2014 Nigeria. To him, the conversation about Afrobeats in the future will be based on who did the most in the \u201chome market.\u201d which is the most important market.\n\n\u201cThere are global moments, but the biggest opportunity is Nigeria!\u201d He said emphatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA close look at the numbers from 2021 reveals something that even casual observers must have noticed \u2014 the fintech industry keeps on pulling in the most money ($2.3 billion) of all sectors in the African tech ecosystem. In addition to that, it has significantly more startups compared to the others. Nigeria alone has 144 fintech startups, per Statista. In contrast, there are only 22 commercial banks in Nigeria.\n\nAn underdeveloped financial system, difficulty accessing credit, and a growing number of smartphone users present a huge opportunity for new and existing fintech players in Africa. However, this also means that there will be several startups offering similar services.\n\nJust like it is common to see Nigerians open accounts with more than one bank, we now see customers doing the same with fintech startups.\n\nMarking this register is another fact: these startups compete among themselves for a fraction of the market as there are still barriers to using these services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPreparing for competition\n\nOluwatobi Boshoro, CEO of Infinitetiks, believes that fintech startups can expect to see competition from startups on the fringes of the financial services sector. This, she says, is because consumers are getting tired of having to use too many services for their financial needs.\n\n\u201cIn Africa, a lot of the digital natives are becoming fatigued with the proliferation of apps, particularly with the kind of services that we have seen on the apps in recent times. And so you\u2019re beginning to find more and more organisations who are service champions who are beginning to come into financial services such as OPay and Safeboda,\u201d she said while speaking at Techpoint Build 2021 on the topic, Business model innovation: the rise of ecosystems and platforms based on changing customer attitudes.\n\nWhat does this mean for fintech companies?\n\nWith this increased competition for customers, Boshoro believes that fintech startups need to start offering the whole gamut of financial services rather than focusing on core banking services.\n\nCurrently, most fintech startups in Africa are focused on one financial service. This could be payments, lending, insurance, or banking. However, the same cannot be said of some of their counterparts in other sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake Safeboda, for example; after launching its ride-hailing service in Ibadan, the startup has since added airtime payments to its suite of services. eCommerce giant, Jumia has done the same, launching Jumia Pay in 2016 to allow users to buy airtime, take loans, and pay for products on the platform.\n\nSo what does this mean for fintech startups?\n\nBoshoro believes that this would drive consolidation in the ecosystem as startups either get acquired by bigger players or merge to get access to a larger customer base. This is a view echoed by Abdul Hassan, CEO and Founder of Mono, in his predictions for fintech developments.\n\n\u201cI think there will be a lot of mergers and acquisitions coming up next year because I feel like there are a lot of companies doing similar things. And it doesn\u2019t really make sense to have about 20 companies doing the same thing when they can all put together the demand power, the resources, and the talent to build something that is really massive out of Africa.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to consolidation, Boshoro believes that partnerships will become critical for survival. Companies, she says, will have to \u201cpartner with strengths as the focus to lead the market.\u201d\n\nEven with the current players in the fintech space, there is still room for more companies capable of effectively serving previously excluded groups. However, in all this, the African customer looks set to win.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

The flagship crypto fell more than 12% on Friday, January 20, 2022, going below $36,000 for the first time since July 2021.\n\nSince its peak in November 2021, it has lost more than 45% of its value. Other digital currencies have suffered just as much, if not more, with Ethereum and meme coins seeing a similar dip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding the crypto market\u2019s recovery, GIG Logistics (GIGL) seems to be taking a considerable risk integrating a crypto wallet into its proprietary delivery app, GIGGO.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means users can now perform basic crypto transactions like buying, selling, \u2018hodling\u2019, and transferring crypto right on the app.\n\nBefore the integration is made public, it will go through two beta phases. The crypto wallet will be available to 2,000 users in the first beta phase, and then 10,000 users will be onboarded in the second phase.\n\nThe wallet integration is made possible through a collaboration with XPAD, a platform that allows users to store, invest, and stake in real-world assets using cryptocurrency. XPAD users can import their wallets into the GIGGO crypto wallet. Those who do not have an XPAD wallet can create one on GIGGO.\n\nWith several crypto exchanges providing similar services as XPAD, GIGGO introduces an innovative way to onboard users to the platform.\n\nWhile the crypto space has been inundated with scams since Bitcoin\u2019s inception \u2014 making crypto users wary of the crypto platforms they use \u2014 linking XPAD, a new platform, with GIGL, a reputable company, creates a sense of trust.\n\nTo learn more about how GIGL is building a sense of trust to users, please read: Merging crypto with logistics: How GIGL is preparing for the future of payments\n\nLAMI acquires Bluewave to reach more Africans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLami Technology Team.\n\nDue to the traditional distribution of insurance policies by individual insurance agents, Africa has low insurance coverage. Add to this Africans relying on traditional channels for trade and policy implementation, and we\u2019ve seen customer satisfaction suffer, distribution costs rise, and the processing cycle lengthen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis then affects how premiums are paid. So, in 2018, Jihan Abass founded Lami Technologies to make insurance products available to all Kenyans.\n\nAlthough selling insurance directly can be challenging, they adopted a B2B2C strategy to capitalise on the trust that had already been established through channels that communicate with customers regularly.\n\nThrough an API, Lami enables businesses to provide digital insurance products to their users. Partner businesses can also use this to manage their insurance needs.\n\nTo make insurance coverage available to more people in Africa on a larger scale, the company has acquired Bluewave Insurance Agency for an undisclosed sum. Adelaide Odhiambo, who now works as the head of commercial partnerships at Lami, founded Bluewave Insurance, another Kenyan startup.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Bluewave has developed an online platform that enables clients to access micro-insurance products via various channels like USSD, SMS, WhatsApp chatbots, and web applications.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Lami will integrate Bluewave\u2019s technology into its core platform, enhancing its B2B2C capabilities.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this acquisition will allow Lami to enter new markets like Malawi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where Bluewave already has a presence. Consequently, the startup will reach more customers in these respective countries.\n\nLami, already present in Uganda and Tanzania through partnerships outside of Kenya, plans to expand into Nigeria and several North African countries in 2022.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nWhat are mental health difficulties and when to seek help.

          "title": "New payment system to allow naira across Africa",
          "text": "Nigerians can now use naira to buy goods and services from other African countries without the hurdle of converting to the dollar, thanks to the new African payment system \u2013 Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS).\n\nAfrican countries with 42 different currencies lose $5 billion annually as the cost of currency convertibility.\n\nThe new African payment system will enable Africans to transact in real-time on a digital platform with somebody or entity in other parts of the continent using their local currency, \u201cso you will not have to worry about converting to a dollar, or Euro or any other currency,\u201d notes Wamkele Mene, the secretary-general of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Secretariat.\n\nSpeaking on the first day of BusinessDay\u2019s African Business Conference (ABC) in Lagos, Kunle Elebute, CEO of KPMG, explained how the payment platform will work, saying the central banks of 54 African countries will agree on a single currency, e.g. the dollar, which their currencies will exchange for on the platform managed by either Mastercard or Visa.\n\nBefore the launch of the new African payment system, Mene said, \u201cIf you want to trade between South Africa and Kenya, you have to convert the South African Rand into the dollar, transact with somebody with a business in Kenya and receive that United States dollar, convert it into the Kenyan Shillings and then you can conclude the transaction.\u201d\n\nIntra-African trade is constrained; the lack of expeditious conclusion of transactions are the very challenges the Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) encounter as a result of 42 currencies in the continent, Mene said.\n\nThe new African payment system was officially launched on January 13, 2022, in Accra, Ghana.\n\nAccording to Afreximbank, PAPSS provides the solution to the disconnected and fragmented nature of payment and settlement systems that have long impeded intra-African trade.\n\nPrior to the introduction of the new African payment system, over 80 percent of African cross-border payment transactions originating from African banks had to be routed offshore for clearing and settlement using international banking relationships.\n\nThat posed multiple challenges, ranging from payment delays to operational inefficiencies and compliance concerns for the disparate regional payment systems.\n\nPAPSS is expected to reduce dependence on third currency such as dollar, Euro, Pounds, for intra-African transactions, Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), said.\n\nSettlement for intra-African trade used to require a third currency and a non-African correspondent bank. But Emefiele said with PAPSS the need for correspondent banks will reduce, and that will amplify intra-African trade significantly.\n\n\u201cThough intra-African trade is projected to surge following the successful implantation of the AfCFTA agreement, the launch of PAPSS provides a fresh vista of opportunity and aspiration for the African continent,\u201d Emefiele said at the official launch of PAPSS in Ghana.\n\nNigeria, Africa\u2019s largest economy, signed the AfCFTA on July 7, 2019, becoming the 34th member of the trading bloc.\n\nUnder the AfCFTA, Nigeria is said to gain from increased access to cheaper goods and services from other African countries, as its intra-African trade is low.\n\nIn 2018, Nigeria\u2019s imports from the African region relative to total imports, was put at 3.2 percent while the share of the county\u2019s exports to the African region relative to total exports was 13.2 percent.\n\nAs a percentage of total trade, intra-African trade is expected to increase to 35 percent from 15 percent over a five-year period with the infrastructure provided by PAPSS as payments and settlement bottlenecks are resolved, Emefiele said.\n\nWith the growing pace of digitisation of financial services, which has been accelerated by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, he said PAPSS can serve as a veritable platform for supporting e-commerce within Africa.\n\nRead also: AfCFTA\u2019s slow take-off exposes Africa\u2019s value addition loopholes\n\nAn originator issues a payment instruction in their local currency to their bank or payment service provider.\n\nThe payment instruction is sent to PAPSS. PAPSS carries out all necessary validation checks on the payment instruction.\n\nThe payment instruction is forwarded to the beneficiary\u2019s bank or payment service provider. The beneficiary\u2019s bank clears the funds to the beneficiary in their local currency.\n\nWith instant payment, participants no longer need to convert local currencies into hard currencies which then entailed the funds leaving Africa to be converted before being sent back again to the beneficiary bank \u2013 adding days to the transaction time. In addition, compliance, legal and sanctions checks are performed instantly within the system. Near-instant payments process within 120 seconds.\n\nPAPSS \u2013 enables the efficient flow of money securely across African borders, minimising risk and contributing to financial integration across the regions.\n\nWhether shopping, transferring money, paying salaries, dealing in stocks and shares or making high-value business transactions, PAPSS\u2019 real-time infrastructure provides a reliable, cost-effective answer for instant payments.\n\nPAPSS works in collaboration with Africa\u2019s central banks to provide a payment and settlement service to which commercial banks, payment service providers and fintechs across the region can connect as \u2018Participants\u2019.",

          "title": "Anger swirls around Buhari over Electoral Bill",
          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari may be in for civil disobedience if he fails to assent to, any time soon, the Electoral Bill amended recently and sent to him by the National Assembly.\n\nBuhari has, since 2015, refused to assent to the document for a number of times, fuelling the belief by many observers that his promise to leave behind a legacy of robust electoral process may be a pipe smoke.\n\nEne Obi, convener, Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room and Country director, ActionAids Nigeria, while speaking on Channels Television Wednesday, said President Buhari was toying with the lives of Nigerians and future of Nigeria.\n\nObi wondered if the President was playing pranks or gimmick.\n\n\u201cAre we going to wait for him again? Time is running out. In 2018, he rejected it about three to four times and we had to fall back on the Act that had lasted for years. We urge him to sign the bill. We cannot wait again. The Independent National Electoral Commission is ready to move; timetable for the elections beginning from February next year has already been drawn.\n\n\u201cBefore then, we have the off-season gubernatorial elections in Ekiti and Osun. The INEC needs the document to make adequate preparations, but here we are waiting for the President.\n\n\u201cAgain, the National Assembly spent a lot of time towards the end of last year working on the document; they were able to send it to the President for assent, yet nothing is happening and time is going,\u201d she said, rather angrily.\n\nShe also wondered what is difficult in signing the Electoral Bill, saying that if the President could sign the Appropriation and the Petroleum Industry Bills despite the issues raised in them, the Electoral bill should also not be an issue.\n\n\u201cIt is like toying with the lives of Nigerians. We have elections coming and you are tying our hands,\u201d she further said.\n\nBy the same token, Sam Onuigbo, member representing Ikwuano/Umuahia North/Umuahia Federal Constituency for Abia State and member of the APC, blamed some bad elements for frustrating the efforts of Nigerians to have credible elections.\n\n\u201cThe laws that we have are more than enough to have credible elections, but there are some individuals that have a mindset to spoil things. Let us have a level-playing field in our electoral process,\u201d Onuigbo said.\n\nThe federal lawmaker wondered why Nigeria has continued to be described as a nascent and fledgling democracy after 24 unbroken years of civil rule.\n\n\u201cAfter 24 years, we should be able to lay a solid foundation for democracy. It is not right that we are still being described in flowering words- fledgling and nascent democracy,\u201d he said.\n\nA few days ago, opposition federal lawmakers asked President Buhari to assent to the reworked Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2022 without delay.\n\nThe lawmakers, under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Assembly caucus, made the demand, at their meeting with the leadership of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the major opposition party.\n\nAt the meeting, Enyinnaya Abaribe, Senate Minority Leader, said: \u201cWe are asking President Buhari to sign the Electoral Act, which we have passed. We made sure that everything he complained about has been given to him.\n\n\u201cNow that we have bent backwards, no excuse or reason should be given again. Provisions of the bill are very critical for expected credibility of the 2023 general elections,\u201d he said.\n\nNdudi Elumelu, Minority Leader, House of Representatives, alleged that some APC governors were again plotting to stop the President from assenting to the reworked bill. He, however, urged President Buhari not to yield to the request of the governors but sign the bill because of its importance in strengthening the country\u2019s electoral process.\n\n\u201cWe met them; they said they want direct primary. We said okay, if it will mean giving Nigerians a very sound electoral reform, we will accept it,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThey came back again and said, oh, we have rejected it, we now want indirect primary. We said we agree, but give Nigerians electoral reform. They came back again and said; we want consensus. We have added consensus to the amendment.\n\n\u201cAgain, I am hearing that, among them, those APC governors, with their \u2018wuru-wuru,\u2019 are still plotting for the president not to sign. Nigerians are tired of APC. We promise not to let the people down. That is why we are asking APC and President Buhari to sign the Electoral Act. Sign it, Nigerians want it signed. No more delay.\u201d\n\nA former member of the House of Representatives and chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Moshood Salvador advised the President to urgently sign the amended Electoral Act into law to help sanitise the electoral process, because time was running out.\n\nSalvador said the Electoral Act was the solution to the problems bedeviling the conduct of credible elections in Nigeria, which had worsened in recent years.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIf the President doesn\u2019t sign it, it means, he has his agenda and it would affect the APC. That amendment is the way out of the problem bedeviling our electoral system. I mean the way forward for ballot box snatching, double voting, violence and all sorts of manipulations that have characterised elections in Nigeria in recent decades.\n\n\u201cThey are playing with us and they claim not to have money, but this thing would save the country a lot of money and human efforts that would give ultimately credibility to our elections.\n\n\u201cThis is the only thing you can do to protect our votes, make them count. Is like they are playing with time, so that the INEC people would say time has run out and even if he signs it cannot be used again. It appears some people are deceiving the President to do what would favour them and their constituencies.\u201d\n\nEddy Olafeso, former national vice chairman South-West of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), said time was running out for the President Buhari to do the needful, while expressing concerns about the state of the country and the ability of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct a free and fair election next year.\n\nHe however, implored public office holders to prepare ground for INEC to conduct a free and fair election next year.\n\n\u201cTime is running out for this signing to be done, there is really nothing I can say again about the country and the Electoral Act, but it is obvious all is not right with Nigeria now. All I want to tell the lawmakers, Governors and other public office holders is for them to prepare ground for INEC to do their duty next year; which is to conduct elections.\n\n\u201cAll this game they are playing would not help us. Nigeria is on the precipice now and they are just playing to the gallery,\u201d Olafeso said.\n\nAlso speaking in a similar vein, public affair analyst, Tope Musowo, said it was obvious some influential politicians in the country and in the APC are not happy with the Electoral Act and are putting pressure on the President not to sign it into law, urging Nigerians to stand and speak with one voice on the issue.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSome governors are trying to lobby him not to sign, they know that if we have free elections some of them may not win. Some people said last time that it was electronic transmission of results that they were against and not direct primaries which was the excuse President Buhari was giving to us.\n\n\u201cHe may have something in his slip, the Governors are there, he may not sign. Nigerians should put pressure on the President to sign, we can\u2019t be docile now. Democracy is about the will of the people and not about what few people want.\u201d\n\nIf the Electoral Act Amended Bill had been assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari since 2015 when the National Assembly sent the bill to him, many believe that Nigerian elections would have been more credible, particularly the 2019 election, and politicians checked because of the provisions of the bill.\n\nRead also: Buhari\u2019s APC has ruined nation\u2019s economy \u2013 NASS member\n\nSadly, it baffles many that the bill, which many think should be a legacy Mr. President, should leave behind against the criticisms, hardship and maladministration leveled against his administration, is likely not going to sail through, even when the ball is on Mr. President\u2019s court.\n\nIt also worries many concerned citizens why President Buhari has refused to give his assent to the amended bill, and also forcing people to ask the National Assembly to look for other means to pass the bill into law.\n\nChijioke Umelahi, a former Abia lawmaker and an Abuja-based lawyer, assured that President Buhari will not assent to the bill. He decried the development, saying that the President has deliberately refused to give his assent to the electoral bill since 2015 because of the crop of legislators at the National Assembly who are merely rubber stamps.\n\n\u201cIf the legislative arm is what it should be, we cannot be borrowing from every country, and it would have forced the president to give assent to the bill. The senate president keeps saying there is cordial relationship between the presidency and legislature, that is compromise and it is not good for democracy. They need to disagree on many issues, lobby and settle in favour of the masses,\u201d Umelahi said.\n\nThe angry lawyer noted further that in democracy the executive can always be checked by the legislature and judiciary arms, but that the reverse is the case in Nigeria because the senators and members of House of Representatives are not interested in fighting for the masses, but for their positions and pockets, hence money can always change hands for the executive to have its ways as President Buhari has done since 2015.\n\nToeing the same line with Umelahi, Terfa Ngusa, a Benue State politician, said the president will likely not give his assent to the bill because the National Assembly is not strong enough to compel him to do so, despite that giving the assent is his constitutional responsibility.\n\nThe Political Science lecturer turned politician said that the amended bill is for the good of Nigerians, but the political parties are kicking against it, hence the president is toeing party lines rather than national interest, which makes it more difficult.\n\nReviewing some of the new contents of the bill, which is part of the reason for the delay, Ngusa disclosed that the amended bill provides for direct primaries, which many party bigwigs kicked against, they prefer indirect and consensus primaries.\n\nAnother reason for the delay by the president is the electronic transmission of results, which, according to Ngusa, will curtail rigging by 80 percent.\n\n\u201cPoliticians are aware that the masses are suffering and are unhappy with them. They know that the masses can stop them with their votes, especially with electronic transmission of results, which makes it difficult for rigging. So, the delay is supported by those who fear that the new system will turn against them\u201d, he said.\n\nLooking at the Section 57 of the amended bill, which says, \u201cNo voter shall record his vote otherwise than by personally attending at the polling unit or voting centres and recording his vote in the manner prescribed by the Commission\u201d, the Political Science lecturer said that some selfish interests are contesting it because it will deny many people, especially in the north opportunity to cast their votes.\n\nBut Sam Onikoyi, a Nigerian researcher in Brussels, thinks that the president may not assent the bill for obvious reasons and the only way to get it done is by veto, which is allowed by the constitution.\n\n\u201cThe provisions of the amended bill seem good for sustainable democracy, amid expectant dividends for the masses, if not, it will not be contested by the executive the way it has been since 2015. I think the legislators should act in the interest of Nigerians, look for a way to compel the president to assent the bill, hold on requests from him, and sit on loan requests and approvals\u201d, he said.\n\nHowever, most observers think that there are many other critical issues, which the president has treated with levity and that the assent to the amended electoral bill may be given by the coming president.\n\nMr. President has refused to give assent to anything that will make Nigerians happy. He has not fought corruption, which he promised to fight, insecurity is at its peak despite his assurances, and Nigerians are poorer today all because of his policies. So, the amended bill is one of the least of his problems, if he has any,\u201d an aggrieved observer decried.\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n\nBuhari rejects Electoral bill six times in 7 years\n\nBuhari rejected the amendment bill for the first time in February 2018 due to provisions that reordered the sequence of elections.\n\nA second amendment bill passed by both chambers of the National Assembly and sent to Buhari in June 2018 was not given any consideration.\n\nIn July 2018, Buhari refused to sign another version of the amendment bill passed and transmitted to him by the National Assembly for the third time, citing concerns about the increased cost of conducting elections, among other issues.\n\nBuhari declined assent to the amendment bill for the fourth time in December 2018, after the National Assembly addressed all of his previous reasons for refusing to sign.\n\nBuhari stated in a letter dated December 6, 2018, addressed to then Senate President Bukola Saraki and Speaker of the House of Representatives Yakubu Dogara, that he would not sign the electoral bill while the country was preparing for the 2019 elections because doing so would cause confusion and uncertainty in the polity.\n\nBuhari promised in the letter that he would sign the bill after the 2019 elections, but when presented with the opportunity in December 2021, he declined once more. Buhari refused to sign the electoral bill into law for the fifth time in December 2021.\n\nThe amended electoral bill was passed by the National Assembly on January 25, 2022, and it provided political parties with three models of primary elections: direct, indirect, and consensus.\n\nThe most recent transmission of the electoral bill to Buhari marks the sixth time he (Buhari) will be tasked with signing legislation aimed at reforming the country\u2019s electoral system.\n\nThe amended electoral bill included strict guidelines for implementing the various primary election models. These guidelines are intended to prevent political parties from being forced to accept candidates.\n\nThe presidency issued a statement on January 31 titled \u2018Transmission of the Electoral Bill 2022\u2019 to acknowledge the transmission of the electoral bill to Buhari.\n\nNigerians are hoping that Buhari will sign the electoral bill into law as soon as possible so that INEC can begin planning for the 2023 general election.\n\nINEC had previously stated that the timetable for the 2023 general election would not be released until the electoral bill was signed into law.\n\nINEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu stated at a consultative meeting with political parties in Abuja on January 19 that \u201cas soon as it (the electoral bill) is signed into law, the Commission would quickly release the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 general election based on the new law.\u201d",

He pointed to other land cases like the unresolved Osapa London that has been on since 2013, and the multiple ongoing suits involving major landowning families in Ajah.\n\n\u201cThere will be regulatory and compliance intensity, with heightened title uncertainty in high profile locations. However, technology can be expected to take center stage in the sector this year, with extremely strong prospects for growth in comfort homes, led by demand from first-time homebuyers, millennials, young families, and empty nesters\u201d he emphasised.\n\nOguniran, who is also the CEO, Eximia Realty, observed that real estate thrives off the back of strong macroeconomic fundamentals, adding that the 25 percent homeownership rate in Nigeria reflects the challenging operating environment in the country.\n\nReinforcing Ogunniran\u2019s thoughts on the emergence of increased regulatory oversight in the real estate sector, the special adviser to the Lagos State governor on housing, Toke Benson-Awoyinka, harped on the need to curb fraudulent practices and emphasised the state government\u2019s commitment to sanitising the industry.\n\n\u201cThis year is going to be different as Lagos is going to tackle fraudulent activities in the real estate sector this year. We will name and shame when the time comes because the returns on investment is unbelievable so there\u2019s no reason to defraud people,\u2019\u2019 Benson-Awoyinka said.\n\nRead also: Building sustainable growth through investment grade real estate\n\nShe said the state would, in a few weeks, conclude the foreclosure clause in its mortgage law to build investors\u2019 confidence and provide access to investments when there\u2019s a default in the mortgage payment.\n\nBenson-Awoyinka emphasised the need for individuals that want to buy land to do their due diligence and engage the services of a lawyer when purchasing properties to avoid cases of fraudulent land allocation.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no clear title of land in Lagos called \u2018excision in process\u2019 as this means such land has not been allocated. You must search at the land bureau to ensure that a property has a clean title before you begin any transaction to avoid being scammed,\u201d she advised.\n\nAlso, Bisi Adeyemi, NBCC president and chairman of the council, observed that the real estate sector had become a major contributor to the country\u2019s economic growth this year.\n\n\u201cThe major objective of this event is to examine the opportunities, challenges, and, indeed, the threats in the real estate sector in 2022. The sector showed positive GDP growth in 2021 and has been identified as one of the sectors to look out for this year. We have assembled distinguished subject matter experts that will ensure we all leave here better informed,\u201d she assured.",

          "title": "THREAT TO 2023 ELECTIONS: THE DANGER OF SPONSORTING THUGS TO WIN OSUN 2022 ELECTION \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe illegal action of sponsoring thugs to win party congresses in Osun is a recipe for violence. Governor Oyetola is inducing violence in Osun APC by orchestrating thugs attack and manipulated the state APC congresses. The use of thugs in Osun APC by Governor Oyetola to conduct ward, local government and state congresses clearly shows the level of bad governance in Osun State. The illegality and the danger of sponsoring thugs to win Osun 2022 election poses a great threat to 2023 election in Nigeria. Every democratic system has to regulate the flow of money and use of thugs for political gains. Illegal thugs funding for Osun 2022 election presents certain problems to future elections in modern liberal and the emerging democracy in Nigeria. Sponsoring of thugs in Osun State fails to guarantee fairness and equality in the competition among candidates and political parties. The outcome of Osun 2022 election may not reflect the interest of the majority in Osun State, but the interest of the financier of the thugs. This will necessitates reactions in the form of violence, which characterized Nigerian political system in the post general election, postelection litigation, and postelection violence. It is important for me to emphasize that many democratic governments to continually strive toward reducing thugs and money in politics. The danger ahead of Osun 2022 election is that Governor Oyetola used thugs to conduct APC state congress and he is set to use thugs against other political parties that will participate in the Osun 2022 election. Governor Oyetola is now a threat to members of Osun APC and a threat to Nigeria\u2019s 2023 elections because he is not committed to free and fair election.\n\nI want to urge Governor Oyetola to concentrate on winning elections by the performance of his party and not by relying on thugs and violence for electoral victory. Good governance remains the surest path towards winning elections especially when you are committed to free and fair and credible elections devoid of the kind of violence witnessed in Osun State today. So instead of trying to pacify by violent and lawlessness just because Oyetola wants to win election, Oyetola should support the stellar performance being displayed by former Governor Aregbesola in Osun State, that way, he will not need the services of his thugs to win Osun 2022 election.\n\nGovrnor Oyetola has been sending thugs to attack members of Osun APC since 2021 so as to disrupt members of Osun APC meetings and prevent them from getting justice. Governor Oyetola is so sad that he will not be able to win Osun 2022 governorship election because of his bad governance. If Oyetola can rely on thugs to win APC PRIMARY, I wonder what will happen to Oyetola during July election. We are now seeing desperation and frustration in the behaviour of Governor Oyetola.\n\nThe attack on the Oranmiyan House, the political edifice of the immediate past governor and current Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola will not help Governor Oyetola to win Osun 2022 election. Osun state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola and some leaders of the faction supported by the governor are sponsoring attacks against Aregbesola\u2019s supporters. Governor Oyetola is pursuing victory without peace in Osun State because he lacks the experience of a leader and he is still behaving as if he is still working in an insurance company. These attacks are sponsored by the state government through the campaign structure of the governor, known as Ilerioluwa.\n\nThe hoodlums that attacking members of Osun APC were identified for the police in the state, but they were yet to make any arrest. I want to call on the Inspector-General of Police Usman Alkali Baba to act swiftly on these attacks.\n\nThugs working for Governor Oyetola have denied members of Osun APC from conducting ward congress and state congress in 2021. Thugs seized their voting credentials and beat them up to produce Famodun as state chairman. The inability to conduct a free and fair state congress in Osun is a reflection of what Governor Oyetola stood for in Osun. The 2,517 aggrieved members of Osun APC have gone to court. It is not Aregbesola\u2019s camp that has gone to court. They are card-carrying members of Osun APC. They are pursuing their rights. I want to correct the wrong impression about labelling aggrieved members as Aregbesola\u2019s camp. Aggrieved members have the rights to go to court. The implication of 2,517 aggrieved members of APC court suit is that Governor Oyetola has lost his popularity and now relies on thugs to conduct ordinary party congress in Osun State. Thugs cannot save Governor Oyetola from defeat in Osun 2022 election. I want to warn that 2,517 aggrieved members should not be reduced to Aregbesola\u2019s name.\n\nAggrieved members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State that dragged the leadership of the party to court to challenge the outcome of the last state congress in the state will go to court of appeal to challenge the judgment. A total of 2,517 aggrieved members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 26 local governments of the State of Osun have approached a Federal High Court, sitting in Osogbo, the state capital, to challenge the Ward Congress of the party, held on July 31, 2021 in the state. They are being victimised by political operatives in Osun loyal to Oyetola.\n\nGovernor Oyetola failed when he refused to submit Aregbesola\u2019s name for ministerial appointment but he was disappointed when Aregbesola was appointed as minister. Governor Oyetola failed when he used thugs to conduct Osun APC ward congress and now he is confused whether to revoke the certificate of occupancy of Oraminyan House in Osogbo. Governor Oyetola has resorted to the use of arrest and judicial harassment of political opponents since he is no longer popular in Osun. In March 2021 Olateju Adunni, the Personal Assistant to Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola was attacked by some hired thugs.\n\nThe popular Oranmiyan House belonging to the Honourable Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Ar\u00e9gb\u00e9sol\u00e1 has constantly come under attack because it the venue of the weekly stakeholders meeting of The Osun Progressives (TOP) .\n\nBystanders who watched the siege from a far how thugs armed with guns and other dangerous weapon unleashed terror on Oranmiyan House couldn\u2019t hold their tears as information has it that the floor targeted by the gun men was proposed to house TOP hierarchies meeting which was billed to hold immediately after the Thursday general meeting. Armed political hoodlums have been sponsored by Governor Adegboyega Oyetola-led IleriOluwa faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC), are currently attacking Oranmiyan House in Osogbo.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes from Osogbo, Osun State.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

This further renews the existing call by Civil Society groups for transparency and accountability of the management of overall budget appropriated to the National Assembly\u201d.\n\nThey also reiterate their position that adequate welfare for the legislative staff/aides is paramount to effective delivery of the core mandates of both Lower and Upper Chambers of the National Assembly. Just as staff/aides must not be bullied to silence or refrained from exercising their Constitutionally-backed democratic rights in the guise of an oath of office or any selfish reason.\n\nThe rights group called on the management of the National Assembly to uphold the practice and teachings of democracy by respecting staff/aides\u2019 constitutional rights, and desisting from such unlawful actions tantamount to violation of Constitutional provisions or major flaw of democratic core values.\n\n\u201cWe call for full transparency and accountability of allocation and implementation of budget as appropriated to the National Assembly, especially as it affects general welfare of staff/aides and constituency projects\u201d.\n\nThey equally called on the Office of Auditor General of the Federation to carry out a thorough and targeted audit of implementation of the total sum appropriated to legislative aides, National Assembly Management and National Assembly Service Commission, respectively in 2021.\n\n\u201cWe encourage Legislative Staff/Aides to never be intimidated from leveraging various democratic platforms in galvanising their views on governance, as such constitutes a right and not privilege under the 1999 Constitution and United Nations resolutions, the release added.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Sadio Mane made up for an earlier penalty kick miss with the decisive kick on Sunday in Yaounde as Senegal claimed their first Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) title.\n\nThey claimed the title with a 4-2 penalty kick shootout win over Egypt at the Olembe Stadium in the final match of the 2021 AFCON in Cameroon.\n\nThe Lions of Teranga were beaten in the 2019 final by Algeria, but they belatedly got their hands on the trophy after a dramatic shootout victory.\n\nThis was after a largely dour goalless 120 minutes though.\n\nMane had seen a seventh minute penalty kick saved by Mohamed Abou Gabal and he was fortunate to still be on the pitch for the shootout.\n\nThat was after he had avoided a second yellow card for a clear dive.\n\nBut the Liverpool forward had the last laugh, though, powering low past Abou Gabal after Edouard Mendy had kept out Mohanad Lasheen\u2019s tepid effort from 12 yards.\n\nBut the hero of the night could be Abou Gabal who made three good saves from Senegal\u2019s Bamba Dieng in extra time.\n\nHe had already saved four penalty kicks at the tournament by the time the match went to a shootout, against C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and hosts Cameroon.\n\nBut on this occasion the 33-year-old ended on the losing side.\n\nEgypt were the first to err when centre-back Mohamed Abdelmonem saw his penalty kick hit the left-hand upright and bounce away, only for About Gabal to immediately deny Bouna Sarr.\n\nHowever, Lasheen saw his effort saved and Mane won it with an emphatic finish into the bottom left-hand corner.\n\nThat meant his Liverpool team-mate Mohamed Salah did not even have the chance to take a penalty, with the Pharaohs captain set to go fifth for his side.\n\nSenegal had previously lost two AFCON finals, finishing runners-up in 2002 and 2019, and it is now time for Mane and the rest of the Teranga Lions squad to celebrate.\n\nBut Egypt will soon have a chance for revenge, with the two sides meeting again next month in a two-legged play-off for a spot at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.\n\nSunday\u2019s match had been dubbed a head-to-head battle between two Liverpool team-mates.\n\nThe match saw a free-flowing Senegal side with Mane as its attacking spearhead, against Salah\u2019s compact and defensively-minded Egyptian outfit.\n\nThe West Africans were handed an early chance to take a lead when Abdelmonem lunged in on Senegal left-back Saliou Ciss in the seventh minute.\n\nMane had words with Abou Gabal before placing the ball on the penalty kick spot, appearing to tell the goalkeeper to get back on his line.\n\nBut while the 29-year-old blasted his attempt just to the left of centre, the goalkeeper dived the right way and punched the ball clear.\n\nSalah was well-marshalled by the Senegal defence and only had two efforts in the first half, forcing Mendy into a good save with the second.\n\nThe second half became somewhat fractured as record seven-time champions Egypt, with coach Carlos Quieroz absent from the touchline through suspension, looking to break up play.\n\nExtra time was more lively as Senegal looked to take the game to their opponents, and Dieng saw a low, angled effort pushed away, and a good downward header clawed behind.\n\nThe substitute then had a long-range effort pushed behind before Mendy tipped over a fierce shot from Marwan Hamdy with three minutes remaining.\n\nHowever, it was a fitting win for Senegal who have been Africa\u2019s top-ranked side for the past three years under Aliou Cisse.\n\nAs a player, he missed a crucial penalty kick in the 2002 final defeat and was in the dugout for their loss three years ago.\n\nNow Mane was instrumental in their landmark success in Cameroon, having scored three goals at the tournament and set up another two.\n\nIn contrast, Salah\u2019s influence waned as the contest went and he ended on the losing side for the second time in a Nations Cup final.\n\nHe was part of the team which lost to Cameroon in 2017.\n\nThe Pharaohs went out in the last 16 on home soil three years ago but will not have too long to wait for the next tournament.\n\nIt is due to take place in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire in June and July next year.(dpa/NAN)",

But we still have about 40 countries that are yet to be launched officially. In the coming years, all these countries will be inaugurated officially.\n\n\u201cOur message is that of hope and to encourage our sons and daughter that no place like home, here in Nigeria we help them to protect their interest and ensure that they are not defrauded or victimized on any ground.\u201d\n\nAdams, the Global Convener of OPU, said the intention was to encourage business opportunities and also project the ideas of Yoruba cultural promotion.\n\nHe said: \u201cThrough our initiative, many, who have lost interest in coming back home because of the security situation in the country, are beginning to change their mind. The idea behind OPU is to improve the socio-economic prospects of all Yoruba sons and daughters abroad.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the idea behind the book which was unveiled in the presence of traditional leaders across different parts of the South-West, he said they intend to set the record straight and to rid the organisation of unnecessary misinterpretations.\n\nCorroborating his views, Chairman Planning Committee and European Coordinator of OPU, Chief Victor Adewale, who led delegates of Yoruba sons and daughters across six continents of the world, said that they are happy to be back home.\n\nAdewale said: \u201cPart of the programmes organized for this anniversary was our visit to the motherless and old people\u2019s home, where we gave a little of our kind gifts for their upkeeps. Also for OPU 10th anniversary, we embarked on various empowerments programmes for the widows and underprivileged people across the South-West.\u201d",

          "text": "Sadio Mane made up for missing from the spot in normal time to score the decisive penalty as Senegal overcame Mohamed Salah\u2019s Egypt 4-2 in a shoot-out to win their first Africa Cup of Nations title after Sunday\u2019s final finished goalless at the end of extra time.\n\nMane had seen Mohamed Abou Gabal save his seventh-minute penalty at the Olembe Stadium in Yaounde but Egypt could not capitalise as they went all the way to extra time for the fourth consecutive game at this Cup of Nations.\n\nSalah was due to step up to take Egypt\u2019s fifth penalty but with Mohamed Abdelmonem hitting the post and Mohanad Lasheen having his kick saved by Edouard Mendy, the Liverpool star did not get his chance and was already on the verge of tears as his club team-mate Mane prepared to strike the decisive blow.\n\nAfter two previous final defeats, Senegal are Cup of Nations winners at last, while Egypt missed out on a record-extending eighth continental crown that would also have been a first for Salah.\n\nSenegal\u2019s celebrations followed a disappointing final, the fifth in the last 11 editions of the tournament to be decided in a shoot-out after a goalless draw.\n\nIndeed Egypt had already twice won finals that had been settled on penalties after finishing 0-0, and they had already won in the same manner twice in the last fortnight, against the Ivory Coast in the last 16 and the hosts in the semi-finals.\n\nSalah\u2019s night\n\nThis time their luck ran out as the tournament ended at the venue where eight people died and 38 were injured in a crush on January 24.\n\nThe country\u2019s 88-year-old President, Paul Biya, attended the closing ceremony where he was paraded in an open-top car to hysterical crowds along with his wife, First Lady Chantal Biya.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino and CAF chief Patrice Motsepe were also in attendance although the biggest cheers were reserved for Cameroon great Samuel Eto\u2019o, now the head of the country\u2019s football federation, when his face appeared on the big screens.\n\nA four-time African player of the year and two-time AFCON winner, Eto\u2019o is one of the continent\u2019s all-time great footballers, but this final brought together Africa\u2019s current superstar duo in Salah and Mane.\n\nDesperate to make up for losing the 2019 final to Algeria, Senegal had a golden early chance to take the lead when outstanding left-back Saliou Ciss was chopped down by Abdelmonem in the box.\n\nMane stepped up, but his kick was too close to the middle of the goal and Abou Gabal was able to save.\n\nSalah needed nearly half an hour to make a genuine impact with a jinking run in from the right and a shot easily saved by Mendy, and the Chelsea goalkeeper then produced an excellent stop to tip a Salah effort over just before half-time.\n\nExtra time again\n\nAliou Cisse\u2019s Senegal team boast a plethora of stars based at major European clubs while Salah and Arsenal\u2019s Mohamed Elneny are exceptions in an Egyptian side still largely based at home.\n\nCarlos Queiroz\u2019s team are masters of the dark arts and the Portuguese coach himself was suspended here after losing his temper in the semi-final and being sent off.\n\nTheir coaching staff pulled the strings on the touchline, moving Salah into a central role after an hour, and substitute centre-forward Marwan Hamdy missed a glorious chance soon after as he headed wide from point-blank range.\n\nBy then it was clear that Egypt were willing to go to extra time again, sure that they could rely on more heroics from their goalkeeper.\n\nAbou Gabal, nicknamed Gabaski, clawed away Boulaye Dia\u2019s 100th-minute header after a fine cross by Ciss, and he also kept out a Bamba Dieng piledriver in the second period of extra time.\n\nWith Mendy saving from Hamdy at the other end, penalties were inevitable, and it proved to be Senegal\u2019s night with Bouna Sarr their only player to miss his kick.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to use his good offices and leadership position to urgently review and rescind the reported approval for security agencies to access people\u2019s personal details via NIN-SIM linkage without due process of law.\n\nThe appeal was contained in a letter dated February 5, 2022, and signed by the SERAP Deputy Director Kolawole Oluwadare.\n\nThe organisation urged the President to \u201csend executive bills to the National Assembly to repeal and reform all laws, which are inconsistent and incompatible with Nigerians\u2019 rights to privacy, dignity and liberty.\u201d\n\nThe development followed reports that some security agencies have received presidential approval to access people\u2019s personal details via the database of the National Identity Management Commission in the course of carrying out their duties.\n\nSERAP believes that the reported approval to allow security agencies to access people\u2019s personal details via NIN-SIM linkage without due process of law directly interferes with the privacy, dignity and liberty of individuals.\n\nIt also believes that a failure to rescinded the reported approval may cause millions of law-abiding Nigerians to feel that their private lives are the subject of constant surveillance.\n\n\u201cThe interference entailed by unlawfully or arbitrarily accessing people\u2019s personal details is far-reaching and must be considered to be particularly serious,\u201d the statement read in part, adding: \u201cInterference with an individual\u2019s right to privacy is not permissible if it is unlawful or arbitrary\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe power to access individual\u2019s details raises serious concerns as to their arbitrary use by the authorities responsible for applying them in a manner that reduces human rights and democratic principles by the monitoring and surveillance of millions of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is crucial to rescind the approval, and respect the autonomy of individuals to receive and share information of a personal nature without interference from the authorities, if unintended adverse consequences are to be avoided.\n\n\u201cThe risk of arbitrary or abusive interference shows the importance for your government to comply fully with the requirements of legality, necessity, and proportionality.\n\n\u201cThe right to privacy allows Nigerians to hold opinions and exercise freedom of expression without arbitrary or illegal interference and attacks.\n\n\u201cPrivate conversations of individuals \u2013 which belong to their intimate sphere and contribute to their personal development \u2013 also enjoy strong legal protection and can only be limited based on the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality.\n\n\u201cThe reported presidential approval to security agencies does not align with the principle that any restriction on human rights capable of limitation should be the least intrusive means possible, and shall be necessary and proportionate to the benefit sought.\n\n\u201cViolations or abuses of the right to privacy might affect the enjoyment of other human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference.\n\n\u201cSERAP notes that the right to privacy can enable the enjoyment of other rights and the free development of an individual\u2019s personality and identity, and an individual\u2019s ability to participate in political, economic, social and cultural life.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn relation to the requirement of legality, any limitation must be expressly, exhaustively, precisely, and clearly provided for in a law in the formal and material sense. It is not enough that the restrictions be formally approved by the president or by any other competent body: they must also be sufficiently clear, accessible and predictable.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, measures restricting enjoyment of the right to privacy must comply with the principle of proportionality, meaning that they must not unduly interfere with other rights of the persons targeted.\n\n\u201cIn the digital age, protecting the right to privacy requires exceptional attention. While acknowledging the challenging issues that your approval may seek to address, SERAP is seriously concerned that this may be used as a pretext by security agencies to violate Nigerians\u2019 right to privacy and other related human rights.\n\n\u201cThe undermining of the universality of fundamental human rights, alongside the potential encroachment upon the enjoyment of the right to privacy raised by the presidential approval, suggests the urgent need to review the matter, and rescind your approval, consistent with constitutional and international standards.\n\n\u201cSERAP notes that the relationship between data principals and the authorities involves a power imbalance. Nigeria ought to provide the leadership in developing a data protection framework that is fully consistent and compatible with the protection of the fundamental and inalienable right to privacy.\n\n\u201cAccording to reports, some security agencies have received your approval to access people\u2019s personal details via the database of the National Identity Management Commission in the course of carrying out their duties. The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami reportedly conveyed the approval to the relevant security agencies.\n\n\u201cMr Pantami also reportedly stated that the approval would enhance security as it would help security operatives to go after kidnappers and other criminals.\n\n\u201cThe approval would now allow security agencies to access the data of the over 73 million Nigerians who have linked their National Identity Number with their SIM, and other people who may do so.\n\n\u201cWhile the effectiveness of the fight against serious crime may depend to a great extent on the use of modern investigation techniques, such an objective of general interest, however fundamental it may be, cannot in itself justify the unlawful or arbitrary interference with the right to privacy.\n\n\u201cUnlawful or arbitrary access to people\u2019s personal details would contravene section 37 of the Nigerian Constitution 1999 (as amended), article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and article 5 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights, which protect against arbitrary or unlawful interference with one\u2019s privacy.\n\n\u201cAny constraints upon the right to privacy must strictly comply with the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality. These requirements are included in the Nigerian Constitution and the human rights treaties to which Nigeria is a state party.\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within 7 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter. If we have not heard from you by then, SERAP shall take all appropriate legal actions to compel your government to comply with our request in the public interest\u201d.\n\nThe letter was copied to Mr Abubakar Malami, SAN, Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, and Mr Isa Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy.",

          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has in the strongest terms cautioned the Zamfara State Governor, Bello Matawalle, for allegedly stoking and inducing violence in the state by orchestrating and manipulating the State House of Assembly to commence an illegal and undemocratic process of impeachment against the democratically elected Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Mahdi Aliyu Mohammed Gusau.\n\nAccording to the PDP, \u201cthis illegal process of impeachment despite a subsisting order of the Federal High Court, Abuja in suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/ 650/2021 portends grave implication for peace and security not only in Zamfara State but the entire North West region as well as the continued sustenance of democracy in our country\u201d.\n\nThe party through its spokesman, Hon. Debo Ologunagba said it is clear that this panic move by Governor Matawalle is induced by his realization that the mandate of the PDP, which he stole away into the APC, is on the verge of being recovered through the legal processes of the court and restored to the deputy governor.\n\nREAD ALSO: PDP Warns Lawmakers Against Move To Impeach Zamfara Deputy Governor\n\nAccording to Ologunagba\u2019s statement, Matawalle violated the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) in recklessly moving to the APC when there is no division in the PDP.\n\nHe asked Governor Matawalle to note that the people of Zamfara State are solidly with the deputy governor, who enjoys a large political following in the state as the custodian of the PDP mandate after Matawalle\u2019s infamous defection to the APC.\n\nIt added that any action against the deputy governor amounts to a direct assault on the will of the people which they will firmly resist.\n\n\u201cAny attempt, therefore, to strip the deputy governor of the mandate of the people on the grounds of baseless and unfounded allegations is a recipe for a serious crisis that can result in the complete breakdown of law and order in the State.\n\n\u201cThe State House of Assembly is, therefore, cautioned not to allow itself to be pitched against the people and destroy the State because of the bloated ego of Governor Matawalle whose political career is at its twilight.\n\n\u201cGovernor Matawalle must know that the people of Zamfara State cannot allow his personal frustration and ego to be exchanged for their mandate which is now embodied in the Deputy Governor,\u201d the PDP stated.\n\nThe party called on the Inspector General of Police to \u201cnote how Governor Matawalle, out of frustration has constituted himself into a security threat in Zamfara State and the entire North West region, where he is now threatening the lives of members of the PDP and other well-meaning citizens of Zamfara State\u201d.\n\nPDP further alerted Nigerians of how Governor Matawalle has allegedly been hounding members of the Zamfara State Working Committee of the PDP particularly, the State Deputy Chairman, Prof. Kabiru Jabaka, who the opposition party claims have been forced to relocate out of the State over threats to his life.\n\nThe PDP also stressed with consternation, that \u201cGovernor Matawalle\u2019s well-known connections and negotiations with bandits and terrorists and calls on Nigerians to hold him responsible should any harm befall our party members in the State\u201d.\n\nThe party called on President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC to immediately call Governor Matawalle to order and ensure that the action which the PDP terms a great assault on democracy especially the principle of separation of powers and peaceful co-existence in Zamfara State is halted forthwith.\n\nPDP through its spokesman further asserted that Governor Matawalle must be held responsible for any breakdown of law and order which can result in bloodshed in Zamfara State for which he can also be personally held liable even beyond the shores of Nigeria.",

          "title": "Oil Prices Head for $100 as Bonny Light Sells for $95",
          "text": "Oil prices continued their surge on Saturday, sending one of Nigeria\u2019s most valued grades, Bonny Light to $95 and Algeria\u2019s Sahara Blend to $97.48, in an obvious push towards the $100 mark.\n\nThe increase represented a 3.70 per cent for the Nigerian grade and 4.29 per cent for the North African grade, the highest level they have attained since 2014.\n\nThis is coming as the federal government through the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), in collaboration with other relevant stakeholders, yesterday embarked on a Joint Investigation Visit (JIV) to the facility of the Shebah Exploration & Production Company Limited (SEPCOL), which exploded on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO), Trinity Spirit, located at Ukpokiti field in Oil Mining Lease (OML) 108 in Warri, Delta State, was engulfed by fire during the incident, with 10 members of the crew still missing.\n\nOther grades of Nigeria\u2019s oil, which experienced a significant rise were the Brass River, which was selling for $94.13, an addition of 3.53 per cent and Qua Iboe, which hit $94.13 as at 6 pm Nigerian time.\n\nNigeria\u2019s most popular oil and the country\u2019s benchmark, Brent Crude was going for $93.27, a rise of 2.87 per cent while the United States crude benchmark settled at $93.27 a barrel.\n\nThis is happening for the first time since October 2014 due to ongoing supply worries and as frigid weather cascades across the US.\n\nThe latest rally was attributed to growing concerns that extended cold weather could hit production in the US, exacerbating the tightness in world crude markets.\n\nThe market was also watching developments between Russia and the West over the former\u2019s aggressive posture towards Ukraine.\n\nCrude benchmarks have been pointing upward for weeks on expectations that supply would tighten further even after the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers (OPEC+) stuck to planned moderate output increases.\n\nDemand remains on the upswing, with the Omicron coronavirus variant only temporarily denting consumption in major economies in recent times.\n\nOPEC and allies led by Russia, known as OPEC+, during the week agreed to stick to a monthly increase of 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) in output despite pressure from consumers to raise supplies more quickly.\n\nIn addition, Goldman Sachs has forecast Brent topping $100 a barrel in the third quarter, but that might come even earlier though insinuations are rife that OPEC+ may consider a faster unwinding of its production cuts.\n\nSeveral OPEC members, like Nigeria, are struggling to pump more despite prices being at seven-year highs, with the country unable to meet expected levels due to sabotage, waning upstream infrastructure and outright theft.\n\nNigeria was unable to meet its oil production allocation by OPEC in January, as it was only able to pump 1.46 million barrels per day of the expected 1.683 million bpd for the month.\n\nMoreover, the Group Managing Director, Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), Mr Mele Kyari, had said that NNPC\u2019s joint venture partners were unable to restart oil wells shut down in the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic. His promise of a 1.8 million barrels target by December 2021 had earlier faltered.\n\nThe surge in the price of Bonny Light indicates that Nigeria now has as much as $33 above the $62 per barrel 2022 budget benchmark.\n\nThe budget was based on the production of 1.8 million barrels per day, including about 400,000 barrels of condensate that Nigeria produces daily.\n\nIronically, Nigeria\u2019s external reserve at the weekend fell below the $40 billion thresholds it had maintained in over three months. This was according to data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nThe reserve had endured a continuous decline in recent months, owing to the intervention of the apex bank in the official FX market and sustained forex crunch in the economy.\n\nNotably, the reserve level had fallen to $39.98 billion as of Thursday, February 3, 2022.\n\nDespite the rising oil prices, the country\u2019s excess crude account had been depleted, while the foreign reserve dipped by $481.4 million in January 2022, following a $66.17 million decline recorded in December 2021.\n\nThe federal government had explained recently that the fund depleted from $72.4 million to $35milion in a space of one year, despite crude oil averaging higher than Nigeria\u2019s benchmark for the year.\n\nFG, Others Embark on Joint Probe of SEPCOL FPSO Explosion\n\nMeanwhile, the NUPRC, in collaboration with other relevant stakeholders yesterday embarked on a Joint Investigation Visit (JIV) to the facility of SEPCOL, which exploded on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe FPSO, Trinity Spirit, located at Ukpokiti field (OML 108) in Warri, Delta State, was engulfed by fire during the incident.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday by the NUPRC, providing an update, the commission said the fire had been successfully extinguished.\n\n\u201cThe commission will commence JIV with relevant stakeholders immediately in line with our regulatory oversight function for upstream operations.\n\n\u201cThe commission will further deploy its incident management strategy while also ensuring that the removal of the FPSO is carried out professionally to prevent an escalation of the incident.\n\n\u201cThe commission will continue to ensure that all safety and environmental measures are strictly adhered to in the management of the incident,\u201d the statement said.\n\nSimilarly, a release signed by the Chief Executive Officer, SEPCOL (in receivership), Mr Ikemefuna Okafor, owners of the vessel, confirmed that the JIV with relevant stakeholders and experts was fixed for yesterday (Saturday).\n\nThe vessel with a capacity to process up to 22,000 barrels of oil per day, inject up to 40,000 barrels of water per day and store 2 million barrels of oil, had exploded and sunk at the Ukpokiti Terminal, around Excravos.\n\nTHISDAY checks showed that the huge facility, TRINITY SPIRIT, was built in 1976 (46 years ago).\n\nThe asset is owned by SEPCOL, which in 2004 acquired all of 40 per cent of ConocoPhillips\u2019 equity interest in OML 108.\n\nThe vessel had broken into two and partially submerged but there was no evidence of spilled crude, sources said, adding that there could have been problems with the vessel\u2019s boilers, which they said kept no more than 20,000 barrels of crude.\n\nAn update provided yesterday by the company confirmed that the fire had been extinguished, while the search for the whereabouts of the crew on board was ongoing.\n\n\u201cThe management of Shebah Exploration & Production Company Limited (SEPCOL) in receivership, hereby provides an update on the explosion and subsequent fire that engulfed the FPSO Trinity Spirit located at the Ukpokiti Terminal, in the early hours of Wednesday, February 2, 2022.\n\n\u201cWe have been working with the relevant authorities and stakeholders to contain the situation and an investigation has been launched to establish the cause of the explosion.\n\n\u201cWe can confirm that the fire burnt out completely as of Thursday afternoon, February 3, 2022, and this has enabled closer inspection of the vessel. With this development, a Joint Investigation Visit (JIV) has been scheduled for Saturday, February 5, 2022, with the relevant authorities, stakeholders, and expert organisations.\n\n\u201cCurrently, there are still no reported fatalities, and we continue prioritising investigations concerning establishing the whereabouts, safety, and security of the 10 crew members who were on board the vessel before the incident,\u201d the statement explained.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

Nobody should threaten us. We believe in the unity of Nigeria and unity of Nigeria must continue.\u201dWike said the PDP would not give its presidential ticket to a candidate who would not serve the public interest.He said some desperate politicians were already plotting for a candidate who would serve the interest of the affluent few.\u201cNo amount of gang-up can make PDP give somebody who will want to run an election for the interest of some big men, and not for all Nigerians,\u201d he said.\u201cAnybody who wants to be a candidate of PDP must be a candidate for the interest of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, PDP on Saturday cautioned the Zamfara State Governor, Matawalle against manipulating the state House of Assembly to commence the removal of the deputy governor, Gusau.\n\nThe Zamfara State House of Assembly had on Friday served the deputy governor of notice of impeachment from office, accusing him of corruption and disobedience to constituted authority.\n\nIn a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Ologunagba, PDP said that the illegal process of removal of the deputy governor, despite a subsisting order of the Federal High Court, Abuja in suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/ 650/2021 portends grave implication for peace and security not only in Zamfara State but the entire North-west region as well as the continued sustenance of democracy in the country.\n\nThe PDP said: \u201cIt is clear that this panic move by Governor Matawalle is induced by his realisation that the mandate of the PDP, which he stole away into the APC is at the verge of being recovered through the legal processes of the court and restored to the Deputy Governor; he (Matawalle), having violated the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) is recklessly moving to the APC when there is no division in the PDP\u201d.\n\nPDP further stated that Matawalle should note that the people of Zamfara State are solid with his deputy as the custodian of the PDP mandate after Matawalle\u2019s infamous defection to the APC.\n\n\u201cAs such, any action against the deputy governor amounts to a direct assault on the will of the people which they will firmly resist.\n\n\u201cAny attempt, therefore, to strip the deputy governor of the mandate of the people on the grounds of baseless and unfounded allegations is a recipe for a serious crisis that can result in the complete breakdown of law and order in the state,\u201d it explained.\n\nThe party cautioned the state lawmakers not to allow itself to be used against the people and destroy the state because of the bloated ego of Matawalle whose political career is at its twilight.\n\n\u201cGovernor Matawalle must know that the people of Zamfara State cannot allow his frustration and ego to be exchanged for their mandate which is now embodied in the deputy governor,\u201d the statement added.\n\nPDP called on the Inspector General of Police, President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC to note how Matawalle has constituted himself into a security threat in Zamfara State and the entire North-west region, where he is now threatening the lives of members of the PDP and other well-meaning citizens.",
