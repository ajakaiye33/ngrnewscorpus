          "text": ".\n\nSoni Daniel, Abuja\n\nSave Nigeria Movement, a non-governmental organisation has warned Middlebelt Youth Forum to stop criticising the work of the Department of State Services and press for good governance in their domain.\n\nAt a news conference in Abuja on Thursday, the Convener of SNM, Reverend Solomon Semaka, particularly asked Middlebelt youths to prevail on their governors to pay their workers\u2019 salaries and provide infrastructure and programmes to promote the wellbeing of the citizens rather than dabble into security issues.\n\nThe SNM was reacting to a statement credited to the Middlebelt Youths Forum on Tuesday calling for the sack of the Director-General of Department of State Services, Alhaji Yusuf Magaji Bichi for daring to raise the alarm that some elements were plotting to incite ethnoreligious crisis in the North.\n\nWhile pleading with the Middlebelt youths to leave the DGSS out of their frustration, SNM, asked the youth forum to allow the DSS to do their job without undue interference in the interest of the nation and its citizens.\n\nAlso Read:\n\n.PDP screens 43 governorship aspirants in South-East \u2013 Vice chairman\n\nThe SNM Convener said: \u201cCalling for the sack of the Director of the DSS is shameful. Instead of demanding his sack, it is better to address the issues raised by the revelations in the DSS report. Criminal elements intent on causing civil disturbance must desist if not the full weight of the law will descend on them. Please leave the DGSS alone. Allow him to continue his good work.\n\n\u201cThis is a clarion call to all youths especially in the middle belt to prevail on their state governors to pay salaries with approved federal government scales to reduce the hardship people are facing in their states.\n\n\u201cYouths should hold their leaders accountable and resist being used as thugs and hatchet men. This is the highest duty of youths to their states and country. Making themselves available to be used by governors and political leaders must stop henceforth,\u201d SNM warned.\n\nThe movement stated that there was never a time the agency or its DG mentioned governors in its statement which drew attention to the fact that some elements were planning to stoke violence in parts of the country, particularly the North Central zone.\n\n\u201cWe are utterly surprised that the MiddleBelt group would ascribe a report done by an independent national newspaper to the DSS.\n\nSNM continued: \u201cTo put the records straight and address the misinformation and outright lies contained in that press statement, it is the duty of DSS to gather intelligence and inform Nigerians about possible threats. It is also the duty of the DSS to take proactive steps to forestall and quell internal uprisings.\n\n\u201d If the DSS has uncovered a plot by some persons it did not mention to incite violence and make the country ungovernable, then they should be praised for doing their duty professionally. The DSS works round the clock to safeguard lives and property in the country. This kind of statement coming from youths who should know better is disgusting and shameful.\n\n\u201cIt is easy to chronicle isolated security incidences to push home a false narrative that the federal government is not doing well or to divert people\u2019s attention from the situation on the ground in some states. It is, however, uncharitable to refuse to acknowledge the numerous successes the DSS and other security agencies are doing to combat insecurity.\n\n\u201cSuch behaviour is tantamount to wishing the state to fail. The good news is that Nigeria has not failed and its institutions are solid and delivering to the chagrin of corrupt and politically reckless leaders.\n\n\u201cThe federal government cannot use the DSS to witch-hunt any governor as was alleged in that pointless press statement. There will be no justification to go after any state governor simply because they do not agree with Mr President.\n\n\u201cGovernors are covered by constitutional immunity that protects them from prosecution. It does not add up to say that the federal government is setting them up. Why choose them amongst all others?\n\n\u201cMay Nigeria succeed and may criminal elements fail ten times,\u201d Save Nigeria Movement concluded\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".\n\nDirisu Yakubu, Abuja\n\nThe Akwa Ibom State Caucus in the National Assembly, on Wednesday, adopted and endorsed Pastor Umo Eno as their sole candidate for the May 21, 2023, PDP Governorship primaries and the 2023 Governorship election.\n\nIn a motion moved by the member representing Itu/Ibiono Federal Constituency, Hon Dr Henry Archibong and seconded by the member representing Ikot Ekpene Federal Constituency, Mr Nsikak Ekong, the lawmakers said their decision to support Umo Eno is premised on his integrity, entrepreneurial accomplishments and strong believe in inter-governmental collaboration and partnership to complete ongoing projects of Governor Udom Emmanuel and sustain the much need peace and serenity in Akwa Ibom State.\n\nThe parley, which took place at the Abuja residence of Senator Akon Eyakenyi saw 10 out of the 13 members of the caucus in attendance and witnessed by frontline politicians and former lawmakers of AkwaI bom origin, including Senator Effiong Bob, Senator Ibok Essien and Senator Aloysius Etok, among others. Senator Chris Ekpenyong, a serving senator, who was indisposed sent his goodwill and solidarity message through Senator Eyakenyi.\n\nAddressing the Caucus, Pastor Eno thanked the lawmakers for their support and solidarity, stating that his emergence as the preferred successor is nothing but a product of God\u2019s grace and not his political strength and know-how.\n\n\u201cI am humbled by the calibre of people here. I thanked God who found me through His Excellency, Governor Udom Emmanuel. The job ahead of us going into the next phase is very crucial. We must be able to convert our State assets into job creation to stem the tide of unemployment. The general national unemployment figures are not looking good. In Akwa Ibom State, agriculture will serve as the low hanging fruits that will create quick impact which must be explored\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am offering myself to provide service. I am ready for a public debate with any other aspirant on job creation with specifics on timelines for implementation\u201d.\n\n\u201d I do not know everything. I am not one of those who knows it all. That is why I will need your advice and support. You need that Governor that you can advise, who will listen to you and who will respect you. I will create a partnership that works between the executive branch of government and the legislature for the good of our people\u201d, he stated.\n\nPastor Eno said Small and Medium Enterprises, SME\u2019s, remains the engine room or even the advanced and developed economies, promising to reposition agriculture to play a major role as one of the biggest employers of labour. He promised to enthrone the sustainability of the prevailing peace, reiterating the need for the peace Governor Udom Emmanuel has built in the State to be sustained.\n\n\u201cStand by me, give me your shoulders so that I can ride on your shoulders. My aspiration is not an ambition but a calling to serve. With your support we will make Akwa Ibom State better\u201d, he assured.\n\nAddressing the gathering, the DG, Umo Eno Campaign Organisation, Amb. Assam Assam, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria SAN, said the endorsement by any caucus is a great political capital in any democracy the world over. \u201cYou are not just representing the people. You are speaking for the people. Today, we stand at a threshold of history. Akwa Ibom caucus has done well and would have done more if the country had a PDP government at the centre\u201d, he noted.\n\nAlso speaking, the National Chairman, Maintain Peace Movement, MPM, Barr Emmanuel Enoidem, thanked the lawmakers for their show of patriotism, love and oneness, stating that their endorsement by the national legislators is of great significance, following a similar endorsement by the entire State legislators.\n\n\u201cParliament is the major ingredient of democracy. Without parliament there is no democracy. We thank you for your support and I can assure you all that with Pastor Umo Eno as Governor, the future of Akwa Ibom State is guaranteed and prevailing peace will be perpetuated.\n\nResponding, the host, Senator Akon Eyakenyi, thanked the team for the visit, stating that it was a honour for the Umo Eno Campaign Organization to visit and consult them in Abuja.\n\n\u201cWe feel honored to have you come to consult us officially. We are with you and for you. We are the people\u2019s representatives. We have control over the delegates which is the first bridge to cross. If you have the support of the National Assembly caucus, go to sleep, victory is yours. We will follow you till the end. Your victory will be clean and landslide\u201d, she assured.\n\nGoodwill and solidarity messages were made by Senator Effiong Bob, Senator Emmanuel Ibok-Essien, Chairman of the Akwa Ibom State Caucus in the 7th National Assembly, Senator Aloysius Etok, leader, House of Representatives Caucus, Mr. Francis Uduyok, member representing Abak Etim Ekpo Ika Federal Constituency, Mr Aniekan Umanah, Deputy Speaker, Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly, Felicia Bassey, Dean, College of Commissioners and Commissioner for Youths and Sports, Sir Monday Uko, among others.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Olayinka Dada while addressing the media was quoted as saying \u201cAs you can see, Nigerians in all corners of the nation embraced a new beginning with their huge participation at the NNPP congresses because they are tired of the lies and corrupt nature of the characters in the two dominant political parties, the APC and the PDP\u201d. The people have shown that 2023 elections is theirs to decide by the decorous manner with which the Congress was conducted.\n\nThey loudly signaled to the corrupt leaders running Nigeria aground that they are ready to uproot them from political leadership.\n\nHon. Dada particularly praised Ekiti State members of the NNPP for adopting the consensus method in electing her leaders saying it shows they already have a clear direction different from claims to leadership by entitlement. From the lowest to the highest level of governance, our party shall contest for available offices with capable hands to save the nation from dwindling.\n\nHon. Dada said, \u201cgone are the days when Nigerians were divided on the basis of tribal, ethnic and primordial sentiments, we can no longer accept the political scavengers parading themselves for themselves at the detriment of our collective development\u201d.\n\nA new Nigeria is possible, and you have seen Ekiti people demonstrating by coming out en-mass for these congresses.\n\nHe charged officers of the party elected at Ward, Local Government and State levels to work hard in unseating the political parties he described as predators, the people\u2019s woes- APC and PDP.\n\nIn 2023, let us all change the destiny of our country. Let us enthrone capable leaders that can rebuild the ruins caused by these political scavengers. Only our party, the NNPP can guarantee that hope and that begins with your election as officers of our great party.

This emphasizes the special relationship that Edo State, as a sub-national, and the Italian government enjoys. We have had a long-standing relationship as you pointed out and are very glad that, under your leadership, we are hitting the ground running.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs you know, we are currently working on a lot of initiatives with the Federal Government and the Italian authorities, and this derives from what we have done in the past. In the past five years, we have been working with the Italian authorities and have been able to significantly limit and reduce the incidents of irregular migration and human trafficking in Edo.\n\n\n\n\u201cMigration has become a global phenomenon, you cannot stop it, but can only manage it. Our people love to travel, many have established and they are doing well, which serves as an impetus for many more who want to go.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut we have to regulate that process. That is where we would be discussing with you and the federal authorities. The conversation has started on the new structure for our response to migration; we call it migration 2.0.\n\nREAD ALSO: Protest as Obaseki sacks 513 sports workers\n\n\u201cHere, we are saying that in addition to what have been doing in the last five years, which is first to resettle those who want to come back home and integrate them into the society, we try to deal with the root causes of migration so that we can reduce the number of people who want to migrate as migration is linked to development.\u201d\n\n\n\nEarlier, the Italian Ambassador, who reassured of the continuous support of the Italian government, hailed the governor\u2019s efforts in the fight against human trafficking and illegal migration.\n\n\n\nHe noted: \u201cGlobal migration is a phenomenon that is unstoppable. This visit is another opportunity to look at it as a game-changer and fully share your vision and outline how we can work together, starting from the work you did in the fight against human trafficking.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s time to look at the migration clause that is legal and then create opportunities to attract investments from Europe, especially from Italy.

          "text": ".\n\nBy Luminous Jannamike\n\nThe Enugu state government has assured that Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi will not tinker with the zoning arrangement in the state, saying those opposed to it merely seek to heat up the polity.\n\nSpecial Adviser to the Governor on Media, Barrister Steve Oruruo, who made this known in a statement to journalists, noted that the authors of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) constitution even enshrined the rotational clause to ensure a sense of belonging, harmony and peaceful coexistence among various parts of the state and country.\n\nHe, therefore, said the Governor would not do anything to halt the power-sharing arrangement at this phase of Enugu\u2019s democratic history, stressing that zoning was the making of the founding fathers of the state.\n\nAccording to him, Governor Ugwuanyi is rather preoccupied with serving the people who give him their mandate, and so will not be distracted from his assignment by overzealous politicians.\n\n\u201cIt is possible that some people want to destabilize the government in Enugu State, but as you can see our peace-loving governor has maintained his focus. Notable leaders and elder statesmen have spoken and the situation is clear that zoning exist and must continue to exist in the state,\u201d he declared\n\nOruruo also said it was normal for politicians nursing various ambitions to make spurious claims about their capacity or influence, especially as the 2023 general elections draw near, adding that the governor does not take the monumental support of Ndi-Enugu for granted.\n\nHe said, \u201cHis Excellency is focused on his mandate and would not like to join issues with those who want to distract him or plunge the state into unnecessary chaos over political permutations.\n\n\u201cThere are many ongoing projects initiated by our dear governor, which he wants to see to their completion. The first-ever long span flyover at the Nike Lake Road T junction, which is geared towards relieving commuters of perennial traffic snarl has attained more than 70 per cent completion.\n\n\u201cThe 200-Bed ESUT Teaching Hospital project in Nsukka and other rural development initiatives are what the governor is particular about more than politicking,\u201d Oruruo stated.\n\nThe governor\u2019s aide maintained that Governor Ugwuanyi would continue to pursue his inclusive and ecumenist style of leadership, stressing that the approach has endeared him to many people both in Enugu and Nigeria as a whole.\n\n\u201cPeace and harmonious social co-existence mean the world to His Excellency, who, as a child of God has continued to restrain himself from joining issues with those whose stock in trade is stoking misunderstanding.\n\n\u201cThankfully, he had successfully engendered a reengineering of the political psyche of the people to embrace peace, conciliation and love for one another, as opposed to unbridled violence since inception of this regime,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Nobel Laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, has decried the protests by some Ile Ife indigenes over the appointment of Prof. Adebayo Bamire as Vice Chancellor of the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU).\n\nHe lambasted the protesters, saying Ile Ife people ought to have denounced the protesters for such \u201ccrazy\u201d agitation.\n\nThe protesters expressed anger that an indigene of Ile-Ife was not appointed OAU VC.\n\nSoyinka spoke at a lecture titled: The Politics of Black Intellection and Creativity, at the University of Pennsylvania, United States on Tuesday. His lecture was the first of the newly inaugurated Distinguished Lecture in African Studies.\n\nTraditional religious worshippers, dressed in white attire with other paraphernalia on Monday carried out fetish sacrifices at the OAU campus over the appointment of a non-indigene.\n\nThe playwright, who also said he had been \u201cunder a state of shock for a couple of decades\u201d over the spate of killings, kidnappings and other forms of violent crimes in Nigeria, added that those behind the protest in OAU should be \u201cruthlessly\u201d dealt with.He said: \u201cWhy should there be an Ife VC anywhere? An Ife person wrote me and said, \u2018look at these people disgracing us.\u2019 I told him go there and disgrace them. You are an Ife person. You should be in the frontline.\n\n\u201cThe Ife people should say those people don\u2019t belong to us; we don\u2019t know where they came from. And they should be dealt with ruthlessly.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand what they put in the water these days. It is crazy,\u201d\n\nFielding questions from Prof. Wale Adebamwi of the Africana Studies, Department of Africana Studies, University of Pennsylvania on killings and kidnappings in Nigeria, the Nobel Laureate said he was alarmed by the magnitude of the incidents,\n\nHe blamed both the government and the people who, he said, had not shown enough will to stem them.\n\n\u201cI have been under a state of shock for a couple of decades. So it was time I took my revenge and hopefully shock our own people just for exchange,\u201d told the audience.\n\nAdebamwi\u2019 had asked Soyinka whether or not his latest book,\u201d Chronicles of the Happiest People on Earth\u201d was a summation of his most recent frustrations about a polity that is believed to have used its immense human and material resources to produce one of the most embarrassing national outcomes in Africa.\n\nSoyinka stated that the things happening in the country were never imagined by him. He specifically made reference to the kidnap of students, saying it was \u201ca reflection of not only the government but of the nonchalant attitude of people.\u201d\n\nHis words: \u201cThings have been happening I never thought I would witness. Take for instance the kidnapping of those children under the guise of religion. More than 300 school pupils were kidnapped from a school, where we put them there to take their examination, going about our business, raise their school fees and they disappeared completely.\n\n\u201cPeople saw them going. They saw them being kidnapped. The lackadaisical response of the government at the time was a shocker. But it wasn\u2019t just Boko Haram alone. It isn\u2019t just ISWAP. It is what has been happening just among the generality of people \u2013 killing for ritual purposes.\n\n\u201cYou wake up, somebody has disappeared, the body is found, the vital organs removed. People kidnapping for ransom every day. Pick up the papers. This has been going on for decades. So, It\u2019s been going on for a very long time. And we are pretending that this is not happening.\u201d\n\nThe Nobel Laureate insisted that drastic action must be taken to put an end to the anomalies..\n\nHe said: \u201c\u201dI stated one time that anytime anybody is kidnapped in any state, let us shut down that state immediately until that person is recovered. It has reached that point that abnormal measures are absolutely imperative. It is no longer a choice. And yet the government continues to roll on.\n\n\u201cWhat exactly is ideology all about? It is about humans. The human is at the basis of all ideologies. So this has been going on for a long time. It is overwhelmingly making one feel impotent useless, staining what one thinks one has been able to achieve in terms of contribution to humanity\n\n\u201cWe have now to tackle that painful question: What is human? Somebody who is capable of taking another being, slaughtering that person because you want to make money, whatever the circumstances are. Is that human?\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s consider those who brutalise children, those who take children and sell them into slavery, which is what Boko Haram, ISWAP and the others have been doing. Are these human? Isn\u2019t it about time we taught all those souls about the human race?\n\n\u201cWe better start investigating thoroughly that question: Just what is human? Once upon a time of course people tried to define it along with race, colour, religion, gender etc. No. Now we must really get down to basics and then when we have a sort of lowest common denominator of what constitutes humanity, then we must be brave enough to know how to deal with those I have so identified If they are in a position of power.\u201d",

          "text": "From Fred Itua and Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nA week after a Federal High Court in Abia State declared as illegal Section 84(12) of the newly-signed Electoral Act, both chambers of the National Assembly, yesterday, resolved to appeal the judgment.\n\nIn addition , the House of Representatives vowed to report the judge to the National Judicial Council (NJC) and also warned Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, not to tamper with the new Act pending the determination of all suits.\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nLast Friday, Evelyn Anyadike of the Federal High Court, Umuahia, ordered the AGF to delete section 84 (12) of the amended electoral act.\n\nThe judge held that the section was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal, null, void and cannot stand. She ruled that sections 66(1)(f), 107(1)(f), 137(1)(f) and 182(1)(f) of the 1999 constitution already stipulated that appointees of government seeking to contest elections were only to resign at least 30 days to the date of the election.\n\nThe section reads: \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\nBut in a motion sponsored by George Thompson Sekibo, tagged: \u201cUrgent need to appeal the judgment of the Federal High Court Umuahia on Suit No. FHC/UM/CS/16/2022, senators argued that the power to make laws is vested on the parliament.\n\nIn his motion, Sekibo quoted Section 4(1, 2 and 3) of the 1999 Constitution, which he said was at variance with the court ruling. He said the Constitution also confers more powers on the National Assembly on any issue regarding the affairs of political parties and effective management of the electoral process by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution...

Letting this judgment go without concern will become a precedence on which any person could go to court and obtain a judgment to ridicule the good intentions of the National Assembly as an institution.\u201d\n\nAn attempt by the senate president to refer the motion to the Committee on Judiciary was rejected. In its resolution, the Senate agreed to accordingly appeal the judgment in Suit marked FHC/UM/CS/16/2022.\n\nAt the House, lawmaker from Katsina, Sada Soli, had moved a motion and told his colleagues that the court judgment was an infringement on the right of legislators to lawmaking. The legislators described the judgment as an aberration and vowed to appeal against the verdict.\n\nSpeaker Femi Gbajabiamila said he cannot allow the lower legislative chamber to be ridiculed under his watch.\n\nMinority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu, said there was separation of powers in the constitution which clearly states that no arm of government should take up the duty of another arm. He said the court should have interpreted the law and not interfere with the powers of the National Assembly to make laws.\n\nTahir Monguno, chief whip, said the principle of natural justice calls for fair hearing. He said the National Assembly is an interested party but was not joined in the suit. He said the judge should have made an order for the National Assembly to be joined in the suit.\n\nMajority Leader, Ado Doguwa, said Nigeria\u2019s democracy should not be allowed to run as a jungle system. \u201cWhatever the decision the court took is an aberration.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022Your days are numbered, minister tells saboteurs\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday deployed the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari as well as the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor to assess the level of oil theft in the Niger Delta.\n\nThe development followed public outrage against the massive stealing of Nigeria\u2019s crude oil, which had hobbled the country\u2019s ability to meet the quota allocated by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, had on Monday lamented the unprecedented rate of oil theft recorded in recent times and its debilitating effect on government revenue and accretion to reserves.\n\nThe governor\u2019s comment came a day after THISDAY reported similar concerns expressed by the Co-founder and former Chief Executive Officer of Seplat Energy Plc, Mr. Austin Avuru, who called for a state of emergency in the Nigerian oil and gas sector.\n\nHe revealed that up to 80 per cent of oil pumped in the country, particularly in the East, is stolen.\n\nAvuru spoke a few days after a businessman and Chairman Heirs Holdings, Mr. Tony Elumelu, also bemoaned the worsening state of the industry, stressing that about 95 per cent of oil production does not get to the terminal.\n\nEarlier, Aiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company (AEEPCO), operators of the Nembe Creek Trunk Line (NCTL) pipeline, had threatened to exit the facility due to incessant vandalism, perennial sabotage and outright theft.\n\nHowever, at the group\u2019s first ports of call in Port Harcourt, Rivers state, Delta and Bayelsa states yesterday, Sylva who described the perpetrators as criminals, said the deployment of top stakeholders by Buhari was to underscore the importance of the situation.\n\n\u201cWe have come because of the activities of these criminals. The government and the country can no longer afford these activities and that\u2019s why we are here. I don\u2019t want to say much, but we are going now, the CDS, myself and the operating companies and the GMD, we are going to overfly and see for ourselves what\u2019s happening.\n\n\u201cAnd then I can assure you that within the next few days, operations will start in earnest and we are very sure that we are going to be victorious in a few months.\n\n\u201cThe problem of security has come to the attention of the president and Mr. President has directed myself and the CDS and the GMD to ensure that this problem is handled once and for all,\u201d the minister said.\n\nAccording to Sylva, there are three elements to the solution to the extant problem, including the communities, as in his words, \u201cthese people involved in the illegal activities are not ghosts.\u201d\n\nSylva argued that since the perpetrators are from communities, the host communities need to be involved in finding a lasting solution to the menace.\n\n\u201cThe security too must be involved because you are the law enforcement arm of government and of course we also as part of government we must be involved and then the third arm, are the operating companies.\n\n\u201cAll the elements are complete now. We are here as government, the operating companies are here and of course we are going to the communities. So, I believe that finally, this problem will be resolved.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to stop it because we can ill afford the continuation of the insecurity in the oil industry. So I want to let everybody know that these criminals have their days numbered.\n\n\u201cWe are here to ensure that this problem is finally resolved and to reclaim this industry for the country because this country has lost so much from the activities of these criminals and the government and country can no longer afford these activities and that\u2019s why we are here,\u201d he maintained.\n\nIn his comments, Kyari stated that the government had concluded plans to move against oil bunkering, pipeline vandalism and illegal activities threatening the country\u2019s oil sector.\n\nKyari noted that the government would leave no stone unturned to arrest the increasing spate of oil theft and destruction of the environment which had cost the country foreign exchange earnings.\n\nThe team which visited various sites where illegal oil refineries were being carried out, he said, was on a mission to ensure that illegal oil refining and theft of crude oil was halted.\n\nAt Ibaa which is in Emeoha Local Government of the state, Kyari and the team ordered the destruction of several illegal sites.\n\nSpeaking with journalists at Ibaa, Kyari said the country could no longer afford to see her oil illegally exploited and stolen. He pointed out that the strategy being adopted would finally arrest the situation.\n\nHe commended the security team in the effort to stop denying the country the much needed resources for economic development.\n\nThe NNPC GMD warned that stakeholders are not being left out in the quest to find a lasting solution, adding that the Navy were also on top of the situation, assuring that the task of destroying illegal oil refinery will not stop until the problem is resolved.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

It agreed on Senator Iyiola Omisore for National Secretary. Other positions will be filled through the Unity List being worked out by the governors. The Unity List is expected to contain names of candidates for all positions. Anyone who is still bent on contesting is free to do so, but once outside the unity list, it\u2019s surely going to be a losing game as the governors control the delegates who will vote at the convention.\n\nBuhari, at a meeting with the governors, warned against frittering away the gains of the government and the party as a result of in-fighting. He later met with some of the intending chairmanship hopefuls, to discuss how to manage the many tendencies ahead of the convention.\n\nOmisore is believed to have the backing of his Osun State governor, Gboyega Oyetola, who many allege may need the national officer to fight Rauf Aregbesola.\n\nHowever, briefing newsmen after a meeting between Buhari and the APC governors at State House, Abuja, Chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF) and Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, said those opposed to the consensus option were equally free to contest for any of the party offices.\n\nThat was as Chairman of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of APC, and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, warned the media against setting party stakeholders against one another to ignite crisis, a few days to the national convention.\n\nNotwithstanding, the screening committee of the party, yesterday, extended the screening of aspirants vying for various party positions by one day ahead of the convention.\n\nAPC selected 180 delegates to represent the Anambra State chapter of the party at the national convention on Saturday.\n\nAt the same time, following the court case filed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) against Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State and his Deputy, challenging their defection to the APC. Chairman of APC in the state, Alphonsus Ogar Eba, expressed optimism that the judgement, slated for Friday, would be in the favour of the governor and his deputy.\n\nWhile meeting with the APC governors, Buhari stated, \u201cOver the last seven years we have done our best to deliver good governance to the country. We have guaranteed national food security, we have provided modern infrastructure to kick-start economic growth and we have implemented the most comprehensive social welfare programmes in our history.\n\n\u201cAlong the way, our party has survived shocks and attempts to derail it. Our government has also had to endure the worst economic crisis with the free fall of oil prices from an average of $100 per barrel over 15 years of PDP government to an average of $30 \u2013 $50 until the recent energy crisis.\n\n\u201cWe need to remind ourselves of these achievements and not be diverted by petty quarrels and unseemly jockeying for positions. It will be very sad and regrettable development if these manifest gains are frittered away as a result of internal dissent and rivalry.\n\n\u201cWe must avoid narrow focus and inordinate personal ambitions at the expense of our party\u2019s common good. We must stop frivolous and diversionary litigationss when the party\u2019s reconciliation processes are available for settling disputes. We must restore sanity and purpose in the affairs of our party and lead ourselves to victory and safety.\u201d\n\nThe president later met with all the seven chairmanship aspirants of APC. The meeting held over dinner at the official residence of the president at State House, Abuja.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the meeting, which began at 8pm, also had in attendance Buni, Chief of Staff to the President, Professor Ibrahim Gambari, and Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha.\n\nAt the meeting with the seven aspirants, it was learnt that the president stressed the need for the aspirants to embrace consensus to avoid acrimony.\n\nThe aspirants that attended the meeting were Minister of Special Duties, George Akume; Senator representing Niger East Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Mohammed Sani Musa; former Deputy National Chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change, Saliu Mustapha; and Mohammed Etsu.\n\nOthers were former Nasarawa State governor and serving Senator Tanko Al-Makura; former governor of Nasarawa State and Senator representing Nasarawa West, who is believed to be Buhari\u2019s preferred candidate, Senator Adamu Abdullahi; and former Governor of Zamfara State, Abdul Aziz Yari.\n\nBut Bagudu, who spoke on behalf of his colleagues at the meeting with the president, numbering 15, said the governors took turns to brief Buhari on steps being taken to ensure that consensus candidates emerged at all levels.\n\nHe stressed that the PGF was in support of the chairmanship candidate being backed by Buhari, although, he refused to name the candidate. Buhari was weeks ago alleged to have settled for Adamu as consensus chairman for the party.\n\nAccording to Bagudu, \u201cMr. President has always urged consensus for all positions, because consensus is in accordance with democratic tenets and once you have leaders, who are established, who are working towards the same goal, yes, we might have our individual differences, like was once carefully explained by Governor El-Rufai.\n\n\u201cBut on the principle of ensuring that we get leadership that will hit the ground running, we are united, and to that extent, will support any process that will lead to consensus and the emergence of leaders without the need for election.\n\n\u201cToday, we all briefed Mr. President on the issue of distributing political party offices to the respective zones and our support for Mr. President\u2019s endorsement of the candidate for the National Chairman of the party and the various geo-political zones.\n\n\u201cWe took turns to brief Mr. President on what they have been doing to generate consensus in their respective zones among the National Working Committee (NWC) and zonal party positions that have been either allocated to the zones or which the zones are entitled to.\n\n\u201cMost of the zones have been allocated NWC positions that are fewer than the number of states. However, there are zonal executive committees from which the zones are working to produce a consensus list.\n\n\u201cSo, this afternoon, the respective zones \u2013 Governor Abubakar Bello briefed on behalf of the North-central; Governor Babagana Zulum on behalf of the North-east; Governor Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa State on behalf of North-west; Governor Dave Umahi, on behalf of South-east; Governor Kayode Fayemi briefed the president on behalf of the South-west. I further mentioned the position of the South-south to Mr. President, as I had on paper.\n\n\u201cSo, Mr. President appreciated the briefing and restated his gratitude for the work the governors have been doing in support for the party and preparation for the National Convention.\u201d\n\nThe Kebbi State governor further reiterated that aspirants that were against the consensus option were free to run at the convention, saying APC, as a democratic party would not bar anybody from exercising their rights.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cOur party is a democratic party. We will always urge consensus; we\u2019ll urge respect for the decisions of the party, because the distribution of political party offices here has been approved by the highest organ of the party, which is the National Caretaker Committee, because they were acting in their capacity as the National Executive Committee of the party. But where people still choose to go against the grain, whatever the party constitution allows them, because we wouldn\u2019t do anything undemocratic.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that the meeting with Buhari also agreed that everything should be put in place for the party to have a successful convention come March 22, by supporting all the decisions taken by the Buni-led caretaker committee and those taken in his absence.\n\nHis words, \u201cSome of you may recall that last week, there was a letter that was widely circulated in the media, addressed to me as the chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum and copied to a number of others, including the chairman of the Caretaker Committee, the acting Chairman of the Caretaker Committee and, indeed, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation.\n\n\u201cThat letter led to a series of actions, including meetings between the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Chairman of the National Caretaker Committee, Acting Chairman, Governor Abubakar Bello of Niger State, as he was then, and myself.\n\n\u201cWe all restated our commitment to working together to ensure that the convention takes place on March 26, 2022 and then, we agreed to support all the decisions that were taken by the caretaker committee, both acting as a working committee and acting with the donated powers given to it by the National Executive Committee.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the chairman of the caretaker, upon his return, also appreciated what the caretaker committee did and the decisions that were taken in his absence.\u201d\n\nBuni Warns Media against Igniting Crisis in APC\n\nChairman of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of APC and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, warned the media against setting party stakeholders against one another and igniting an crisis a few days to the party\u2019s national convention slated for Saturday, March 26.\n\nBuni, in a statement yesterday by his Director General, Press and Media Affairs, Mr. Mamman Mohammed, described the media report, which suggested a victor and vanquished positions \u201cas irresponsible and deliberately intended to instigate disaffection and acrimony among the critical stakeholders of the party.\u201d\n\nThe reports were gleaned from recent happenings in the party.\n\nBuni noted that since the intervention of Buhari via a press statement issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media, Malam Garba Shehu, calling on stakeholders to shun media backstabbing and name-calling, APC governors and all other stakeholders had obliged to the presidential directive.\n\nHe added that upon his return and assumption of office as chairman of the party, he described the incident as a past event, declaring that there is no victor, no vanquished.\n\nBuni also commended his colleagues in the caretaker committee for the great job they had done under the acting chairmanship of Niger State Governor, Abubakar Sani Bello.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it is irrational, absurd and irresponsible for anyone to at this moment initiate animosity and resentment among the stakeholders, who are working assiduously for the success of the upcoming convention,\u201d Buni said.\n\nThe Yobe State governor stressed that the governors and other critical stakeholders were now heading various sub-committees of the convention and had been meeting with him to ensure a successful arrangement for the convention.\n\nHe said, \u201cTherefore, it amounts to irresponsibility for anyone to write an injurious opinion in complete disregard to the directive from the president. The party and all stakeholders would not condone such disrespect to the president to deliberately cause confusion and divert attention from the cause of having a fruitful convention.\n\n\u201cThe authors of such baseless, flimsy, and unwarranted articles, should be cautious of the negative impact of such deliberate sabotage on the party and the good relationship between the governors and their followers.\u201d\n\nBuni advised the authors to either work for the unity of APC or just watch if they had nothing to contribute positively. He said the party remained a united family, with much respect for the president, adding that they are collectively committed to the success of the convention, assuring all that the APC would not be distracted from the noble cause of moving forward.\n\nScreening of Aspirants Extended by One Day\n\nAPC, yesterday, extended the screening of aspirants vying for various party positions by one day, meaning the screening that was supposed to end yesterday will now end today. The one day extension was due to the number of aspirants jostling for positions, which apparently overwhelmed the committee.\n\nThe Screening Committee chaired by Governor of Kastina State, Aminu Masari, had planned to screen all aspirants for positions in the National Working Committee (NWC) on Tuesday and complete the assignment on Wednesday with the screening of Non-NWC and zonal positions.\n\nTHISDAY checks revealed that the committee screened six out of the seven national chairmanship aspirants on Tuesday, as well as Deputy National Chairmanship aspirants for North and South and National Secretary aspirants.\n\nYesterday, the committee screened Senator Abdullahi Adamu and a few other aspirants for NWC offices and aspirants for zonal offices.\n\nThe committee also screened all the national chairmanship aspirants, deputy national chairmanship, national secretary, and national vice chairmen for the six zones.\n\nA source at the Kastina State Governor\u2019s Lodge, venue of the exercise, said the committee would request for time extension.\n\nThe officer, who did not want his identity publicised, said, \u201cThough the committee may have been told not to disqualify any aspirant, they are bent on due diligence by ensuring that all aspirants have the minimum qualification. This is a move to stall any legal action after the convention.\n\n\u201cWith the volume of work to be done and with the template for a thorough screening, the two days assigned for the exercise is grossly inadequate. The committee chairman, His Excellency, Governor Bello Masari, may approach the caretaker committee for a day extension.\u201d\n\nThe screening of aspirants for zonal offices continued yesterday as at press time.\n\nMeanwhile, a chieftain of APC, Mr. Longers Anyawu, appealed to delegates to the APC national convention to support Senator Abdullahi Adamu to emerge as National Chairman of the party on Saturday.\n\nAnyanwu, in a statement, described Adamu as a de-tribalised Nigerian, who will stabilise, unify and reposition the party for electoral victories.\n\nAnyanwu described Adamu as, \u201cA tested politician that has run several elections and lost none. We need somebody, who knows how to play the game by the rules.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cToday, opposition political parties are jittery, because a new sheriff that knows how to lead is coming to take over, not a makeshift leader. If we vote and ratify the chairmanship of Senator Abdullahi Adamu, 2023 electoral victories are assured.\u201d\n\nAnambra Selects 180 Delegates for Saturday\u2019s Convention\n\nThe Anambra State chapter of APC selected 180 delegates to represent it at the national convention on Saturday. The delegates were drawn from the 21 local government areas, and their names were announced at the state party secretariat in Awka yesterday evening by the state chairman, Sir Basil Ejidike.\n\nEjidike announced the names during the inauguration of the state zonal and local government executive committees.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe delegates were selected according to APC Constitution, from the state exco, LGA executive and political office holders.\u201d\n\nWhile congratulating the newly inaugurated state officers, Ejidike, said, \u201cI wish to restate and draw your attention to the essence of a political party. All political parties\u2019 interest is to win elections and advance the course of their environment.\n\n\u201cThe APC has all it takes to achieve this and more. Therefore, we must all put our hands on deck to reposition the party, and as well win elections.\n\n\u201cThis is achievable in Anambra, being that we have both the human and material resources needed. As a new family, we are poised to galvanise and harness our diverse potentials and resources to put our party in political positions in our dear state.\n\n\u201cIt is, indeed, factual that the APC-led federal government has benefitted Anambra State and people in terms of infrastructural development, human capacity building, and empowerment.\n\n\u201cThese have reposed on us all the onerous task of leading the people of Anambra into the mainstream politics of Nigeria. This we must accomplish. In a very special way, I appreciate the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, His Excellency Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, for his giant development strides in Anambra State.\u201d\n\nAPC Optimistic about Court Judgement on Ayade, Deputy\n\nChairman of APC in Cross State, Alphonsus Ogar Eba, said the court judgement challenging the defection of Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State and his deputy, slated for Friday, would be in favour of the governor and his deputy.\n\nEba, who reacted to the case filed by the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), gave the assurance yesterday, and explained that there was simply a misunderstanding in the judgement made earlier by the court.\n\nEba, who was on the Morning Show of Arise News Channel, shed more light on Justice Taiwo Taiwo\u2019s rejection of the claim that the lawmakers had not become registered members of the party and explained that a body of a fractionalised PDP expelled them, rendering them handicapped.\n\nHe noted that they did not defect neither was it their desire to leave the party, but that the APC took them in, after they were expelled by PDP.\n\nEba stated, \u201cThe document before the court of Justice Taiwo is to the effect that these lawmakers had been expelled from the party. The records are there. Mai Mala Buni is a chairman of a party, he saw that people were expelled from PDP and he was looking for people to convert into the party. The beauty of why I love the APC is that they look for assets.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of jurisdiction, Eba said it was a settled matter, noting that the Supreme Court judgement by Justice Walter Onnoghen and others, had settled the matter.\n\nEba stated, \u201cI\u2019m interested in expounding a jurisprudence of law and the issue of judgement coming on Friday, we are not bothered. It can go anywhere but we know we have our right of appeal. There is no way that the clear provision of the law will not be adhered to. The law, as it is, and not the law as it ought to be is the jurisprudence of law.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about zoning of the governorship in 2023 to the southern senatorial district, he said the issue would not be a problem for them in APC, but had always been a problem that existed in the opposition party particularly, in the PDP\n\nThe lawmaker said, \u201cIn recent times, we have listened to some members of our party, and I believe that what is fair is that the governorship should move to the southern senatorial district. But at the state level, all our views will be brought to the table; the governor\u2019s, mine and every member of APC will be looked at.\u201d\n\nSharing his perspective on happenings in Cross River State, too, a member of the PDP, and senator for Cross River North in the National Assembly, Jarigbe Agom Jarigbe, described Eba as a factional chairman of APC and not substantive as he claimed.\n\nJarigbe further called him a pathological liar as there was no document backing the expulsion claims of Governor Ben Ayade and others being put in the purview of the public, saying the party wasn\u2019t an appendage of Government House, and the facts were very clear.\n\nJarigbe alleged that the governor gave out orders to the police to take over the House of Assembly in the state, adding that he was known for that type of brutality. He said there was evidence that there was over-voting in areas that were hijacked as the number of accredited voters was less than the number of the total votes scored in that election.\n\nJarigbe said, \u201cWe are before the court, we applied for certified true copies of the data from the Bimodal machine. It has proven that there was over-voting. We have asked that those polling units be cancelled and if that happens, we will win with an overwhelming majority. Nigeria is not a banana republic. Those things will be fixed.\u201d\n\nChairmanship Aspirant Promises to Reserve Deputy Positions for Women, Youth\n\nA frontline chairmanship aspirant of APC, Alhaji Saliu Mustapha, promised to reserve all deputy positions for women and youths in the party. Mustapha made this known yesterday during his consultation with the APC House of Representatives caucus in Abuja.\n\nHe said the gesture would create a process of mentoring the younger ones in the country, and give competent young women and youth the opportunity to lead.\n\nMustapha believed the country lacked a solid platform for building or mentoring the younger ones to take over, saying, \u201cWe must have a new approach to things and do things differently.\u201d\n\nMustapha promised that if given the opportunity, he would create a progressive party, where lawmakers would be able to archive their achievements.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere was need to preach and enthrone internal democracy. Once there is no justice, the party will not have a healthy house. The party was at a very critical stage of its transformation and, therefore, needs strategy on how to win election.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t win election as a ruling party, some of the good works we are doing may be truncated. So, do not look at me on a face value, but what can guarantee our party\u2019s victory in general election.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Saraki intensifies consultation, meets PDP stakeholders\n\nChuks Okocha\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar declared his presidential aspiration yesterday in Abuja, saying Nigeria is a sinking ship that must be rescued urgently.\n\nIt was the sixth time Atiku would be bidding for the presidential seat since the inception of the Fourth Republic in 1999.\n\nThe former vice president said the 2023 presidential election was a referendum for Nigerians to choose between greatness and continued destruction as well as backwardness.\n\nAtiku\u2019s presidential declaration came as former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, intensified consultation with Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) stakeholders, including senators and members of the House of Representatives over his presidential bid.\n\nAtiku had contested against Chief MKO Abiola in 1993 on the platform of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). He contested again in 2007 on the platform of the defunct Action Congress (AC). He contested under PDP in 2011, on the platform of APC in 2015, and under PDP in 2019.\n\nSpeaking at the ceremony, Atiku said the 2023 general election was not the usual selection of those who would govern the country. But, \u201cIt is a referendum to decide whether we want greatness or continuous destruction. It is a choice between two paths: the path of unity and progress or the path of division and backwardness,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former vice president stressed, \u201cWe need a new kind of leadership that will steer us to a positive path. In 2023, we want a president, who has ideas on how to fix Nigeria. We want a president who understands, who inspires and is empathetic.\n\n\u201cAs the election is fast approaching, we should not be distracted from the devastating conditions we are in now. The ruling party wants to divide us; they want to divide us along the political, ethnic, and religious lines so that we forget to blame them for the rising inflation.\n\n\u201cThey want to distract us from holding them responsible for the insecurity and rising poverty. They want us to be facing each other and hating one another. We should focus on the issues, not our differences. Let us unite and fight our common enemies: the lack of unity, insecurity, poverty, inflation, and unemployment.\n\n\u201cThat is what this election is about. I have no doubt in my mind that we, as Nigerians, can do it. We did it in 1993. We can do it in 2023. We must stand firm, get our PVCs, come out en masse, cast our votes, and protect it against any manipulation.\u201d\n\nHe recounted his previous presidential bids, saying his motivation has always been to rekindle the Nigerian dream.\n\nAtiku said, \u201cI have contested for the office of President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria a couple of times in the past. My enduring persistence is borne out of my passion to rekindle the Nigerian dream that I was privileged to live.\n\n\u201cNigeria is a land of possibility. There is no challenging background that will make any Nigerian give up. I am a living witness to what is possible in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nTracing his political history, Atiku said, \u201cWho could have ever imagined, an 11-year-old village orphan, who had to rear other people\u2019s cattle to raise money to feed his family, would have the opportunity to go to school for free, rise through the cadre of a decent profession, establish successful businesses, and become the vice president of this country?\n\n\u201cThat is the Nigerian dream and that is my story. That is the possibility I want to pass to you and your children. No matter your current circumstances, that should not limit your success in life. There should not be any limit to what you want to achieve if you are willing to work for it.\n\n\u201cThat is my dream for Nigeria. However, that is not possible without credible and visionary leadership, and that is what I want to offer to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nDoubling down on his aspiration, Atiku said, \u201cYou and I know that Nigeria is in dire need of visionary leadership. Our fundamental principles and purpose as a nation have never been challenged as it is today.\n\n\u201cPresently, Nigeria is a sinking ship; it must be rescued urgently. That is why I am happy to announce my candidacy for the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\n\u201cI offer myself to rescue the sinking ship. Under my captainship, this ship will sail to a brighter course by the grace of God. However, this journey is not mine alone. It is a journey I am taking for all Nigerians. It is also a journey to a destination I planned with my late great mentor, Major General Shehu Musa Yar\u2019adua.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Saraki continued consultation for his own presidential ambition by meeting with PDP senators and House of Representatives members. He first met the members of the PDP House of Representatives at the residence of the House Minority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu, and later, the PDP senators at the residence of Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe.\n\nElumelu, in his address, called for unity of all the presidential aspirants in their campaigns and cautioned against unnecessary antagonism among the presidential hopefuls. He said it was unity of purpose that would ultimately guarantee victory for PDP in 2023.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Just In: PDP Govs Meet in Abia, Say APC Unfit to Contest 2023 General Election",
          "text": "Emmanuel Ugwu-Nwogo\n\nThe governors under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) have declared the ruling All Progressives Congress(APC) unfit to participate in the 2023 general elction, saying that the ruling party has become \u201cuncaring and a menace to Nigerians\u201d.\n\nThe opposition governors under te aegis of PDP Governors Forum passed the damning verdict on the APC led administration of President Muhammadu Buhari at its regular meeting held on Wednesday at the Umuobiakwa country home of its Vice-chairman and Abia State Governor, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu with 12 governors and a deputy governor in attendance.\n\nAccording to the Forum, it was a surprise that \u201cin the face of these statistics of complete failure in all ramifications and areas, the APC still wants to be on the ballot in 2023\u201d.\n\nShould APC insist on contesting the forthcoming general election despite it woeful failure in every aspects of national life, the PDP Governors said that Nigerians should outrightly reject the ruling party at the polls.\n\n\u201cThe Forum urges Nigerians to reject the APC, a party run undemocratically by a Committee contrary to the Constitution (S.228) with Mr. President regularly issuing instructions and dictates. It is impossible for a party so disorganized to offer good governance to the people of Nigeria\u201d.\n\nIn a nine-point communique read by the chairman of the Forum and Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, the go enjoys lamented \u201cexcruciating hardships and suffering being meted out to Nigerians by a failed APC led Federal Government\u201d, which is enough reason for Nigerians to reject the party.\n\nThey also stated that APC is no longer viable as a political party and is \u201cat the point of near collapse\u201d, adding that Nigerians should hinge their hope on \u201cthe readiness of the PDP to take over and offer qualitative leadership options to rescue the nation\u201d.\n\nWe lament the terrible pain and hardship facing Nigerians in virtually all aspects of life. The meeting noted that life was much better in 2015 under the PDP than today under the APC,\u201d the PDP Governors said.\n\nUsing comparative indicators \u201cobtained mainly\u201d from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBC), the PDP Governors said that\n\ndiesel which is critical for running of SMEs was N131.47 in 2015, but it now costs above N700.\n\n\u201cFuel: Official and Black-Market was N87/155 in 2015, it now costs N167/350.\n\nAviation Fuel/Air Ticket Rate on Domestic Flights was N110 per Litre/N18,000 in 2015, it now hovers around N700 per Litre/N70,000, where available.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the scarcity of fuel which has resulted in loss of several man hours is a disgrace to Nigeria,\u201d the Governors said, adding that \u201cthe collapse of the National Grid (126 times in 7 years \u2013 (June 2015 to March 2022) and its consequences of non-availability of power is most unfortunate\u201d.\n\n\u201cKerosene (NHK) used by the ordinary Nigerian for cooking and power was N180 in 2015, it now sells at \u20a6450.\n\nLiquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) \u2013 12.5kg Cylinder sold for N2,400 in 2015, is now sold at between N8,750 and N10, 000\u2033.\n\nThe main opposition party governors noted that Nigerians now find it extremely difficult to put bread on their tables as \u201cprices of basic food stuffs are now three times higher than what they used to be in 2015\u201d.\n\n\u201cStaple foods such as rice, beans, cassava flakes are now slipping out of the hands of average Nigerians. Indeed, a Bag of Rice sold for N8500 in 2015 is now N39,000\u201d while electricity was N14.23 per kilowatt in 2015, but is now N38.530, and not even available.\n\n\u201cUnemployment rate was 11.4% in 2015, it is now over 33%, one the highest in the world.\n\nThe poverty rate in 2015 was 11.3% but now about 42.8%.\n\nAccumulated Inflation in 2015 was about 4%, it is now 15.50%; Inflation Rate was 9.01% in 2015 and now 15.7%.\n\nPerhaps the Exchange Rate has been one of the most disastrous. N150 to a dollar was the parallel market (patronised by most businessmen and Nigerians) rate in 2015, it is now about N580 to $1 in the parrel market and still rising.\n\nOn Debt and Debt Servicing, the Forum said:\n\n\u201cDomestic Debt of N8.4T and External Debt of USD 7.3bn was incurred between 1999-2015.\n\nWhile Domestic Debt of N7.63T (June 2015-Dec 2020) and USD28.57bn as at Dec 2020 was incurred. External debt of USD21.27bn was incurred between June 2015 and 2021.\n\nNational Debt to GDP Ratio was 23.41% (2016) it is now 36.88% (2022)\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Corruption Index has risen from 136 in 2015 to 150 now. Nigeria\u2019s Misery Index, an indicator used in determining how economically well off the citizens of a country are, is usually calculated by adding the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate to the annual inflation rate, has moved from 14.75 percent in 2015 to 50.48 (2021).\n\n\u201cThe major threat to the agricultural sector and food security in Nigeria is insecurity. In the northeast of Nigeria, it is estimated that no fewer than 70,000 hectares of arable farmland have been abandoned in the affected States and Local Government areas. The trend is the same all over the country. This further contributes to food inflation. The APC led Federal Government must take steps to cooperate with States to bring security down to the grassroots.\n\nOn the economic front, the Forum took a swipe at the ruling party, expressing \u201cconcern and alarm over various reports and claims of incidents of stealing of crude oil ranging from 80% to 95% of production made by industry practitioners and called on the Federal Government to set up an appropriate mechanism to reverse this trend and bring perpetrators to account.\n\n\u201cThe PDP Governors once again decried the inability of the NNPC to make its statutory contributions to the Federation Account, inspite of Oil selling at above $110. It is patently unconstitutional for NNPC to determine at its whim and discretion when and what to pay to the Federation Account, as it is a mere trustee of the funds for the three tiers of Government: Federal, States and Local Governments. We once again, call for investigations and audit of the quantity of consumption of fuel ascribed to Nigerians and for deployment of technology at the filling stations to determine in a transparent manner the volume of consumption.\n\n\u201cThe Governors would resist any further attempt by NNPC to ascribe unsubstantiated subsidy claims to other tiers of government.\u201d\n\nOther PDP Governors that attended the meeting include, Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri \u2013 Adamawa State; Udom Emmanuel \u2013 Akwa Ibom State; Bala Mohammed -Bauchi State; Sen. Douye Diri \u2013 Bayelsa State; Samuel Ortom \u2014 Benue State;\n\nDr. Ifeanyi Okowa \u2013 Delta State; Godwin Obaseki \u2013 Edo State; Gov Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi \u2013 Enugu State;\n\nEngr. Oluseyi Abiodun Makinde \u2013 Oyo State;\n\nNyesom Wike \u2013 Rivers State; and\n\nHon Haruna Manu, Deputy Governor \u2013 Taraba State.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "summary": "The new APC group, SaharaReporters further gathered on Wednesday, prefers former President Jonathan to be the party\u2019s candidate in the 2023 presidential election, which will also see the presidential ambition of the Central Bank Governor, Godwin Emefiele, be buried altogether.\n\u201cA new group in the APC cabals has ruined Emefiele\u2019s plans as they asked ex-president Jonathan to contest and that he will be selected by consensus.\nTinubu had hoped to ward off challenge from Osinbajo, Rotimi Amaechi and others to get the APC presidential ticket through direct primaries.\n\u201cBuni is also working to organise national convention to create substantive national executives, all a ploy to ensure a Jonathan candidacy.\nThe most likely candidate for that will be Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State,\u201d the source had revealed further.",

          "text": "In 2014, when Umar Abdulbaki got his diagnosis of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR), a form of tuberculosis caused by bacteria resistant to at least two of the most powerful anti-TB medication, he was dejected and frustrated. He had first been diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2003.\n\nTuberculosis (TB), an infection caused by a bacteria called mycobacterium tuberculosis, most often affects the lungs. It can also occur in other parts of the body, such as the kidney or spine.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), in 2020, an estimated 10 million people fell ill with tuberculosis worldwide, 1.1 million of these being children.\n\nAbdulbaki, a Kano resident, experienced stigmatisation at the hospital after he was diagnosed. Abdulbaki said as soon he handed a nurse his result and she noticed he had MDR tuberculosis, she was alarmed and asked him to move away from her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I got to the hospital, I gave a nurse my file, and immediately I gave her my file, she started shouting at me that I should go back and not come close to her. She said it is because I don\u2019t know what is happening to me that I am coming close to her,\u201d he said.\n\nAbdulbaki said he felt so embarrassed by the nurse\u2019s outburst that he started to cry.\n\n\u201cI was so sick that I couldn\u2019t even say anything to her and it hurt me. Nobody who saw what happened intervened,\u201d he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHOW TUBERCULOSIS IS SPREAD\n\nContrary to popular belief, kissing, hugging, or shaking hands with a person who has tuberculosis do not spread the disease. Likewise, sharing bed linens, clothes, or a toilet seat does not spread the disease either.\n\nThe disease can be spread when people with lung tuberculosis cough, sneeze, or spit, propelling the tuberculosis germs into the air.\n\nIf the air with tuberculosis is breathed in by someone not infected, they may get TB infection. This means the person has dormant TB germs in their body. These dormant germs do not make people sick and cannot be passed to another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut if the TB germs wake up and multiply, the individual will get sick with TB disease.\n\nThe disease is usually spread through constant exposure to an infected person as opposed to one-time contact.\n\nThis means if you\u2019re in close quarters over a period of time with someone who has tuberculosis, you could catch the disease from breathing air that\u2019s been saturated with the bacteria.\n\nPeople living and working with someone who has the disease are more likely to become infected than someone who has a short encounter with a carrier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough TB can be cured \u2013 usually after treatment for six months \u2013 for some patients, stigmatisation is an issue they cannot escape.\n\n\u2018EVERYBODY GAVE ME A DISTANCE\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOsho Aaron* said he was diagnosed with tuberculosis at the end of 2019 after being treated for malaria and typhoid for one month. According to him, he faced stigmatisation right from when he went for a test at Kubwa General Hospital, Abuja.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe recalled that the tuberculosis section of the hospital was very scanty and he was told by a health worker told to stand far away from the window where he would get the tube to collect his sputum sample.\n\n\u201cI was told to stay very far, then a lady came and dropped a tube on the window and I was told to come and pick it up. I was told to go to the end of the fence, very far from where the buildings were, to put my saliva in the tube. When I was done, I came back, dropped it, and had to move far away again before she came to pick the sample up. The same thing happened when I came to collect the result,\u201d he said.\n\nThe survivor explained that he was then placed on medication for six months after diagnosis.\n\n\u201cThroughout the process in the hospital, it was the same thing, nobody wanted to talk to me, they were giving me a distance,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t blame them for treating me that way, maybe they were just trying to protect themselves.\u201d\n\nOsho said even his family members kept their distance throughout the time he battled the ailment.\n\n\u201cAt home, I was given my own cutleries, I was given a separate room to stay. I wasn\u2019t really going out of the room a lot and anytime I went out, I would use a face mask,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018I WAS AFRAID OF BEING STIGMATISED\u2019\n\nNarrating his experience, Francis Ubong said he was in Akwa Ibom in 2013 when he took ill and started taking malaria drugs. He initially got better but after two weeks, he felt worse.\n\n\u201cI reached out to my mum and she said I should come back to Abuja immediately,\u201d Ubong said.\n\n\u201cAfter a while in Abuja, I started to cough, sweat profusely at night, lose weight, and lose my appetite. My mum took note of my symptoms and rushed me to Asokoro District Hospital where I was diagnosed with tuberculosis and placed on treatment for six months.\u201d\n\nUbong said although he didn\u2019t face external stigmatisation because he did not disclose his condition to people outside his family, his siblings started to avoid him upon learning of his diagnosis.\n\n\u201cAt first, my siblings were avoiding me but my mum who is a health personnel called them and educated them on tuberculosis. After that, their behaviour towards me got better,\u201d he said.\n\nOn why he chose not to tell people other than his family about his diagnosis, Ubong said: \u201cI heard so many stories of people who lost their jobs and were stigmatised by friends and co-workers due to tuberculosis so I decided to keep it to myself.\u201d\n\nA 2014 study said the perceived contagiousness of tuberculosis is a leading cause of stigmatisation of patients.\n\nThe study said people lack adequate knowledge about tuberculosis and its treatment, noting that stigmatisation by society is \u201cone of the most important obstacles to eliminating this disease\u201d.\n\nItohowo Uko, head of advocacy, communication and social mobilisation at the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Programme (NTBLCP), advised that rather than avoid family members who have the disease, proper ventilation should be maintained in the house to prevent bacteria that cause tuberculosis to hang in the air.\n\n\u201cTuberculosis is an airborne disease. You can only get it when someone who is infected coughs or sneezes or shouts and then the bacterium goes into the air, hangs in the air and another person happens to breathe it in,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOne of the ways to avoid getting infected with tuberculosis in a family setting where one person is infected is to avoid overcrowding in the house. They should avoid poor ventilation and keep their windows open. The infected person should also be told to cover their mouth when coughing to avoid droplets going into the air.\u201d\n\nUko added that it is pointless to ostracise tuberculosis patients and limit contact with them.\n\n\u201cOnce that person is on medication for one to two months, the person can no longer infect people. The micro bacterium is inactive,\u201d she added.\n\nOn the stigmatisation experienced at healthcare centres, Uko said the situation is so serious that health workers stigmatise their colleagues who treat tuberculosis patients.\n\n\u201cWe are sensitising them. We have been sensitising them about the ways tuberculosis cannot be spread,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cWe have also advised them to leave the doors and windows of their health facilities open. Once there is proper ventilation, the tendency of breathing in the tuberculosis germs from the air is reduced because the wind has blown it off and it has been killed by the sun.\u201d",

          "title": "Tyranny in the workplace: The chaotic culture of Bento Africa",
          "text": "\u201cBento took everything from me\u2014my sense of humanity, sanity, confidence, and trust,\u201d Pascal*, an ex-sales executive at Nigerian payroll startup Bento Africa, said about his time working there. \u201cWe worked around the clock. Ebun [CEO and co-founder of the company] would send you messages by 2 AM and expect a response asap. No rest. We went to bed every night praying our jobs would still be there when we woke up the next morning.\u201d\n\nOn March 18, 2021, Pascal\u2019s prayer, which had seemed to work for over a year, stopped working. He was abruptly fired from his job. He fell into a depressive state, and everything stopped making sense. He stopped going out, and his relationships with friends and family suffered. Even though he said working at Bento for over a year had been torture, it was all he had at the time.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng) is the brainchild of Ebun Okubanjo and Chidozie Okonkwo, his friend, business partner, and Bento\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO). Headquartered in Lagos, Nigeria, Bento provides payroll management software to 900 businesses, including Hygeia, Paystack, Kobo360, Branch, and LORI Systems.\n\nOkubanjo and Okonkwo built, and still run, multiple businesses together. While both co-founders flock together, they aren\u2019t quite of the same feather. All ex-employees who spoke to us described Okubanjo as fire and Okonkwo as neither water nor fire; Okonkwo simply remains in the background, silent and rarely engaged in the company\u2019s day-to-day operations. These ex-employees therefore believe that Okonkwo\u2019s attitude outsources all authority to Okubanjo and enables his toxicity.\n\nIn Okubanjo\u2019s termination email to Pascal, he was fired because of a \u201clack of cultural fit and poor performance\u201d. But Pascal wondered: \u201cHow could I have been culturally unfit and incompetent after working for you for over a year? Why did it take you that long to clock my incompetence?\u201d\n\nOkubanjo\u2019s email terminating Pascal\u2019s contract\n\nThe termination letter\n\nHe said, despite the daily verbal assaults he endured in the hands of Okubanjo, all he wanted to do was to be the best salesperson in the company and make his employer proud. He hadn\u2019t done much work in sales prior to Bento, so he put in the work. Within 5 months, according to him, he had the second-highest number of clients on their sheets at the time. He closed some of the biggest clients\u2014some of them with over 1,000 employees and a monthly payroll worth \u20a615\u2013\u20a620 million (~$47,000).\n\nDespite his achievements, however, Pascal did not succeed in making his boss proud. \u201cThere was no free day from Ebun\u2019s verbal abuse. If he wasn\u2019t calling me a useless person, he was threatening to beat me up,\u201d Pascal said. At some point, while recounting his experience to TechCabal, he paused to catch his breath.\n\nPascal described his time at Bento as the darkest period of his life.\n\nPascal narrated how employees would weep during the sales team\u2019s check-in call at 8 AM every weekday. Okubanjo harshly criticised their work and threatened to fire them all at these meetings.\n\nEzekiel*, who had worked with the company\u2019s growth marketing team, shared his experience with TechCabal. He had joined one of the sales calls and heard Okubanjo calling them \u201cpussies and deadweights\u201d. He also heard Okubanjo tell the team that they smelled. \u201cEven though he never attacked me personally,\u201d Ezekiel said, \u201cI always wondered how anybody could go through that every morning and remain sane.\u201d\n\nBento Africa\u2019s cofounders: Ebun Okubanjo (left) and Chidozie Okonkwo (right)\n\nEx-employees also revealed gaps in Bento\u2019s employment contract, specifically where leave days and time off were concerned. Okubanjo promised employees that they could take time off when they needed it, but Bola*, another ex-employee from the company\u2019s sales team, dispelled that promise as a myth.\n\n\u201cI can count on one hand how many people took leave during my stay there. Ebun said breaks are for pussies and fuckers, and whoever takes time out of the office for a whole week is a weak member of the team and not needed in the organisation,\u201d said Bola.\n\n\u201cEbun scarred me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have spent money on therapy, yet, I still suffer from anxiety.\u201d\n\nIn her early days at the startup, Bola asked a lot of people to come work with her at Bento. At that time, she was ignorant of Okubanjo\u2019s \u201cterrifying personality\u201d. \u201cHad I known about it, I wouldn\u2019t have asked anybody to join Bento. Now, when a prospective Bento employee reaches out to me, I just tell them to run!\u201d\n\nAccording to the sources we spoke to, Okubanjo rarely welcomed alternative opinions and monopolised making key business decisions; the punishment for criticising his ideas was immediate termination of employment. For a number of Bento ex-employees, termination simply entailed deactivated Slack accounts and emails.\n\nTinu*, who had been poached from another company to come join Bento, woke up one day and found out she\u2019d been fired and logged out of her Slack and work email. She\u2019d only been with the company as Communication Lead for less than 3 weeks.\n\n\u201cIt was a nerve-wracking experience and the worst 5 months of my adult life,\u201d said Amaka*, who was excited to join a tech startup in Nigeria after finishing her studies in the US. She was fired after enduring Okubanjo\u2019s insults and unwarranted comments about her body.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a plus-size woman and Okubanjo would always have opinions about my dressing. He once told me to stop wearing dresses, that I need to wear jackets, trouser and suit all the time (presumably to cover my breast) after his girlfriend Alice commented that she liked my breast. What did I wear? Regular dresses that even my mother approved of.\u201d\n\nAmaka likened the day she was fired to a scene out of a movie. \u201cWe were on a sales call, and Ebun kept saying I wasted company resources while bringing in zero value.\u201d Okubanjo accused her of charging her personal Bolt ride on the company\u2019s debit card, unaware that Amaka had stopped using the card entirely and even ran the company\u2019s errands with her own car.\n\nFollowing Okubanjo\u2019s accusation, Amaka asked that the card be audited to ascertain whether she had indeed been wasting the company\u2019s money. Okubanjo checked the card and discovered that she hadn\u2019t been using the card for personal expenses. Rather than apologise to her, he changed tack and started accusing her of not working.\n\n\u201cHe called me useless and told me to f*ck off from the call. Next thing I knew, my colleagues were texting to inform me that he\u2019d fired me after I dropped off the call.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, when Kunle*, a lead engineer who worked for the company for over 2 years, was fired last November, he only found out about it when he couldn\u2019t access his Slack and work email the next morning. \u201cEbun fired me because he felt like I was trying to wrest authority from him,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo announcing on the company\u2019s slack after firing Kunle\n\n\u201cLeave Ebun, that man can literally kill you and brag about it. He\u2019s that vindictive,\u201d Ezekiel had mentioned while speaking to TechCabal. Ada*, another ex-staff, had also specifically declined to speak to us because she was worried about her safety, fearing that her former employer, could hurt her.\n\nIn the images above, Okubanjo referred to himself as Marlo Stanfield on Bento\u2019s Slack. Who is that, you may ask?\n\nMarlo Stanfield is a fictional character on the HBO television drama The Wire. He is a young, ambitious, intelligent, and ruthless gangster. In the drama series, Stanfield demanded unconditional respect, which superseded all other concerns. He was murderously narcissistic, and frequently ordered the deaths of those who disrespected or undermined him. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked him number 2 on their list of \u201c40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\u201d.\n\nThe day before Kunle was fired, the company\u2019s CTO Lede Adeniyi was on leave, so Kunle stepped up to lead the engineering team. Kunle recalled that one of the account executives had told him that a customer wanted a feature that was not in Bento\u2019s product roadmap for the year. Kunle said he explained to the executive that the company had prioritised other fixes and features for the year and would include the requested feature on their first sprint in 2022. He, however, suggested that if the customer wanted the feature added quickly, he could talk to Okubanjo.\n\n\u201cI referred the executive to Ebun because Ebun had already accused me, previously, of setting priorities behind him. But even that was a crime,\u201d said Kunle. The executive went to Okubanjo with their request, as Kunle had suggested, and all hell broke loose.\n\n\u201cI remember how Ebun came to shout at me: \u2018Hey motherfucker, what did you say to a customer about their ask?\u2019 He shut me up before I could even answer and called me names, which was normal. I was his usual point of reference whenever he wanted to benchmark weaknesses and redundancy in the team. Imagine being disrespected in front of your team members every day.\u201d\n\nNow, before the November firing, Okubanjo had fired Kunle once before. It happened on a trip to Ghana. Kunle had asked Okubanjo to stop calling him a monkey. Okubanjo responded to that by firing him on the spot. \u201cHe told me to find my way back to Nigeria, and that he didn\u2019t care how I did it.\u201d But then, he called Kunle after a few hours to give him his job back, knowing he needed him to sort out the business operations they had come for in Ghana.\n\nOn November 22, when Okunbanjo fired Kunle for the second and final time, he refused to pay his November salary and severance pay. Kunle reached out to Adeniyi, the CTO, to help him speak to Okubanjo about his owed payments, but Adeniyi couldn\u2019t do anything about it. \u201cYou know Ebun does what he wants,\u201d Kunle recalled Adeniyi saying to him.\n\nWhen TechCabal reached out to Adeniyi for comment on the incident, he confirmed Kunle\u2019s report: \u201cYes, Kunle asked me to follow up with Ebun, which I did, and Ebun promised to pay him.\u201d It\u2019s been 4 months now and Okubanjo still hasn\u2019t paid Kunle.\n\nBut after Kunle got fired, it seemed his former boss wasn\u2019t done with him.\n\n\u201cLast month, just when my mental health was getting back in shape, Ebun popped up on my LinkedIn, offering me my old job back,\u201d Kunle said. \u201cI declined. Such effrontery! No form of apology. I haven\u2019t found a new job yet because I\u2019m scared of working in another Nigerian startup.\u201d\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo reached out to Kunle* 4 months after to offer him his job back\n\nKunle claimed that Ebun sacked his friend John*, a former member of Bento\u2019s design team, because John was talking a lot about web3 on social media. Okubanjo accused John of finding Bento \u201cless interesting\u201d. TechCabal reached out to John through Kunle but he hasn\u2019t replied.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give Okubanjo notice period when you\u2019re leaving the company. He\u2019d fire you and tell you off,\u201d Ezekiel said. \u201cWhen Ebun fires you, he tells you to watch how he\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t get a job anywhere else in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nTare Johnson, Bento\u2019s ex-accountant and financial analyst, believes this was why he couldn\u2019t find a job for 6 months after leaving Bento in August 2020. When Johnson joined Bento in February 2020, his contract stated that he was coming in to lead the finance team. He would later find out that there was no team, and that he would be leading himself while reporting to a \u201cnarcissistic boss\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was basically the only one handling all the company\u2019s finances. I was also doing clerical jobs and running errands like a personal assistant, which was confusing and not even remotely close to my job description,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cMy initial thought was, \u2018It\u2019s a startup and things move around a lot.\u2019 But I was wrong. This place was designed to break employees. Ebun abused me verbally, which is standard behaviour for him with employees. He\u2019d call me a motherfucker, dullard, and every vulgar word in the dictionary. He even insulted my family.\u201d\n\nJohnson, running a one-man finance team, was stuck in a mess he hadn\u2019t bargained for. The pandemic lockdown hit barely a month after he got the job, locking him into the job at a time when companies were laying people off and not hiring. So he stuck around and took all the verbal abuse Okubanjo hurled at him. After 5 months, he figured he was coping, until an event on Monday, August 17, 2020 made him resign without notice.\n\nThe WhatsApp conversation between Johnson and Okubanjo\n\nThat Monday, Johnson\u2014like he had done every morning\u2014shared the company\u2019s daily bank statements to Okubanjo and Okonkwo on WhatsApp. Upon receiving them, Okubanjo replied with: \u201cBro, are you drunk???\u201d Johnson thought he must have made a mistake somewhere on the statements, so he quickly double-checked before re-sharing the statements with Bento\u2019s founding team. Okubanjo was still not satisfied with the statements. Apparently, some recent transaction hadn\u2019t reflected yet in the company\u2019s account at the time Johnson compiled the statement; there was no way Johnson could have included it in his report. But Okubanjo, \u201cin his usual fashion\u201d, asked Johnson to fix the spreadsheet or he\u2019d fire him. Finally fed up, Johnson resigned with a simple message: \u201cNo need, I quit\u201d and exited the WhatsApp group. An hour later, he sent in his resignation letter.\n\nFor Johnson, joining Bento Africa was \u201ca bad idea\u201d and leaving \u201cthe best thing he\u2019d ever done for himself\u201d.\n\nWhy were Okubanjo\u2019s red flags ignored?\n\nSome of the ex-employees said Okubanjo\u2019s ruthless leadership style was obvious from the first day they met him. \u201cThe day I met him for my interview, he told me he could read poverty all over my face,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cOn the first day we met,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cI witnessed an altercation that ended with Ebun threatening to punch a stranger in the face.\u201d\n\nAmaka, on her part, said she recognised Okubanjo from a video that had gone viral a year before, where he was in a heated argument with a female customer of Fitness Central, a gym he co-founded with Okonkwo. In the video, Okunbanjo\u2019s threatening personality was evident and on full-display.\n\nSo, why did these former Bento staff accept to work for the company after seeing these red flags from the CEO?\n\n\u201cI felt bad, but what could I do? I needed the job. I was just coming off the HNG Internship,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cThe money was good, for someone who hadn\u2019t even done the mandatory, one-year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC),\u201d said Amaka.\n\n\u201cI had already stayed about 7 months without a job, after NYSC, and was even planning to go back home [which is outside Lagos] when the job came. So, it was my best option at the time,\u201d said Adanma*, a former employee of the company.\n\nCulture shock after leaving Bento\n\nFormer employees who spoke to TechCabal confessed to experiencing culture shock at their subsequent jobs.\n\nAdanma \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe it when my current boss asked for my opinion on things. \u201cFor the first few months [at my current job], I was too scared to voice an opinion at meetings, for fear of being called stupid.\u201d\n\nBola \u201cwas surprised when my current boss said switching off Slack notifications is good to reduce anxiety, and that we should all try it.\u201d\n\nAccording to McKinsey, hundreds of experiments show that encounters with rude, insulting, and demeaning people undermine workers\u2019 performance, including their decision-making skills, productivity, creativity, and willingness to work harder and help coworkers.\n\nOkubanjo often claims that Bento is \u201ca mission and not a company\u201d hence his iron-fist leadership.\n\nBento is still toxic\n\nThree current Bento employees contacted by TechCabal were diplomatic about their responses, but they agreed that everything this publication has unearthed about Bento Africa\u2019s work culture \u201cis not false\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne minute it\u2019s silence; the next it\u2019s chaos. It\u2019s unstable here, and the pressure is too much,\u201d one of them said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really bothered,\u201d the second employee said. \u201cMy former place of work was also toxic, so I\u2019m kinda used to it. At this point, I think all startups are the same.\u201d\n\nThe third employee wouldn\u2019t \u201cdeny that Bento can be toxic for some people but not in my personal experience. We work very hard, and we play harder. Most people on the team love their jobs. It\u2019s not for everyone, really.\u201d\n\nWhile several ex-Bento employees agree that the company has a great and important product, they believe both founders in charge of the startup are unfit for their roles. The company\u2019s Glassdoor reviews tell more stories of its unconducive work culture.\n\nIn December last year, Bento expanded into Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, with plans to set up operations in 6 other markets\u2014Egypt, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, Angola, and Ethiopia\u2014by the end of this year. The company also leveraged the influence of music veteran and record label boss Don Jazzy to push a campaign supporting the African entrepreneurship spirit\u2014a campaign that arguably boosted its pan-African brand equity. These strides mean that the company is growing to a stage where its apparent lack of structure, process, and attention to employee welfare can no longer be ignored.\n\nTechCabal reached out to Okubanjo and Okonkwo for comments. Okonkwo didn\u2019t respond, but Okubanjo did. In his response, he called our then-developing story \u201cfiction\u201d and posted our email request to Twitter, claiming our article was a \u201chit job\u201d. He has followed his tweets with a series of abusive personal messages to members of the TechCabal team.\n\nEbun Okubanjo posted our email request on Twitter, he has since deleted the tweet.\n\nWhile Johnson, Bola, Amaka, Kunle, Ezekiel, Adanma, and others still scared to speak up have licked their wounds and moved on, Pascal\u2019s family refuses to let the abuse he suffered at Bento slide. They have sued Okubanjo. \u201cI just want him to rescind the lies he told in the termination email to me, I have all the evidence to prove he lied,\u201d Pascal said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: * Besides Tare Johnson who specifically asked not to be anonymous, other names have been changed to protect the identities of those involved. Furthermore, two current members of Big Cabal Media\u2019s team were former employees at Bento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng).\n\nUpdate: Amaka\u2019s account on Okubanjo\u2019s comment about her dressing was updated at 12:30 AM on March 22, 2020.\n\nUpdate: Tangerine Africa was removed from the Bento\u2019s client lists because the company said they have only provided insurance to Bento clients in the past, but never been a client themselves. This update was done 1:20 PM on March 23, 2022.\n\nTechCabal is working on a follow-up story exploring hostile work culture in African startups.

          "title": "Big Cabal Media raises $2.3m to expand its compelling line of digital products",
          "text": "Over decades, the news media landscape has changed dramatically. Checking for news online\u2014whether through Google, social network sites, major newspapers, or local media websites\u2014has become ubiquitous. The widespread use of smartphones also means the latest developments around the world are delivered to people instantaneously.\n\nWhile digital media has connected people in ways never before possible, enabling users to remain informed and maintain relationships across time and distance, companies in the space have attracted a paltry amount of funding. In 2021, venture capital invested $115 million in digital media globally, a tenth of the $1.1billion it funded in 2015, but not much came to Africa. Digital newsrooms in Africa are more likely to receive story grants than business funding, with a few exceptions.\n\nToday, one of such exceptions, Big Cabal Media (BCM), a leading African digital media company, has announced a $2.3 million Seed funding round, emphasising its commitment to keep building exciting and authoritative media products and brands. The new investment round saw participation from existing investors: Unicorn Capital Partners and Future Africa. New investors such as Mac Venture Capital and Luminate participated.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted to support Big Cabal Media at a pivotal moment. Independent tech media like BCM are key pillars of society,\u201d said Abdul Noormohamed, Vice-president Africa at Luminate. \u201cAt Luminate, we are convinced that these digital media disruptors will continue to create engaging content and thereby contribute to the political and societal change we all want to see.\u201d\n\nPrior to this funding, with just over $600,000 raised in funding, BCM has grown to become one of the most exciting media and tech businesses in Africa. Its two major publications, TechCabal and Zikoko, reach over 30 million people monthly across platforms, with over 170,000 newsletter subscribers, and a 225% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2018 and 2021.\n\nFounded in 2013 by Bankole Oluwafemi, TechCabal started as a deliberate effort to cover the burgeoning Nigerian tech ecosystem. While the publication started out focusing just on the Nigerian startup space, it soon expanded its coverage to all of Africa. The publication covers startup fundraises, product launches, expansions, regulatory tussles, and stories of various players in the digital economy.\n\nA year after TechCabal launched Seyi Taylor joined the company as co-founder and CEO, while Oluwafemi continued in his role as Editor-in-Chief. They continued to expand TechCabal\u2019s coverage and scale up its operations. In 2016, the duo decided to try something different with the launch of Zikoko, a publication many likened to Buzzfeed at the time of its birth. Zikoko has grown from mostly publishing listicles and quizzes to sharing important stories on every aspect of Nigerians\u2019 lives, earning it \u201cNigeria\u2019s most viral publisher\u201d tagline.\n\nTwo years after the launch of Zikoko, Tomiwa Aladekomo joined the company, taking over as CEO. Aladekomo is an experienced media and marketing professional, who has worked in a range of businesses across different sectors in both North America and Africa.\n\nOver the next four years, Aladekomo focused on diversifying the company\u2019s revenue streams. BCM had derived its income mostly through native advertising, but Aladekomo oversaw the build-out of an extensive suite of advertising products across publications. The company built out a substantial events business; launched the Cabal Creative content studio, which has served multiple Fortune 500 clients ranging from Google to Coca-Cola; and launched TC Insights, a digital economy consultancy business.\n\nUnder Aladekomo\u2019s leadership, BCM has also embarked on ambitious projects like Jollof Road, an 80-day adventurous road trip across all mainland countries in West Africa; and Tech Women Lagos, a multi-sensory exhibition of 50 women in the Lagos technology ecosystem from different backgrounds.\n\n\u201cI joined BCM in 2018, brought on some really talented people, and we immediately kickstarted a period of experimentation,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cOur experiments encompassed editorial content and approaches, monetisation and even company culture.\u201d\n\nTomiwa Aladekomo, CEO of Big Cabal Media\n\nNine years after its launch, BCM which started as a tech blog has morphed into a media powerhouse. Its two publications, TechCabal and Zikoko are experts at creating content that hits the cultural nerve. They go beyond covering the scenes to creating agenda-setting editorial content, projects, and events. Cabal Creative and TC Insights are also supporting hundreds of companies within Africa.\n\nThe company also boasts of a laudable alumni network, which includes Odunayo Eweniyi, CEO and co-founder of Fintech startup Piggyvest and First Check, a female-led, female-focused, angel fund and investor community; Osarumen Osamuyi, Partner Manager at Meta; Jola Ayeye, scriptwriter and co-host of the I Said What I Said (ISWIS) podcast\u2014one of the most listened to podcasts in Africa\u2014and a host of others. An indication of its investment in its employees.\n\n\u201cFrom documented reports and experience, too, very few people who work for media organisations are offered a competitive salary and we\u2019d like to be the exception to the norm,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cThe BCM model has been tested and proven. In 2021, we quadrupled our 2020 revenue, and over the last 4 years our CAGR is 225%.\u201d\n\nWith this new funding, BCM plans to develop its product serving, staff, and audience. \u201cWe are expanding our video production by exploring docuseries and short films,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cWe will be transforming our studio into a community hub for creatives, and introducing 3 new tech products, including the Zikoko app and Zikoko Memes 2.0, which first launched in 2020. We will also be building out new audiences while offering competitive wages.\u201d\n\nIn the past 5 years, some notable fundraises by African digital media companies include Nigerian media company Stears Business\u2019 $600,000 seed round in 2020 and Ghana\u2019s OMG Digital $1.1m seed funding in 2017. BCM\u2019s progress over the years and recent fundraise is a noteworthy example of the possibilities and opportunities in Africa\u2019s digital media sector.\n\nOf the reported $4.3\u2013$5 billion raised by African startups in 2021 whereby fintech received 53\u201363% of the volume, digital media companies are one of many sectors that have traditionally been overlooked in the conversation of tangible ventures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to enter this chapter with Big Cabal Media, as we fully believe in its massive potential for further success, scale and global impact,\u201d said Marlon Nichols, co-Founder and Managing General Partner at MaC Venture Capital. \u201cInvesting in Africa\u2019s booming digital media sector aligns perfectly with MaC\u2019s mission of supporting exceptional entrepreneurs building valuable technology companies that leverage shifts in cultural trends and behaviours. I have no doubt that BCM will seize this unique opportunity to continue leading conversations in culture and helping digital consumers access the information that matters most to them.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "The untold story of how ThriveAgric survived a turbulent 2020",
          "text": "In September 2020, a few days after Muhammed Akinyemi didn\u2019t receive payment for a 6-month poultry cycle investment made in ThriveAgric, he informed his lawyer about this but didn\u2019t take legal action.\n\nHe was expecting the sum of \u20a6581,000 ($1,200) for the \u20a6510,000 he\u2019d invested in March. Akinyemi had also invested \u20a6200,000 in April, which was due (\u20a6224,000) in October.\n\n\u201cAt first, I just felt it\u2019s money, and it\u2019s with them. Whatever the problems are, within a week or two, they should resolve it,\u201d Akinyemi said. \u201cBut I found out that they hadn\u2019t addressed the issue to all their subscribers; rather they were explaining to individuals. And there was no specificity as to when it would be resolved.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, a few weeks later, Akinyemi\u2019s car broke down and he urgently needed money to fix it. ThriveAgric hadn\u2019t yet paid him and he was running out of patience. He was one out of hundreds of ThriveAgric\u2019s retail investors who hadn\u2019t received the payments.\n\nHis lawyer sent a warning notification to ThriveAgric, threatening to sue if the issue wasn\u2019t resolved. Akinyemi also put out a tweet calling out the company to fix the problem. He tried to rally around other retail investors who hadn\u2019t been paid, but a number of them didn\u2019t want any media attention.\n\n\u201cWe fought it from the legal and social aspect,\u201d said Akinyemi.\n\nOver 500km away, in Southwestern Nigeria Osun State, Esther*, a poultry farmer who partnered with ThriveAgric, had lost over 1,000 birds because there was little to no movement.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult period losing my birds in the middle of the pandemic,\u201d Esther said. She was one out of many farmers within ThriveAgric\u2019s network who suffered massive losses.\n\nWhile the losses incurred varied among the farmers, depending on the capacity of their pens, ThriveAgric shared that there were over 400,000 mature birds that had no buyers. Despite efforts made by ThriveAgric to rent more cold rooms for storage of processed chickens, the lack of buyers and difficulty in moving the birds during the pandemic meant that over 90% of the birds were lost. The losses started happening as early as April 2020, until the end of the year.\n\nWith hundreds of unpaid, angry retail investors dragging ThriveAgric online, asking for their money, and farmers recording millions of naira in losses, this was ThriveAgric\u2019s darkest hour.\n\nFounded by Uka Eje (CEO) and Ayodeji Arikawe (CTO) in 2017, ThriveAgric started as an agricultural technology startup that provided access to finance, premium markets, and data-driven advisory for smallholder farmers. It financed agriculture projects through crowdfunding. In the space of 3 years, ThriveAgric had grown to become a notable African Agritech startup, with backing from Y Combinator\u2014one of the world\u2019s most successful startup accelerators\u2014in 2019.\n\nHow did it get into this mess?\n\n\u201cIt was a mix of different events. The pandemic meant that offtakers couldn\u2019t pay for the goods we\u2019ve already supplied,\u201d Eje said. \u201cFarmers were also suffering losses in the farm, and we lost over 100 million naira worth of produce in transit because they were held up on the road. No movement during the pandemic.\u201d\n\nThe dilemma for ThriveAgric was that its owing offtakers\u2014FMCGs and restaurant chains\u2014made repeated failed promises on when they\u2019d repay.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d promise to pay next week and, banking on their words because they hadn\u2019t defaulted before, we\u2019d in turn promise our retail investors that they\u2019ll be paid next week, only for the offtakers to go quiet,\u201d Eje said.\n\nThe offtakers too were anticipating that the pandemic would wind down and business activities would return, but it took longer than expected. This affected ThriveAgric\u2019s communication with its retail investors as it repeatedly failed to fulfil the promises it made to its retail investors. The fact that its large network of farmers were also experiencing losses also exacerbated the situation as ThriveAgric had invested in them by providing seeds and chicks, expecting to receive returns when they were sold. Many of those farmers haven\u2019t recovered from those losses till today.\n\nA popular question that came up during this period was whether ThriveAgric\u2019s claims to be covered by insurance were true. The company explained that the insurance covered the farming activities and not the retail investors\u2019 investment\u2014the logic being, if the farming process went well, the returns on the investment by the retail investors were guaranteed. Also, in this situation, the fact that farmers were unable to sell and the offtakers were owing weren\u2019t valid bases for requesting for insurance claims.\n\nAmerican serial entrepreneur Elon Musk once described the experience of running a startup as being similar to the act of chewing glass and staring into the abyss. \u201cAfter a while, you stop staring, but the glass chewing never ends,\u201d Musk said. ThriveAgric\u2019s experience validates this description.\n\nAll through this turbulent phase, the company maintains it didn\u2019t take its retail investors for granted.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we realised was that this money we were owing was important for these people; for some it was house rent or school fees,\u201d Eje said. \u201cIt was money that meant a lot to them. Regardless of how people reacted, it was their money, and they needed it back.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSalvaging the situation\n\nAs the situation escalated, different parties showed up to help out.\n\n\u201cWe stepped in as quickly as we got wind of the situation and did the best that we could at the time by guiding the team on the right approach to take, as well as by providing the practical support they needed in what was a very time-sensitive situation,\u201d said Kola Aina, General Partner, Ventures Platform, one of ThriveAgric\u2019s investors.\n\nVentures platform helped with recruiting an interim CEO, Adia Sowho, who was then VP of Growth and Managing Director, Nigeria, for credit platform Migo. It also restructured the finance and communications team.\n\nWhen ThriveAgric came knocking, the first question Sowho had to answer was \u201cDid she care enough?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe big question for me was, do I care enough about ThriveAgric and what it\u2019s doing? And am I willing, because I wasn\u2019t bored,\u201c Sowho said.\n\nWith the answer to that question being yes, in October Sowho agreed to step in, with Eje stepping down to the role of chief operating officer (COO).\n\n\u201cFood security is an important part of our economy. It doesn\u2019t get enough love and support as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Sowho said. \u201cIf every Nigerian were a farmer, we\u2019d be feeding ourselves and the continent, which is literally ThriveAgric\u2019s vision.\u201d\n\nSolving for Y\n\nTasked to initiate a turnaround in a new company and entirely different sector, the guiding principle Sowho turned to was first-principles thinking, a reverse engineering technique that has its origins from the teachings of Aristotle and has been made recently popular by leaders in Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cFor me, I tend to work with first principles. At the end of the day, whatever problem you\u2019re trying to solve, whether it\u2019s a startup, enterprise, or even conglomerate turnaround,\u201d Sowho said. \u201cThey all involve the two or more parties exchanging value. With ThriveAgric there was an equation and it was broken.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was this hazy chain of unfulfilled agreement that just ended up in a crisis. And, of course, when it hits the public sphere, it makes the news.\u201d\n\nTo fix the broken equation, Sowho deployed three things: structure, governance, and documentation, concepts she claims startups tend to be wary of. The different teams and processes were restructured in order for the company to solve existing problems and be \u201c10 steps ahead of any risk before it materialises\u201d.\n\n\u201cA lot of the things I did were an outcome of the experience that I have working in building organisations,\u201d Sowho said. \u201cThese things don\u2019t happen by accident. The success of any enterprise has to be by design.\u201d\n\nSowho and Eje worked on structuring the financing plan for the repayment of the retail investors and hiring for key roles. Alongside Sowho, a new Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and a head of risk were hired. As the new hires got to work, stabilising the ship, co-founder and CTO Arikawe couldn\u2019t help but wonder why they joined the company at such a time.\n\n\u201cThese people joined us during the crisis. I was thinking, didn\u2019t you look up ThriveAgric online, a company that people are bashing, before joining,\u201d Arikawe said.\n\nThe typical response from the new hires was that they believed in what the company was doing and were willing to put their names on the line.\n\n\u201cOur CFO joined us and 2 days later he\u2019s on a call where investors were insulting him,\u201d Arikawe said. \u201cA similar incident happened with Sowho, who joined and 1 week later had 300 angry people on a Zoom call with her.\u201d\n\nIn a few months, the presence of additional hands, fresh ideas, and the \u201cbridge\u201d capital (temporary financing) provided by Ventures Platform helped stabilise ThriveAgric.\n\nTransparency\u2014the currency of trust\n\nDuring this period, members of the support team and other departments had to work overnight for many days.\n\n\u201cEveryone was stretched but we had a lot of empathy for the people and also a sense of responsibility to ensure that things don\u2019t go wrong again,\u201d Arikawe said.\n\nOn one of those nights, the engineering team in collaboration with the support team, decided to enhance transparency around the repayment schedule by creating a new payout dashboard\u2014Payout.thriveagric.com\u2014that reflected each retail investor\u2019s exact repayment date.\n\nThis was done to fix an issue with the initial payment dashboard which automatically indicated that the retail investors had been paid, as soon as it was due date. This feature caused retailer investors to be confused and angry, because they hadn\u2019t been paid.\n\n\u201cWhen we initially built the payout dashboard we didn\u2019t foresee a period like this where we wouldn\u2019t have been able to pay. People always got paid on or before payout day,\u201d Arikawe said.\n\nWith the new payout dashboard, the retail investors could also see how many other people have been paid. A feature which the engineering team hoped would provide extra comfort and ease tension.\n\nUtilising the bridge loan secured, over the span of 9 months ThriveAgric was able to pay back the hundreds of customers it was owing. Akinyemi was paid in November and December 2020. ThriveAgric also repaid the bridge loan in 2021.\n\nUnexpected support and lessons\n\nDuring the turbulent period, there was a lot of pushback from retail investors but also surprisingly a lot of support from investors, financiers, and friends.\n\n\u201cI remember people calling and asking, what\u2019s the challenge, what do you need?\u201d Arikawe said. \u201cFor example, one of the people we sold birds to but hadn\u2019t paid called to apologise that he\u2019s trying his best. He was owing us because someone else was owing him.\u201d\n\nAfter 6 months at the helm of ThriveAgric, Sowho left to join telecom giant MTN Nigeria as its first-ever female Chief Marketing Officer while Eje returned to the position of CEO. During his time as COO, Eje worked on ensuring that repayment and communications with different stakeholders happened seamlessly.\n\n\u201cEssentially, I ensured that the core business operations ran smoothly and built a system to ensure that the defaulting offtakers paid,\u201d Eje said. \u201cI also identified other funding opportunities outside crowdfunding.\u201d\n\nReminiscing on her experience, she said, \u201cYou often wonder whether you can hack it with a turnaround, and I did, so that\u2019s one thing I learned. Now people are calling me the queen of turnaround after one event.\u201d\n\nAnother valuable lesson for Sowho was how she was able to manage her productivity considering that she joined ThriveAgric during the pandemic and managed things virtually.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realise how focused I could be, because I\u2019m one of those people that like to do everything all the time, all at once,\u201d Sowho said. \u201cBut I think in this situation, the urgency required that I stay very focused.\u201d\n\nThere were ThriveAgric team members she didn\u2019t meet until about 2\u20133 months into the job, because she was very focused on talking to the people nearest to this issue.\n\nFor the team at ThriveAgric, the incident was a learning moment for them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re learning to scale with structure. Right now as we explore different opportunities, we look at the risks and how to scale sustainably,\u201d Eje said. \u201cFor us, we\u2019re still certain about what we want to do. It\u2019s still day one.\u201d\n\nKola Aina believes the incident was a reminder as an investor that \u201csupporting companies through difficult times is one of the truest forms of portfolio support.\u201d\n\nOpportunities ahead\n\nThriveAgric has since paused crowdfunding from retail investors to focus on institutional investors. Since the pivot, ThriveAgric has sealed investment partnerships with several commercial banks, the CBN, World Food Program, and USAID. Its landmark partnership came recently in the form of a one-year project in partnership with USAID-backed West Africa Trade & Investment Hub (Trade Hub).\n\nThe partnership, which aims to empower at least 50,000 farmers across Nigeria, will be supported with a $1.75 million co-investment grant from Trade Hub. The startup is also focusing on building out its farmer-centred technology solutions which currently serves over 200,000 farmers. The company\u2019s focus is to build the largest network of profitable farmers across Africa.\n\n\u201cAgritech is not just about having a website and asking people for money,\u201d Eje said. \u201cIt\u2019s about building the infrastructure that supports the food production value chain.\u201d\n\nSultan Quadri contributed to this story.\n\n*Name changed to protect source\u2019s identity.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing its success in the agricultural sector with technology that addresses market access and other challenges for Nigerian farmers, Tingo Mobile Plc, on Tuesday, March 22, 2022, announced a new platform, TingoPay Super app, to address end-user challenges in Nigeria.\n\nTingoPay is an all-in-one financial solution application designed to address challenges for Small and Medium Scale Businesses (SMEs) and, by extension, all bank customers with smartphones. The Super app will address the issue of limited payment options for users.\n\nAt a press conference, Ayoade Alao, the company\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO), stated that the \u201csingle bold step would revolutionise financial technology in Nigeria by providing a single window.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith our technology, we connect millions of farmers through their various cooperative societies, allowing them to access markets both locally and globally from the comfort of their own homes,\u201d he said.\n\nConsequently, farmers have unlimited access and market information, and their concerns about infrastructural challenges, time and product waste are completely alleviated.\n\nAccording to the company, it provides its users with customised smartphones to assist them in accessing the app in order to make this process easier and to assist these farmers.\n\nTingo Mobile plans to work with Motorola to provide new Defy rugged Motorola smartphones to users who do not currently own one. In addition, users can pay off the cost of the smartphone over a period of 24 to 36 months.\n\nAccording to the COO, since the CBN implemented its cashless policy in 2007, the policy has seen significant improvement, with implementation in various sectors and various SMEs popping up and channeling their businesses toward facilitating policy adoption.\n\nMoreover, the company claims that TingoPay will completely remove the users\u2019 stress of entering into a banking relationship because the app can resolve all banking challenges, including loans. They affirm to have gone so far as to help businesses manage their day-to-day challenges, though users will need a commercial bank account.\n\nTingoPay is an upgraded version of Nwassa\n\nLaunched in January 2019, Nwassa is a comprehensive platform that aims to connect every player in the agriculture value chain. The platform enables farmers to sell large quantities of farm produce to buyers both within and outside of Africa.\n\nAll farmers need to do with Nwassa, which can be considered a spin-off of Tingo\u2019s agricultural activities over the years, is list their produce and ensure it is ready. Tingo and its partners, on the other hand, handle every other aspect of the company\u2019s operations, from logistics to payment and warehousing.\n\nTingoPay, on the other hand, is open to everyone, not just farmers. But will house all existing customers under Nwassa.\n\nAlao revealed that the SuperApp would address the challenges of limited payment options for end users, inability to resolve time-related transaction issues with banks, business continuity due to funds, using multiple solutions to perform day-to-day transactions, complexity with application and use case adoption, and business continuity for Agents as the T+1 time on settlement from Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) can be challenging.\n\nThe new development, which also offers a peer-to-peer lending option, would allow end users to purchase airtime and data for the country\u2019s four major network providers \u2013 MTN, Airtel, GLO, and 9Mobile \u2013 as well as Smile and Spectranet.\n\nIt also will finance television subscriptions within Nigeria for Startime and Multichoice, and generate token for users from Nigeria\u2019s electricity providers. Other services would include a WAEC result checker and One Time Password setup with one-way messaging (OTP).\n\nBesides, the platform will make it simple for SMEs to generate online invoices for customers using a variety of payment methods. It will also provide \u201cCheckout,\u201d \u2013 an inline integration for Web applications and CMS \u2013 to complete payment on their sites.\n\nIt also includes a fund transfer option within the Payant application as well as a transfer API to process fund transfers from external applications, as well as a dashboard for a well-detailed reporting system to report inflow, outflow, invoicing, and monitoring of all user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeimo Noel, Financial Controler, Tingo Mobile Plc (right); Busayo Ayenimo, Head Human Resources; Alao Ayoade, Chief Operating Officer; Olaide Ayoola Chief Commercial Officer; and Auwal Maude, Director Public Sector at a the launch of TingoPay SuperApp in Lagos.\n\nTingo Pay is also expected to provide agency banking, with POS terminals available for agents to perform CashIn/CashOut transactions. According to Ayoade, the new solution will also provide customers with soft loans that are easy to access and repay.\n\nAlao also stated that the development increases profitability by 40-60%, thereby increasing farmers\u2019 investment to produce more while also connecting them to a global market and network that aids in the resolution of challenges in their farming value chain.\n\nWith a current subscriber base of 9 million people, coming from Nwassa, TingoPay will officially launch on May 1st, 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Coverage by Techpoint Africa Looking to promote your industry event?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterswitch, the leading Africa-focused integrated digital payments and commerce company, held an immersion session and interactive parley with members of the media on Thursday, March 17, 2022.\n\nThe aim was to engage with the media, answer some burning questions, and provide relevant updates to them on the solutions and services that Interswitch renders to its individual and business customers.\n\nIn her opening remark, Cherry Eromosele, Executive Vice President (EVP), Group Marketing & Corporate Communications, Interswitch, welcomed members of the media and discussed the role of Interswitch as an innovative enabler in the African Fintech ecosystem.\n\nShe said \u201cin support of our mission to inspire Africa to greatness, Interswitch group has continued to push the boundary of innovation to deliver payment solutions that enable commerce thrive across Africa. In keeping with this goal, we have naturally taken the role of an enabler in the African Fintech ecosystem, a duty we have accepted with a deep sense of responsibility, fully realizing that several of our platforms form the framework on which many players in the ecosystem have built their offerings\u201d.\n\nAcknowledging the media\u2019s role in framing their narratives, she hoped that the parley would set the tone for a mutually beneficial relationship with members of the media moving forward.\n\nThe immersion session led by Olawale Akanbi, Group Head, Growth Marketing \u2013 Merchants & Ecosystem, was titled \u2018understanding the Interswitch business: Africa\u2019s Fintech Model Company.\u2019 It showcased the businesses of Interswitch and its position as an enabler in the fintech industry.\n\nSome proprietary products of Interswitch were also discussed. These include but are not limited to: Webpay which has now evolved into Interswitch Payment Gateway, it is free and easy to integrate; Quickteller, Verve, API services that other fintechs leverage, software development for customers such as banks, etc. Also, there is e\u2019Clat, a relatively new arm of Interswitch.\n\nInterswitch e\u2019Clat is a Healthtech company. They provide smart solutions for effective healthcare with expression at different touchpoints on the value chain, such as efficient record keeping, and so on.\n\nAnswering a question bordering on how Interswitch has been able to navigate infrastructural challenges in Nigeria, Akeem Lawal, Managing Director (MD), Payments Processing and Switching (Interswitch Purepay), highlighted that the company, which started operations in 2002, has come so far by adapting and providing their solutions to local problems.\n\nHe mentioned that standby generators are available at their data centres and offices. This is one of the ways they have managed the infrastructural challenges prevalent in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe recognise the challenges; however, we also believe that the capacity to solve them are with us.\u201d\n\nMr Lawal also mentioned that Interswitch plans to launch an internship program and sponsors another science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education initiative through its InterswitchSPAK Switch-a-Future initiative, which already organises STEM competitions in Nigeria and Kenya. The aim is to empower the younger generations with necessary skills to tackle the prevalent issues in Africa.\n\nCherry Eromosele also added that InterswitchSPAK is part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) program. They intend to continue the program in other countries as they continue to expand.\n\nOn digital security issues and growing concerns from customers using digital payment platforms, Vincent Ogbunude, MD, Payment tokens (Verve), said some measures, such as the two-factor authentication, have been put in place to curb fraud.\n\nHe also mentioned that users of these platforms also need to be informed of their usage. He said they create awareness directly and indirectly by educating users on best practices when using their platforms.\n\nAlso, answering a question relating to Interswitch\u2019s presence in 185 countries and the appeal of Verve card usage in Nigeria and its possible limitations, Vincent Ogbunude mentioned that there are two types of Verve cards: Classic Verve card and Verve global card.\n\nThe Verve Global card is accepted in 185 countries. The Verve global card covers the limitations of the Classic Verve card.\n\nHe also said that they are looking at increasing global acceptance of Verve. They are working on partnering with online global merchants such as Netflix, Microsoft, AliExpress, among others, on boosting acceptance.\n\nRegarding Quickteller\u2019s services and how they have been handling competition, Muyiwa Asagba, MD, Digital Commerce & Merchant Acquiring (Interswitch Paymate), said they focused on the consumer and their lifestyle.\n\nHe said Quickteller is tailored to the consumer\u2019s lifestyle and they have new features on the platform. Examples are the new events and airline ticket booking features on the Quickteller platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Coverage by Techpoint Africa Looking to promote your industry event?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb3 is perhaps one of the biggest buzzwords frequently used in the crypto world.\n\nCrypto evangelists have thrown it around to signify an era where the Internet becomes decentralised, and every user owns a portion of everything that exists on the Internet.\n\nHowever, Web3 might not be all it\u2019s cracked up to be. This article by The Verge details how the Web3 concept could be a ploy by VCs and investors to recoup their investments earlier rather than wait several years.\n\nThey do this by getting the startup to create tokens. While the success of the Web3 company depends on many real-life factors, the token, however, could reach incredible highs with the right amount of hype.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen these tokens are created, a sizable portion is given to the VCs who simply wait for it to blow and cash out afterwards. This dark side of Web3 became famous last year when Elon Musk, Tesla CEO, referred to it as \u201ca marketing buzzword.\u201d Do you agree? You can shoot me a reply and tell me how you feel.\n\nInterestingly, we\u2019re discussing something crypto-related today. Here\u2019s today\u2019s spread:\n\nLegalising and regulating crypto\n\nYouTube\u2019s plan to stream TV shows for free\n\nLegalising and regulating crypto\n\nWhile the crypto market has not seen bull runs that send the entire crypto community in a frenzy since Bitcoin\u2019s all-time high of $65,000, it has not been devoid of significant updates.\n\nAn example is Ukraine\u2019s decision to make digital currencies into legal tender and the US\u2019 regulatory plans.\n\nBoth events are a watershed moment for cryptocurrencies as this means institutional investors and governments are recognising it as a tool for major financial transformation.\n\nHowever, the events can also be tied to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war that has seen Ukraine raise $54 million in crypto donations in one week.\n\nTo know more about Ukraine\u2019s crypto donations and their effect on the market, please read here: Russia-Ukraine War: What $54m in crypto donations could mean for the global crypto market\n\nSome people believe that the executive order on crypto by the US was borne out of fears that Russia might use it to circumvent sanctions. According to Bitcoin.com, the President of the European Central Bank (ECB), Christine Lagarde, said that cryptocurrencies are a threat, and Russia is certainly using them to avoid sanctions\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao, believes it\u2019s not possible and gives reasons.

Yes, but if you\u2019re willing to see ads.\n\nAccording to a blog post, YouTube now has up to 4,000 TV series episodes available on the platform. However, they are still only available to users in the US.\n\nThe video-sharing platform did not mention if this feature would be available in other regions, but it will be interesting to see how it competes with pay TV services like MultiChoice-owned DStv and GOtv.\n\nYouTube already has a massive audience: According to Statista, YouTube had 1.8 billion users globally in 2021 and 23.01% \u2014 415 million \u2014 come from Africa.\n\nDStv, on the other hand, grew its number of active subscribers in Africa to 20.9 million in 2021.\n\nPer YouTube\u2019s blog post, more people are opting to watch videos on the big screen, and the move to add TV shows to their options is perfect timing.\n\nUnlike pay TV, where you have to flip through channels to see what\u2019s on, YouTube said it\u2019ll add streamlined navigation and menus that will make it easy to find airing TV shows.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nMaine island library wants your banned books.

          "text": "The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) said on Wednesday it expects Nigeria\u2019s economic growth to slow more than expected in 2022 as power-supply issues, high inflation and expected monetary tightening hurt output.\n\nFrom an initial forecast of 3.3 percent in February, the EIU now expects real GDP growth to decelerate to 3 percent in 2022 from 3.6 percent in 2021.\n\nThe slowdown \u201cwill stem from continued erosion of household purchasing power by inflation, monetary tightening by the CBN and power-supply issues, with low water levels and inadequate gas supply constraining production,\u201d it said in a new report.\n\nFaster growth is, however, expected in 2023 and 2024 on the back of higher real exports and reduced imports, followed by another marked slowdown in 2025 and 2026 as world oil prices slide and fundamentals deteriorate.\n\nThe EIU\u2019s projection, though at par with the median estimate of economists polled in a BusinessDay survey earlier this month, is more optimistic than that of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which expect the economy to grow by 2.7 percent and 2.5 percent respectively in 2022.\n\nNigeria\u2019s economy expanded at the fastest rate in seven years in 2021, thanks to the low base effect from the COVID-1- induced recession the previous year.\n\nHowever, a shrinking GDP size, relative to 2014, exposes the economy\u2019s struggles and the pain of its 200 million people who are growing poorer and have to contend with the world\u2019s second highest unemployment rate and Africa\u2019s sixth-highest inflation rate.\n\nRead also: 7 economic highlights of First Quarter 2022 (Q1 \u201922)\n\nNigeria\u2019s economic woes have gone from bad to worse this year, with rising diesel prices, lingering petrol scarcity in major parts of the country and worsening power supply.\n\nDiesel prices have more than doubled amid the Russia-Ukraine crisis, raising energy costs for businesses that must generate their own power to make up for the shortfall from an unreliable national grid.\n\nManufacturers are threatening shutdown, job cuts and price increases as a result of the higher energy costs while several other businesses are bracing for lower profits.\n\nOn Monday, Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), said available data on key macroeconomic indicators suggested a likely subdued output growth for the economy for most of 2022.\n\nEmefiele said the anticipated slowed growth \u201cis hinged on the dampening impact to growth of rising energy prices in the domestic economy, tightening external financial conditions and the persistence of legacy security and infrastructural problems.\u201d\n\nAlthough the CBN left interest rates unchanged at its last Monetary Policy Committee meeting this week, four out of 10 members of the committee voted for a hike, as pressure mounts on Nigeria to hike rates in line with rising global interest rates.\n\nThe EIU expects the CBN to increase rates by 100 basis points over 2022, taking it to 12.5 percent.\n\nNigeria\u2019s economic growth is, however, expected to pick up to 3.9 percent in 2023 amid changing economic fortunes.\n\nA mega-refinery, the Dangote Refinery, is expected to come on stream this year and will be ramped up in 2023, further boosting net exports.\n\nSome output will be for regional markets, and from 2023, local production will increasingly replace fuel imports, on which Nigeria depends, as fuel prices are liberalised.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s fiscal deficit will widen to a 10-year high this year as high global fuel prices push up petrol subsidy bills while crude oil output remains low, a new report by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) has said.\n\n\u201cWe have raised our fiscal deficit forecast for 2022 from 4.5 percent of GDP to 5 percent of GDP, largest since the 1990s, reflecting high expenses related to petrol subsidies and low crude production limiting revenue despite high world prices,\u201d the report said.\n\nA fiscal deficit is the excess of government spending over its revenue.\n\nNigeria\u2019s rising fiscal deficit is another stark reminder of how the petrol subsidy bills continue to eat into the earnings of the cash-strapped government of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nPetrol subsidy payment gulped about N1.67 trillion in 2021, according to data from the Nigerian National Petroleum Company.\n\nThe government had initially said the 2022 budget would only provide for subsidy till June but is now set to maintain it for at least another 17 months when the current administration would have left office.\n\n\u201cThe cost is unsustainable, but an election in early 2023 has sharpened the government\u2019s resolve to continue with price regulation,\u201d EIU noted.\n\nOil prices shot above $100 per barrel for the first time in years as Russia invaded Ukraine but this has not benefitted Africa\u2019s biggest oil producer as the country has also been battling with weak oil production.\n\nNigeria recorded an average oil production of 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2011 but this plunged to 1.5 million bpd in 2020 and 1.3 million bpd in 2021. According to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Nigeria\u2019s oil production plunged 10 percent to 1.26 million bpd in February 2022.\n\n\u201cLow crude oil production will hold back revenue,\u201d the EIU analysts said.\n\nThe report said a large fiscal overhang would be dealt with by the next administration, mainly through tax reform.\n\nRead also: FAAC shares N590.5bn revenue to federal, state, local governments in March 2022\n\nNigeria\u2019s value-added tax (VAT) is one of the lowest in the world at 7.5 percent, with the EIU saying a tax increase is inevitable during the next administration due to the high debt-servicing costs. They project that after the 2023 elections, VAT will rise to 15 percent.\n\nNigeria\u2019s total public debt hit N39.5 trillion as at December 2021 from N38 trillion in September 2021, according to data from Debt Management Office.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has projected that Nigeria will spend 92 percent of its 2022 earnings repaying debts. This is higher than the 85.5 percent spent last year. Agusto and Co, a local credit ratings firm, says the figure will be around 90 percent.\n\nRaising VAT to 15 percent may be challenging for a nation where over 40 percent of its citizens live in abject poverty.\n\n\u201cWhile tax rates are relatively low in Nigeria, it simply is not an excuse to keep increasing taxes,\u201d Akinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank, said recently.\n\n\u201cTake the case of Norway for example. Its tax-to-GDP ratio is 39 per cent but education is free through university. Singapore\u2019s tax-to-GDP ratio is 13.2 percent but has 100 percent access to electricity and 100 per cent access to water,\u201d Adesina said.\n\n\u201cOverall, we expect tax increases to narrow the fiscal deficit from an estimated 5 percent of GDP in 2022 to an average of 2.6 percent of GDP a year in 2023-24. Falling oil prices will then result in a steady widening of the deficit, to 3.1 percent of GDP in 2026,\u201d the EIU added.",

          "text": "The rising energy costs and other challenges facing businesses in Nigeria may put a damper on their ability to service bank loans, even as lenders may be forced to reduce credit to critical sectors of the economy, analysts in the financial services sector said.\n\nBanks saw their non-performing loans moderate to 4.84 per cent in February 2022 from 4.90 per cent in December 2021, Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), said on Tuesday.\n\nNigerian households, banks and other businesses rely on fuel-powered generators for the running of their daily activities or transactions as public power supply remains unreliable.\n\nCurrently, the price of diesel has jumped to over N700 per litre from about N300/litre early in the year, compounding the already high inflationary pressure in the country.\n\nNigeria\u2019s headline inflation accelerated to 15.70 percent in February from 15.60 percent in January, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nFollowing the ongoing fuel crisis, some Nigerian commercial banks have said they would cut down on some hours of operations to make sure they are able to conserve diesel cost.\n\n\u201cInflationary pressures may affect the way they (banks) deal with customers in terms of selection criteria, given the pressures that businesses are facing right now,\u201d Abdulrahman Yinusa, former council member of Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria, said.\n\nYinusa noted that the banks were also facing the pressures.\n\nHe said, \u201cSo, the pressure will begin to show on the ability of customers to service their loans. And once that begins to happen, it is either bad loans or a reduction in the loan portfolio. Either way the economy will be the loser because at the end of the day, the ability of the economy to generate more activities is going to be constrained.\n\nRead also: Many rich Nigerians one shock away from poverty \u2013 W/Bank\n\n\u201cI suspect the bad loans will happen first before the reduction in the loan portfolio because at the end of the day, a lot of loans are already out anyway and the ability to service loans will begin to be impaired by the increased cost of doing businesses.\u201d\n\nMuda Yusuf, CEO of Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, said the high diesel cost has a negative effect on manufacturers because their cost would go up.\n\n\u201cSome of them will not be able to continue production. So, if that happens, the risk of lending to them will be higher because their risk of default will be higher, therefore that may affect lending to them,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CBN data on money and credit growth show that total credit to the private sector increased by 15.7 percent year-on-year to N35.4 billion.\n\n\u201cAlthough growth has slowed since November last year, the double-digit growth rate is encouraging,\u201d said analysts at FBNQuest.\n\nIn terms of credit allocation to key sectors of the economy, latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics show that the oil and gas sector got the highest credit allocation of N3.93 trillion, followed by the manufacturing sector (N3.19 trillion) as at the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nBismarck Rewane, CEO of Financial Derivatives Company Limited, said, \u201cThere is a spillover effect of international price levels on us.\n\n\u201cInterest rates are moving upwards while Nigeria is maintaining the periscope for several reasons; so except something is done to increase aggregate supply and to take care of the energy crisis shocks that have taken place, we will continue to wallow in an inflationary spiral.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said on Monday that the Ministry of Finance, the CBN and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation were making plans for adequate funding for petroleum products supply.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be engaging NNPC as well, if there\u2019s any kind of intervention that we can provide to help make it easy for them to bring in these products,\u201d Emefiele said while responding to questions from journalists after the Monetary Policy Committee meeting.",

This emphasizes the special relationship that Edo State, as a sub-national, and the Italian government enjoys. We have had a long-standing relationship as you pointed out and are very glad that, under your leadership, we are hitting the ground running.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cAs you know, we are currently working on a lot of initiatives with the federal government and the Italian authorities, and this derives from what we have done in the past. In the past five years, we have been working with the Italian authorities and have been able to significantly limit and reduce the incidents of irregular migration and human trafficking in Edo.\n\n\u201cMigration has become a global phenomenon; you cannot stop it, but can only manage it. Our people love to travel; many have established and they are doing well, which serves as an impetus for many more who want to go.\n\n\u201cBut we have to regulate that process. That is where we would be discussing with you and the federal authorities. The conversation has started on the new structure for our response to migration; we call it migration 2.0.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cHere, we are saying that in addition to what have been doing in the last five years, which is first to resettle those who want to come back home and integrate them into the society, as well as try to deal with the root causes of migration so that we can reduce the number of people who want to migrate as migration is linked to development.\u201d\n\nThe governor further noted, \u201cIn this new policy, we want to amend our laws on human trafficking and irregular migration and in addition, try to put in pathways for regular migration. We should move from migration to trade and investment.\n\n\u201cWe are creating the enabling environment for businesses to thrive in Edo State. Whatever businesses they are doing there, there is really no reason why they cannot bring some of the capital back home.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Italian Ambassador, who reassured the continuous support of the Italian government, hailed the governor\u2019s efforts in the fight against human trafficking and illegal migration.\n\nHe noted, \u201cGlobal migration is a phenomenon that is unstoppable. This visit is another opportunity to look at it as a game-changer and fully share your vision and outline how we can work together, starting from the work you did in the fight against human trafficking.\n\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s time to look at the migration clause that is legal and then create opportunities to attract investments from Europe, especially from Italy.

We don\u2019t just want to strengthen our TVET schools, we want to mainstream TVET so that from primary school, our pupils are exposed to handiwork.\n\n\u201cWe call it pre-apprenticeship training. With this, any pupil that wants to go to a TVET school can do so. If they go the TVET route, that doesn\u2019t mean that is where their education stops; they can decide to go on to read medicine or go to a polytechnic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. We just want to ensure that basic education, as stipulated by the 2004 UBE Act, which first 10 years of education, is free and compulsory, and by the time a student is graduating from JSS 3, we want them not only to be literate and numerate, we also want them to be skilled,\u201d she added.\n\nOn formalizing the informal skilled sector in the state, the Commissioner noted that going forward, the state would ensure that all electricians, plumbers, welders and tailors among other artisans operating in the state, work in line with the guidelines of the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE).\n\n\u201cSo, for our informal apprenticeship sector, we want to link that with our adult education system. If you are already an artisan; a master craftsperson, but you don\u2019t know how to read, we can send you to our adult education school; it is free. That is for those who are already established.\n\n\u201cFor new apprenticeship that will be coming into the system, we are now going to say you must know how to read and write.\u201d\n\nThe mainstreaming of skill acquisition, technical and vocational studies, Oviawe explained, would be extended to Special Needs Schools in the state.\n\n\u201cSo, mainstreaming skilled acquisition, technical and vocational is not just in our regular schools, the governor has mandated that we should extend to our Special Needs schools.\n\n\u201cWe want to train the next generation to be self-sufficient. We don\u2019t want to raise the next generation of able people who grow up and are acculturated to become beggars,\u201d she noted.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

I think, the biggest value apart from the distributions which we have talked about is the ability for you using embedded finance to remove frictions for your customers\u201d, disclosed Akeem Lawal, Chief Executive Officer, Interswitch Group.\n\nFounder/CEO of OnePipe, Ope Adeoye stated that the platform\u2019s launch demonstrated that the payment industry was making significant progress. \u201cOur view is that the market will recognise the importance of concepts like this. Fidelity Bank will blaze the trail and there\u2019s a high probability that other competitors will come into the space down the line.\u201d\n\nIn assessing OnePipe\u2019s relationship with Fidelity Bank, Adeoye disclosed, \u201cWhen we started working on the idea for embedded finance for non-finance companies with Fidelity Bank serving as infrastructure at the base, there was quite an effort spent on trying to understand each other. We enjoyed working with Fidelity Bank because the process was collaborative and smooth.\n\nOn his part, Executive Director, Inlaks, Tope Dare lauded the bank for blazing the trail in open banking and embedded finance which further reinforces its commitment to delivering unrivalled customer service. \u201cWe hope to see more players in the financial services industry collaborate to ensure we grow a bigger economy that would be beneficial to everyone in the ecosystem\u201d, he said.\n\nIn a similar vein, Executive Director/Co-Founder of AppZone, Emeka Emetarom applauded the bank for collaborating with the Financial Technology (FinTechs) industry rather than competing with them. \u201cWe are hoping that all the other banks will take a cue from Fidelity Bank and ensure the adoption of embedded finance across the financial services industry\u201d, said Emetarom.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Stanley Amuchie, Executive Director/Chief Operations and Information Officer, Fidelity Bank Plc encouraged customers to use the platform as guaranteed that they would return with positive testimonials.\n\n\u201cEverything we do as a financial organisation including the design of our products and services has the customer as our main focus. It is on this basis that we have worked very hard over the last few months, together with our technical partners to innovate a solution that enables businesses across different sectors to easily integrate financial services with their product offerings\u201d, said Amuchie.\n\nFidelity Bank is a full-fledged commercial bank operating in Nigeria with about six million customers who are serviced across its 250 business offices and digital banking channels. In 2021, the bank was recognised as the \u201cFastest Growing Bank\u201d and \u201cMSME & Entrepreneurship Financing Bank of the Year\u201d at the 2021 BusinessDay Banks and Other Financial Institutions (BAFI) Awards.",

          "title": "APC Governors Concede To Buhari On Consensus Candidate",
          "text": "There were indications yesterday that the All Progressive Congress (APC) has finally settled for consensus ahead of the party\u2019s national convention billed for Saturday.\n\nThis is even as governors elected on the party\u2019s platform have yielded to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s choice of the next national chairman of the party.\n\nThe APC governor yesterday came out from a meeting with Buhari saying they will throw their weight behind whoever the president supports to become national chairman.\n\nFormer Borno State governor, Ali Modu Sheriff, had on Sunday announced his decision to step down from the national chairmanship race of the APC, citing a unity list the party had agreed on.\n\nSheriff added that if the party decides to throw the contest open between Monday and Friday, he would return to the race.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere had been reports suggesting that former Nasarawa State governor, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, is the aspirant Buhari is pushing for to be the national chairman, but the choice of Adamu is facing stiff opposition from the Senate caucus of the party and legacy parties that merged to form the APC.\n\nFollowing the development, chairman of the party\u2019s caretaker committee and Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni, will meet with the APC Senators today.\n\nContrary to rumours that President Buhari may have changed his mind on backing Senator Adamu following the protest by legacy parties, it became clear that the president and the party are still much interested in the consensus arrangement last night when he met with the party\u2019s national chairmanship aspirants.\n\nBuhari hosted the national chairmanship aspirants of the governing party to a dinner at the presidential villa.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe parley with the aspirants was said to be in furtherance of genuine efforts at ensuring a rancor-free and successful national convention.\n\nAll those aspiring for the national chairmanship position attended the meeting.\n\nThe chairmen of the APC caretaker committee, Governor Buni; chief of staff to the president, Prof Ibrahim Gambari and secretary to the government of the federation, Boss Mustapha, were also in attendance.\n\nEarlier yesterday, APC governors who were led to the meeting with the president by the chairman of the caretaker committee of the party said they were fully in support of whoever Buhari chooses to be national chairman.\n\nChairman of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) and governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, told State House correspondents after the closed door meeting that they would support any process that would lead to a consensus.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to him, the governors all restated their commitment to working together to ensure that the convention takes place on March 26.\n\nBagudu said they also agreed to support all the decisions that were taken by the caretaker committee, both acting as a working committee and acting with the donated powers given to it by the National Executive Committee (NEC).\n\nHe said \u201cOur party is a democratic party; we will always urge consensus. We\u2019ll urge respect for the decisions of the party because the distribution of political party offices here has been approved by the highest organ of the party, which is the national caretaker committee because they were acting in their capacity as the national executive committee of the party.\n\n\u201cBut where people still choose to go against the grain, whatever the party constitution allows them because we wouldn\u2019t do anything undemocratic.\n\n\u201cMr President has always urged consensus for all positions because consensus is in accordance with the democratic tenets and once you have leaders who are established, who are working towards the same goal; yes, we might have our differences, like was once carefully explained by Governor El-Rufai.\n\n\u201cBut on the principle of ensuring that we get leadership that will hit the ground running, we are united, and to that extent, we will support any process that will lead to consensus and the emergence of leaders without the need for an election.\u201d\n\nAsked if we are likely to see surprises at the convention, he said \u201cNo, the governors are united. The governors are unanimous in support of Mr President. The governors are unanimous in the support of the caretaker committee.\n\n\u201cNaturally, there will be hiccups one day, but we have overcome them and we are a human organisation, which is bound sometimes to generate emotions and anxiety, but we are united and unanimous and by God\u2019s grace, we\u2019ll have a very successful and peaceful national convention.\u201d\n\nThe progressive governor\u2019s forum chairman further said they all briefed the president on the distribution of political party offices to the respective zones.\n\n\u201cApart from our support for Mr. President\u2019s endorsement of the candidate for the National Chairman of the party, the various geo-political zones took turns to brief Mr President on what they have been doing to generate consensus in their respective zones amongst the National Working Committee and zonal party positions that have been either allocated to the zones or which the zones are entitled to.\n\n\u201cMost of the zones have been allocated National Working Committee positions that are fewer than the number of states, but there are zonal executive committees from which the zones are working to produce a consensus list.\n\n\u201cSo, this afternoon, the respective zones, Governor Abubakar Bello on behalf of the North-Central; His Excellency, Governor Babagana Zulum Umara, on behalf of the North East; His Excellency, Governor Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa State on behalf of North West; His Excellency, Governor Dave Umahi, on behalf of South East; Governor Kayode Fayemi on behalf of the South West all briefed the president. I further mention the position of the South-South to Mr. President, as I had on paper.\u201d\n\nBuni Meets Senators Today Over Party Crisis\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate caucus of the APC will today meet with the Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee.\n\nThe meeting which is billed for 4pm, LEADERSHIP gathered is not unconnected with the crisis in the party.\n\nThe notice of meeting was conveyed in a letter read by the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, moments before the chamber adjourned sitting on Wednesday.\n\nThe letter was signed by the Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi (APC, Kebbi North).\n\nThe meeting, which was supposed to be held yesterday (Tuesday) at the National Assembly, is now slated to be held today at the National Secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nLawan said, \u201cThere will be an APC Senate caucus meeting with the CECPC at the National Headquarters on Thursday, March 24, 2022.\n\n\u201cBuses conveying Distinguished Senators will leave by 3:30 pm at the Senate Entrance. Venue is Blantyre Street, Wuse 2, Abuja. Time: 4pm.\u201d\n\nAkume Expresses Satisfaction With Party Screening\n\nMeanwhile, former governor of Benue State and minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs, Senator George Akume, has declared that he is satisfied with the screening of aspirants for the national chairmanship position of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe former lawmaker was among the national chairmanship aspirants screened last night in Abuja.\n\nOther national chairmanship aspirants at the screening include: Senator Sani Musa, Senator Tanko Al-Makura, Saliu Mustapha, Mohammed Etsu, former governor Abdulaziz Yari and Senator Abdullahi Adamu.\n\nThe frontline chairmanship candidate, who was accompanied to the screening venue by a powerful delegation of elder statesmen as well as APC leaders across the states of the federation and other stakeholders, expressed confidence that the screening exercise will produce quality leadership for the ruling party.\n\nAkume said, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s an interview or it\u2019s a screening exercise. They asked me questions on the political realities of our time. So these are issues that affect many other political parties, even the big ones like APC which is a flagship political party at the moment.\n\n\u201cIt was an interactive session so to speak and I think I learnt much from them and I think they learnt a little from me. By and large, it was okay.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a Forum of Christian and Muslim Youths of Nigeria have expressed support for the national chairmanship aspiration of Senator George Akume.\n\nAt a media briefing at the end of their meeting in Abuja, the forum said Akume, a former Benue state governor, is the best for the party and by extension the country.\n\nLeaders of the forum, Mallam Yusuf Muhammed and Peter Bassey Asuquo, president and national publicity secretary respectively, said Akume will unite the party and ensure the party wins the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe Forum of Christians and Muslims Youth of Nigeria recommended Senator George Akume without reservations as the best candidate for the APC National Chairmanship based on his competence, experience, and nationalism.\n\n\u201cWe have constituted a lobbying committee among our members who cut across the 36 states and FCT to solicit the support of the APC critical stakeholders for Senator Akume\u2019s victory as the next National Chairman of the APC. This, we have been doing behind the scenes silently and are quite hopeful of our Patron\u2019s victory,\u201d they said.\n\nThe forum which said Akume has a worldwide leadership perspective, said that he is what APC needs now to galvanize all the stakeholders to victory ahead of the general elections and also Nigeria.\n\nEarlier in the week, Borno State governor, Prof Babagana Zulum, had pleaded with President Buhari, governors on the platform of Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), their deputies and all other stakeholders to consider the candidature of Akume for the position of the national chairman \u201cfor the sake of fairness, equity, and justice.\u201d",

          "text": "Governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) were conspicuously absent at the presidential declaration of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar yesterday.\n\nInstead, the governors were in Abia State for a meeting to deliberate on the state of the nation. Governor Adamu Fintiri of Adamawa State, Atiku\u2019s home state, was also in Abia but he came from there to attend the presidential declaration in Abuja.\n\nThe former vice president, for a record sixth time, declared his ambition to contest the 2023 presidential ticket of the PDP before a mammoth crowd at the International Conference Centre, (ICC) Abuja, yesterday.\n\nHe had flown the party\u2019s flag four years ago but lost the presidential contest to the incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome governors like Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State and Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State have also indicated their interest to vie for the top seat. Former Kwara State governor and Senate President Bukola Saraki is also in the race for the main opposition party\u2019s presidential ticket.\n\nDeclaring his ambition, Atiku said the 2023 presidential election will be a referendum on the country\u2019s unity and progress, or a path to division and backwardness, adding that the ruling party wanted to divide the nation along political, ethnic, and religious lines.\n\nAmong the dignitaries at the declaration were former Vice President Muhammad Namadi Sambo; Adamawa State governor, Umaru Fintiri; former Niger State governor, Babangida Aliyu, Chief Tom Ikimi, Senator Ben Obi, Prof ABC Nwosu, Senator Dino Melaye, Ambassador Roland Omowa and Josephine Anenih, among others.\n\nMeanwhile, contrary to the expectation of Nigerians, the PDP governors in Abia failed to state their stand on the vexed issue of zoning formula for the 2023 general election.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn a communique read by its chairman at the end of their meeting, Governor Tambuwal urged leaders and members of the party to remain focused and united in order to win the election.\n\nTambuwal said the governors reviewed \u201cthe excruciating hardship and suffering being meted out to Nigerians by a failed APC-led federal government, the near collapse of the APC as a viable political party, and the readiness of the PDP to take over and offer qualitative leadership options to rescue the nation.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Tambuwal, life was much better in 2015 under the PDP than today under the APC.\n\n\u201cThe forum urges Nigerians to reject the APC, a party run undemocratically by a committee contrary to the Constitution (S.228) with Mr. President regularly issuing instructions and dictates,\u201d he further said, arguing that \u201cit was impossible for a party so disorganised to offer good governance to the people of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe governors present were Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, Adamawa; Udom Emmanuel, Akwa Ibom; Bala Mohammed, Bauchi; Douye Diri , Bayelsa; Samuel Ortom, Benue, and Ifeanyi Okowa, Delta State.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOthers were Godwin Obaseki.

          "text": "The two chambers of the National Assembly have resolved to appeal last Friday\u2019s judgment by a Federal High Court in Umuahia, Abia State, nullifying the provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nThat provision mandates political appointees with political ambitions to resign their positions before contesting in primary elections.\n\nThe resolution was first reached at the Senate during plenary yesterday, following the consideration of a motion entitled: \u201cUrgent need to appeal the judgment of the Federal High Court Umuahia on Suit No.: FHC/UM/CS/26/2022 on Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022.\u201d\n\nAlso, the House of Representatives resolved to appeal the same judgement, which directed the attorney-general of the federation and minister of justice, Abubakar Malami, to delete section 84(12) from the new electoral act.\n\nIn the Senate, the motion was sponsored by Senator George Thompson Sekibo (Rivers East) and co-sponsored by 79 other senators.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSekibo, in his presentation, observed that Section 4(1)(2) and (3) of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, vested the power of lawmaking for the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the National Assembly.\n\nAccording to him, the interpretation of the meaning of the words \u2018civil service\u2019 and \u2018public service\u2019 in Section 318 was unambiguous, saying, \u201cthere\u2019s a difference between the civil service or public service and political appointment.\u201d\n\nHe called on the Senate to show concern about the judgment especially when it was not given opportunity to represent itself in a matter that emanates from its legitimate functions, warning that \u201cletting the judgment go without concern will become a precedent on which any person could go to court and obtain judgment to ridicule the good intentions of the National Assembly as an institution.\u201d\n\nThe Senate, accordingly, resolved to appeal the judgment.\n\nAt the proceedings in the Green Chamber, the House resolved to report the trial judge, Justice Evelyn Anyadike, to the National Judicial Council (NJC) for probe.\n\nThe lawmakers expressed disappointment and displeasure with the judgement, which they said was aimed at usurping the powers of lawmaking conferred on them by the 1999 Constitution as amended.\n\nThe lawmakers criticised the judiciary and the executive for usurping the powers of the legislature, stating that only the parliament and not a presidential appointee can amend the law.\n\nThe Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, said he got to know about the case from the media and vowed that he would not sit back and allow the parliament to be ridiculed on his watch.\n\nGbajabiamila said it was curious that the National Assembly was joined in the suit and the judgment was secured from a court in Umuahia, saying parliament must appeal the judgment and ensure that it was set aside.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDeleting Section 84 (12) Work In Progress \u2013 Malami\n\nThe federal government has said the process of deleting section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022, is still on.\n\nThe attorney-general of the federation and minister of justice, Abubakar Malami, disclosed this to State House correspondents after the federal executive council meeting presided over President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa.\n\nAsked to give an update on the implementation of the ruling by a federal high court in Umuahia, Abia State, that ordered him to delete section 84 (12) of the amended electoral act, he said the process was being worked on by the concerned agencies.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe true position of it, in that respect, is that government printers, and indeed Law Reform Commission, among others, that are responsible for the codification and gazetting of our laws, are working naturally, hand in hand with the Office of the Attorney General for the purpose of ensuring that what goes into our laws are indeed in line with the provision of the law.\n\n\u201cAnd above all, as you rightly stated, the possibility of an appeal is equally there. So, what I am saying in effect is that the deletion of section 84 Subsection 12 is a work in progress and is being considered as such.\u201d\n\nLawyers Welcome Planned Appeal By NASS\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, some lawyers in the country yesterday welcomed the decisions of the National Assembly to appeal the judgement, saying it will enhance the country\u2019s jurisprudence.\n\nAccording to them, the judge went beyond the powers given to him on such matters.\n\nThey called on the National Assembly to immediately appeal the judgement and to expect that the case will get to the Supreme Court where it would be decided one way or the other.\n\nA senior advocate, Mr Abdul Balogun, said the judgement will surely crumble at the appeal.To him, a court should not exercise such powers and come up with such judgment.\n\nAnother lawyer, Sylvanus Akpotia, said the judgement may lead the country into chaos in the electoral process. To him, until the judgment is tested at the court of Appeal, it remains the position of the law.\n\nHe said, \u201cI applaud the Senate and the House of Representatives for the resolution. The move will deepen our democracy and law practice in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201dUntil a judgment is set aside by a higher court, it must be obeyed, even if it is given by a drunken hooligan. But I expect an appeal against it in the next few days.\u201d\n\nTo Barrister Ismail Amedu, the court\u2019s position is a dangerous precedent in the country\u2019s jurisprudence.",

          "text": "Ahead of the All Progressives Congress, APC, upcoming national convention, President Muhammadu Buhari, on Wednesday, met with governors of the party.\n\nDuring the meeting, Buhari urged the APC leadership to refund aspirants who were dropped immediately.\n\nHe urged them not to allow the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to take over power in 2023.\n\nThe President told the party leadership to be united in appointing executives ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nHe spoke while reeling out 11 points during the meeting held at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nSee full text of Buhari\u2019s speech below:\n\n\u201cYour Excellencies, I would like to express my gratitude to you all for the work you have done and are doing and your continued partnership and fortified alliances with the Federal Government over the years.\n\n\u201cWhen we came together to form the All Progressives Congress, nearly eight years ago our goal was National Salvation, our resolve was unshakable, our motivation was patriotic and noble.\n\n\u201cConsequently, by the Grace of God, we were rewarded with victory in the 2015 General Elections in a free and fair election.\n\n\u201cOver the last seven years, we have done our best to deliver good governance to the country. We have guaranteed national food security, we have provided modern infrastructure to kick-start economic growth and we have implemented the most comprehensive social welfare programmes in our history.\n\n\u201cAlong the way, our party has survived shocks and attempts to derail it. Our government has also had to endure the worst economic crisis with the free fall of oil prices from an average of $100 per barrel over 15 years of PDP government to an average of $30 \u2013 $50 until the recent energy crisis.\n\n\u201cWe need to remind ourselves of these achievements and not be diverted by petty quarrels and unseemly jockeying for positions. It will be a very sad and regrettable development if these manifest gains are frittered away as a result of internal dissent and rivalry. We must avoid narrow focus and inordinate personal ambitions at the expense of our party\u2019s common good. We must stop frivolous and diversionary litigation when the Party\u2019s reconciliation processes are available for settling disputes.\n\n\u201cWe must restore sanity and purpose in the affairs of our party and lead ourselves to victory and safety.\n\n\u201cAs I remarked when I met Your Excellencies on February 22nd, our aim must be to hand over to an APC Government at the Center and the great majority of states. We must not, by default allow the PDP to get its dirty hands on Government again and return us to the Stone Age.\n\n\u201cAs I said at that meeting, our Party chose its leadership by consensus. I again plead that we choose our next leadership by consensus. This is consistent with the spirit of democracy, the Party\u2019s Constitution and the Nigerian Constitution.\n\n\u201cI have already given my input and other recommendations on the way forward in both my 25th February 2022 meeting with the Chairman of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Committee and my 13th March 2022 letter to the Chairman of the APC Governors Forum.\n\n\u201cWith the convention only two days away I implore you to come together and sort out all the remaining party positions so that within the next 24 hours we can arrive at a Unity List which we can take to the convention.\n\n\u201cFinally, all those who have bought forms indicating interest and have been dropped should have their money refunded without delay.\u201d",

          "text": "The Senate Wednesday resolved to appeal the judgement delivered by the Federal High Court Umuahia last week Friday against Section 84(12) of the 2022 Electoral Act, just as the federal government commenced the process of deleting the section.\n\nThe Bill was recently assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAnd upon assenting the Bill, the president immediately requested that the said clause which bordered on resignation of political appointees of public office holders within a specified period if they wish to participate in primary election of their respective political parties, be expunged from the Act on grounds that it negated provisions of the Nigerian Constitution.\n\nThe judgement\n\nBut in a judgement, Justice Evelyn Anyadike held that the section of the Act was \u201cunconstitutional, invalid, illegal, null, void and of no effect whatsoever and ought to be struck down as it cannot stand when it is in violation of the clear provisions of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the court ordered the Attorney General of the Federation Abubakar Malami (SAN) to \u201cforthwith delete the said Subsection 12 of Section 84 from the body of the Electoral Act.\u201d\n\nPlanned appeal\n\nBut the Senate, on the strength of a motion sponsored by Senator George Sekibo (PDP Rivers East) and 80 others, faulted the ruling and resolved to appeal against it.\n\nThe resolution of the Senate reads: \u201cSenate accordingly resolved to appeal the judgement in suit marked FHC/UM/ CS/26/2022 for the court to set aside the judgement as it was reached without due consideration of the constitutional interpretation in section 318 of the 1999 Constitution as amended.\u201d\n\nSekibo, as main sponsor of the motion, had in his lead debate, said section 84(12) nullified by the court, states that \u201cno political appointee at any level shall be voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or Congress of any political party for the purpose of nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\nHe argued further that political appointees provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act referred to were neither civil servants nor public servants captured by relevant provisions of the Constitution in the 30 days grace of resignation before election.\n\nThe section, he explained, was not inconsistent with sections 66(1) (f), 107(1) (f), 137(1) (g) and 182(1) (g) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended.\n\nThe Deputy Whip of the Senate, Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi (APC Niger North), seconded the motion.\n\nBut Senate President Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, in a move to water down the prayer on appeal, suggested that the matter should be forwarded to the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters.\n\nSenator Gabriel Suswam (PDP Benue North East), however countered by saying \u201csince the prayer on appeal is a direct one, it should be adopted by the Senate.\u201d\n\nThereafter, Senate President Lawan put the prayer of the motion for voice votes with majority of the lawmakers voting in favour of appealing the judgement.\n\nHowever, as observed from the list of senators who co-sponsored the motion, none of the three from Katsina state, the president\u2019s home state, joined in the motion.\n\nOther senators whose names were not included in the list of co-sponsorship of the motion were the Deputy President of the Senate Ovie Omo-Agege, Senate Leader Yahaya Abdullahi, Senate Whip Orji Uzor Kalu and Senator Oluremi Tinubu from Lagos Central among others.\n\nReps too\u2026\n\nAlso, the House of Representatives Wednesday resolved to appeal the judgement.\n\nThe lawmakers resolved that the National Assembly would file a complaint to the National Judicial Council (NJC) against the judge who gave the judgement, as it considered the judgement as amounting to gross misconduct.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe House, while condemning the Abia High Court judgement, also faulted attempts at hurriedly deleting the contentious section, even when the National Assembly was not joined in the suit.\n\n\n\nThe development was fallout of a motion raised under personal privileges by Hon. Sada Soli, who argued that the decision of the court was akin to usurping the constitutional powers of the parliament to make laws.\n\n\n\nIn their separate submissions, Majority Leader of the House, Ado Doguwa and the Chief Whip, Muhammed Tahir Monguno, insisted the legislature is the only institution of government under democracy that has the rights of law making, wondering why an issue which originated from Abuja was filed in Abia state.\n\n\n\nIn his ruling, Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila said he cannot allow anyone to rubbish the institution of legislature, even though he absolved President Buhari of any blame in all of this.\n\nHe said the president merely relied on the legal advice from his aides on the matter, calling on Malami to tarry a while and not to usurp the role of the National Assembly, by foreclosing the right of appeal.\n\nDeleting in progress \u2013 Malami\n\nMeanwhile, AGF Malamihas said the process of deleting the controversial section as ordered by the court, had commenced.\n\nThe minister said this while fielding questions from State House correspondents at the end of the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting Wednesday.\n\n\u201cMy clear response arising there-from, is the fact that truly there exists a court judgment. By the judgment, the court directed the Office of the Attorney General to take the necessary steps to delete the provision, which in essence implies that the provision should not form part of our laws.\n\n\u201cWhether it has been deleted, or has not been deleted, is indeed a function of agencies of government and associated relevant parastatals. But the true position of it in that respect, is the fact that government printers, and indeed Law Reform Commission among others, that are responsible for the codification and gazetting of our laws, are working naturally, hand in hand with the Office of the Attorney General for the purpose of ensuring that what goes into our laws are indeed in line with the provision of the law.\n\n\u201cSo, what I am saying in essence, it is indeed a work in progress against the background of the fact that the Law Reform Commission is involved statutorily, which is a parastatal under the Office of the Attorney General, is a party to the process of codification.\n\n\u201cThe government printers, which is saddled with the responsibility of gazetting our laws on the request of the Office of the Attorney General is equally involved. And above all, as you rightly stated, the possibility of an appeal is equally there. So, what I am saying in effect is deletion of section 84 Subsection 12 is a work in progress and is being considered as such,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Governors elected on the All Progressives Congress (APC) platform have expressed their readiness to support the preferred candidates of President Muhammadu Buhari at the party\u2019s forthcoming national convention.\n\nThe governors made the pledge Wednesday after a meeting with President Buhari at the State House Abuja.\n\nAddressing State House correspondents at the end of the meeting, Chairman Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum and Kebbi state Governor Atiku Bagudu said the governors were ready to do Buhari\u2019s bidding.\n\nThe governors were led to the meeting by the Chairman APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and Yobe state Governor Mai Mala Buni.\n\nLast month, Buhari said he was in favour of the consensus mode for selecting candidates for the party\u2019s national positions, urging the governors to explore same.\n\nSpeaking to journalists at the end of the meeting, Bagudu said: \u201cToday, members of the Progressive Governors Forum were hosted by President Buhari at a meeting to discuss what the governors have been doing in preparation for the March 26, National Convention.\n\n\u201cSome of you may recall that last week there was a letter that was widely circulated in the media, addressed to me as the Chairman of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum and copied to a number of others, including the Chairman of the Caretaker Committee, the acting Chairman of the Caretaker Committee and indeed the Secretary to the Government of the Federation.\n\n\u201cThat letter led to a series of actions, including meetings between the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Chairman of the National Caretaker Committee, Acting Chairman, Gov. Abubakar Bello of Niger State, as he was then, and myself.\n\n\u201cWe all restated our commitment to working together to ensure that the convention takes place on March 26, 2022 and then we agreed to support all the decisions that were taken by the Caretaker Committee, both acting as a working committee and acting with the donated powers given to it by the National Executive Committee.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the Chairman of the Caretaker, upon his return, also appreciated what the Caretaker Committee did and the decisions that were taken in his absence.\n\n\u201cToday we all briefed Mr President on that, and our support for Mr President\u2019s endorsement of the candidate for the National Chairman of the party.\u201d\n\nBagudu further said the president was also briefed on the issue of sharing of political party offices among the respective zones.\n\n\u201cMost of the zones have been allocated National Working Committee positions that are fewer than the number of states, but however, there are zonal executive committees from which the zones are working to produce a consensus list.\n\n\u201cThe governors are unanimous in support of Mr.President. The governors are unanimous in the support of the caretaker committee; we thank the caretaker committee for what they have been doing.\n\n\u201cNaturally, there will be hiccups one day, but we have overcome them and we are a human organisation, which is bound sometimes to generate emotions and anxiety, but we are united and unanimous and by God\u2019s grace, we\u2019ll have a very successful and peaceful National Convention,\u201d he said.\n\nAdamu, Mustapha, others cleared\n\nAbout seven aspirants have picked the expression of interest and nomination forms to contest for the office of the national chairman of the ruling party.\n\nThe aspirants, all of whom hail from North Central zone, are; Senators Tanko Al-Makura and Abdullahi Adamu, both senators and former Nasarawa state governors, Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs Senator George Akume; Saliu Mustapha from Kwara state, a Niger East Senator, Sani Musa; and an aide to the Niger state Governor, Mohammed Etsu.\n\nAlso, an aspirant, Abdul\u2019aziz Yari, a former governor of Zamfara state in the North-west, who dared the zoning arrangement by picking the form last week, also made the list.\n\nIn a related development, the APC national convention screening committee has extended screening of aspirants contesting various positions beyond Wednesday, Blueprint has learnt.\n\nOne of our correspondents also reports that Adamu was screened, contrary to reports that he had earlier been screened before now.\n\nSome online media (not Blueprint) had earlier reported that Senator Adamu did not attend the screening exercise.\n\nBut when Blueprint correspondent visited the Kastina Lodge in Abuja, venue of the said screening exercise, it was reliably learnt that Senator Adamu was at the venue by noon Wednesday and had his time with Governor Aminu Bello Masari-led screening committee.\n\nA source said: \u201cSenator Abdullahi Adamu and few other aspirants for NWC offices joined aspirants for zonal offices today (Wednesday) at Katsina Governor\u2019s Lodge, Asokoro, Abuja for the screening.\u201d\n\nAccording to the earlier announcement signed by Secretary of the Committee, Emmanuel Otagburuagu, the screening of chairmanship and other National Working Committee (NWC) aspirants, was fixed for Tuesday while aspirants for zonal offices was to be conducted Wednesday.\n\nBlueprint, however, learnt that the screening of aspirants for substantive NWC could not be completed as it started late Tuesday night.\n\nOther aspirants sighted at the venue of the exercise include Akume, Musa, Al-Makura, Mustapha, former Deputy Governor of Osun state Senator Iyiola Omisore, Etsu and Yari among others.\n\nAkume commends exercise\n\nMeanwhile, former Benue governor, Senator Akume, has expressed satisfaction with the screening of aspirants for the national chairmanship position.\n\nAccompanied to the venue by a delegation of elder statesmen, APC leaders across the states of the federation and other stakeholders, the minister expressed confidence that the screening exercise would produce quality leadership for the ruling party.\n\nSenator George Akume said: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s an interview, it\u2019s a screening exercise. They asked me questions on political realities of our time, so these are issues that affect many other political parties even the big ones like APC which is a flagship political party movement. It was an interactive session so to speak, and I think I learnt much from them and I think they learnt a little from me. By and large, it was okay.\u201d\n\nThe former senator was among the national chairmanship aspirants screened Tuesday evening in Abuja.\n\nAlso screened were Musa, Al-Makura, Mustapha, Etsu, former governor Yari and Adamu.\n\nMeanwhile, a Forum of Christians and Muslims Youth of Nigeria have backed the national chairmanship aspiration of Senator George Akume.\n\nAt a media briefing at the end of their meeting in Abuja, the forum said Akume was the best for the party and by extension the country.\n\nLeaders of the forum, Malam Yusuf Muhammed and Mr. Peter Bassey Asuquo, President and National Publicity Secretary respectively, said Akume would unite the party and ensure it wins the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe Forum of Christians and Muslims Youth of Nigeria recommend Senator George Akume without reservations as the best candidate for the APC National Chairmanship based on his competence, experience, and nationalism.\n\n\u201cWe have constituted a lobbying committee among our members who cut across the 36 states and FCT to solicit the support of the APC critical stakeholders for Senator Akume\u2019s victory as the next National Chairman of the APC.\n\n\u201cThis, we have been doing behind the scene silently and are quite hopeful of our Patron\u2019s victory,\u201d they said.\n\n",

          "title": "\u2018Reject APC\u2019, PDP Governors Urge Nigerians",
          "text": "The PDP Governors\u2019 Forum has urged Nigerians to reject the All Progressives Congress (APC), saying it is impossible for a party so \u201cdisorganised\u201d to offer good governance to the people of Nigeria.\n\nThe governors\u2019 appeal was disclosed in a communique after their meeting in Abia State on Wednesday.\n\nAmong other things, they reviewed the \u201cexcruciating hardship and suffering being meted out to Nigerians by a failed APC-led Federal Government; the near collapse of the APC as a viable political party, and the readiness of the PDP to take over and offer qualitative leadership options to rescue the nation.\n\nIn attendance were: Governor. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State (Chairman), Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, Abia State (Vice Chairman), Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri of Adamawa State, Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State, Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State, Governor of Bayelsa State, Sen. Douye Diri, Governor of Benue, Samuel Ortom, Governor of Delta, Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, Governor of Edo, Godwin Obaseki, Governor of Enugu, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, Governor of Oyo, Oluseyi Abiodun Makinde, Governor of Rivers, Nyesom Wike, and Deputy Governor of Taraba State, Hon Haruna Manu.\n\nThey issued the following Communique:\n\n1. We lament the terrible pain and hardship facing Nigerians in virtually all aspects of life. The meeting noted that life was much better in 2015 under the PDP than today under the APC as exemplified in the following Comparative Indicators obtained mainly from the National Bureau of Statistics:\n\na. Diesel which is critical for running of SMEs was N131.47 in 2015, it now costs above N700\n\nb. Fuel: Official and Black-Market was N87/155 in 2015, it now costs N167/350.\n\nc. Aviation Fuel/Air Ticket Rate on Domestic Flights was N110 per Litre/N18,000 in 2015, it now hovers around N700 per Litre/N70,000, where available. Indeed, the scarcity of fuel which has resulted in loss of several man hours is a disgrace to Nigeria.\n\nd. The collapse of the National Grid (126 times in 7 years \u2013 (June 2015 to March 2022) and its consequences for non-availability of power is most unfortunate.\n\ne. Kerosene (NHK) used by the ordinary Nigerian for cooking and power was N180 in 2015, it now sells at \u20a6450.\n\nf. Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) \u2013 12.5kg Cylinder sold for N2,400 in 2015, is now sold at between N8,750 and N10, 000.\n\ng. Prices of basic food stuffs are now three times higher than what they used to be in 2015. Staple foods such as rice, beans, cassava flakes are now slipping out of the hands of average Nigerians. Indeed, a Bag of Rice sold for N8500 in 2015 is now N39,000.\n\nh. Electricity was N14.23 per kilowatt in 2015, it is now N38.530, and not even available.\n\ni. Unemployment rate was 11.4% in 2015, it is now over 33%, one the highest in the world.\n\nj. The poverty rate in 2015 was 11.3% but now about 42.8%.\n\nk. Accumulated Inflation in 2015 was about 4%, it is now 15.50%; Inflation Rate was 9.01% in 2015 and now 15.7%.\n\nl. Perhaps the Exchange Rate has been one of the most disastrous. N150 to a dollar was the parallel market (patronised by most businessmen and Nigerians) rate in 2015, it is now about N580 to $1 in the parrel market and still rising.\n\nm. Debt and Debt Servicing:\n\nDomestic Debt of N8.4T and External Debt of USD 7.3b was incurred between 1999-2015.\n\nWhile Domestic Debt of N7.63T (June 2015-Dec 2020) and USD28.57b as at Dec 2020 was incurred. External debt of USD21.27b was incurred between June 2015 and 2021.\n\nn. National Debt to GDP Ratio was 23.41% (2016) it is now 36.88% (2022).\n\no. The Corruption Index has risen from 136 in 2015 to 150 now.\n\np. Nigeria\u2019s Misery Index, an indicator used in determining how economically well off the citizens of a country are, is usually calculated by adding the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate to the annual inflation rate, has moved from 14.75 percent in 2015 to 50.48 (2021).\n\nq. The major threat to the agricultural sector and food security in Nigeria is insecurity. In the northeast of Nigeria, it is estimated that no fewer than 70,000 hectares of arable farmland have been abandoned in the affected States and Local Government areas. The trend is the same all over the country. This further contributes to food inflation. The APC led Federal Government must take steps to cooperate with States to bring security down to the grassroots.\n\n2. The Forum is surprised that in the face of these statistics of complete failure in all ramifications and areas, the APC still wants to be on the ballot in 2023.\n\nThis shows how uncaring and insensitive the APC is. IT HAS BECOME A MENACE TO NIGERIA.\n\n3. The Forum urges Nigerians to reject the APC, a party run undemocratically by a Committee contrary to the Constitution (S.228) with Mr. President regularly issuing instructions and dictates. It is impossible for a party so disorganized to offer good governance to the people of Nigeria.\n\n4. The meeting expressed concern and alarm over various reports and claims of incidents of stealing of crude oil ranging from 80% to 95% of production made by industry practitioners and called on the Federal Government to set up an appropriate mechanism to reverse this trend and bring perpetrators to account.\n\n5. The PDP Governors once again decried the inability of the NNPC to make its statutory contributions to the Federation Account, inspite of Oil selling at above $110. It is patently unconstitutional for NNPC to determine at its whim and discretion when and what to pay to the Federation Account, as it is a mere trustee of the funds for the three tiers of Government: Federal, States and Local Governments. We once again, call for investigations and audit of the quantity of consumption of fuel ascribed to Nigerians and for deployment of technology at the filling stations to determine in a transparent manner the volume of consumption.\n\nThe Governors would resist any further attempt by NNPC to ascribe unsubstantiated subsidy claims to other tiers of government.\n\n6. Furthermore, S.162 (1) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended stipulates that \u201cThe Federation shall maintain a special account to be called \u201cthe Federation Account\u201d into which shall be\n\npaid all revenues collected by the Government of the Federation\u2026\u201d\n\nand S.162 (10) states that \u201cFor the purpose of subsection (1) of this section, \u201crevenue\u201d means any income or return accruing to or derived by the Government of the Federation from any source and includes \u2013\n\n(a) any receipt, however described, arising from the operation of any law;\n\n(b) any return, however described, arising from or in respect of any property held by the Government of the Federation;\n\n(c) any return by way of interest on loans and dividends in respect of shares or interest held by the Government of the Federation in any company or statutory body\u201d\n\na. As of today, 18 (Eighteen) Federation Revenue Agencies are not paying/remitting any revenue to the FAAC Account. These include (i) Central Bank of Nigeria (ii) Nigeria Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) (iii) Nigeria Liquefied National Gas (NLNG) (iv) Nigeria Communication Commission (NCC) (v) Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) (vi) NPA (vii) Security and Exchange Commission etc\n\n(b) FIRS and DPR takes cost of collection of 4% (Four percent) of Revenue collected while Customs collects 7%. In March 2022 for instance, FIRS took N15.4Billion as cost of collection and Customs took N8.4b. If these are annualised, FIRS and Customs collects about N1.84Billion and Customs N100B per annum. Obviously, some states of the Federation\u2019s capital budget does not come close to these.\n\n(c) Nigeria Federation has 49% shareholding in NLNG. According to the Minister of Finance during the 2020 budget performance brief at the National Assembly stated that the federation received dividend of N144billion (One Hundred and Forty Four Billion) from NLNG. These figure to the best of our knowledge was never paid into the Federation Account.\n\n(d)) NNPC deducts N8.33Billion monthly for the rehabilitation of the Refineries in Nigeria. Till date no refinery is working.\n\n(e) On priority projects of the Nation\u2019s oil industry, NNPC deducted N788.78Billion for various investments between 2018-2021 without recourse to FAAC.\n\n(f) NNPC in 2021 alone claimed to have paid over One Trillion Naira as petroleum subsidy. Indeed, the month of March 2022, N220Billion was deducted as oil subsidy with a promise that N328Billion will be deducted in April 2022. This is unacceptable.\n\n(g) NNPC and FIRS as well as other remitting Agencies continue to apply an exchange rate of N389/$1 as against the Import and Export window of N416/$1. The extent of this leakage can be better felt, if this rate is compared to the current N570/$1.\n\n(h) From available records about N7.6T is withheld between 2012 and 2021, by NNPC from the Federation Account.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has declared that Nigeria\u2019s dependence on imported products in the agriculture sector will soon be a thing of the past with the inauguration of Dangote Fertilizer Plant, which has an installed capacity of 3.0 million metric tonnes of Urea per annum.\n\nSpeaking at the commissioning of the plant in Ibeju Lekki, Lagos State on Tuesday, the President said the plant will further advance Nigeria\u2019s drive towards achieving self-sufficiency in food production, create jobs, increase the inflow of foreign exchange and accelerate economic growth.\n\nHe commended the Chairman, Board and Management of Dangote Industries Limited for their business initiative in conceptualizing and building this plant, which is the second-largest in the world.\n\nREAD ALSO: EFCC Punishes Officer Who Leaked Obiano\u2019s Video\n\nThe President expressed confidence that the investment in this plant will replicate the Group\u2019s earlier exploits in the cement sector, where Dangote Cement holds the enviable record as our continent\u2019s largest cement producer, with footprints in ten other African countries.\n\n\u2018\u2018This new plant is a renewed testament to the widely acknowledged patriotism of Alhaji Aliko Dangote and the leadership of Dangote Industries Limited. It also demonstrates their commitment to the socio-economic development of our country and the well-being of our people.\n\n\u2018\u2018The Group\u2019s investment in integrated cement plants, spanning the value chain from quarry to \u2018bagging, has effectively ended Nigeria\u2019s dependence on imported cement products.\n\n\u2018\u2018Along with the several other subsidiaries, Dangote Industries Limited has created thousands of jobs across Nigeria. It is the second biggest employer of labour in this country, after the Federal Government.\n\n\u2018\u2018This is very pleasing because job creation by private sector operators is vital to security as it takes thousands of youths off the street,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOn other benefits of the plant, the President expressed delight that with the commencement of exports to other countries including the United States, India, and Brazil, Nigeria is already gaining extensively in earnings of foreign exchange from the excess production of, and export from, the plant.\n\nHe noted that coming on stream of the plant had created huge opportunities in the areas of job creation, trade, warehousing, transport, and logistics, which would, in turn, create significant wealth, reduce poverty, and help in securing the future of the nation.\n\n\u2018\u2018In the agricultural sector, another focal point of our economic policy, we expect a boom as fertilizer is now readily available in greater quantities and better quality.\n\n\u2018\u2018Many Nigerians who hitherto practiced subsistence farming because of nonavailability of necessary inputs can now take up agriculture as a business.\n\n\u2018\u2018We expect the rise of a new breed of agropreneurs who will add value to farming and make the nation self-sufficient in food production,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari used the occasion to reassure Nigerians that his government is focused on providing an enabling environment for the private sector to thrive, pledging continuity in improving infrastructure, power and security as well as enacting relevant laws and regulations to drive investments in the economy.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are partnering with the private sector, through a tax credit scheme, in the rehabilitation of roads across Nigeria under Presidential Order No. 7.\n\n\u2018\u2018As we know, good roads contribute to easy movement of goods and services across the nation, thus reducing the cost of doing business and improving productivity.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are also rehabilitating our railway lines and building new ones to lessen the burden on our roads and create more effective multi-modal transportation networks,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018\u2018I look forward to coming back to inaugurate the Refinery and petrochemical plant later in the year.\n\n\u2018\u2018Projects of this magnitude and complexity require the support and collaboration of many persons and organisations. I am grateful to all of them.\n\n\u2018\u2018In particular, I would like to commend the Central Bank of Nigeria, the Development Finance Institutions and the Local and Foreign Commercial Banks that have supported the investor to make these projects a reality,\u2019\u2019 the President declared.\n\nLauding Dangote for helping to rebrand Nigeria through his mega investments across Africa, President Buhari said:\n\n\u2018\u2018He has fueled job-led growth and transformation of several African economies. I am proud of his contribution to affirming Nigeria\u2019s leadership status in the continent, and I wish him many more successes in the future.\u2019\u2019\n\nAfter the historic inauguration, President Buhari inspected the Group\u2019s 650,000 barrels per day Petroleum Refinery and 900,000 tonnes per annum Polypropylene Plant sited within the Dangote Free Trade Zone Complex.\n\nIn his remarks, Dangote said the fertiliser complex, which occupies 500 hectares and built at a cost of $2.5 billion will drastically reduce the level of unemployment and youth restiveness in the country, through generation of direct and indirect employment.\n\n\u201dAgriculture accounts for over 20 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s GDP, and the country is a leading producer of various agricultural commodities. The sector has the potential of becoming the biggest source of income for our Nation, providing employment and raw materials for industries.\n\n\u201dHowever, low fertilizer usage has been a major reason for low productivity in the sector. It is common knowledge that non-availability of the product, in quantity and quality, rather than affordability, is the primary constraint to the use of fertilizer.\n\n\u201dOur goal is to make fertiliser available in sufficient quantities and quality for our teeming farmers assuring greater agricultural output,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Chief Executive of Dangote Industries expressed immense gratitude to President Buhari, for his sustained support and encouragement, and for honoring the invitation to come, in person, and inaugurate the plant.\n\nHe also commended the leaders of the host communities and their people for providing a peaceful and conducive environment for the project to thrive, recognizing the many years of enthusiastic teamwork, labour, toil and sweat of the Management and Staff of Dangote Group for their commitment to high performance, perseverance and resilience.\n\nThe governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, recounted the role played by a former governor of the State, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in the establishment of the fertiliser plant and the refinery.\n\n\u201dThe idea of having a free zone in the Ibeju Lekki was conceived by our leader Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\n\u201dI was with him in 2003, when we took a trip to China and we were trying to conceive a free zone and this is where we are.\n\n\u201dThe free zone is not only home to the largest fertilizer plant in Africa but will certainly be home to the largest refinery,\u201d Sanwo-Olu said.\n\nHe thanked the President for coming to Lagos, adding that he looked forward to receiving him in a few months\u2019 time to commission more projects.",

          "text": "A Support Group \u201cNo Alternative to Buhari-Osinbajo 2019\u201d that worked assiduously for the re-election of President Mohamudu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo in the 2019 general elections, has described a national leader of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the only qualified candidate to sustain president Buhari\u2019s endearing legacies in 2023.\n\nThe group in a statement issued on Wednesday by National Coordinator, Vincent Uba, said now that the Buhari administration is coming to an end, there\u2019s need to carefully look and select the best person to continue the good work of the president. This, they say is no other person than former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bolas Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nThe support group further stated that Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s religious tolerance is unequalled among the others, a man, despite the fact that he is a Muslim not just married one woman but chose a Christian as a wife.\n\nThey say with Tinubu as our president, forget about discriminating against other religions because there is no known case of him discriminating against his wife or any other person.\n\nThe statement reads further:\n\n\u201cWhy will President Buhari and Vice President Osinbajo be seen as blessings to Nigeria in the face of economic hardship and security challenges? The answer is, God who sees beyond us chose the two great men to run the affairs of Nigeria, knowing that we would soon experience two global crises that would shake and humble the world.\n\n\u201cRecall the oil glut of 2015, which resulted in most countries of the world, including Nigeria, witnessing economic crisis that the citizens experienced excruciating hardship, affecting exchange rates of currencies. For Nigeria, it was not business as usual as our foreign reserve depleted that sourcing of foreign exchange to do international businesses became difficult.\n\n\u201cRecall also the Covid-19 pandemic that brought all countries of the world to their knees, which effects are still ravaging the world till date.\n\n\u201cThe combined devastating effects of these global crises and the already existing rot Nigeria suffered in the hands of the previous administrations of PDP would have made it almost impossible for any ordinary persons to steer the country out of the crises. This is where the supremacy of God who is all knowing comes in.\n\n\u201cHas anyone thought of or imagined what our fate as a country would have been if God had allowed the previous administrations that mismanaged the country in times of oil boom and plenty? Yes, what we complained of and suffer today would have been a child\u2019s play if that had happened.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari and Vice President Osinbajo not only prudently managed the scarce resources of our country but also put in place infrastructures that are second to none, in comparison with the previous administrations. Rather than complain and blame President Buhari for the current harsh economic situations, we should applaud him and thank God for giving him to us at these trying times.\n\n\u201cNow that President Buhari\u2019s administration is coming to an end, there is the compelling need to look for and pray for someone that will not only carry on with the good legacies but also begin to build and improve on them. We, No Alternative to Buhari-Osinbajo 2019, having critically observed and examined the state of the nation as it affects religious wars, ethnicity and leadership issues, decided to go for the man who the cap fits to tackle the above mentioned national problems.\n\n\u201cLooking at the array of persons aspiring for the presidency of this country in 2023, the only person, out of the lots who has the trappings and or paraphernalia to handle the affairs of the country is no other person than Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Yes, there is no alternative to Tinubu in 2023.\n\n\u201cIn Tinubu, we see a man whose religious tolerance is unequalled among the others, a man, despite the fact that he is a Muslim not just married one woman but chose a Christian as a wife. With Tinubu as our president, forget about discriminating against other religions because there is no known case of him discriminating against his wife or any other on the basis of religion.\n\n\u201cIn Tinubu we see a man who will not discriminate against any tribe in running the affairs of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. If Tinubu would display nationalistic tendencies in running Lagos State as a governor by accommodating and appointing people of other tribes in his cabinet, then the issue of discriminating against other tribes in governance as a president would not arise.\n\n\u201cHis track record of empowering people across ethnic and religious boundaries stands out. A noble man who has the gift of sourcing for round pegs to put in round holes or square pegs in square holes.\n\n\u201cEven if you don\u2019t know Tinubu and the stuff he\u2019s made of, a cursory look at his friends, associates, the quality of men and women he has made and empowered politically, financially and professionally gives you a perfect picture of who he is. Hence the dictum, \u201cShow me your friends and I will tell you who you are\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis man, Tinubu, will use the wisdom of age and experience to fix this country and lay a solid foundation for generations yet unborn, just as he laid an enduring solid foundation for the modern Lagos. In Tinubu, we see a man who has been known, tested and trusted such that Nigeria does not need an unknown Angel to take this country to the promised land of prosperity.\n\n\u201cRecall that Tinubu answered the divine call and aligned himself prior to 2015 with Buhari who had the divine mandate to keep this country going as a united country in the face of internal and global crisis. In the light of the above, No Alternative to Buhari-Osinbajo 2019 unequivocally not only endorses Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu for 2023 presidency of Nigeria, but also will put in place activities that will be geared towards supporting his campaigns.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the No Alternative to Buhari-Osinbajo 2019 ( NATBO 2019) will now be known and referred to as No Alternative to Tinubu 2023 (NATT 2023),\u201d the group concluded.",
          "summary": "This, they say is no other person than former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bolas Ahmed Tinubu.\nThe statement reads further:\u201cWhy will President Buhari and Vice President Osinbajo be seen as blessings to Nigeria in the face of economic hardship and security challenges?\nRather than complain and blame President Buhari for the current harsh economic situations, we should applaud him and thank God for giving him to us at these trying times.\nYes, there is no alternative to Tinubu in 2023.\n\u201cConsequently, the No Alternative to Buhari-Osinbajo 2019 ( NATBO 2019) will now be known and referred to as No Alternative to Tinubu 2023 (NATT 2023),\u201d the group concluded.",

Life can be defended only when united,\u201d he said.\n\nRussian ground forces slowed or stopped in their tracks by Western-armed Ukrainian troops are resorting to indiscriminately shelling military and civilian targets alike from a distance.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the NATO summit, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Russian President Vladimir Putin made a \u201cbig mistake\u201d with his unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.\n\nStoltenberg said leaders at the meeting will discuss \u201cthe need for a reset of our deterrence and defense in the longer term.\u201d\n\nNATO has already said it will double the number of deployments it has in Europe by adding four more. The new installments will be located in Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and Bulgaria.\n\nJosep Borrell, the European Union\u2019s top diplomat, said on March 24 that Russia is stalling in talks on a cease-fire in Ukraine and won\u2019t take the discussions seriously until it has reached its goals.\n\nA senior U.S. defense official said on March 23 that Moscow\u2019s ground forces appear to be setting up defensive positions 15 to 20 kilometers outside Kyiv as they make little to no progress toward the city center.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said in some areas east of Kyiv, Ukrainian troops appear to have pushed the Russians farther away.\n\nIn an interview with Spain\u2019s TVE broadcast on March 24, Borrell said Russian President Vladimir Putin has his eyes on surrounding the Black Sea coast to the border with Moldova in order to isolate Ukraine from the water.\n\n\u201cRight now, Russia doesn\u2019t want to sit and negotiate anything. What it wants is to occupy the ground,\u201d Borrell said. \u201cIt wants to negotiate in earnest only when it has secured a position of strength.\u201d\n\nBiden is scheduled to give a news conference after the March 24 meetings, then head to Poland for talks with leaders in that country, which has taken on the bulk of Ukrainian refugees fleeing the fighting.\n\nThe UN General Assembly is preparing to meet on March 24 to discuss the war in Ukraine and a draft humanitarian resolution written by Kyiv. Unlike in the Security Council \u2014 where Russia, along with other permanent members, holds veto power \u2014 no one country can block a resolution in the General Assembly.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) exports edged up in December 2021, compared with a year earlier and was the highest since September 2020,.\n\nSpecifically, the country exported 2.62 billion m\u00b3 equivalent of pipeline gas (2.04mn t of LNG) in December, up from 2.59bn m\u00b3 a year earlier and the highest since the 2.67bn m\u00b3 shipped in September 2020.\n\nIt was the most exported in 15 months, according to recent figures made available by the Joint Organisation Data Initiative (Jodi) quoted by Argus media.\n\nOn Tuesday, THISDAY reported that in spite of the much-talked-about renewed attention to the use of natural gas in boosting Nigeria\u2019s foreign earnings, there was no significant growth in the country\u2019s production level between 2016 and 2020.\n\nThe information was gathered from the latest report of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Initiative (NEITI), covering 2020. It revealed that the country produced more of the commodity when there was little focus on it compared to when dedicated programmes to expand its exploration and use gained national prominence.\n\nSince the current administration took over the reins of governance, a number of programmes to reduce gas flaring and make it more available for use nationwide have been launched, while other initiatives to expand the growth of the commodity have taken centre stage.\n\nBut despite all the efforts, there was no marked growth in gas production during the period under review, even though gas utilisation increased in-country marginally.\n\nDuring the five years under review, in 2016, Nigeria produced 3,051,249 mmscf of gas, followed by the highest production level in 2017, when the country did a total of 3,499,695 mmscf.\n\nThese production levels declined sharply in 2018, as Nigeria produced 2,909,144 mmscf for that year, recording a little improvement in 2019 to 3,047,507 mmscf and declined again to 3,013,640 mmscf in 2020.\n\nOf the figures, Joint Ventures (JVs) produced 68.36 per cent as Shell , Mobil and Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC) led the production from the arrangement.\n\nThe NEITI report stated that 114,781.44 mmscf that was, about four per cent was the total quantity of gas unaccounted for , based on the templates submitted by the 54 companies assessed.\n\nBut while total gas production decreased by 1.11 per cent between 2019 and 2020, the country\u2019s total relative gas utilisation of the commodity rose to 3.90 per cent.\n\nBut the story appeared to have changed markedly in 2021, when LNG exports rose despite upstream output of 3.94bn m\u00b3 falling short of the 4.15bn m\u00b3 produced in December 2020. However, production was up from 3.55bn m\u00b3 in November and the highest since the 4.09bn m\u00b3 recorded in July the previous year.\n\nThe Argus report noted that slimmer domestic demand may have freed up more supply to be fed to the country\u2019s 22mn t/yr Bonny Island liquefaction complex.\n\nNigerian gas use, according to the research firm, fell sharply to 33.5mn m\u00b3/d in December from 48mn m\u00b3/d a year earlier, after also falling short of a year earlier in the preceding three months.\n\nBut while in September-October the drop was entirely the result of slower power sector gas burn, residential and industrial consumption also fell in the last two months of the year, and far outstripped the drop in power sector gas demand in December.\n\nGlobal LNG prices have risen sharply in recent months and have remained consistently above oil prices in energy equivalent terms since mid-2021. This may have reduced the incentive for associated gas producers such as Nigeria to reduce reinjections of gas into oil fields for enhanced oil recovery, the report said.\n\nThat said, Nigerian exports had remained weak in recent months despite LNG prices already reaching record levels, which encouraged producers to maximise utilisation rates at liquefaction facilities.\n\nThe country exported 27.7bn m\u00b3 of equivalent pipeline gas as LNG last year, down from 31bn m\u00b3 a year earlier, the report by the research firm noted.\n\nMeanwhile, a number of European countries are pressuring Nigeria to ramp up its gas production and export to Europe, a source in the know told THISDAY yesterday.\n\nAlready, the Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, was said to have held meetings with the countries which are desperately in need of more gas as the war between Russia and Ukraine rages on.\n\nHowever, it was learnt that the capacity to increase production was almost non-existent, prompting Nigeria to call on the United States recently to invest massively in the country\u2019s gas infrastructure before the request by the countries in Europe can be met.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s serious pressure on Nigeria to increase production. The minister has already held meetings with two of such countries due to the war in Ukraine. Capacity is still low. So, Nigeria is calling on the United States to invest in our gas assets,\u201d the source stated.",

          "text": "Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Wednesday unveiled the first batch of 1,000 brand-new GAC-branded automobiles for safe, comfortable and modernised taxi scheme in the state ahead of his declaration for a second term.\n\nTHISDAY last week reported that after months of apprehension and uncertainty, former Lagos State Governor, Mr. Bola Tinubu, had cleared Sanwo-Olu, to run for a second term.\n\nHowever, the new taxi scheme, codenamed \u201cLAG RIDE\u201d, was launched at a well-attended ceremony held at the State House in Alausa.\n\nThe ride hailing taxi initiative, which is being operated on a lease-to-own basis, is a component of the state government\u2019s multimodal transportation blueprint being executed under the Traffic Management and Transportation pillar of the THEMES agenda of the Sanwo-Olu administration.\n\nThe initiative is a partnership between Lagos State-owned IBILE Holding Limited and CIG Motors Company Limited, with the objective to provide clean and reliable means of taxis movement across the metropolis at affordable cost, using brand-new vehicles.\n\nOperators are required to pay about N1.9 million down payment, of which the sum covers the 20 per cent equity of cost of vehicle, registration and insurance.\n\nEach car being used in the scheme comes with technology-enabled security features that monitor every journey undertaken.\n\nSanwo-Olu, while launching the scheme, said the state had moved another step forward in its drive to develop an efficient transportation model in tune with modernity and comfort.\n\nThe governor said the aim was not to run existing hailing ride operators out of the business, but to offer safer alternative and clear the roads of rickety cars being used for taxi business.\n\nThe scheme, he said, would provide opportunities to the operators to become owners of the vehicles within three to four years\u2019 period.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe need to provide better, dignifying and more rewarding means of transportation and livelihood for unemployed and underemployed population gave birth to the new \u2018Lagos State Taxi Scheme\u2019, which will be operated on a lease-to-own basis.\n\n\u201cUnder this arrangement, a beneficiary will be provided a brand-new car which will become the driver\u2019s property after completion of the payment of the vehicle\u2019s subsidised cost.\n\n\u201cThis taxi scheme will complement the various bus services which are making significant impact in the lives of our people; the water transport service, which is recording unprecedented patronage, as well as the Blue and Red Line Rail services which are on course to commence commercial operations between the last quarter of this year and the first quarter of 2023.\u201d\n\nTo improve riders\u2019 and passengers\u2019 security, Sanwo-Olu said a full security gadget, including a 360 dashboard camera that will give 24-hour audio-visual feeds to the control centre, had been pre-installed on each car deployed for the scheme.\n\nHe added that each car came with a physical panic button that could be used by anyone on board in case of assault or emergency. The panic button, the governor said, was also on the mobile application and is connected to the Control and Command Centre.\n\nSanwo-Olu disclosed that the automobile assembly plant being set up in Lagos \u2013 another component of the partnership between CIG Motors\u2019 and the State Government \u2013 stood at 60 per cent completion, with anticipated launch and start of operations expected in September.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat we are witnessing today is that, Lagos is moving away from the era of rickety kabu kabu to brand-new, comfortable and safe transport system. The multiplier effect of this singular initiative on job creation, youth employment and economic growth and development in the State cannot be overstated.\u201d\n\nCommissioners for Transportation, Dr. Frederic Oladehinde, described the scheme as, \u201canother milestone achievement\u201d by the state government, noting that the initiative had joined an array of other innovative solutions initiated in the transport sector, which were targeted at redefining public transportation.\n\nTo make the rides affordable, the Commissioner said the technology on which the scheme is operated had made ride-sharing possible for passengers, who would agree to share ride and share transit costs.\n\nOn her part, the Chairman of CIG Motors in Nigeria, Mrs. Diana Chang, said the roadmap for the urbanisation of the transportation system in Lagos started in November 2019, when the governor and members of his cabinet visited the Republic of China for bilateral partnership.\n\nThe launch, she said, was the glorious end of the partnership sealed with Chinese investors.\n\n\u201cWe are using this partnership to promote a Greater Lagos where opportunities abound for citizens of the State, while creating a win-win model for all stakeholders,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Managing Director of IBILE Holding, Mr. Abiodun Amokomowo, said over 5,700 drivers had downloaded the driver\u2019s mobile apps as at last Tuesday, out of which 1,786 drivers submitted applications.\n\nRegistration and enrolment fee has been accepted from 359 drivers, while others were awaiting screening, Amokomowo further disclosed.\n\nHe added: \u201cAs part of the process each operator will go through for the safety and security of life and effective operations of the scheme, we will conduct full verification of applicants\u2019 Lagos State Drivers\u2019 Institute (LASDRI) ID cards, medical history, background check and verification of NIN and Lagos resident registration numbers.\u201d\n\nThe launch of the taxi scheme was received with a warm embrace by ride hailing drivers, who described the initiative as \u201cunique, better alternative\u201d.\n\nSam Mfuk, who is the first successful driver to get onboard of the scheme, said: \u201cWhen we first heard about LAG RIDE, we were skeptical. But, when we attended the stakeholders\u2019 meetings, we changed our minds. LAG RIDE has become the answer to our prayers in ride hailing sector. The details and features they shared with us were clearly thought out and our input was well included in the final model.\u201d",

          "title": "Nigeria: APC Governors Bow to Buhari, Agree on Adamu as Consensus Candidate for Party Chairman",
          "text": "The coast appears clear for the March 26 national convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) as President Muhammadu Buhari and the 22 governors of the party, on Wednesday, agreed to adopt consensus candidates for all the offices of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party.\n\nThe party settled for former Nasarawa State Governor, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, as consensus candidate for the post of National Chairman. It agreed on Senator Iyiola Omisore for National Secretary. Other positions will be filled through the Unity List being worked out by the governors. The Unity List is expected to contain names of candidates for all positions. Anyone who is still bent on contesting is free to do so, but once outside the unity list, it\u2019s surely going to be a losing game as the governors control the delegates who will vote at the convention.\n\nBuhari, at a meeting with the governors, warned against frittering away the gains of the government and the party as a result of in-fighting. He later met with some of the intending chairmanship hopefuls, to discuss how to manage the many tendencies ahead of the convention.\n\nOmisore is believed to have the backing of his Osun State governor, Gboyega Oyetola, who many allege may need the national officer to fight Rauf Aregbesola.\n\nHowever, briefing newsmen after a meeting between Buhari and the APC governors at State House, Abuja, Chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF) and Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, said those opposed to the consensus option were equally free to contest for any of the party offices.\n\nThat was as Chairman of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of APC, and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, warned the media against setting party stakeholders against one another to ignite crisis, a few days to the national convention.\n\nNotwithstanding, the screening committee of the party, on Wednesday, extended the screening of aspirants vying for various party positions by one day ahead of the convention.\n\nAPC selected 180 delegates to represent the Anambra State chapter of the party at the national convention on Saturday.\n\nAt the same time, following the court case filed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) against Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State and his Deputy, challenging their defection to the APC. Chairman of APC in the state, Alphonsus Ogar Eba, expressed optimism that the judgement, slated for Friday, would be in the favour of the governor and his deputy.\n\nWhile meeting with the APC governors, Buhari stated, \u201cOver the last seven years we have done our best to deliver good governance to the country. We have guaranteed national food security, we have provided modern infrastructure to kick-start economic growth and we have implemented the most comprehensive social welfare programmes in our history.\n\n\u201cAlong the way, our party has survived shocks and attempts to derail it. Our government has also had to endure the worst economic crisis with the free fall of oil prices from an average of $100 per barrel over 15 years of PDP government to an average of $30 \u2013 $50 until the recent energy crisis.\n\n\u201cWe need to remind ourselves of these achievements and not be diverted by petty quarrels and unseemly jockeying for positions. It will be very sad and regrettable development if these manifest gains are frittered away as a result of internal dissent and rivalry.\n\n\u201cWe must avoid narrow focus and inordinate personal ambitions at the expense of our party\u2019s common good. We must stop frivolous and diversionary litigationss when the party\u2019s reconciliation processes are available for settling disputes. We must restore sanity and purpose in the affairs of our party and lead ourselves to victory and safety.\u201d\n\nThe president later met with all the seven chairmanship aspirants of APC. The meeting held over dinner at the official residence of the president at State House, Abuja.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the meeting, which began at 8pm, also had in attendance Buni, Chief of Staff to the President, Professor Ibrahim Gambari, and Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha.\n\nAt the meeting with the seven aspirants, it was learnt that the president stressed the need for the aspirants to embrace consensus to avoid acrimony.\n\nThe aspirants that attended the meeting were Minister of Special Duties, George Akume; Senator representing Niger East Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Mohammed Sani Musa; former Deputy National Chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change, Saliu Mustapha; and Mohammed Etsu.\n\nOthers were former Nasarawa State governor and serving Senator Tanko Al-Makura; former governor of Nasarawa State and Senator representing Nasarawa West, who is believed to be Buhari\u2019s preferred candidate, Senator Adamu Abdullahi; and former Governor of Zamfara State, Abdul Aziz Yari.\n\nBut Bagudu, who spoke on behalf of his colleagues at the meeting with the president, numbering 15, said the governors took turns to brief Buhari on steps being taken to ensure that consensus candidates emerged at all levels.\n\nHe stressed that the PGF was in support of the chairmanship candidate being backed by Buhari, although, he refused to name the candidate. Buhari was weeks ago alleged to have settled for Adamu as consensus chairman for the party.\n\nAccording to Bagudu, \u201cMr. President has always urged consensus for all positions, because consensus is in accordance with democratic tenets and once you have leaders, who are established, who are working towards the same goal, yes, we might have our individual differences, like was once carefully explained by Governor El-Rufai.\n\n\u201cBut on the principle of ensuring that we get leadership that will hit the ground running, we are united, and to that extent, will support any process that will lead to consensus and the emergence of leaders without the need for election.\n\n\u201cToday, we all briefed Mr. President on the issue of distributing political party offices to the respective zones and our support for Mr. President\u2019s endorsement of the candidate for the National Chairman of the party and the various geo-political zones.\n\n\u201cWe took turns to brief Mr. President on what they have been doing to generate consensus in their respective zones among the National Working Committee (NWC) and zonal party positions that have been either allocated to the zones or which the zones are entitled to.\n\n\u201cMost of the zones have been allocated NWC positions that are fewer than the number of states. However, there are zonal executive committees from which the zones are working to produce a consensus list.\n\n\u201cSo, this afternoon, the respective zones \u2013 Governor Abubakar Bello briefed on behalf of the North-central; Governor Babagana Zulum on behalf of the North-east; Governor Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa State on behalf of North-west; Governor Dave Umahi, on behalf of South-east; Governor Kayode Fayemi briefed the president on behalf of the South-west. I further mentioned the position of the South-south to Mr. President, as I had on paper.\n\n\u201cSo, Mr. President appreciated the briefing and restated his gratitude for the work the governors have been doing in support for the party and preparation for the National Convention.\u201d\n\nThe Kebbi State governor further reiterated that aspirants that were against the consensus option were free to run at the convention, saying APC, as a democratic party would not bar anybody from exercising their rights.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cOur party is a democratic party. We will always urge consensus; we\u2019ll urge respect for the decisions of the party, because the distribution of political party offices here has been approved by the highest organ of the party, which is the National Caretaker Committee, because they were acting in their capacity as the National Executive Committee of the party. But where people still choose to go against the grain, whatever the party constitution allows them, because we wouldn\u2019t do anything undemocratic.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that the meeting with Buhari also agreed that everything should be put in place for the party to have a successful convention come March 22, by supporting all the decisions taken by the Buni-led caretaker committee and those taken in his absence.\n\nHis words, \u201cSome of you may recall that last week, there was a letter that was widely circulated in the media, addressed to me as the chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum and copied to a number of others, including the chairman of the Caretaker Committee, the acting Chairman of the Caretaker Committee and, indeed, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation.\n\n\u201cThat letter led to a series of actions, including meetings between the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Chairman of the National Caretaker Committee, Acting Chairman, Governor Abubakar Bello of Niger State, as he was then, and myself.\n\n\u201cWe all restated our commitment to working together to ensure that the convention takes place on March 26, 2022 and then, we agreed to support all the decisions that were taken by the caretaker committee, both acting as a working committee and acting with the donated powers given to it by the National Executive Committee.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the chairman of the caretaker, upon his return, also appreciated what the caretaker committee did and the decisions that were taken in his absence.\u201d\n\nBuni Warns Media against Igniting Crisis in APC\n\nChairman of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of APC and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, warned the media against setting party stakeholders against one another and igniting an crisis a few days to the party\u2019s national convention slated for Saturday, March 26.\n\nBuni, in a statement Wednesday by his Director General, Press and Media Affairs, Mr. Mamman Mohammed, described the media report, which suggested a victor and vanquished positions \u201cas irresponsible and deliberately intended to instigate disaffection and acrimony among the critical stakeholders of the party.\u201d\n\nThe reports were gleaned from recent happenings in the party.\n\nBuni noted that since the intervention of Buhari via a press statement issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media, Malam Garba Shehu, calling on stakeholders to shun media backstabbing and name-calling, APC governors and all other stakeholders had obliged to the presidential directive.\n\nHe added that upon his return and assumption of office as chairman of the party, he described the incident as a past event, declaring that there is no victor, no vanquished.\n\nBuni also commended his colleagues in the caretaker committee for the great job they had done under the acting chairmanship of Niger State Governor, Abubakar Sani Bello.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it is irrational, absurd and irresponsible for anyone to at this moment initiate animosity and resentment among the stakeholders, who are working assiduously for the success of the upcoming convention,\u201d Buni said.\n\nThe Yobe State governor stressed that the governors and other critical stakeholders were now heading various sub-committees of the convention and had been meeting with him to ensure a successful arrangement for the convention.\n\nHe said, \u201cTherefore, it amounts to irresponsibility for anyone to write an injurious opinion in complete disregard to the directive from the president. The party and all stakeholders would not condone such disrespect to the president to deliberately cause confusion and divert attention from the cause of having a fruitful convention.\n\n\u201cThe authors of such baseless, flimsy, and unwarranted articles, should be cautious of the negative impact of such deliberate sabotage on the party and the good relationship between the governors and their followers.\u201d\n\nBuni advised the authors to either work for the unity of APC or just watch if they had nothing to contribute positively. He said the party remained a united family, with much respect for the president, adding that they are collectively committed to the success of the convention, assuring all that the APC would not be distracted from the noble cause of moving forward.\n\nScreening of Aspirants Extended by One Day\n\nAPC on Wednesday, extended the screening of aspirants vying for various party positions by one day, meaning the screening that was supposed to end yesterday will now end today. The one day extension was due to the number of aspirants jostling for positions, which apparently overwhelmed the committee.\n\nThe Screening Committee chaired by Governor of Kastina State, Aminu Masari, had planned to screen all aspirants for positions in the National Working Committee (NWC) on Tuesday and complete the assignment on Wednesday with the screening of Non-NWC and zonal positions.\n\nTHISDAY checks revealed that the committee screened six out of the seven national chairmanship aspirants on Tuesday, as well as Deputy National Chairmanship aspirants for North and South and National Secretary aspirants.\n\nYesterday, the committee screened Senator Abdullahi Adamu and a few other aspirants for NWC offices and aspirants for zonal offices.\n\nThe committee also screened all the national chairmanship aspirants, deputy national chairmanship, national secretary, and national vice chairmen for the six zones.\n\nA source at the Kastina State Governor\u2019s Lodge, venue of the exercise, said the committee would request for time extension.\n\nThe officer, who did not want his identity publicised, said, \u201cThough the committee may have been told not to disqualify any aspirant, they are bent on due diligence by ensuring that all aspirants have the minimum qualification. This is a move to stall any legal action after the convention.\n\n\u201cWith the volume of work to be done and with the template for a thorough screening, the two days assigned for the exercise is grossly inadequate. The committee chairman, His Excellency, Governor Bello Masari, may approach the caretaker committee for a day extension.\u201d\n\nThe screening of aspirants for zonal offices continued Wednesday as at press time.\n\nMeanwhile, a chieftain of APC, Mr. Longers Anyawu, appealed to delegates to the APC national convention to support Senator Abdullahi Adamu to emerge as National Chairman of the party on Saturday.\n\nAnyanwu, in a statement, described Adamu as a de-tribalised Nigerian, who will stabilise, unify and reposition the party for electoral victories.\n\nAnyanwu described Adamu as, \u201cA tested politician that has run several elections and lost none. We need somebody, who knows how to play the game by the rules.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cToday, opposition political parties are jittery, because a new sheriff that knows how to lead is coming to take over, not a makeshift leader. If we vote and ratify the chairmanship of Senator Abdullahi Adamu, 2023 electoral victories are assured.\u201d\n\nAnambra Selects 180 Delegates for Saturday\u2019s Convention\n\nThe Anambra State chapter of APC selected 180 delegates to represent it at the national convention on Saturday. The delegates were drawn from the 21 local government areas, and their names were announced at the state party secretariat in Awka yesterday evening by the state chairman, Sir Basil Ejidike.\n\nEjidike announced the names during the inauguration of the state zonal and local government executive committees.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe delegates were selected according to APC Constitution, from the state exco, LGA executive and political office holders.\u201d\n\nWhile congratulating the newly inaugurated state officers, Ejidike, said, \u201cI wish to restate and draw your attention to the essence of a political party. All political parties\u2019 interest is to win elections and advance the course of their environment.\n\n\u201cThe APC has all it takes to achieve this and more. Therefore, we must all put our hands on deck to reposition the party, and as well win elections.\n\n\u201cThis is achievable in Anambra, being that we have both the human and material resources needed. As a new family, we are poised to galvanise and harness our diverse potentials and resources to put our party in political positions in our dear state.\n\n\u201cIt is, indeed, factual that the APC-led federal government has benefitted Anambra State and people in terms of infrastructural development, human capacity building, and empowerment.\n\n\u201cThese have reposed on us all the onerous task of leading the people of Anambra into the mainstream politics of Nigeria. This we must accomplish. In a very special way, I appreciate the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, His Excellency Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, for his giant development strides in Anambra State.\u201d\n\nAPC Optimistic about Court Judgement on Ayade, Deputy\n\nChairman of APC in Cross State, Alphonsus Ogar Eba, said the court judgement challenging the defection of Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State and his deputy, slated for Friday, would be in favour of the governor and his deputy.\n\nEba, who reacted to the case filed by the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), gave the assurance yesterday, and explained that there was simply a misunderstanding in the judgement made earlier by the court.\n\nEba, who was on the Morning Show of Arise News Channel, shed more light on Justice Taiwo Taiwo\u2019s rejection of the claim that the lawmakers had not become registered members of the party and explained that a body of a fractionalised PDP expelled them, rendering them handicapped.\n\nHe noted that they did not defect neither was it their desire to leave the party, but that the APC took them in, after they were expelled by PDP.\n\nEba stated, \u201cThe document before the court of Justice Taiwo is to the effect that these lawmakers had been expelled from the party. The records are there. Mai Mala Buni is a chairman of a party, he saw that people were expelled from PDP and he was looking for people to convert into the party. The beauty of why I love the APC is that they look for assets.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of jurisdiction, Eba said it was a settled matter, noting that the Supreme Court judgement by Justice Walter Onnoghen and others, had settled the matter.\n\nEba stated, \u201cI\u2019m interested in expounding a jurisprudence of law and the issue of judgement coming on Friday, we are not bothered. It can go anywhere but we know we have our right of appeal. There is no way that the clear provision of the law will not be adhered to. The law, as it is, and not the law as it ought to be is the jurisprudence of law.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about zoning of the governorship in 2023 to the southern senatorial district, he said the issue would not be a problem for them in APC, but had always been a problem that existed in the opposition party particularly, in the PDP\n\nThe lawmaker said, \u201cIn recent times, we have listened to some members of our party, and I believe that what is fair is that the governorship should move to the southern senatorial district. But at the state level, all our views will be brought to the table; the governor\u2019s, mine and every member of APC will be looked at.\u201d\n\nSharing his perspective on happenings in Cross River State, too, a member of the PDP, and senator for Cross River North in the National Assembly, Jarigbe Agom Jarigbe, described Eba as a factional chairman of APC and not substantive as he claimed.\n\nJarigbe further called him a pathological liar as there was no document backing the expulsion claims of Governor Ben Ayade and others being put in the purview of the public, saying the party wasn\u2019t an appendage of Government House, and the facts were very clear.\n\nJarigbe alleged that the governor gave out orders to the police to take over the House of Assembly in the state, adding that he was known for that type of brutality. He said there was evidence that there was over-voting in areas that were hijacked as the number of accredited voters was less than the number of the total votes scored in that election.\n\nJarigbe said, \u201cWe are before the court, we applied for certified true copies of the data from the Bimodal machine. It has proven that there was over-voting. We have asked that those polling units be cancelled and if that happens, we will win with an overwhelming majority. Nigeria is not a banana republic. Those things will be fixed.\u201d\n\nChairmanship Aspirant Promises to Reserve Deputy Positions for Women, Youth\n\nA frontline chairmanship aspirant of APC, Alhaji Saliu Mustapha, promised to reserve all deputy positions for women and youths in the party. Mustapha made this known on Wednesday during his consultation with the APC House of Representatives caucus in Abuja.\n\nHe said the gesture would create a process of mentoring the younger ones in the country, and give competent young women and youth the opportunity to lead.\n\nMustapha believed the country lacked a solid platform for building or mentoring the younger ones to take over, saying, \u201cWe must have a new approach to things and do things differently.\u201d\n\nMustapha promised that if given the opportunity, he would create a progressive party, where lawmakers would be able to archive their achievements.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere was need to preach and enthrone internal democracy. Once there is no justice, the party will not have a healthy house. The party was at a very critical stage of its transformation and, therefore, needs strategy on how to win election.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t win election as a ruling party, some of the good works we are doing may be truncated. So, do not look at me on a face value, but what can guarantee our party\u2019s victory in general election.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye, Adedayo Akinwale, Juliet Akoje in Abuja, Emma Okonji, Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos and David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka",
