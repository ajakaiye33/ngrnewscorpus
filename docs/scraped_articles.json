          "text": "An 11-year-old girl on Tuesday told the Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Court, Ikeja, Lagos State, how she was allegedly raped and impregnated by a 39-year-old car wash operator, Ezekiel Udoh.\n\nPUNCH Metro learnt that the incident occurred in the FESTAC Town area of the state in 2020.\n\nThe police prosecutor, Z.A. Dindi, led the minor in evidence.\n\nNarrating her ordeal to the court, the victim said Udoh took advantage of her twice.\n\nOn the first occasion, she said the defendant sent her on an errand and directed her to take the item into his room, where he raped her.\n\nShe said, \u201cHe (Udoh) sent me to buy something for him and when I returned, he told me to take it upstairs. When I took it there, he came and told me to take it inside his room and he slept with me for the first time. He said if I told anyone, he would kill me.\n\n\u201cWhen he slept with me the second time, I saw blood coming out of my private parts. I did not know I was pregnant. My grandma asked why I was getting fat and I said I did not know.\u201d\n\nThe victim, who is now 13-year-old, gave birth to a baby boy, who is currently one-year-and-five-month-old.\n\nHer grandmother, who told the court that the minor had been living with her since she was two years old, said she initially did not know that her granddaughter was raped.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe first day I saw a trace of blood, I thought it was menstruation. I said, \u2018At 11, you have started menstruation, yours is fast.\u2019\n\n\u201cI just noticed she was becoming fat. Not until one day that my sister came and told me if I didn\u2019t notice her. She said it seemed she was pregnant. Then we took her for a medical check-up and they told us she was five-month pregnant.\n\n\u201cWe asked her and she said it\u2019s a brother at the car wash. She also did not know his name. We went there to ask him if he knew her and he asked us if she was pregnant.\u201d\n\nThe case was adjourned till September 29, 2022, for further trial.",

          "text": ".\n\nDayo Johnson, Akure\n\nThe four weeks warning strike embarked upon by the National leadership of the College of Education Academic Staff Union (COEASU) has paralyse academic activities in Adeyemi College of Education, ACE, Ondo, in Ondo state.\n\nLeadership of COEASU at Adeyemi College of Education have again threatened to extend the four week warning strike if government failed to attend to their demands.\n\nThe warning, the leaders said became necessary after the expiration of the 21- days ultimatum given to the Federal Government.\n\nChairman and Secretary of the union, Adetokunboh Adepoju and Joel Edafe respectively, in a statement, said that the Federal Government has failed to address lingering and emerging issues of an industrial concern affecting members of the union\n\nThey noted that the refusal of the government to address the issues raised by the Colleges of Education lecturers had shown governments insensitivity to issues bordering on the advancement of the nation\u2019s teacher education industry.\n\n\u201cOver the years, the Colleges of Education system, the incontrovertible hub of Teacher Education and by extension the bedrock of the nation\u2019s education system, has suffered wanton abandonment by the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThis neglect has gradually culminated in aggravated decay of infrastructures in the Colleges of Education System. Furthermore, based on poor conditions of service, the sector has also witnessed monumental academic staff attrition without significant effort by Government for their replacement.\n\n\u201cThe resultant gross deficit of college academic staff and the backlash effect on the quality and quantity of teachers produced by the Colleges of Education system is best imagined.\u201d\n\nAccording to them, \u201cpleas to government, for urgent revamp of facilities and recruitment of adequate quality and quantity of staff, among other needs to enhance the standard of facilities and working conditions of academic staff in the Colleges of Education sector has yielded no fruit.\n\n\u201cThis has left our Union, having exhausted all other avenues of gaining the Government\u2019s attention, with no other option than to embark on this total warning strike in the face of the Government crass insensitivity.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the National Executive Council (NEC) of the Colleges of Education Academic Staff Union (COEASU), at its meeting, attended by 51 Chapters comprising 111 delegates including former Presidents and members of the National Officers\u2019 Council (NOC), held on Friday 10th June, 2022 at the Federal College of Education (Technical), Asaba, Delta State, after a thorough evaluation of the dismal level of responsiveness of the Federal Government and upon the lapse of a 21-day ultimatum issued by the Union on aforementioned lingering issues of an industrial concern, resolved unanimously that the total strike action suspended by the Union in December 2018 be resumed immediately, for four weeks in the first instance.\u201d\n\nThe union listed some of the lingering issues that called for the industrial action to include, failure of the Federal Government to constitute its own Team and commence renegotiation of the FGN-COEASU 2010 Agreement in spite of all entreaties of the Union which should have addressed among others, the obnoxious tax regime on staff consolidated salary which includes allowances as against basic salary, and capturing in the annual budget the Peculiar Earned Allowance;\n\n\u201cNon-release of N15billion approved, out of the N456,599,691,914.18 revitalization fund recommended, for both Federal and State Colleges of Education contrary to repeated promises by the Federal Government;non \u2013 implementation of the consequential effect of the implementation of CONTISS15 on Lower Cadre (a.k.a. Migration) since 2018;\n\n\u201cPoor funding of Colleges of Education and poor conditions across state-owned Colleges of Education especially in Ogun, Kwara, Abia, Kogi, Zamfara, Yobe, and the Edo States; and federal Government\u2019s recalcitrant insistence on the satanic IPPIS that does not take into account the peculiarity of the College of Education system as against the more reliable alternative of UTAS.\u201d\n\nThey also listed other local issues already communicated to the College Management to include, four-month salary arrears for 2019 recruited academic staff; and Responsibility Allowances for HODs, and Dean\u2019s/Directors, among others.\n\nThe union however said that \u201cin the light of the foregoing, our Chapter, will not resume academic activities until all national and local issues are resolved\u201d",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Ogalah Ibrahim\n\nKatsina State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, Thursday, at Government Day Secondary School, Kofar Yandaka, flagged off the disbursement of School Improvement Grant (SIG) to the tune of N2.1billion (N2,113,180,000) to Junior and Senior Secondary Schools across the State under the Adolescent Girls Initiative for Learning and Empowerment (AGILE) Project.\n\nSpeaking at the flag-off, Governor Masari said the funds shall be disbursed in two tranches to each school after reaching progress level and certification by the technical monitors.\n\nAccording to Masari, \u201cthe AGILE project, like other sister projects in the state is being implemented after fulfilment of certain conditions as agreed between the state and the World Bank. It is a project for Katsina State.\n\n\u201cThe project was earlier designed as a result of the report of Annual School Census of the year 2018/2019 which shows a large percentage of our children who graduates from Primary and Junior Secondary Schools and do not transit to the next level of education.\n\n\u201cIn Katsina State in particular, the report shows 45% of Primary 6 pupils do not transit to Junior Secondary Schools, while 48% of those students who finished JSS do not transit to Senior Secondary School.\u201d\n\nThe Katsina Governor explained that his administration has already started taking actions to address the many factors responsible for the low transitions by establishing Pilot Junior Secondary Schools in 68 Primary Schools across the state, with two in each Local Government Area.\n\nHe said, \u201call primary 6 pupils from these pilot schools now transit automatically to JSS since the classes are now at the next door within the same premises. In addition to continue learning, the strategy has also reduced stress by some of the students who do trek between 5 to 10 kilometres to attend secondary schools in other locations. The chances of dropping out has also been reduced significantly.\u201d\n\nThe Katsina Governor also noted that through the AGILE project, \u201cthe State Government will construct 160 new additional secondary schools, comprising of 90 Junior Secondary School (JSS) and 60 Senior Secondary School (SSS) spread across the state in order to increase access to transition until completion of secondary education.\n\nSimilarly, Masari said \u201cteachers will be recruited from the current S-power teachers and be given permanent and pensionable appointment to teach in the schools to be constructed by the project.\n\nI therefore called on all stakeholders to join hands together in making the state proved thank you and God bless.\u201d\n\nMasari further explained that \u201chis administration approved the disbursement of the grants to schools in order to test their integrity of handling public trust by allowing them to execute minor projects through renovation of toilets, water points and classrooms. It is therefore expected of the committees to live above board by showing commitment and honesty while expending the funds entrusted to them.\n\n\u201cI am aware the schools are mandated to sign indemnity that the funds shall be utilised for the purpose of improving condition of schools and not otherwise. This means any attempt to mismanage the funds will be tantamount to violation of the indemnity agreement and the law shall take its course.\n\n\u201cThe School Based Management Committees (SBMCs) are expected to execute the projects using the School Improvement Plan (SIP) as a guide. In this regard the plan now serves as guide for all activities, deviating from it is an offence as contained in the indemnity form which all schools have signed.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier, the Commissioner of Education in the state, Prof. Badamsi Lawal\n\nthanked Governor Masari for all the support he has been rendering to the educational sector in the state, noting that\n\nbased on his approval, the School Improvement Grant (SIG) has been disbursed to 50% of schools to start execution of projects that are limited to renovation of toilets, provision of water and repairs of classrooms.\n\nProf. Badamasi assured the Katsina Governor and the good people of the State of their commitment in ensuring prompts monitoring of the schools through the School Based Managements Committees in order to ensure the funds are judiciously utilised for the benefit of the students and communities.",

We look forward to the elections. I\u2019m sure the APC would expect a stiff competition. We agree that they are the government in power in that state but they will be definitely expecting a very stiff competition from us. We are poised to take back that state.\u201d\n\nOn Matawalle\u2019s proposition for state citizens to take up arms, he faulted the idea saying, though birthed out of frustration, it would have telling consequences for the overall security of the region.\n\nHe said, \u201cI think they need critical thinking because you have to also be in a position to examine the recommendations being made. When recommendations are made and you have not thought through it in full about the consequences of such, then it is also a problem.\n\n\u201cIt is out of frustration that such recommendations are being made, not doubt. But when you ask for everybody to carry guns you must ask yourself, are Nigerians in the mindset where every single individual can carry his own gun? You will be surprised that with every little argument people will just snuff themselves out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cause for concern when we hear that kind of recommendation. But the real thing is people are frustrated and he (Governor Matawalle) is also frustrated to the extent that he thinks that is the way to go. I don\u2019t think that is the best recommendation at the moment.\u201d\n\nOkowa argued that with the insecurity biting hard, the government must address insecurity holistically, with a long-term strategy in mind.\n\n\u201cI think we need to begin to look into many other things. Yes, as a quick one, he\u2019s calling for that. But there will be consequences. But we need a long-term approach to deal with insecurity. We need to look at the foundation of the problems that we have. A lot of hunger, joblessness, a lot of people are losing hope. And when you look at all these issues, it brings a lot of frustration. So, we have to address it holistically,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "About 10,000 remaining Nigerian pilgrims billed to perform this year\u2019s Hajj would be airlifted on or before Monday to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, it was learnt on Thursday.\n\nThe Chairman of the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON), Zikrullah Hassan, disclosed this during an interactive session with the media in his office in Abuja.\n\nHassan said that all necessary arrangements have been made to ensure that no registered pilgrim is left out of this year\u2019s Hajj exercise.\n\nHe said over 20,000 Nigerian pilgrims are already in Saudi Arabia, adding that some airlines involved in the airlift have added additional aircraft to make the airlift seamless.\n\nHassan said: \u201cWhen the operations started, a lot of our counterparts from the states were not actually fully prepared. Again, maybe because of shortness of notice. So the flights were fluctuating.\n\n\u201cThe aircrafts were ready but the pilgrims were not as ready. But in the last few days we have gotten over that and so from our arrangement, we expect to finish majority of the flights by the 3rd of July and to clean up in the event that there are any eventuality by the 4th of July 2022.\n\n\u201cThat is how we stand otherwise, we have now in the Kingdom in excess of about 20,000 Nigerian pilgrims and we are hoping to fly majority of the other pilgrims by the 3rd of July, 2022 and in the event that few ones who are just getting ready, the totality of Nigerians pilgrims will be in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by the 4th of July, 2022.\n\n\u201cI may wait till on the 5th of July to ensure that no Nigerian registered pilgrim will be here in Nigeria and if we see on the 4th of July that there is no such possibility, I will also be in the Kingdom on the 4th of July.\n\n\u201cSo far, every other thing has been going on smoothly, and I think we are on good stead to say that really we have come back, after the two years interregnum.\n\n\u201cWe have come back to full Hajj operations. We pray and expect that by this time next year we will be able to have the full allocation of about 100,000 pilgrims.\u201d\n\nOn whether the Commission would be able to airlift the remaining 100,000 pilgrims as promised, he said: \u201cWe will. The beauty of the present moment is that there is nobody who does not want to go now. That is the beauty of the moment.\n\n\u201cPreviously, what we have had is to invite states and they will say we are not ready either because their officials are busy or they want the Governor to do farewell ceremony for the pilgrims or their BTA is not enough. But now because of the readiness of the pilgrims we have worked out the flight schedule and clearly, I think we are on good stead.\u201d\n\nOn the about 250 Lagos State pilgrims said to have been rejected, he said: \u201cI just told you, we have about 10,000 pilgrims to airlift. So what is 250 out of 10,000?\n\n\u201cThis is schedule. You cannot say I want to go, so I must be taken. There are other people. So Lagos\u2019 time will come very soon. I don\u2019t want to say it here but like I said, it is not just about Lagos.\n\n\u201cIt is about Nigerian pilgrims. I cannot say because Lagos say you must take me now, then I tell other people don\u2019t worry Lagos has access to the media, and so they will come and take us.\n\n\u201cNo. You see the problem we have with this year is peculiar, it is the exact opposite of what we had in 2019. In 2019, we were given slots we could not utilise all.\n\n\u201cNow, if we are given the slots we are given in multiple ways it will still not be enough. We got 43,800 slots. If we get another 43,800 slots it would still not be enough for reason of the two years of COVID-19 restrictions and many other factors.\n\n\u201cSo what Lagos state is saying is okay, if I were them maybe I will say the same. But the Bauchi people wants to go there too as well as others.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has urged the Portuguese government and the business community in the country to increase the trade volume towards Nigeria, more especially in the non-oil sector.\n\nPresident Buhari made the call on Thursday in Lisbon, while speaking at an Economic Seminar between Nigeria and Portugal businesses.\n\nHe noted that the two countries are in dire need of new investment opportunities following the devastation on global economies caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and, in recent times, the impact of Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nBuhari, who noted that the contemporary Nigeria/Portugal diplomatic bond had lasted for more than 40 years, noted that the two countries still possess the power to sustain a bond that would guarantee their mutual prosperity and greatness for another 500 years.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, President Buhari said \u2018\u2018the relationship between modern Nigeria and Portugal started over 40 years ago with strong collaborations on the diplomatic and defence fronts.\n\n\u2018\u2018I was very excited to learn of the increased level of enthusiasm Portuguese businesses have shown towards Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018In the past 25 years, trade between Nigeria and Portugal has more than doubled to over $1 billion by 2020 just before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u2018\u2018This has been mostly in the oil and gas sector. Although this is great progress, I strongly believe we can and should do a lot more,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAssuring the Portuguese government of Nigeria\u2019s support to Portuguese companies wishing to invest in the country, the President said \u2018\u2018the Portuguese were the first European voyagers on record to visit the shores of Nigeria in the late fifteenth century. And just like how African culture is influential in modern Portugal, the Portuguese culture is also felt in today\u2019s Nigeria.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe announced that recently, the Government of Nigeria awarded a contract to Mota-Engil, a Portuguese company, to construct a railway line that connects Kano in Northern Nigeria to Maradi in Southern Niger Republic.\n\nHe added this partnership will surely open doors for more Portuguese companies to come to Nigeria, as the largest and most populous economy in Africa.\n\n\u2018\u2018Just two months ago, Portugal opened its first North Africa Trade Chamber. This will complement the Chamber in South Africa.\n\n\u2018\u2018I am confident after your interactions today on the tremendous potential in Nigeria, we will soon be hearing an announcement on the opening of the Nigeria Portugal Trade Chamber\u201d, he said.\n\nRecounting that in 2021, the African Export-Import Bank and Portugal\u2019s National Association of Young Entrepreneurs announced a 3-year partnership to promote Africa\u2019s fashion apparel and textile manufacturing industry, the Nigerian leader said:\n\n\u201cI strongly believe this will benefit Nigeria\u2019s vibrant fashion industry.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari also used the occasion to apprise prospective investors of the many fiscal, trade and monetary incentives that support foreign investments.\n\n\u2018\u2018The Nigerian Government officials in this room are on standby to provide all the necessary information you need.\n\n\u2018\u2018I have already directed the establishment of a dedicated Portugal working group headed by the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment to address any special concerns you may have above and beyond the existing policies in place.\n\n\u2018\u2018I want to assure you that we will take these requests seriously and our response will be swift.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn his expectations for the forum, the President expressed confidence that it was an appropriate platform to establish and strengthen business relationships, share valuable experience, and collaborate for both countries\u2019 mutual benefit.\n\n\u2018\u2018Nigeria and Portugal share long historical ties. The relationship between our two countries brought with it trade partnerships, an area that we wish to build upon today,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari thanked President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa of Portugal, who was present at the Seminar, for his contribution, interest and trust in forging formidable economic cooperation between Nigeria and Portugal.\n\n\u2018\u2018As I mentioned earlier our two countries have a long, shared history and we now have the power to ensure the next 500 years is built on mutual prosperity, sustainability and greatness,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIn his response, the President of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa told President Buhari that Portugal can help Nigeria diversify the economy.\n\n\u201cBecause we are a very small country, we have huge experience. We have experience in water supply, technology, infrastructure, pharmaceuticals, tourism, Agriculture, Science, Health care, Trade, the sea and we want to cooperate with you. We have experienced companies, experienced hands. We have a unique knowledge of Africa,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the visit, the Portuguese President said, \u201cYour visit is a new beginning, A new beginning of every sector. We don\u2019t want 30 or 100 companies, we want thousands of companies in Nigeria, we want thousands of Portuguese in Nigeria and that will be your legacy, my legacy, the legacy of this state visit. I\u2019ll be going to Nigeria later on and together we shall see with our own eyes what the outcome of this visit is. This is not a visit of words but a visit of facts and achievements. We will achieve.\u201d",

          "text": "Mara, a pan-African company that offers suite of crypto products, has announced the pre-launch of the Mara Wallet, a portal to the crypto economy.\n\nThe product is focused on helping people begin their journey towards conveniently managing their crypto-finance needs, take a major step towards financial freedom, and learn more about cryptocurrency and blockchain in Africa.\n\nThe Mara Wallet is a fast and secure multi-currency crypto wallet that gives Africans control over their cryptocurrency. Offering both user-facing products and core infrastructure, Mara reveals a product roadmap that enables users to easily buy, sell, send, withdraw, store, and protect a wide range of fiat and crypto-assets such as cryptocurrencies and NFTs in real time and without any prior crypto knowledge.\n\nCommenting on the pre-launch of the Mara Wallet, the Co-Founder and CEO at Mara, Chi Nnadi, said: \u201cAt Mara, we are committed to the financial empowerment of the individuals that use our products and services to meet their various crypto-finance needs, and take responsibility in building an informed community seriously.\n\n\u201cAs one of our first steps to achieve crypto education, financial literacy, and ensuring a more equitable distribution of capital, we are delighted to pre-launch the Mara Wallet. Our goal is to get Sub-Saharan individuals started on their journey to leverage a financial infrastructure that they can build their lives upon and make the most of the financial-growth opportunities available in the crypto economy.\u201d\n\nThe Mara Wallet waitlist, which is the core mechanic of the pre-launch app, is aimed at crypto-curious and crypto-enthusiast users alike who seek early access to the exchange. Through it they will unlock financial rewards that give users the perfect jumpstart into the #cryptoeconomy.\n\nWhile describing how the Mara Wallet waitlist works, Nnadi said: \u201cPre-registered users will join a queue to enable early access on a first-come, first-served basis. Moreover, a higher position on the waitlist increases the odds of periodically winning prizes. As soon as users join the waitlist, they instantly earn a signup reward. All users who refer the Mara Wallet to their friends, family and community also earn further rewards when those users sign up using their unique referral link. Pre-registered users who participate in the referral activity also improve their chances of moving to top positions on the waitlist.\u201d\n\nThe Mara Wallet app is available on the Google Play and Apple App stores. Once formally launched in a few months time, the Mara Wallet will enable users to invest in crypto and send money to their family members in real time without processing times, delays, or high fees.\n\nTo join the waitlist, Nnadi advised would-be subscribes to download the app on the Google Play or the Apple App Store.\n\nThe Mara Wallet pre-launch comes at a critical inflection point in the evolution of sub-Saharan Africa. The current centralised financial system continues to present ongoing obstacles to the development of both local economies and individuals. As a result, food prices have doubled or even tripled in some areas and created record-breaking interest rates. These systems have prompted a dire need for a decentralised alternative.\n\nMara\u2019s mission is to facilitate a more equitable distribution of capital by providing an alternative that spans across tribes, class, cultures, and countries.",

          "text": "*Expresses regret three countries have slipped back to military rule\n\n*Portugal promises to help diversify Nigeria\u2019s economy\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has declared that Nigeria will continue to seek consensus on the full resumption of democratic governance throughout the 16-nation West African subregion.\n\nResponding Thursday in Lisbon, Portugal, to commendations by President of the Portuguese Parliament, Augusto Santos Silva, on the role Nigeria is playing under the present administration, stabilizing West Africa and Guinea Bissau in particular, the President regretted that three countries in the subregion have slipped back to undemocratic, military rule saying the former Portuguese colony was lucky to have survived those attempts.\n\nWhile attributing some of these reversals to the process of development which the new nations will pass through, the Nigerian leader said Nigeria will continue to work within the framework of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to reverse the unwanted situation, stressing that \u201cwe have to go back to proper democratization.\u201d\n\nOn the failed attempt to topple the elected government of Guinea Bissau, President Buhari said in the process of national development, \u201cwe can\u2019t do hop, start and jump,\u201d meaning that there are no shortcuts, expressing strong confidence however that the problems will be overcome.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe will try to support him (meaning Oumarou Sissoco Embalo, the Prime Minister of Guinea Bissau).\u201d\n\nThe President said his visit to the parliament where he was honored with a ceremonial parade and a standing ovation inside the chamber by its 120 membership was an eye opener to things he had read in history books in his school days.\n\nHe described the growing trade and political relationship between the two countries as momentous, expressing hope \u201cthat this visit will put in place the firm foundations of a special relationship between our two countries, the national governments and the citizens of our two states.\u201d\n\nIn an entry into the \u201cBook of Honor\u201d at the Parliament building, President Buhari said:\n\n\u201cMy visit to the Portuguese National Assembly is to underscore the strong relationship between Nigeria and Portuguese Republic, focused on cooperation, respect for global inclusiveness, promotion of investment and trade and adherence to international rules and norms.\n\n\u201cThe constraints of the past are behind us and the foundations of a bright, strong future are being put in place by our two governments. There is much to be done in the field of trade, energy, security and other areas.\n\n\u201cAs democracies, our systems require parliamentary support for the sort of engagements we want to have in place between our two independent countries.\n\n\u201cSo far, I am encouraged by the signals and responses to the historic and great partnership we envisage between our two great nations.\u201d\n\nThe President of the Portuguese Parliament, Augusto Silva expressed happiness with the visit of a Nigerian President 17 years after the last one, expressing gratitude for Nigeria\u2019s reliable supply of Liquefied Natural Gas, the continuing collaboration in the fight against terrorism in Africa, the patronage of a Portuguese company in the construction of the Kano-Maradi railway line and for the support of the Nigerian government for the elected government of Guinea Bissau.\n\nHe gave assurances of the continuing role of Portugal as bridge and ladder between Africa and Europe.\n\nAt another event in Lisbon same day, President Buhari called for an increase in the volume of trade with Portugal as well as diversification to non-oil products.\n\nThe President, who spoke at an Economic Seminar between Nigeria and Portugal businesses in the course of his State Visit to Portugal, noted that the two countries are in dire need of new investment opportunities following the devastation on global economies caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and, in recent times, the impact of Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nAccording to him: \u2018\u2018The relationship between modern Nigeria and Portugal started over 40 years ago with strong collaborations on the diplomatic and defence fronts.\n\n\u2018\u2018I was very excited to learn of the increased level of enthusiasm Portuguese businesses have shown towards Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018In the past 25 years, trade between Nigeria and Portugal has more than doubled to over $1 billion by 2020 just before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThis has been mostly in the oil and gas sector. Although this is great progress, I strongly believe we can and should do a lot more\u201d.\n\nAssuring the Portuguese government of Nigeria\u2019s support to Portuguese companies wishing to invest in the country, the President said: \u2018\u2018The Portuguese were the first European voyagers on record to visit the shores of Nigeria in the late fifteenth century. And just like how African culture is influential in modern Portugal, the Portuguese culture is also felt in today\u2019s Nigeria.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe announced that recently, the Government of Nigeria awarded a contract to Mota-Engil, a Portuguese company, to construct a railway line that connects Kano in Northern Nigeria to Maradi in Southern Niger Republic.\n\nHe added this partnership will surely open doors for more Portuguese companies to come to Nigeria, as the largest and most populous economy in Africa.\n\n\u2018\u2018Just two months ago, Portugal opened its first North Africa Trade Chamber. This will complement the Chamber in South Africa.\n\n\u2018\u2018I am confident after your interactions today on the tremendous potential in Nigeria, we will soon be hearing an announcement on the opening of the Nigeria Portugal Trade Chamber.\u2019\u2019\n\nRecalling that in 2021, the African Export-Import Bank and Portugal\u2019s National Association of Young Entrepreneurs announced a three-year partnership to promote Africa\u2019s fashion apparel and textile manufacturing industry, the Nigerian leader said: \u2018\u2018I strongly believe this will benefit Nigeria\u2019s vibrant fashion industry.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari also appraised prospective investors of the many fiscal, trade and monetary incentives that support foreign investments.\n\n\u2018\u2018The Nigerian Government officials in this room are on standby to provide all the necessary information you need.\n\n\u2018\u2018I have already directed the establishment of a dedicated Portugal working group headed by the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment to address any special concerns you may have above and beyond the existing policies in place.\n\n\u2018\u2018I want to assure you that we will take these requests seriously and our response will be swift.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn his expectations for the forum, the President expressed confidence that it was an appropriate platform to establish and strengthen business relationships, share valuable experience, and collaborate for both countries\u2019 mutual benefit.\n\n\u2018\u2018Nigeria and Portugal share long historical ties. The relationship between our two countries brought with it trade partnerships, an area that we wish to build upon today,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari thanked President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa of Portugal, who was present at the Seminar, for his contribution, interest and trust in forging formidable economic cooperation between Nigeria and Portugal.\n\n\u2018\u2018As I mentioned earlier our two countries have a long, shared history and we now have the power to ensure the next 500 years is built on mutual prosperity, sustainability and greatness,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIn his response, the President of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa told President Buhari that Portugal can help Nigeria diversify the economy.\n\nHe said: \u201cBecause we are a very small country, we have huge experience. We have experience in water supply, technology, infrastructure, pharmaceuticals, tourism, Agriculture, Science, Health care, Trade, the sea and we want to cooperate with you. We have experienced companies, experienced hands. We have a unique knowledge of Africa\u201d.\n\nOn President Buhari\u2019s state visit, the Portuguese President said, \u201cYour visit is a new beginning, A new beginning of every sector. We don\u2019t want 30 or 100 companies, we want thousands of companies in Nigeria, we want thousands of Portuguese in Nigeria and that will be your legacy, my legacy, the legacy of this state visit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be going to Nigeria later on and together we shall see with our own eyes what the outcome of this visit is. This is not a visit of words but a visit of facts and achievements. We will achieve.\u201d",

We look forward to the elections. I\u2019m sure the APC would expect a stiff competition. We agree that they are the government in power in that state but they will be definitely expecting a very stiff competition from us. We are poised to take back that state.\u201d\n\nCommenting on Zamfara Governor\u2019s directive for state citizens to take up arms, he faulted the idea saying, though birthed out of frustration, it would have telling consequences for the overall security of the region.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI think they need critical thinking because you have to also be in a position to examine the recommendations being made. When recommendations are made and you have not thought through it in full about the consequences of such, then it is also a problem.\n\n\u201cIt is out of frustration that such recommendations are being made, not doubt. But when you ask for everybody to carry guns you must ask yourself, are Nigerians in the mindset where every single individual can carry his own gun? You will be surprised that with every little argument people will just snuff themselves out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cause for concern when we hear that kind of recommendation. But the real thing is people are frustrated and he (Governor Matawalle) is also frustrated to the extent that he thinks that is the way to go. I don\u2019t think that is the best recommendation at the moment.\u201d\n\nOkowa argued that with the insecurity biting hard, the government must address insecurity holistically, with a long-term strategy in mind.\n\nHis words: \u201cI think we need to begin to look into many other things. Yes, as a quick one, he\u2019s calling for that. But there will be consequences. But we need a long-term approach to deal with insecurity. We need to look at the foundation of the problems that we have. A lot of hunger, joblessness, a lot of people are losing hope. And when you look at all these issues, it brings a lot of frustration. So, we have to address it holistically\u201d.",

          "text": "Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe House of Representatives has passed through second reading a Bill seeking to amend the Discrimination against Persons with Disability (Prohibition) Act, 2018 for upward review of retirement age of persons with disability.\n\nThe proposed legislation titled, \u201cDiscrimination Against Persons with Disability Prohibition (Amendment) Bill, 2022,\u201d was sponsored by Chairman Committee on Defence, Hon. Babajimi Benson.\n\nLeading the debate on its general principles said the Bill seeks to amend the Principal Act which provides for measures to protect and ensure inclusion of PLWD in Nigeria.\n\nHe explained that the amendment seeks to address some salient defects noticed in the Principal Act by amending Sections 30 and 32 of the Principal Act and rearranging Sections 30-58 as Sections 30-59.\n\nThe amendment, he said will include an insertion of a subsection 30 (1) which provides for an increase in the retirement age and term of service from 65 to 70 years or 40 years of service, whichever comes first.\n\nBenson also said the second amendment seeks to ensure that the Chairman of the National Commission for Persons Living with Disability is someone also living with disability and has requisite qualifications for that position.\n\nHe said, \u201cDear Colleagues, the rationale behind this amendment is to further ensure that persons living with disability are fairly treated to ensure equity and justice. Originally, employment rates of persons with disabilities are substantially lower than the rates for persons without disabilities in Nigeria. Persons with disabilities have lower earnings, and are sometimes low-skilled, part-time, and informal job settings with subminimum wages.\n\n\u201cThey also face social stigma and prejudice and obstacles to moving around their own communities and city spaces. This leads to poverty and dejection especially when they retire early. This amendment will give them more opportunities, not only to fully give their services to the country, but to also benefit more from the government and live a reasonable life after retirement. As a peoples\u2019 parliament, the passage of this bill will further demonstrate our commitment to equity and fairness for all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nContributing, Hon. TJ Yusuf while noting that he\u2019s not against policies that will encourage people living with disabilities, said the House should be mindful so as not to create another challenge in the cause of curing one.\n\nReacting, the Speaker Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila told him that PWDs are a special class of people that shouldn\u2019t be discriminated, hence why the Bill is important.\n\n\u201cDisability is not a profession, it\u2019s a special class. And the constitution said they shouldn\u2019t be discriminated this special class,\u201d Gbajabiamila said\n\nThe Bill was thereafter voted on, passed and referred to the Committee on Disabilities.\n\nOther Bills which scaled the second reading include, \u201cA Bill for an Act to Provide for Establishment of an Independent Office of the Auditor-General for Area Councils in the Federal Capital Territory and Provide for the Audit of Area Councils Public Accounts; and for Related Matters (HB. 1782) by Hon. Wole Oke and a Bill for an Act to Establish Nigerian Association of Paralegals charged with the responsibility of determining the Standards of Knowledge and Skills required of Persons seeking to become Members of the Association; and for Related Matters.",

          "text": "Samuel Ortom, governor of Benue, says 14 out of 17 members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) panel preferred Nyesom Wike as the vice-presidential candidate of the party.\n\nOrtom spoke on Thursday during an interview with Channels Television.\n\nRecently, Atiku Abubakar, PDP presidential candidate, named Ifeanyi Okowa, governor of Delta, as his running mate for the 2023 elections.\n\nThe selection of Okowa has sparked varied reactions in the party as it was believed that Wike, governor of Rivers, would be the choice of the party for the vice-presidential slot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking on the development, Ortom said the Rivers governor should have been consulted before Okowa was announced as the vice-presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cOf course, three names were presented. In the order of preference, Wike, Okowa and governor Udom \u2013 all of them are qualified. But the preference was Wike \u2013 14 members (referring to the committee) out of 17. This is the point we are making,\u201d Ortom said.\n\n\u201cThree of them were qualified but governor Wike was eminently qualified \u2013 14 out of 17 members chose him. All these things were said during our meeting.

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date.

          "title": "Spotlighting 7 African startups in Techstars Toronto spring 2022 cohort",
          "text": "Yesterday, 7 African startups selected for the Techstars Toronto accelerator spring cohort programme graduated alongside 4 other companies across Canada, Pakistan, and India, according to information shared with TechCabal by Techstars Toronto managing director, Sunil Sharma.\n\nThe accelerator programme provided these startups with $120,000 funding ($100,000 convertible note and $20,000 stipend), hands-on mentorship, and access to Techstars\u2019 network of experienced founders. For the African startups in the accelerator that TechCabal spoke with, the acceptance also served as an opportunity for them to bounce ideas off the accelerator\u2019s vast network of founders and mentors. They said Techstars has helped them better understand the problem they are solving and improve their business models.\n\nIn the last class, 8 African startups made the cut. This time around, out of the 12, 7 startups focused on the continent participated in the 3-month programme, culminating in a Demo Day held yesterday.\n\nThe African startups selected in Techstars Toronto\u2019s spring 2022 class are: Emergency Response Africa, Blackcopper, Mycoverai, truQ, Bongalow, Glade, and Gigmile.\n\nEmergency Response Africa\n\nFounded in 2019 by Ghanian CTO, Maame Pooku and Nigerian CEO Folake Owodunmi, Emergency Response Africa (ERA) provides fast, reliable emergency medical help across Africa.\n\nERA was born after Pooku lost a family member in Ghana due to slow emergency response, and Owodunmi almost lost a child to a medical emergency. When both founders realised slow emergency response was a prevalent problem in Africa, they started working on a solution. ERA began operations until 2021.\n\n\u201cKnowing that so many people lose their lives needlessly in that journey to get healthcare with so many delays, I really wanted to find out how we could make that process better and, ultimately, save lives. And this was an opportunity to use technology to solve a big problem that I saw,\u201d said Owodunmi on a call with TechCabal.\n\n\u201cAt its simplest level, the problem that we\u2019re solving is the lack of access to fast, reliable emergency medical care. But there are a lot of factors that contribute to that problem existing in the first place. One of those factors is simply a shortage of supply in terms of ambulances and first responders. But perhaps more importantly, the bigger issue is that there\u2019s a lack of centralised communication and dispatch,\u201d she added.\n\nEmergency Response Africa identifies, assesses, and onboards a large network of first responders, emergency vehicles, and hospitals on its technology platform, making it possible to dispatch the right resources to the patients in minutes.\n\nOwodunmi said that Techstars has helped ERA in refining its business model and also provided insights on how they can increase the efficiency, speed, and quality of responses from its network of first responders. Owodunmi said that ERA is currently only available in Nigeria, but it intends to expand across West Africa in the next 3 years.\n\nBlackcopper\n\nBlackcopper provides lenders with data that helps them make smart credit decisions and thereby helps nano, micro, and small businesses access credit. It was founded in 2020 by Muyiwa Faulkner and Azeez Oluwafemi who have a cumulative 2 decades of banking experience.\n\n\u201cWhile building solutions for a bank and a number of fintechs, I found out that nano, micro and small businesses are totally neglected from getting easy and fast access to financial services in emerging markets,\u201d Faulkner said on a call with TechCabal.\n\nBlackcooper operates only in Nigeria at the moment, but over the next 12 months, it wants to expand to Ghana, Uganda, and Tanzania.\n\nMycoverai\n\nMycoverai builds a digital insurance infrastructure that African businesses can embed into their products. It was founded in 2021 by Adebowale Banjo (CEO), Fred Ebho (CTO), and Alexander Igwe Ifendu (CPO).\n\nBanjo explained in a call with TechCabal that Africans are already struggling with poverty, and that to live without insurance is to deepen the strain, so he and his co-founder thought of creating a safety net first for Africans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built this API that allows other businesses to embed insurance into their offering. To make distribution of insurance easy, we are leveraging two pillars: product innovation and distribution. For product innovation, we are working with insurance companies to create insurance products that are very interesting and attractive to the end users. Then the second leg is to find businesses who are going to embed our offerings into their own products and services. For the third leg, we are building an infrastructure that makes the claims process easier for the insurance companies and the users,\u201d Banjo said, explaining Mycoverai\u2019s product.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created this retail health insurance product called FlexiCare which goes for \u20a61,600 monthly and gives people up to \u20a61 million worth of benefits and access to primary care, secondary care, surgeries, and eye care. We also discovered that this product is unique and robust. About 3,000 of our current users are first-time purchasers of insurance products,\u201d Banjo added.\n\nMycoverai currently operates in Nigeria, but it intends to expand to 5 other African countries including Kenya and Rwanda in the coming years.\n\nBongalow\n\nBongalow is a US-incorporated but Africa-focused startup that provides digitised mortgage infrastructure that traditional banks, neobanks, and real estate agents and brokers can embed into their products to offer mortgage solutions to their customers. It was founded in 2021 by Kelechi Nwokocha (CEO), Abdulrahman Atta (CTO), and Samuel Haruna CPO,\n\ntruQ\n\ntruQ is automating and optimising short-haul logistics across Africa. It is doing this by connecting B2B e-commerce businesses, merchants, and individuals in real-time to the closest vehicles to enable trusted, trackable, and affordable shipments. It was founded in 2019 by Williams Fatayo (CEO) and Foluso Ojo (COO).\n\nGlade\n\nGlade is a fintech startup that provides African businesses with multi-currency bank accounts and allows them to perform cross-border payments. It was founded in 2020 by Liyi Victor (CEO) and Temitope Hundeyin (COO). It is trying to solve the challenges that African businesses deal with when accessing cross-border payments including the outright decline of access, high costs of exchange rates, bad experiences, and lack of transparency in transactions by making cross-border payments seamless.\n\nGigmile\n\nGigmile provides gig workers with various financing options ranging from motorcycle financing to smartphone financing and fuel advance. Gigmile wants Africa to tap into the full potential of the gig economy by supplying potential gig workers with important tools such as vehicles and smartphones and giving them access to skills training and credit. It was founded in 2022 by Nigerians Kayode Adeyinka (CEO) and Samuel Esiri (COO), both ex-Jumia country head.\n\nLike in other years, this 6th cohort of Techstars Toronto features an array of startups dealing with payments and money in some way, a trend credited to Toronto\u2019s reputation as a financial centre. It also features a healthy mix of startups that aren\u2019t tilted towards fintech or payment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another remarkable class of Canadian and international startups, and they are all raising money and growing really fast with very strong founders, most of whom are now in Toronto,\u201d Sunil said in a statement announcing the graduation.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "\u201cThe future of work for African startups is in distributed offices\u201d and other ideas from VivaTech, one of Europe\u2019s largest tech conferences",
          "text": "May 14\n\nAt about 5:45 PM CET on May 14, I arrived at the Gare du Nord station in Paris, France. It was rowdy, with a mix of different people who had just arrived in the city or were about to leave. A typical sight at one of the city\u2019s 6 large mainline railway station terminals.\n\nI had travelled to Paris for VivaTech, one of Europe\u2019s largest tech conferences. Founded in 2016, VivaTech has hosted 36,000 startups, 3,300 investors, and numerous business leaders and innovators such as Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Ma and Tim Cook.\n\nI planned to arrive a few hours earlier for the Viva AfricArena event at Station F, but a 90-minute train delay made it impossible.\n\nMy first stop was Rue Montorgueil, a street lined with restaurants, caf\u00e9s, bakeries, fish stores, cheese shops, and wine shops. About 100 VivaTech attendees filled the street chatting and drinking at Viva Night, a networking event.\n\nTo satisfy my hunger, I bought shawarma\u2014starting with familiar food\u2014and a drink, before going on to chat with a few startup founders from Africa and Europe.\n\nExhausted from a long day of dragging my suitcases around, I decided to book an Uber to my Airbnb, so I wouldn\u2019t have to keep asking people for directions.\n\nOver the course of the 45-minute ride, I had a light-hearted conversation with the driver who lives in Paris but is from Algeria. His English wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was good enough for him to dish out some words of advice on why I should get married soon.\n\n\u201cJe parle Anglais,\u201d was a standard disclaimer I gave to almost everyone who started speaking to me in French, telling them that I only speak English. Growing up, I had learnt French at every level of my education but was never in the right environment long enough to practise speaking it.\n\nLater, as I settled into my Airbnb room, I made an attempt to watch TV but embarrassingly caught myself scrolling through the stations, looking for an English-speaking channel. So much for using not being in the right environment as an excuse for my incapacity with French. I didn\u2019t bother turning on the TV after that day.\n\nMay 15\n\nAt 9:59 AM, I arrived at the Paris Expo Porte de Versailles. There was a large crowd outside the venue waiting to enter. I was about an hour late because I had to get a SIM card to wean myself off my dependence on public WiFi.\n\nThe conference started on a high note with a teeming crowd and positive energy. After a bit of queuing, I got inside and was fascinated to see more than 100 African startups present\u2014most of them serving francophone African countries.\n\nIt felt odd that there was no Nigerian booth at the conference, considering that countries like Egypt and South Africa had booths. I later learned from someone involved in trying to organise a Nigerian delegation that the current focus on the 2023 election cycle was a major reason why the government didn\u2019t sponsor a delegation.\n\nOver the next few days at the conference, talking to many of these startups made me more aware of the francophone African tech ecosystem and the different people and organisations working to make it thrive.\n\nConversations and sessions\n\nWith startups stationed in shared 3-by-3-metre booths all over the conference venue, I walked to different booths seeking to learn more about what they did.\n\nI spoke to Julien Herbin of Kayfo Games, a startup based in Senegal, who explained that making games from Dakar had a few limitations as he couldn\u2019t monetise the business through in-app purchases because Senegal didn\u2019t have an agreement with Google and Apple on taxation and revenue share, thereby limiting his revenue streams to only advertising.\n\nFinding a place to park in African cities can often be a hassle. Senegalese Lamine Ba of Parcsmart, explained to me that solving the problem of parking in Senegal and other African cities could lead to more efficient use of land and how parking can be a significant revenue stream for businesses.\n\nYanick Kemayou of Kabakoo Academies (Mali), whose edtech solution is helping youths acquire critical competencies such as programming and design, for success in a fast-moving world, was generous in explaining his business model and later helping me get a city transport card to aid my movement around the city.\n\nI also chatted with Singaporean-French serial entrepreneur and now investor, Lin Dejean Yun of Transcendence VC, who explained why she\u2019s bullish on francophone Africa: it\u2019s an untapped market.\n\nOn different occasions, I listened to a pitch by Lew Kam of Easy Matatu (Uganda)\u2014one of the 3 finalists in the Climate Tech Awards\u2014on how they are reducing carbon emissions by streamlining mobility.\n\nDr Rasha Rady of Chefaa (Egypt) spoke about learning to pitch to investors as a female founder on a panel session about women in tech.\n\nCameroonian tech founder and investor, Rebecca Enonchong, gave a passionate talk on her struggles as an entrepreneur and why African entrepreneurs are better adapted to surmount new challenges.\n\n\u201cStartups in Africa, in my opinion, are less risky than startups in other parts of the world because of our resilience as entrepreneurs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe [African entrepreneurs] are very adapted for challenges, and we\u2019re able to surmount challenges unlike any other ecosystem entrepreneurs that I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Here\u2019s a 2-minute clip of her speech.\n\nI also listened to a panel on the future of work. Gregoire Schwebig, CEO AfricaWorks, suggested that maybe Africa doesn\u2019t need to rely on Western ideas of going fully remote due to its current infrastructural problems. The future he suggested is in distributed offices: rather than having one office, companies could have offices all-around cities, closer to employees. The idea rings nice to me, but I wonder how affordable it is.\n\nSince it was launched in 2018, the D\u00e9l\u00e9gation G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 l\u2019Entreprenariat Rapide des Femmes et des Jeunes (DER) has granted 60 billion FCFA (~$96,424,000) out to startups and helped transform the Senegalese tech ecosystem. Mame Aby Seye, General Delegate for Youth and Women Entrepreneurship, spoke about the achievements of the Senegalese tech ecosystem and the support given by the DER to make this possible.\n\nFood\n\nAfter eating shawarma on my first day in Paris, I had more sandwiches, croissants, and pizza over the next 2 days, and then I started craving Nigerian food\u2014I was tired of meals with flour. Fortunately, I ate sea bass, Turkish food, which made my taste buds come alive.\n\nOn Friday evening, I got to eat some Nigerian fried rice cooked by a Nigerian friend who was also at the conference.\n\nOutside African tech\n\nIndia was recognised as Country of the Year at VivaTech, a special recognition given due to the contribution of Indian startups to the world. India has 100 unicorns\u2014one out of every 10 unicorns comes from India.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, and other notable innovators and leaders were also present at the conference.\n\nFour years ago, Huawei launched its app gallery to the rest of the world, making a concerted effort to move beyond Google and build its own ecosystem of products that tie together. During a session by Huawei, the company shared that it has over 432 billion downloads and over 580 million monthly average users (MAU), as of 2021\u2014and that less than 10% of those came from Europe. The number of users from Africa wasn\u2019t shared, most likely because the session was more relevant to a European audience. The Huawei operating system has 5.4 million registered developers and over 187,000 apps are already integrated into it.\n\nThat\u2019s a small figure compared to Google, which had 3.48 million apps on Playstore as of Q1 2021, and 111.3 billion apps downloaded as of 2022. But still, it is a sign that Huawei has made progress over the years. The company also displayed some of its machine learning capabilities. Here\u2019s a video of a demonstration of that.\n\nFashion and tech\n\nAmid the 2,000 exhibitors at the conference, I learned that fashion and beauty brands like Fendi, Bulgari, and Dior were doing more than just creating outfits in the metaverse. Bulgari had an interactive display that enabled clients to create a 3D image of a piece of jewellery in the metaverse, which can then be minted into an NFT. Christian Dior partnered with Lucibel, a French company that designs and manufactures new-generation lighting products and solutions based on LED technology, to create this mask that uses cold red light to stimulate and regenerate skin cells within 12 minutes, without the risk of burning. I didn\u2019t get to try it, but someone who did mentioned that it\u2019s like a substitute for Botox, given that it tightens the skin and straightens out wrinkles.\n\nFendi teamed up with a startup to create an interactive game that gave users the ability to recreate a limited edition bag in order to experience how it was created by craftsmen in Italy. It took 900 hours to create one bag.\n\nSome of these demonstrations were a strategy to get the attention of passers-by, and others were meant to build affinity with the brand by asking users to create fashion items virtually.\n\nLa fin\n\nSaturday, May 18 was the hottest day of the year so far in France, and I felt every degree of it. Many people stayed indoors, and those who went outside were dressed lightly. At its peak, temperatures rose to about 32\u00b0C\u2014Lagos was 26\u00b0C. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder how the heat from Lagos followed me to Paris.\n\nSaturday was mostly dedicated to conference sessions held in French\u2014most sessions without translators, presenting me with the perfect opportunity to visit more booths and meet more people.\n\nLater in the evening, after 4 days of learning about tech and showcasing tech products and services, VivaTech 2022 came to an end with music from French DJ Hadrien Federiconi, better known by his stage name Feder. The Africa Tech section hosted ace Congolese guitarist Olivier Tshimanga, who dished out some melodic tunes. The Congolese delegates sure do know how to end a conference in style.\n\nVivaTech 2022 recorded about 91,000 in-person visitors and 300,000 online visits from 146 countries. There were 1,800 startups and 700 investment funds.\n\nAfter an exhilarating week, the next day, I made sure to visit the Eiffel Tower before leaving Paris.\n\nAs I got closer, I didn\u2019t find the Eiffel Tower impressive, seeing that it was one tall structure made up of connected metals. But as soon as I made it to the top, my opinion changed; the experience was beautiful.\n\nAu revoir, mes amis!\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

Currently, one of our refineries is working, which is Watersmith modular refinery that is producing 5,000bpd and serving the eastern market.\n\n\u201d In terms of our modular refinery operation, by July, this one will go live to tell you that there are modular refineries working in the country.\n\n\u201cThere has been substantial improvements. In March, we were here to do our inspection and also had a board meeting. During the meeting, the board mandated duport to carry out a lot of activities with a view to officially commissioning this in June.\n\n\u201cThis is the rainy season and they have got off to work. Between March and now, what I have seen is a marked improvements in terms of installation of the GPF, completion of the refinery installation. This is an energy park with a data center that is currently operational,\u201d Wabote said.\n\nDr Akintoye Akindele, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Duport Midstream Company Limited (DMCL), on his part, said production will begin after the final assessment of the facility is done by the regulatory agency.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we can process 60-million-scf of gas daily. This refinery is a 10,000 barrel per day refinery, starting with 2,500 barrel per day.\n\n\u201cThe power plant capacity is over 50 megawatts and we are starting with five megawatts. We have a 32 racks data center that can go up to 100 racks.\n\n\u201cWhat we have not done is to introduce hydrocarbons into it. We are fully done, fully installed. However, the way it works, is, you must get the regulator who will come to do final work through before we start full commercial production.\n\n\u201cWe expect that to be completed by July 28 and then full commercial production will start. It is now no more in progress or under construction, it is done. Regulatory agencies must give right to start commercial operations.\n\n\u201cWithout the NCDMB, this will not be possible. Not only did they invest in us, they held our hands through the process, supporting us, guiding us and letting us tap into their experiences.\n\n\u201cThis government has been very supportive of the energy sector. Not only did they pass the PIA bill, invest in local companies.\n\n\u201cToday in Nigeria, we have three refineries working in Nigeria, we have Watersmith, we have Niger Delta and this one is the third. Two of them are funded by the NCDMB.\n\n\u201cThey have supported the capital and policies.

          "text": "Now it is official, coming from no less a personality and political stalwart than Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara state. Yes. The respected General Theophilus Yakubu Danjuma admonished all those trapped in the fiendish Nigerian contraption to seek protection from outside the compromised and partisan Caliphate controlled \u2018Nigerian\u2019 Military about two years ago. Some deaf Nigerians living in self-denial did not pay heed. Good enough the Central Unitary Government in Abuja could not fault his knowledge-based warning that there was nothing called wholesome Nigerian Military anymore.\n\nThe Governor of Katsina State Bello Masari who shares the same May 29 birthday with me, 5 years younger though, had expressed similar warning out of frustration when his largely Hausa farmers were being slaughtered like chicken on daily basis. In fact, Masari cried out that he had been deceived by the local Fulani and imported terrorists who swore on the Holy Qur\u2019an that they would stop their atrocities. He too called on his people to arm themselves against the marauders. Just last weekend he shared pictures and videos of his people trooping out to neighbouring Niger Republic to escape further routine mindless massacre.\n\nThank goodness and common-sense when reality dawned on courageous Governor Matawalle when he cried out, with official stamp to boot, that his citizens must possess arms and ammunition to counter the surge of terrorism that had kept Zamfara state indigenes captive on their own soil. I felt relieved that many people are now responding to the conclusion of my column last week \u2018Stop the influx of Terrorists into Nigeria\u2019 when I posed the question: \u2018What did Jesus say about possessing a sword?\u2019. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one\u201d [Luke 22:36-38.]\n\nHere is the summary of Bello Matawalle\u2019s directive to his people after officially recruiting 19,800 Community Guards being 200 in each of the 19 Emirates [of course they would be armed]: He also announced an additional paramilitary unit to support control and command, to properly and effectively reinforce the operations of Community Protection Guards (CPG).\n\nIn the preamble to the order, the Governor said, \u201cA handful of bandits with the monopoly of wielding guns against the defenceless people of Zamfara, have made life miserable for the teeming population\u201d And that exactly is what is happening throughout the brutishly terrorized country, insulted by the boring repetitive official crocodile tears and empty assurances of bringing \u2018perpetrators to book\u2019.\n\nThe Governor thereafter in a statement by his Commissioner of Information Ibrahim Dosara gave residents the go ahead to acquire guns to defend themselves against bandits that have been terrorizing them.\n\nThe Governor noted that Kaduna, Zamfara and Katsina have been in bandits\u2019 grip with the terrorists becoming more audacious in their attacks.\n\n\u201cRecall that the Katsina State Government [the home state of Mr. President] was the first to urge residents of the state to \u2018obtain guns to defend themselves\u2019 against terrorists who have been attacking them\u201d the statement said.\n\n*Daily Trust* reported that the Zamfara government also \u201cdirected the state commissioner of police to issue (gun) license\u201d to people who are qualified and willing to use the guns. This directive by the governor to liberalize gun ownership may reverse the trend in the short term.\n\n\u201cThe governor equally banned riding of motorbikes in some designated areas and anyone found riding motorbike within the areas is considered as a terrorist and security agencies are, thereby, directed to shoot such persons at sight.\u201d\n\nSelf-preservation is the first law of Nature.\n\nWe cried and cried, and almost every reasonable person in the land asked for the decentralization of the Police Force to effectively combat the nuisance of bandits, kidnappers and the rampaging terrorists. We had several levels of policing in Nigeria before. However, someone or a group of people with severe ulterior agenda just shut the gate against the realization of the creation of state and local government police as it obtains in all countries of the world except Nigeria which glorifies in celebrating Stone Age mentality. If Ondo state had had State Police or if Akure Metropolis had had her own Police Force, certainly the blood-thirsty cowards that went on murderous campaign at the Catholic Church in Owo would have thought twice before embarking on such carnage.\n\nNow it is official. Every state governor must take advantage of their immunity to dare the Military decree-backed document mischievously called \u2018Constitution\u2019 and bring arms to their respective states and arm their people against wanton daily slaughter and kidnapping-for-ransom which their citizens are being excruciatingly subjected to.\n\nEvery Nigerian must admit the fact that there is no government at the center to look up to, especially a government that says \u2018security is not the business of the federal government\u2019. Or a leader that says \u2018you should be tolerant\u2019 with terrorists!\n\nIt is a simple fact that you cannot be law-abiding in a lawless society. Nigeria is a terrible lawless society where anything goes. And worse than that, it is a country that purportedly operates several layers of discordant and discriminatory laws. A country where you don\u2019t even know which uniform worn by supposed Security personnel is genuine or fake. And a country where the Government, out of sinister motive, confuses you with interchangeable uniforms for the Army, Navy, Air-force and the Police!! The only country in the world where such confusion is in the ascendancy.\n\nNow that a state government led by a member of the National Council of State has officially declared that it is legal for citizens of his state to purchase arms and protect themselves, no sensible Nigerian who values his/her life should surrender whatever weapon in his possession to anybody. In fact, he should buy more. He should stockpile to distribute to able-bodied persons close to him. Why should anyone surrender their weapons to a so-called Authority that has been accused on several occasions of aiding and abetting terrorists and kidnappers? What moral authority does anyone who condones others carrying unlicensed, very illegal AK-47 rifles in the open have to ask others in the same country to surrender their own weapons?\n\nAny state governor who is afraid to follow the courageous and rightful step taken by Matawalle is not fit to be called a man. And surely such a governor should know that sooner or later he will face the wrath of his electors who entrusted their care, protection, safety and general well-being to his leadership.\n\nLet it be made clear here. Nobody is inciting anybody. Matawalle has not incited anybody. At a point, government in Abuja asked people to defend themselves. Are they expected to defend themselves with their teeth or bare hands? Whoever whimsically thinks that someone is inciting someone must be living under intoxicating illusion that the armed personnel protecting him/her from the wrath of the suffering masses would be with him or her forever. To quote Ambassador Kazaure: \u2018there is life after power\u2019. If you doubt the aphorism, check on former governors, former military generals, former permanent secretaries, former Managing Directors in your neighbourhood!\n\nFollowing Governor Matawalle\u2019s bold directive as the Chief Security Officer of his state which should be taken as applicable to all other states in Nigeria, and also responding to similar directives by the Katsina state governor, the admonition by General Danjuma and the recent courageous stand of the Ondo State governor Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu SAN, I earnestly expect all Nigerians of adult age or the age of herders parading AK-47 all over the place to go out en masse and apply for gun licences and, if refused, should acquire guns the same way those under-age herders carrying guns acquired theirs.\n\nWhat is good for the goose should be good for the gander. The era of intimidation, timidity and sycophantic hero-worship is gone forever in Nigeria. The #EndSars heroes and heroines had shown us the legitimate way to go. Nigerian youths and their suffering and repressed elders say a loud \u2018No\u2019 to oppression, victimization. People cannot just wait to be killed without raising a finger. No man-made law can forbid you from protecting your life; from defending yourself, your family and your property.\n\nGet yourself a gun! It is official. Protect your right to life. It is a cardinal right in the UN Charter of Rights. Remove the chains: remove the shackles and set yourself free!.\n\nMatawalle\u2019s name would be written in gold when Posterity beckons.\n\nCopyright: Tola [email protected]",

Vitus Vaishima Borogo, who was killed by terrorists on his farm in Kaduna State.\n\nLate Bogoro was killed on June 25, 2022 while his brother, C.Y. Borogo, was kidnapped by the attackers.\n\nThe Priests of the Kaduna Archdiocese led a peaceful protest after the funeral mass of the slain priest with some of them carrying placards with inscriptions like; \u2018We Are Priest and Not Terrorists\u2019, \u2018Government Should Secure Nigerians\u2019, \u2018Anyone Who Killed Lost His/Her Right To Life\u2019, \u2018Justice Must Be Served\u2019, \u2018Do We Still Have A Government?\u2019, and many others.\n\nSpeaking at the funeral, the Catholic Archbishop of Kaduna, Most Rev Matthew Man-Oso Ndagoso, disclosed that Nigerians are prisoners in their own country because of persistent attacks and killings.\n\nHe added that Nigerians were traumatised and at the stage of losing hope, lamenting that some Nigerians have no reason to live again because of the way things are going on in the country.\n\n\u201cI feel devastated, it is so painful that within one year I have buried three priests who died in the hands of these bandits. The most painful one was late Fr. Aketeh whose burial took place last three weeks without his corpse.\n\n\u201cOver my 60 years of age we have not seen it this bad as it is now, even during the civil war, it was not bad as it is now. Something is wrong with leadership of this country, we live in confusion in this country.\n\n\u201cWe no longer have tears in our eyes because the source of our tears have dried up because of constant crying. We have also lost our voices because when you talk nobody listens, you cry nobody hears your cry, but we will not lose hope, one day God will wipe our tears,\u201d he said.\n\nNdagoso advised that government should recruit young people who are willing to safeguard the country, adding that there were so many millions of young men who are willing to defend their land.\n\nHe further said, \u201cany politician who cannot secure Nigerians should not contest for any political position. It is better the person withdraw from the race.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the vice chairman of the Indigenous Priests of Kaduna, Rev. Fr. Joseph Gandu, called on the government to secure lives and property of Nigerians, maintaining that it is the government\u2019s social responsibility.\n\nHe noted that nobody has any right to kill another person, adding that human beings are major assets of the country before any other asset.",

Look at how they have been killing our comrades these days in the Southern part,\u201d the leader of the group said in the video.\n\n\u201cDrivers are stopped, ejected from their vehicles and shot, a Muslim woman with her four children were stopped and killed, and then it was reported as unknown gunmen, this is lie.\n\n\u201cThe organization of IPOB has been supported to kill Muslims, then Muslims, who is yours?

Many people were in the attack and some of those abducted have yet to regain their freedom.\n\nAccording to the group, its main aim is to protect Islam and Muslims who have been cheated and oppressed, adding that a man called Abu Barra is not its leader.",

          "text": "Former governor of Ekiti State Ayo Fayose has outlined why he thinks Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers State, will never back Atiku Abubakar, the PDP candidate for president (PDP).\n\nAccording to Premium Times, Mr. Ayo Fayose declared that after President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s second term expires in 2023, leadership must be transferred to the southern region of Nigeria.\n\nIn addition, the former governor recalled how Mr. Atiku \u201cpromised\u201d to name Mr. Wike, the governor of Rivers State, as his running mate once he was named the winner of the PDP presidential primary contest.\n\nAccording to the former Ekiti governor, Mr. Atiku failed to fulfill his promise to Mr. Wike when he settled for the Delta State governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, as his running mate.\n\n\u201cWike never said he wanted to be VP, but when Atiku visited him, he was the one who said, \u2018I want you to be my VP\u2019. He said that to Wike. If that then changes, is Wike not supposed to be told? Is he not supposed to know?\u201d\n\nHe recalled that Mr. Atiku had ignored the recommendation of a committee set up by the opposition party to pick his running mate.\n\n\u201cPDP set up a committee to recommend a running mate for the candidate and the committee voted and picked Wike, but they didn\u2019t comply with the recommendation of the committee.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the party is now a one-man show, we will show them that we can resist it. We are with Wike 100 percent.\n\n\u201cWhen they need Wike\u2019s money and Wike\u2019s support, they will say, \u2018Wike is good enough. Wike has been injured, but we will remain with him. Whatever he does is what we would do; wherever he asks us to go is where we will go.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what would happen should Mr. Wike ask them to support Mr. Atiku, the former governor said: \u201cWike will never say we should support Atiku.\n\n\u201cWike cannot come out to say he is supporting Atiku. I dare him to say so; because he knows that whatever he says will haunt him forever. If Wike supports Atiku, we will abandon him.\u201d\n\nAtiku\u2019s response\n\nContacted for a response, Paul Ibe, Mr. Atiku\u2019s spokesperson, said his principal and the party will continue to appeal to aggrieved persons within their fold to embrace dialogue.\n\n\u201cBecause the bigger challenge is winning the election, kicking out the APC, and stopping them from the many years of impoverishing our people,\u201d said Mr. Ibe.\n\n\u201cIt is normal for our people to be aggrieved but the PDP has a way of resolving issues like this and that will be done and we all shall be happy.\u201d\n\n\u2018Power to the south\u2019\n\nOn whether the plan is now to technically support the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Bola Tinubu, or his counterpart in the Labour Party, Peter Obi, Mr. Fayose said: \u201cThis is not about Bola Tinubu or Obi, but this is about our belief that power must come to the south and it is a struggle we must actualize.\n\nMr. Fayose further explained that \u201cwhen the June 12 election was canceled, the presidency was zoned to the southwest to pacify the southwest region.\n\n\u201cWhen former President Goodluck Jonathan was over staying, it was believed that he was already using the northern slot. So, he was opposed and a northern candidate was installed through the APC.\n\n\u201cThis time, it is the turn of the south because Buhari has spent eight years. Why will PDP be insisting that it must again be the turn of the north.\u201d\n\nMr. Fayose also stated that he does not care if his actions are perceived as anti-party activity.\n\n\u201c What I am saying is, it is the turn of the South, and if they want to expel me, to hell with them. I am not taking money from anyone to belong to this party.\n\n\u201cIf they want to rock this boat, we will help them to rock it.\u201d",

          "title": "Military kills 82 terrorists in Zamfara airstrikes, 2 arrested in Kwara",
          "text": "The Defence Headquarters (DHQ) Thursday said air interdiction by the Air Component of Operation HADARIN DAJI killed no fewer than 82 terrorists while many others sustained various degree of injuries at Kofar Danya Village in Bukkuyum local government area of Zamfara state.\n\nThe military high command also said 26 oil thieves were arrested by troops of Operation DAKATAR DA BARAWO and OCTOPUS GRIP in the Niger Delta region of the country.\n\nDirector Defence Media Operations Maj.-Gen Benard Onyeuko stated this while briefing journalists on the successes recorded by various military operations in the country from 16 to 30 June 2022.\n\n\u201cFollowing report about the planned attack on Kofar Danya Village, the air component mobilized to the location and sighted over One Hundred and Fifty (150) terrorists converged under a thick vegetation.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, Nigerian Air Force platforms engaged the terrorists with heavy bombardment which destroyed the terrorists\u2019 concentration camp. Consequently, credible feedback from the locals around Kofar Danya disclosed that over Eighty Two (82) of the terrorists suffered heavy casualties as many of them were neutralized while other sustained various degree of injuries,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further on operations in the South-South Zone, Onyeuko said the military recovered stolen crude, 68 wooden boats and 9 speed boats amongst other equipment from economic saboteurs.\n\n\u201cA total of three million and seventy-four thousand (3,074,000) litres of Automotive Gas Oil, three million eight hundred and then thousand (3,810,000) litres of crude oil, fourteen thousand (14,000) litres of Premium Motor Spirit and Fourteen Thousand (14,000) litres of Dual Purpose Kerosine was discovered,\u201d he said.\n\nBandits kill attack Niger mining site\n\nAnd in a related development, terrorists reportedly killed 30 people including security personnel and villagers at the Ajata-Aboki mining site in Gurmana ward of Shiroro local government area of Niger state.\n\nThe terrorists were said to have invaded the mining site Wednesday evening during which several people were also abducted.\n\nCo-convener Concerned Shiroro Youths of Niger state Sani Abubakar Yusuf Kokki said this in a statement Thursday in Minna.\n\nHe said the casualties included mobile police men, soldiers and villagers working in the mining company.\n\nKokki said many others also sustained various degrees of multiple bullet injuries and taken to various medical facilities for treatment.\n\nKokki also said scores of the bandits were also neutralised as security personnel fought back to repel the attack.\n\n\u201cOn getting the wind of the ugly development, the Nigerian Army stationed at a nearby Erena swung into action by engaging them in fire for fire. Unfortunately and sadly, as at yesterday, officers were gunned down while many others have been wounded through multiple gunshots,\u201d the statement added.\n\nTop army officers as victims\n\nAt the IBB Specialist Hospital Minna, some of those who spoke to Blueprint said over 40 bodies were deposited at the morgue.\n\nAn eyewitness said \u201cthe bodies of the slain persons were mostly soldiers brought in this morning at about 11am with a truck.\u201d\n\nHe said the military personnel have been pouring in more retrieved bodies of their dead colleagues at intervals till 5pm, Thursday.\n\nIt was learnt that a Colonel of the Nigerian Army was among those wounded and on admission at the hospital, while a Major and Captain were among the gallant officers who lost their lives.\n\nHowever, a medical doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 20 bodies were at the morgue with five wounded soldiers receiving treatment at the emergency ward.\n\nGov directs manhunt\n\nConfirming the development, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello directed a manhunt for the remaining terrorists who attacked the mining site.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the governor condemned the attacks, assuring the terrorists would be brought to justice.\n\n\u201cThis is really disturbing especially as the state has been relatively peaceful with only pockets of attacks being recorded as compared to some time past.\n\n\u201cIt really saddened my heart to hear about this. It is even more worrisome to know that the lives of security personnel were involved and expatriates were also among those kidnapped,\u201d he said.\n\nHe commiserated with heads of the various security agencies that were part of the joint security operatives in the state for the loss of their personnel while ensuring the people\u2019s safety.\n\nThe governor also sympathized with the families of the slain security agents, assuring them that the sacrifices of their loved ones would not go in vain and commended the bravery of those who engaged the terrorists, causing them to record casualties also.\n\nBello appealed to the security personnel not to be dampened by the incident on their colleagues encouraging them to remain committed to discharging their duties and ensure the safe return of the four Chinese nationals and an unspecified number of workers kidnapped at the mining site.\n\nHe also prayed for the safe return of those kidnapped.\n\nNSCDC in Kwara\n\nIn another development, the Kwara state command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) Thursday paraded two suspected terrorists arrested near a gold mining site in the state.\n\nThe command also recovered dangerous arms in their possession.\n\nAddressing journalists during the parade, the command\u2019s Public Relations Officer (PRO), Olasunkanmi Ayeni, said the suspects were arrested at a location close to gold mining site at Agbede village in Moro local government area of the state with locally made pistol and rifle, among other dangerous weapons.\n\nThe corps\u2019 image maker, who identified the suspects as Abdulahi Alhaji, 19-year-old and 39-year-old John Ihenka, said the suspects were capable of using the arms in their possession to perpetuate different kinds of crime in the society.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are all aware of the security situation and banditry around us. This command has been working so much not to allow these bandits to infiltrate our state. The Corps Tactical Unit (CTU) of our command was able to apprehend these two suspects, namely Abdullahi Alhaji, 19 years old from Kaduna state and John Ihenka, 39 years old.\n\n\u201cAlhaji was trying to get cartridge for the local pistol he said he had bought for N8,000 and fortunately for Nigerians he asked question from the wrong person. From this process, we were able to trail him, leading to his arrest.\n\n\u201cIt was the arrest of Alhaji that led to that of John, who he said, sold the local pistol to him. On getting to John\u2019s place, the officers in intelligence unit were able to get this rifle from him and other dangerous weapons.\n\n\u201cWe know that no one has the right to own local pistol or local rifle. The highest is the one which is licensed from Nigeria Police. Keeping this with them, one should understand what they may be using it for. We implore members of the public to always furnish us with useful and timely information so that we can all live in peace and secured environment.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with journalists in an interview, the suspect, Abdullahi Alhaji, said he bought the gun to defend himself in his cattle business.\n\nIhenka, who confirmed he sold the locally made pistol to Alhaji, said he is a security guard in a gold mining company.\n\n\u201cThey already know that I\u2019m using it (gun) in the company and they said this gun is not good for security I should go and drop it. I then dropped it. I had a leg pain problem. I sold the local pistol to treat myself. I took permission from the company that I\u2019m going to plant in my farm. I bought chemical for the farm from where I was called and asked if I was the one who sold the local pistol to the suspect and I said yes.\n\n\u201cThe company knows that I have the gun. I\u2019m not a kidnapper. I\u2019m a security man in gold mining company. The reason why the suspect said I should sell the pistol to him is because he has cow and he is sleeping in the bush. That is why I sold it to him. I made a mistake for selling the gun to him. I don\u2019t have more guns to sell,\u201d said the suspect.\n\nMatawalle vindicated our position \u2013 CNG\n\nMeanwhile, the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) has commended Zamfara state Governor Muhammad Bello Matawalle for authorising the use of firearms by citizens of the state in protecting themselves against attacks by bandits.\n\nIn a statement made available to Blueprint in Abuja, Thursday, CNG Director Strategic Communication Samaila Musa, said the coalition had been vindicated at Matawalle\u2019s directive.\n\nIt said no matter how belated, the governor\u2019s decision \u201cis aimed at involving and directly engaging communities in protecting, preserving, and defending their lives and livelihoods against marauding terrorist-bandits that are terrorising and pillaging our communities with little or no requited force.\u201d\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) views the recent policy for authorisation for use of firearms by citizens of Zamfara State for self-defence by Governor Muhammad Bello Matawalle with mixed interest.\n\n\u201cWe note that the effort by the Zamfara State Government is aimed at involving and directly engaging communities in protecting, preserving, and defending their lives and livelihoods against marauding terrorist-bandits that are terrorising and pillaging our communities with little or no requited force.\n\n\u201cWhile CNG is delighted that some of its positions are being recognised and accepted in tackling the security challenge in the North; it is however frowning at certain efforts that try to maintain the status quo without genuine commitment to ending the bloodbath across the North.\n\n\u201cCNG wishes to remind Nigerians that it has been advocating community mobilisation, engagement and participation in addressing the insecurity in the northern Nigeria in particular and the country as a whole.\n\n\u201cWe therefore commend Governor Matawalle for recognising this approach although belatedly. We have equally keenly observed reactions from individuals and groups across the country with a particular concern with the position of Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) who faulted the authorisation for self-defence. We reject his rejection of self-defence! Self-preservation and defence are natural, inalienable and fundamental that cannot be denied.\n\n\u201cWe wish to remind the CDS that even his principal, Minister of Defence, has once called for self-defence amidst incessant killings by terrorists in Nigeria. The CDS himself told Nigerians that many personnel of the armed forces were facing court-martial for conniving with the kidnappers, bandits, terrorists and other criminals.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

This is complemented by the deployment of the Human Resource Module of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System, IPPIS, the Federal Civil Service Strategy Implementation Plan and the reinforcement of the Innovation Division in all Ministries, Departments and Agencies, MDAs.\n\n\u201cLEAD-P and SMART-P trainings have also been consistently carried out to realise this laudable vision of the HCSF.\n\n\u201cMMSD is among the first set of MDAs to receive these facilities and efforts are on to ensure that we blaze a trail in the service-wide project of work-process automation. We have achieved a major improvement in the ACTU rating from about 26.5% to 74.5% compliance and have also surpassed our revenue projections,\u201d Akinlade said.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary disclosed that efforts had also been made within the ministry\u2019s limits of available resources to provide facilities that would enhance productivity and welfare of Staff, adding that in that regard, \u201cwe now have a clinic that can provide basic health services to all staff to ensure that our health is given the priority that it deserves\u201d.\n\nShe said many may be unaware that within the few months of operation of the clinic, health crises had been averted for some staff just through routine check by the medical team in the clinic.\n\n\u201cAlso, we can easily see the massive deployment of ICT infrastructures within office complex aimed at achieving the full automation of the work processes in the ministry,\u201d she added.\n\nCongratulating the members of management and staff of the ministry on week-long activities being commemorated, Akinlade craved their indulgence over the delay in the commemoration which was being held this week instead of last week that was officially set aside to mark the event, adding that it was due to exigencies of duty.\n\n\u201cSince 1999 when the African Union, AU, set aside 23rd June, as the \u201cAfrica Public Service Day, APSD, Nigeria has consistently\n\ncommemorated the day annually with series of activities and we are grateful to God for the opportunity to be part of this year\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cIn her characteristic style of celebrating civil servants, the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation approved a full package of week-long activities for this year including Jumat and Church Services, Keep-fit/aerobics session, a Town-hall Meeting and Special Awards to selected officers for outstanding performance,\u201d she continued.\n\nShe told the workers that the occasion also affords the opportunity to specially acknowledge members of staff that have distinguished themselves through outstanding performance.\n\nSpeaking further, she said, \u201cAs usual, one person was nominated from each department out of which three were selected and forwarded to OHCSF. I want to therefore congratulate all the recipients of this year\u2019s award and appreciate them for their diligence.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly congratulate Engr. Umar Adamu Tsoho who was honoured with the \u201cPresidential Public Service Award\u201d by the OHCSF for outstanding service. He made it to the top ten among the nomination from all the MDAs. We are proud of you and we thank you for bringing honour to this Ministry.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the HCSF, I want to congratulate and specially thank all the retiring staff for the year 2022. It is indeed a noble achievement to successfully exit the Federal Civil Service through retirement. It is the beginning of new life for you and we wish you good health of mind and body as well as a fulfilling life after retirement from public service.\u201d\n\nAlso Member of staff and retirees of MMSD were rewarded with gift items and plaques for the outstanding dedication to duty.",

          "text": "The former Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu on Thursday appeared before Uxbridge Magistrate\u2019s Court in London, facing charges under Britain\u2019s Modern Slavery Act.\n\nEkweremadu\u2019s case, a source told Channels Television, was fast-tracked. He was in good shape, wore a grey tracksuit, and spoke twice during his appearance to confirm his name and date of birth.\n\nHis wife Beatrice, who in her defence, asked the court to allow her to appear by his side because she has not seen him since the hearing last Thursday, was not granted such a request.\n\nThe prosecutor claims that David Ukpo, who alleged that he was coerced to donate his kidney to the Senator\u2019s daughter, is 15 years. According to court, David was allegedly picked up off the street in Lagos by a criminal gang some months ago with the intention of organ harvesting.\n\nEkweremadu was remanded in custody as the court argued that he is an influential person, a flight risk and the case involves a child and modern slavery.\n\nThe case has been adjourned to July 7 at Westminster Magistrate Court to enable the UK Attorney General, Suella Braverman, to determine whether the case will be tried in the country or Nigeria.\n\nA large delegation from the Nigeria High Commission was also present in the public gallery alongside the Senator\u2019s two adult children.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Senate had said it was sending a delegation to visit Ekweremadu and his wife.\n\nSenate President Ahmad Lawan said this after a closed-door session of the lawmakers in Abuja. He explained that members of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs will be traveling to the UK soon.\n\nREAD ALSO: Again, Lawyer Malcolm Omirhobo Appears In Lagos Court\n\n\u201cThere will be a delegation to London to see Senator Ike Ekweremadu and his wife. A delegation from the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Senate will leave in the next two days for London for that purpose,\u201d Lawan said.\n\n\u201cI want to urge all federal government institutions that can do anything to ensure that justice prevails in this case, that they do so.\u201d\n\nHe also said the Nigerian High Commission has engaged the services of lawyers in the UK to defend Senator Ekweremadu.\n\n\u201cI had a personal engagement with our Nigerian High Commissioner to Britain, Alhaji Isola Sarafa, who has done so well to establish contact with our colleague, who has been able to get his team to be in the court at Uxbridge where Ekweremadu was taken to,\u201d Lawan added\n\n\u201cThe high Commission has also been able to provide some consular services that include the engagement of some lawyers who will defend our colleague.\n\n\u201cWe commend them for giving attention to the issue at stake. Equally, the Nigeria Foreign Affairs Minister has been engaged here, so that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs takes steps to provide diplomatic support for our colleague.\n\n\u201cBecause this issue is already in court, we have limited opportunity to discuss beyond what we have done so far.\n\n\u201cBut I want to ensure the family of our colleague, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, and Nigerians, that the Senate will continue to engage with our ministry of foreign affairs as well as our high commission in London. The High Commission has done so much but we still expect that it will continue to provide any other further consular services.\u201d",

          "text": "Russian troops have abandoned their positions on a captured Ukrainian island, a major setback to their invasion effort that weakens their blockade of Ukraine\u2019s ports, defence officials said on Thursday.\n\nThe news from the Black Sea came as NATO leaders wrapped up their summit in Madrid, with US President Joe Biden announcing $800 million in new weapons to help Ukraine fight off Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\n\u201cWe are going to stick with Ukraine, and all of the alliance are going to stick with Ukraine, as long as it takes to make sure they are not defeated by Russia,\u201d he said.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, compared the new diplomatic low to the return of the Cold War, telling reporters: \u201cAs far as an Iron Curtain is concerned, essentially it is already descending\u2026 The process has begun.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: If Putin Was A Woman, There Would Be No Ukraine War \u2013 Boris Johnson\n\nBut there may be a possible opening: Indonesia\u2019s President Joko Widodo said, after meeting Putin in Moscow, that he had given the Russian leader a message from their Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nSnake Island became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance in the first days of the war, when the rocky outcrop\u2019s defenders told a Russian warship that called on them to surrender to \u201cgo f*ck yourself\u201d, an incident that spurred a defiant meme.\n\nIt was also a strategic target, sitting aside shipping lanes near Ukraine\u2019s port of Odessa. Russia had attempted to install missile and air defence batteries while under fire from drones.\n\nNow, however, Ukraine has begun to receive longer range missiles and artillery, and the Russian position on Snake Island seems to have become untenable.\n\n\u2018Strategically important\u2019\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned the Russian president that any eventual peace deal would be on Ukraine\u2019s terms.\n\n\u201cIn the end, it will prove impossible for Putin to hold down a country that will not accept his rule,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen what Ukraine can do to drive the Russians back. We\u2019ve seen what they did around Kyiv and Kharkiv, now on Snake Island.\u201d\n\nThe Russian defence ministry statement described the retreat as \u201ca gesture of goodwill\u201d meant to demonstrate that Moscow will not interfere with UN efforts to organise protected grain exports from Ukraine.\n\nBut Kyiv claimed it as a win.\n\n\u201cThey always downplay their defeats this way,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cI thank the defenders of Odessa region who took maximum measures to liberate a strategically important part of our territory,\u201d Valeriy Zaluzhny, the Ukraine military\u2019s commander-in-chief, said on Telegram.\n\nIn peacetime, Ukraine is a major agricultural exporter, but Russia\u2019s invasion has damaged farmland and seen Ukraine\u2019s ports seized, razed or blockaded \u2014 threatening grain importers in Africa with famine.\n\nWestern powers have accused Putin of using the trapped harvest as a weapon to increase pressure on the international community, and Russia has been accused of stealing grain.\n\n\u2018Direct threat\u2019\n\nOn Thursday, a ship carrying 7,000 tonnes of grain sailed from Ukraine\u2019s occupied port of Berdyansk, said the regional leader appointed by the Russian occupation forces.\n\nEvgeny Balitsky, the head of the pro-Moscow administration, said Russia\u2019s Black Sea ships \u201care ensuring the security\u201d of the journey, adding that the port had been de-mined.\n\nSeparately, the Russian defence ministry said its forces are holding more than 6,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war who have been captured since the February 24 invasion.\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine has dominated the NATO summit in Madrid, where the leaders said Russia \u201cis the most significant and direct threat to allies\u2019 security and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area\u201d.\n\nThis came as NATO officially invited Sweden and Finland to join the alliance, and Biden announced new deployments of US troops, ships and planes to Europe.\n\nBiden said the US move was exactly what Putin \u201cdidn\u2019t want\u201d \u2014 and Moscow, facing fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces equipped with Western weapons, reacted with predictable fury.\n\nPutin on Wednesday accused the alliance of seeking to assert its \u201csupremacy\u201d, telling journalists in the Turkmenistan capital of Ashgabat that Ukraine and its people are \u201ca means\u201d for NATO to \u201cdefend their own interests.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe NATO countries\u2019 leaders wish to\u2026 assert their supremacy, their imperial ambitions,\u201d Putin added.\n\n\u2018As long as it takes\u2019\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed Putin\u2019s comments as \u201cridiculous\u201d and said the Russian leader \u201chas made imperialism the goal of his politics\u201d.\n\nNATO leaders have funnelled billions of dollars of arms to Ukraine and faced a renewed appeal from Zelensky for more long-range artillery.\n\n\u201cUkraine can count on us for as long as it takes,\u201d NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg told the summit, as he announced a new strategic overview that focuses on the Moscow threat.\n\nThe document, updated for the first time since 2010, warned the alliance \u201ccannot discount the possibility\u201d of an attack on its members.\n\nRussian missiles continued to rain down on cities across Ukraine.\n\nIn the southern city of Mykolaiv, rescuers found the bodies of seven slain civilians in the rubble of a destroyed building, emergency services said.\n\nThe city of Lysychansk in the eastern Donbas region \u2014 the current focus of Russia\u2019s offensive \u2014 is also facing sustained bombardment.\n\nThe situation in Lysychansk \u2014 the last major city the Russians need to take over in the Lugansk region \u2014 was \u201cextremely difficult\u201d with relentless shelling making it impossible to evacuate civilians, regional governor Sergiy Gaiday said.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of shelling\u2026 The Russian army is approaching from different directions,\u201d he said in a video posted on Telegram.\n\nRussia\u2019s forces remain at the outskirts of the city where there is currently no street fighting, he said.\n\nGaiday dismissed claims by pro-Russian separatists fighting alongside Moscow\u2019s forces who claim to control half of the city situated across the river from neighbouring Severodonetsk, which was captured by the Russian army last week.\n\nThe United Nations humanitarian coordinator in Ukraine said on Thursday 16 million people in Ukraine were in need of humanitarian aid.\n\n\u2018Offensive\u2019 remarks\n\nAlso on Thursday, Russia summoned Britain\u2019s ambassador to Moscow to protest at Johnson\u2019s \u201coffensive\u201d remarks about Putin.\n\nJohnson had said on Tuesday that Putin would not have started the war in Ukraine if he was a woman and said the military operation was \u201ca perfect example of toxic masculinity\u201d.\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry said: \u201cIn polite society, it is customary to apologise for remarks of this kind.\u201d\n\nAFP",

          "text": "Ketanji Brown Jackson has been sworn in to the Supreme Court, shattering a glass ceiling as the first Black woman on the nation\u2019s highest court.\n\nThe 51-year-old Jackson is the court\u2019s 116th justice and she took the place Thursday of the justice she once worked for. Justice Stephen Breyer\u2019s retirement took effect at noon.\n\nMoments later, joined by her family, Jackson recited the two oaths required of Supreme Court justices, one administered by Breyer and the other by Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Nearly three months after she won confirmation to the Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson will be sworn in as the court\u2019s 116th justice on Thursday.\n\nJackson, 51, will be sworn in just as the man she is replacing, Justice Stephen Breyer, retires.\n\nThe switch takes place at noon, the moment Breyer said in a letter to President Joe Biden that his retirement will take effect after nearly 28 years on the nation\u2019s highest court. In a ceremony streamed live on the court\u2019s website. Jackson will recite two oaths required of Supreme Court justices, one administered by Breyer and the other by Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nJackson, a federal judge since 2013, will be the first Black woman to serve as a justice. She will be joining three women, Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Amy Coney Barrett \u2014 the first time four women will serve together on the nine-member court.\n\nBiden nominated Jackson in February, a month after Breyer, 83, announced he would retire at the end of the court\u2019s term, assuming his successor had been confirmed. Breyer\u2019s earlier-than-usual announcement and the condition he attached was a recognition of the Democrats\u2019 tenuous hold on the Senate in an era of hyper-partisanship, especially surrounding federal judgeships.\n\nThe Senate confirmed Jackson\u2019s nomination in early April, by a 53-47 mostly party-line vote that included support from three Republicans.\n\nShe has been in a sort of judicial limbo ever since, remaining a judge on the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., but not hearing any cases. Biden elevated her to that court from the district judgeship to which she was appointed by President Barack Obama.\n\nJackson will be able to begin work immediately, but the court will have just finished the bulk of its work until the fall, apart from emergency appeals that occasionally arise. That will give her time to settle in and familiarize herself with the roughly two dozen cases the court already has agreed to hear starting in October as well as hundreds of appeals that will pile up over the summer.\n\nThe court issued final opinions earlier Thursday after a momentous and rancorous term that included overturning Roe v. Wade\u2019s guarantee of the right to an abortion. One of Thursday\u2019s decisions limited how the Environmental Protection Agency can use the nation\u2019s main anti-air pollution law to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, a blow to the fight against climate change.",
