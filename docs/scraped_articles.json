          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nA new study by the North American Menopause Society has suggested that dancing could help lower cholesterol levels, improve fitness and self-esteem in postmenopausal women.\n\nAccording to the study, women often struggle with managing their weight and other health risk factors, such as high cholesterol, once they transition through menopause.\n\nExperts say women are considered to be postmenopausal when they have not had their period for an entire year.\n\nBut as a result of several factors, including a lower level of estrogen, postmenopausal women are at increased risk of some health conditions, such as osteoporosis and heart disease, says an online portal, WebMD.\n\nPublished in ScienceDaily, the study authors said after menopause, women are more likely to experience weight gain, overall/central body adiposity increases, and metabolic disturbances, such as increases in triglycerides and bad cholesterol.\n\nTogether, they say, these changes ultimately increase cardiovascular risk.\n\n\u201cAround this same time, women often are less physically active, which translates into reductions in lean mass and an increased risk of falls and fractures.\n\n\u201cAs a result of all these changes, postmenopausal women often suffer from decreased self-image and self-esteem, which are directly related to overall mental health.\n\n\u201cPhysical activity has been shown to minimize some of the many health problems associated with menopause. The effect of dancing, specifically, has already been investigated with regard to how it improves body composition and functional fitness.\n\n\u201cFew studies, however, have investigated the effects of dance on body image, self-esteem, and physical fitness together in postmenopausal women,\u201d the authors said.\n\nAccording to them, this new study was designed to analyze the effects of dance practice on body composition, metabolic profile, functional fitness, and self-image/self-esteem in postmenopausal women.\n\n\u201cAlthough the sample size was small, the study suggested some credible benefits of a three-times-weekly dance regimen in improving not only the lipid profile and functional fitness of postmenopausal women but also self-image and self-esteem\u201d they added.\n\nMedical Director of North American Menopause Society, Dr. Stephanie Faubion says dance therapy is seen as an attractive option because it is a pleasant activity with low associated costs and low risk of injury for its practitioners.\n\nFaubion noted that additional confirmed benefits of regular dancing include improvement in balance, postural control, gait, strength, and overall physical performance.\n\nAll of these benefits, the medical director stated may contribute to a woman\u2019s ability to maintain an independent, high-quality lifestyle throughout her lifespan.\n\n\u201cThis study highlights the feasibility of a simple intervention, such as a dance class three times weekly, for improving not only fitness and metabolic profile but also self-image and self-esteem in postmenopausal women.\n\n\u201cIn addition to these benefits, women also probably enjoyed a sense of comradery from the shared experience of learning something new,\u201d Faubion said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

People should come out to vote and know that their security is guaranteed.\u201d\n\nOlasehinde urged both candidates to sign a Memorandum of Understanding, MoU, assuring the commission of a peaceful election come Saturday.\n\nResponding, the PDP candidate for Ward F, Agege LG, Mr. Sakiru Akinwande said that he was on ground in all the 43 polling units to win the election.\n\nAkinwande advised the commission to take the matter of security very seriously to prevent loss of lives.\n\n\u201cI will only beg LASIEC, on behalf of the electorate, to please make sure they secure the lives of the electorate, the electoral officers and the community.\n\nREAD ALSO: APC sweeps Lagos council polls as results trickle in\n\n\u201cI am committed to peace and we have never defaulted in any peace agreement we signed before in history.\n\n\u201cWe have always comported ourselves with our supporters. We are the party people want. People want us, and we are in a victorious mood,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, the APC candidate, Mr. Yusuf Abolore who commended LASIEC for the stakeholders\u2019 meeting, said that the forum would help engender peace at the poll.\n\n\u201cWe should not take politics as a do-or-die affair. The PDP candidate is my younger brother. It is just a game; we cannot hurt each other.\n\n\u201cElections will come and go, our family bond and community will still remain. We are one and we will still continue to be one,\u201d he added.\n\nIt would be recalled that the last local government election in Agege, ward F was tied between PDP and the APC and LASIEC is empowered by its constitution to conduct a rerun election.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Yusuf Abubakar took control of the Central Zone, Sabo-Kente and other stakeholders in the Southern Zone.\n\n\n\nTwo former acting governors, Alhaji Sani Danladi and Alhaji Garba Umar took control of the party in the Northern Zone through consensus agreement by majority of the stakeholders.",

          "text": "By Omeiza Ajayi, Abuja\n\nThe Yoruba Appraisal Forum YAF has petitioned the United Nations, its five permanent members, the European Union EU, the African Union AU and other powerful countries across the world over a plan by the umbrella body of Yoruba self-determination groups, Ilana Omo Oodua, to present a petition against the Nigerian government at the 76th General Assembly of the UN.\n\nYAF, which in the petition urged the UN and the five Super Power countries to bar Ilana Omo Oodua and its allies from attending the UNGA to present its petition against the Federal Government of Nigeria, stated that \u201cthe ultimate objective of this plan by the group is to achieve nothing salutary or beneficial to the people of Nigeria but to further their evil design to undermine and bring down the country and the incumbent administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, out of sheer malice over the forthcoming 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nThe YAF petition signed by its National Coordinator, Adeshina Animashaun, and made available to Vanguard in Abuja, accused Ilana Omo Oodua of funding \u201cthe violent activities of the self-styled Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Igboho, currently undergoing trial in the Benin Republic for gun-running following his recent arrest at that country\u2019s airport while attempting to flee.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Forum, Ilana Omo Oodua\u2019s endorsement of the recent petition by the Nigerian Indigenous Nationalities Alliance for Self-Determination (NINAS) urging the Nigerian Government to conduct a referendum, is only part of the strategy by the group to legitimise its plan for the violent dissolution of the Nigerian Federation.\n\nIt accused Ilana Omo Oodua and its allies of stockpiling arms and ammunition for its alleged plan to eventually confront the Federal Government in its bid to achieve its \u201cevil objective\u201d of breaking up the Nigerian state under the guise of fighting for an independent Yoruba Nation.\n\nThe Prof Banji-Akintoye-led Ilana Omo Oodua had recently announced its plan to attend the 76th UNGA scheduled for September to present a petition to the global organisation over its demand for a separate and independent Yoruba Nation.\n\nThe Forum alleged that Ilana Omo Oodua \u201cis merely using Igboho to destabilise Nigeria through his nefarious, unpatriotic and violent agitation for an independent Yoruba nation.\u201d\n\nIt further accused the Ilana Omo Oodua of getting \u201cforeign funding from some ignorant Nigerians in the Diaspora to fund its plots to \u201cdestabilise the current government and the Nigerian nation and eventually truncate the country\u2019s democracy.\u201d\n\nYAF also expressed its displeasure with Ilana Omo Oodua and its allies for constituting \u201cthemselves into unrepentant critics of the current government through their frequent acerbic and destructive outbursts and attacks against the government, coupled with the violence they unleash on innocent Nigerian citizens, which have become their pastime.\u201d\n\nIt added; \u201cTheir obsession to pull down the current government has reached a stage where they have reduced themselves to playing the ignoble role of being the coordinator of all subversive activities against the Nigerian nation and the present administration. Their stock-in-trade is offering unsolicited and unconstructive but destructive criticisms and unleashing violence dressed in the garb of agitation for a separate Yoruba Nation.\u201d\n\nYAF\u2019s petition to the UN further partly read, \u201cAs we stated recently, we are aware that this group (Ilana Omo Oodua) and individuals behind the recent violence in different parts of the South-West of Nigeria have a more sinister objective of destabilising the Nigerian nation for the selfish political end of those bankrolling them. They are only merely covering up their agenda with the cloak of fighting for Yoruba freedom and self-determination. Their plan now is to take their self-imposed agitation for independence and self-determination to the next level, which would involve outright widespread violence fashioned after what the IPOB/ESN are now doing in the South-East and South-South regions of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is very clear that the masterminds of this violence are bent on throwing Nigeria into total chaos to hasten the collapse of governments at both the state and federal levels to enable them to execute their evil plans for Nigeria, ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cThey are planning to take advantage of the current security challenges in the country to wreak further havoc, starting with the South-West and expecting to instigate reprisals against Southerners in the North of Nigeria with the ultimate objective of destabilising the country, just as their partner-in-crime, IPOB is currently doing in the South-East and South-South regions of this country.\u201d\n\nThe Forum also raised the alarm that Ilana Omo Oodua and its allies \u201chave begun to mobilise their members in the South-West for the execution of the next phase of their so-called agitation for Yoruba independence and self-determination by engaging in more violent protests and bloody confrontation with government and security agents, all in an attempt to raise tension and create the violent atmosphere in the South-West to enable them to declare non-Yoruba living in the South-West of Nigeria, especially those of the Igbo and Hausa/ Fulani extractions, persona non-grata.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Yahaya noted the existing synergy among the security agencies in the state and assured Governor Masari that the military would continue to work with other security agencies in the state to restore relative peace back to the state.\n\nHe also commended Governor Masari for providing support and logistics to the military formation in the state.\n\nIn his remark, Governor Masari noted that the banditry situation in the state is quite unpleasant with the daily reported severe attack witnessed in 10 of the most affected local government in the state.\n\nHowever, he said the situation has considerably improved when compared to last year.\n\n\u201cHere in Katsina, if we say we\u2019re very happy we are not honest.

We thank God definitely when we compared our situation six months even last year, we need to thank God that there is some progress in restoration of normalcy in our state.\u201d\n\nAs part of effort to reinstate normalcy in the state, Masari informed the COAS that the state has inaugurated the three tier security committee across the state to that effect.\n\n\u201cHere in Katsina, we have created three tiers security committees, from the community to the local, up to the state level, aimed at ensuring peace in our communities,\u201dMasari stated\n\nGovernor Masari equally solicited the support of the press in bringing banditry to an end in the state. He stressed that the media has a critical role to play in winning the war against banditry in the state and nation entirely. He also admonished them to avoid reporting in a way that would cause more trouble for the country.\n\n\u201cMedia has a critical role to play.

          "text": "An Islamic cleric, Professor Sabit Ariyo Olagoke, has advised the three tiers of government to integrate persons with disabilities in all areas of human endeavours.\n\nOlagoke, who spoke with journalists in Ibadan on Thursday, noted that the need to integrate them is necessary in order to reduce discrimination, marginalisation and oppression of persons with disabilities (PWDs) across the country.\n\nDAILY POST recalls that President Muhammadu Buhari had in January 2019, assented to the Discrimination Against Persons with disabilities (Prohibition) Act 2018. The law was aimed to end discrimination against persons with disabilities across the country.\n\nFindings by DAILY POST, however, revealed that the law is not yet effective.\n\nBut, Olagoke who is a former Dean, School of Engineering, Federal Polytechnic Ilaro, Ogun State, while speaking at Celebrities Plus Conference organised for persons with disabilities, insisted that the only way to end discrimination, marginalisation and oppression of persons with disabilities as provided for in the law is for the federal government led by President Muhamadu Buhari to integrate persons with disabilities in areas like education, health, economy and social activities.\n\nOlagoke while speaking at the event with the theme, \u201cTalent, creativity and disability-realities and solutions in Nigeria entertainment industry\u201d, advised other tiers of government (state and local), and other stakeholders to see persons with disabilities as part of the society.\n\nThe Founder/ Spiritual Head of Shafaudeen in Islam Worldwide, maintained that the major challenges facing PWDs in Nigeria is stigmatisation and marginalisation by the abled bodies.\n\nHe said that persons with disabilities are being abused on daily basis because they are not integrated into the society and due to the ineffectiveness of the disability law.\n\n\u201cThe major challenges is that is stigmatisation and marginalisation. The society is being sensitise on the need to integrate them and see them as part of the society. They are being abused, women, men among them are being abused on daily basis. They face more challenges more than abled bodies.\n\n\u201cThere is no special budget for PWDs and the major problem is that they are not intergrated into the society. Government should be able to plan for them. But, you cannot plan on the people that has no statistics. We do not know the number of PWDs in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cPWDs must be integrated into the society. They should have representation in politics, health, education etc. We are talking about inclusion society. There are a lot of them that have talents. They should be involved in intergrated. We should let the society know that they are also part of the society.\u201d\n\nThe convener of the conference, Mr. Yusuf Raheem Olatunji, while speaking with journalists noted that the event was organised in line with United Nations focus to eradicate poverty and promote social inclusion among persons with disabilities.\n\nOlatunji who doubles as National Assistant Secretary General of Joint National Association of Persons with Disabilities (JONAPWD), advised persons with disabilities to focus more on their talents rather than focusing on their disabilities.\n\n\u201cThis conference is aimed to promote inclusion. We put in together to hearnest the potentials of PWDs.\n\n\u201cWe want to encourage PWDs, we want to inspire them and encourage them that they should not look down on themselves.\n\n\u201cThey should focus more on their talents and potentials and not on the disabilities. It is in support of United Nations to eradicate poverty and promote inclusion. The gap between persons with disabilities and other who do not have disabilities is too wide.\u201d",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nThe crisis in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is not about to abate as the man in the eye of the storm and National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus, yesterday, fought back as he accused an unnamed \u201cFather Christmas\u201d of desperation to hijack the party.\n\nHe spoke amidst an emergency meeting of the National Working Committee (NWC) with aggrieved national officials. The officials, who are deputy national officers, had on Tuesday, served a 30-day resignation over alleged ill-treatment by the party leadership.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that at yesterday\u2019s meeting, the second within 24 hours, Secondus appealed to the deputy national officers to reconsider their decision to quit.\n\nA source privy to the discussion at meeting said Secondus told the aggrieved party officials that there was need for all members of the PDP executive to finish strong, especially as their tenure was coming to an end. The source noted that at the end of the meeting, the party said they would consult and get back to the NWC.\n\nDaily Sun equally gathered that in the aftermath of the notice of resignation by the seven national officials and call by the national youth leader, Sunday Udeh-Okoye, for the resignation of Secondus, PDP have been making frantic efforts to calm frayed nerves.\n\nIt was gathered that at a meeting attended by some members of the PDP NWC and Board of Trustees (BoT) on Tuesday night, in Abuja, all the officials, including those threatening to resign should return to their zones and consult with the stakeholders on the current situation in the party.\n\nHowever, the NWC said it had activated internal conflict resolution mechanism to ensure amicable resolution of all issues affecting the party.\n\nThe party in a statement by Kola Ologbondiyan said the party\u2019s NWC rose from a crucial meeting where it reviewed the state of the party, with a view to creating an atmosphere that would engender stability within the party.\n\nOlogbondiyan said against the backdrop, the NWC urged all PDP members to remain calm. He assured members that the PDP remained stable as the NWC was working to bring the party back to power in 2023.\n\nRegardless, Secondus, in a statement by his media aide, Ike Abonyi, alleged that a strong chieftain bent on hijacking the opposition party is unrelenting in the quest to dent his image.\n\nIn the statement entitled \u201cWho is after Secondus and Why is somebody in love of caretaker?\u201d the PDP chairman said he was aware that the said party chieftain was out to hijack the party for his inordinate ambition.\n\n\u201cAnswers to the above posers will help members of the public to decipher the recent disquiet in the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and why few months to National Convention of the party, somebody is routing for a Caretaker Committee to run the affairs of the party.\n\n\u201cThe media office of the National Chairman is privy to an intelligence that the strong party chieftain bent on hijacking the party structure for destruction is still on the lose with the main agenda of denting the image of Prince Uche Secondus the National Chairman.\n\n\u201cReports reaching this office shows clearly that this character is deploying all devious means to try and diminish the person and character of the National Chairman with a view to having his way of ultimately hijacking the structure for his disproportionately large ambition\u2026\n\n\u201cWhat continues to shock many party observers is the real reason behind the desperation of this man to get at the National Chairman and the quantum of public funds being expended to achieve this illicit goal few months to the National Convention.\n\n\u201cFew months to National Convention anybody who mean well for this party and who is a true democrat should respect the constitution of the party and approach issues dispassionately,\u201d the PDP chairman stated.\n\nMeanwhile, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, yesterday, said his recent trip to Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital had nothing to do with the plot to oust Secondus.\n\nHe was reacting to speculations that he was allegedly part of the plot to sack the party chairman.\n\nThe former vice president, who spoke through his media aide, Paul Ibe, told journalists in a telephone interview, that he is more interested in peace in the party.\n\n\u201cThe trip he made to Port Harcourt, he made a similar one to Delta. And he has more in the offing. Why will he promote peace and stability in the party and be behind moves to sack Secondus? It\u2019s ridiculous for anyone to talk about this.\n\n\u201cAtiku understands the Constitution of the PDP and what the party-stated about tenure for party leadership. So, he cannot be working against something that he understands and promotes.\n\n\u201cThat is not how democrats behave. Those are anti-democratic behaviour and that is not who he is. Whoever is saying this should know it is beer parlour talk and unnecessary mischief.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, former governor of Bayelsa, Senator Seriake Dickson admonished leaders of the PDP to convene an emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting to discuss way of stabilizing the party.\n\nDickson stated this when he met with Secondus at the PDP national secretariat.\n\n\u201cAs we are all aware, some officers of our party, resigned yesterday and we should thank them for their services but If their resignation is aimed at causing crisis in the party then we should all condemn it and those behind it.\u201d\n\nDickson also called on Secondus and the NWC to \u201cutilise their powers under the constitution to discipline erring members involved in the nefarious plot to destroy the party.\n\n\u201cPDP is bigger than any individual and should no longer tolerate people with inordinate ambitions to destroy the party which belongs to all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nInspite of that, a member of BoT, Senator Joy Emordi, yesterday formally defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nAlhaji Mamman Mohammed, Director-General, Press and Media of APC, announced this in a statement issued in Abuja.\n\nThe statement said the Chairman, APC Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and Governor of Yobe, Mai Mala Buni, received Emordi at a brief ceremony.\n\n\u201cBuni expressed delight with the decision taken by the board member to contribute to the unity of the country.\n\n\u201cThere is need for us to join hands for the political stability and national unity of our dear country,\u201d the statement said.\n\nBut an elder and chieftain of the party, Dr. Nnamdi Onochie, has pleaded with contending forces to bury the hatchet and close ranks to save the party.\n\nOnochie, a long-standing member of the main opposition PDP said unity, reconciliation and peaceful co-existence were needed at this point in time to save the party from implosion and destruction.\n\nHe argued that it would be a costly mistake for the party\u2019s chieftains to engage in bickering with one another with another general election drawing near.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

We are disturbed with this issue of banditry accompanied with kidnapping, raping of innocent women, armed robbery on our highways. I want technology to be properly deployed to bring this banditry activities under control.\n\n\u201cWe are not deceiving ourselves that we will eliminate criminality; it has never been done before, it cannot be done today rather can it be done tomorrow but we can bring it under control in such a way that it does not disturb the way of life of people as we are seeing today.\n\n\u201c10 out of 34 local governments in Katsina State are under severe bandits attacks daily. So, with that in mind, there is no way we can sleep. Our phones are permanently on to hear what is happening in local governments. Before breakfast, I am briefed about what happened last night. So General we are not in a very comfortable situation but we thank God.\u201d\n\nTo stem the tide, he said, the state government has amended the local government laws and created a three-tiers security structure in the state in order to restore the roles of traditional, religious, youths and women leaders in fighting insecurity across the state.\n\nEarlier, the COAS Lieutenant Gen. Yahaya, told the governor that he was in Katsina State on operational visit to inspect military units and forms under 8 Division of the Nigerian Army, vowing to work with other sister security agencies to curb insecurity in the state.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "AU Announces Rollout of 400m Vaccine Doses to Member States",
          "text": "By Ndubuisi Francis\n\nSouth African President and President of the African Union (AU), Cyril Ramaphosa, has announced the commencement of monthly shipments of vaccines acquired by the AU/African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team (AVAT) to member states of the pan-African union.\n\nAn initiative by the AU member states to pool their purchasing power, the AVATT had on March 28, 2021 signed a historic agreement for the purchase of 220 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson single-shot COVID-19 vaccine, with the potential to order an additional 180 million doses.\n\nThe Johnson & Johnson vaccine was selected for this first pooled procurement for three reasons.\n\nFirst, as a single-shot vaccine, it is easier and cheaper to administer; second, the vaccine has a long shelf-life and favourable storage conditions.\n\nIt is also partly manufactured on the African continent, with fill-finish activities taking place in South Africa.\n\nRamaphosa said: \u201cThis is a momentous step forward in Africa\u2019s efforts to safeguard the health and well-being of its people. By working together and by pooling resources, African countries have been able to secure millions of vaccine doses produced right here in Africa.\n\n\u201cThis will provide impetus to the fight against COVID-19 across the continent and will lay the basis for Africa\u2019s social and economic recovery.\u201d\n\nThe first monthly shipments are expected to arrive August 5 in several member states, and shipments will continue for a total of 6.4 million doses in August.\n\nMonthly shipments will continue and be continually ramped up, with a target of delivering almost 50 million vaccines before the end of December.\n\nBy January, the number of vaccines being released will be in excess of 25 million per month. In collaboration with the Africa Medical Supplies Platform (AMSP), UNICEF is providing logistical and delivery services to the member states.\n\nThe vaccine acquisition is a unique milestone for the African continent. It is the first time Africa has undertaken a procurement of this magnitude involving all member states.\n\nIt also marks the first time that the AU member states have collectively purchased vaccines to safeguard the health of the African population.\n\nFour hundred million vaccines are believed to be sufficient to immunise a third of the African people and bring Africa halfway towards its continental goal of vaccinating at least 60 per cent of the population.\n\nInternational donors have committed to deliver the remaining half of the doses required through the COVAX initiative.\n\nIt is significant that these vaccine doses are being produced on the African continent at the Aspen Pharmacare facility in Gqeberha in South Africa.\n\nThis is part of the concerted effort by African countries to rally the world to support the TRIPS waiver for technology transfer and active pharmaceutical ingredients to develop her own manufacturing capabilities.\n\nAU Special Envoy, Mr Strive Masiyiwa, said: \u201cDelivering our first doses to African Union member states is an unprecedented milestone. We are deploying relentless efforts to help each member state to reach its goal of immunising 60 per cent of Africans, as recommended by the Africa CDC. Johnson & Johnson AVAT-purchased single-shot vaccines will enable us to considerably improve our vaccination level across the continent.\u201d\n\nThe Director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), Dr John Nkengasong, said: \u201cDuring the last months, we have seen the vaccination gap between Africa and other parts of the world widen, and a devastating third wave hit our continent. The deliveries starting now will help us get to the vaccination levels necessary to protect African lives and livelihoods.\u201d\n\nThe agreement with Johnson & Johnson was made possible through a $2 billion facility provided by African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), which are also the financial and transaction advisers, guarantors, instalment payment facility providers and payment agents.\n\nThe President and Chairman of the Board of Afreximbank, Prof. Benedict Oramah, said: \u201cThe very low access to vaccines has exposed Africa to a devastating third and fourth waves of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cDeath rates are rising and economies are becoming increasingly vulnerable. We are encouraged by the successful commencement of this vaccine roll-out, which will help contain the spread of the virus and protect lives and livelihood. Afreximbank is pleased to have contributed in the historic procurement of vaccines by AVAT.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to better days ahead for our people through this effort.\u201d\n\nHe explained that this is a proud moment for the continent, adding that the vaccines, partly manufactured in South Africa, are a true testament that local production and pooled procurement as envisioned in the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) are key to the attainment of a more sustainable post-Covid-19 economic recovery across the continent.\n\nThe United Nations (UN) Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), Dr. Vera Songwe, stated that Africa can create over five million more jobs if more health commodities are manufactured on the continent.\n\nRegular technical meetings of the African Ministers of Finance, who collaborated in an unprecedented manner to make it possible, were coordinated by UNECA.\n\nThe vaccine acquisition and deployment is supported by an innovative partnership between the World Bank, AU and AVATT to expedite access to vaccines throughout the continent.\n\nThrough this partnership, the World Bank is supporting the AVATT initiative with resources to allow countries purchase and deploy vaccines for up to 400 million people across Africa.\n\nThe World Bank Managing Director, Operations, Axel van Trotsenburg, said: \u201cToday marks an important milestone in the AU\u2019s tireless efforts in bringing COVID-19 vaccines to Africa.\n\n\u201cThe World Bank is very pleased to be part of the AU campaign to get the African continent vaccinated, including by helping finance the purchases of the needed doses and supporting the administration of the shots.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Endorses acquisition of 20% stake in Dangote refinery\n\n\u2022Sylva: Rehabilitation of Warri, Kaduna refineries to gulp $1.484bn\n\n\u2022NNPC misses six-month revenue projection by N1.1trn\n\nDeji Elumoye and\n\nBy Emmanuel Addeh\n\nThe Federal Executive Council (FEC) has approved $11.174 billion for the construction of a standard-gauge coastal railway from Lagos to Calabar. FEC also approved the award of two contracts to the tune of N6.2 billion and N2.31 billion, respectively, for the construction of two power substations in Jigawa and Akwa Ibom states.\n\nThe council approved the acquisition of 20 per cent minority stake by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) in Dangote Petroleum and petrochemical refinery in the sum of $2.76 billion. This was as hope for the restoration of the country\u2019s four refineries in less than eight years from now was raised yesterday.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, disclosed these at the end of the monthly FEC meeting in Abuja. Sylva also announced the federal government\u2019s approval of $1.484 billion for the rehabilitation of both Warri and Kaduna refineries.\n\nHowever, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) failed to meet its gross revenue projections in the first six months of 2021, hitting a huge deficit of N1.106 trillion during the period.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen at the end of the weekly FEC meeting presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo at the State House, Abuja, Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed said the meeting approved the memo for the ratification of the president\u2019s approval for the award of the contract for the Lagos-Calabar coastal standard-gauge railway.\n\nThe information minister said, \u201cThis is a very old project, which we inherited. Under the former administration, an approval was given, but nothing was done, but today, the council has given approval to commence the Lagos-Calabar coastal route.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the rail project is important to the nation\u2019s coastal economy, which is why $11.174 billion is earmarked for it with a completion period of six years.\n\nHis words: \u201cThis particular route is very important because after the Lagos-Kano route, this Lagos-Calabar coastal route, actually will link all the coastal cities in the country.\n\n\u201cThe proposed route alignment is to go from Lagos to Shagamu, Shagamu to Ijebu-Ode, Ijebu-Ode to Ore, Ore to Benin City, Benin to Sapele, Sapele to Warri, Warri to Yenagoa, Yenagoa to Port Harcourt, Port Harcourt to Aba, Aba to Uyo, Uyo to Calabar, Calabar to Akamkpa to Ikom, to Obudu Ranch, with a branch line from Benin City to Asaba, Onitsha Bridge and then Port Harcourt to Onne Deep Seaport.\u201d\n\nThe minister also stressed that the commitment of the present administration to expanding and consolidating on the rail projects across the country informed FEC\u2019s approval of the funds for work to commence immediately on the Kano-Jibia rail and the Port Harcourt-Maiduguri route.\n\nSpeaking also, Minister of Power, Sale Mamman, disclosed that FEC approved two projects for his ministry, including the construction of 2 by 60 MVA 132 33 substation at Gagarawa, Jigawa State, in favour of Messrs Power Control and Appliances Limited in the sum of N154,212,396.05.\n\n\u201cThe second one is the award of the contract for the engineering, procurement and construction of 2 by 30 MVA 132 33 substation at Ibiono Ibom, Akwa Ibom State in favour of Messrs YEMEC West Africa Limited in the sum of US$6.2 offshore plus N1.8 billion onshore,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, the Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba stated, \u201cToday, the Federal Ministry of Education presented two memos. The first one dealt with ratification of convention Nigeria had already acceded to which seeks to regularise the recognition of certificates and diplomats all across Africa.\u201d\n\nThe second memo, according to him, dealt with the award of contract for the building of two blocks of social science complexes at Adamawa State University in Mubi for a total sum of N1,103,000,000, which is a TETFUND allocation that emerged from 2017 through 2021.\n\nSylva: Rehabilitation of Warri, Kaduna refineries to gulp $1.484bn\n\nMeanwhile, Sylva has announced the approval of $1.484 billion for the rehabilitation of Warri and Kaduna refineries.\n\nThe minister, who made this disclosure to newsmen at the end of the FEC meeting, also said 15 per cent of the total sum for the rehabilitation of the two refineries in Port Harcourt which was awarded earlier this year had been paid to the construction firm currently working at site.\n\nThe minister said the FEC meeting approved the award of contracts for the rehabilitation of Warri and Kaduna refineries to Messers Saipem SPA and Saipem Contracting Limited at the combined total sum of $1.484 billion.\n\nAccording to him, $897,678,800 would be spent to repair Warri refinery while Kaduna refinery will gulp $586,902,256.\n\nHe stressed that the completion of the rehabilitation exercise would be in three phases spread over a 77-month period.\n\nHe explained: \u201cThe completion of the rehabilitation of Warri and Kaduna refineries is going to be in three phases. First phase will be completed within 21 months, in 23 months phase two will be completed and in 33 months, the full rehabilitation will be completed.\u201d\n\nOn Port Harcourt refinery, Sylva noted that the repair work had commenced adding that already the first 15 per cent of the contract sum has been paid to the contractor and the contractor was fully mobilised to site.\n\n\u201cWe also discussed in council the need for us to give periodic updates. Soon, we\u2019ll be going to inspect the work in Port Harcourt refinery, and you will all be with us on that visit,\u201d he said.\n\nNNPC misses six-month revenue projection by N1.1trn\n\nMeanwhile, the NNPC failed to meet its gross revenue projections in the first six months of 2021, hitting a huge deficit of N1.106 trillion during the period.\n\nLatest data on the operations of the NNPC obtained by THISDAY indicated that against the benchmark of a monthly budget of N414.941 billion, NNPC in the first half of this year did not meet its revenue forecast, the closest figure to the budgeted figure being N320.315 billion in May.\n\nThe 44-year-old corporation is currently beset with high operational costs, especially in its drilling activities in addition to the reduction in oil production quota by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which has led to the shutting down of some of its assets.\n\nMoreover, payment of fuel subsidy remains a burden the corporation has been shouldering, even though it has said the situation is unsustainable, with under-recovery gulping over N608 billion between February and June this year.\n\nInformation on the corporation\u2019s funding performance showed that while gross revenue forecast for the year was put at N4.979 trillion and N2.489 trillion in the first half, it has only be able to meet its financial target to the tune of N1.383 trillion, leaving a shortfall of N1.106 trillion.\n\nIn January, out of the calendarised sum of N414.941 billion, the NNPC only struggled to earn a gross revenue of N195.624 billion, same in February when it made a gross revenue of N191.194 billion.\n\nIn March, revenue rose to N224.589 billion, while they were N156.366 billion, N320.315 billion and N295, 396 billion respectively in April, May and June.\n\nSome of the capital projects earmarked for the year 2021 have also suffered under-funding, with Brass LNG Gas Supply Project in Bayelsa receiving zero financing for the six months under consideration.\n\nThe Brass LNG project designed to produce 10 million metric tonnes per annum of liquefied natural gas, was initially agreed to be built by the NNPC, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Eni Group, but have seen the exit of ConocoPhillips and Chevron. It has now been in the works for over a decade.\n\nAdded to that, national domestic gas development, which had a budget of N40.352 billion for the first six months, only got N20.22 billion, leaving a deficit of N20.130 billion. Also, gas infrastructure development had a shortfall of N15.7 billion, while funding for frontier exploration fell by N12.9 billion during the first six months of the year.\n\nSimilarly, the N3.05 billion budgeted for renewable energy for the year, had a shortfall of N789 million as of June, while the Nigeria/ Morocco pipeline with a budget of N1 billion was underfunded by N83 million.\n\nIt also showed that fuel landing cost for the 22 vessels that brought the product into the country in June, ranged from between N185 to N209, with the recorded under-recovery for the month being N114.337 billion.\n\nFor pipelines\u2019 repair and management cost for June, security and maintenance gulped N3.2 billion, actual facilities\u2019 repairs cost N599.5 million while strategic holding by the NNPC was N677.5 million, totalling N4.530 billion.\n\nHowever, the NNPC and the Minister of State, Petroleum, Mr Timipre Sylva, had on two separate occasions said they were dealing with the twin issues of high production cost per unit of crude oil, said to be one of the highest in the world as well as low production quota handed down by OPEC.\n\nOn the third issue of subsidy, the minister had said negotiations were still ongoing with organised labour.\n\nIn the heat of the COVID-19-induced oil market crash last year, the Group Managing Director of the national oil company, Mr. Mele Kyari, had said along with its joint partners, the NNPC was targeting a production cost per unit of $10 per barrel.\n\nAsked in a recent interview if the target had been met, Kyari told journalists that although the corporation had reduced unit cost by 30 per cent, he could not readily give the actual average cost per every barrel pumped at the time, saying that the NNPC had approached its contractors for renegotiation of contracts, which yielded results.\n\nHe had also said with the contract renegotiations and discounts, in addition to some optimisation of operating process driven by the National Upstream Cost Optimisation Programme (NUCOP), reduced the cost of production by close to a third.\n\nOn low OPEC quota, Sylva during a meeting with the Secretary General of the organisation, Dr. Sanusi Barkindo, last week, noted that Nigeria will be seeking a new reference production figure in addition to the 30,000 barrels Nigerian share of the members\u2019 July agreement of about 400,000 barrels per day.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "BREAKING: PUMA To Sue Nigeria Over Breach Of Contract After Terminating Over N1Billion Deal With Country",
          "text": "German sportswear manufacturing giant, PUMA plans to sue the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) and the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports.\n\nThe development comes as the sportswear manufacturer terminated a four-year contract it had with Nigeria in a letter dated Wednesday, August 4, 2021, and signed by the company\u2019s director, Manuel Edlheimb.\n\nAccording to reports, the AFN under the leadership of Ibrahim Gusau had entered into a controversial $2.76 million deal with PUMA on July 24, 2019, in Doha, Qatar.\n\nThe deal reportedly led to a major crisis that split the athletics body into two factions, with Gusau and AFN First Vice President, Sunday Adeleye accused of sidelining other members of the board during the signing of the deal.\n\nThe deal, signed by the Gusau-led AFN, was due to expire in 2022, Punch reports.\n\nPart of the contract is that PUMA will supply apparel to all age categories to Nigeria\u2019s Athletics team for four years at no cost.\n\nIn addition, gold medalists at the Olympic Games will earn $15,000 (N6 million), silver medalists will get $5,000 (N2 million) while a bronze medal will fetch athletes wearing the PUMA apparel at the games $3,000 (N1.2 million).\n\nIn the latest development, PUMA officials have got in touch with officials of Gusau-led AFN informing them of an intention to sue.\n\nAccording to a source quoted by Punch, the sports ministry would be made a party to the suit \u201cbecause they issued a memo granting AFN permission to seek sponsorship. PUMA sees AFN as a representative of Nigeria with that memo. It gave them confidence that AFN had approval. They also claimed that as of the time of signing the contract, the parties involved are recognised by law and FG, and there was no faction to warrant suspicion. They believe an administration is a continuum and the agreement has government backing..\u201d\n\nThis was confirmed by the AFN First Vice President, Adeleye while appearing on Arise TV as a guest on Thursday.\n\nWhile displaying evidence and documents showing the FG\u2019s approval for the federation to seek a sponsor, Adeleye said, \u201cThe contract is a non-disclosure one. It is between PUMA and AFN with FMYSD\u2019s permission. We warned that this may lead to litigation and wrote to all parties involved, including finance and justice ministries.\n\n\u201cWe are sure that PUMA will go to court on this matter. Their officials have called that they are sending documents from their legal department. We wrote the minister on the implications for Nigeria. This won\u2019t make other companies deal with Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe also argued that Gusau-led AFN did everything possible to ensure that the image of the country is protected.\n\nOn why the kits were kept in a store, he said, \u201cOur AFN has been barred from using the facility in the stadium and we needed to run the activities of the association. We have a store and office that we run. The constitution didn\u2019t say our office should be in the stadium.\u201d\n\nAsked if he would take responsibility for the termination of the contract, Adeleye said, \u201cWe should be awarded because we are patriotic. The Federal Government asked federations to look for sponsors (before Sunday Dare). This contract precedes him. They are aware of the contract.\n\n\u201cWe worked with instruction. We looked for a sponsor so that the burden can be taken off the Federal Government. The sports ministry should be sanctioned. We need a shake-up in the sports ministry.\n\n\u201cThe problem is the minister and sports ministry under his administration. Our problems have never been this worse. Federations have issues but not to this extend. Despite a court order, the minister is resolute in destroying some people. We gave the kits out, the ministry said they were not going to use the kits.\u201d\n\nThe sports ministry\u2019s had insisted that Nigerian athletes at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics will not wear PUMA because of the leadership tussle between the Gusau-led AFN board and the one being championed by the sports minister, Dare.\n\nIt was learnt that several efforts were made to give the athletes the PUMA kits, including shipping bags of kits with 40 items each to Tokyo through the Nigerian Embassy in Japan but to no avail.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of State Services (DSS) last year cleared Gusau and his vice president, Adeleye over corruption allegations levelled against them by the sports ministry.\n\nThe sports ministry in 2020 petitioned the DSS over the AFN\u2019s partnership deal with PUMA to kit Nigeria\u2019s track and field teams until 2023.\n\nThe DSS' response to the sports ministry\u2019s petition, titled \u201cRe: Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development (FMYSD), Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) and Alhaji Shehu Gusau\u201d, dated September 3, 2020, and signed on behalf of the Director-General of the DSS by Bello Mustapha, was received on September 4, 2020, by the sports ministry.\n\nIn the letter, the DSS stated, \u201cThis Service (DSS) has thoroughly investigated the matter regarding the Puma deal. The under-listed findings were established:\n\n\u201cAthletics Federation of Nigeria entered into a valid contract with Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited.\n\n\u201cThe AFN gave Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited the mandate to source for sponsors for Nigeria\u2019s track and field teams on her behalf in a letter dated September 4, 2018, signed by Ademu A. Elijah, Secretary-General of the AFN.\n\n\u201cThe AFN duly authorised Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited to deal with Puma on behalf of the federation in a letter dated June 23, 2019, signed by Patrick Estate, Head Marketing; and there is no evidence that Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited received money meant for AFN from Puma.\n\n\u201cIn view, therefore, it is reiterated that the FMYSD and the AFN board should employ an internal mechanism to resolve the lingering dispute between them.\u201d\n\nThe contract termination comes a few hours after a trending video showed Nigeria\u2019s shot put medal hopeful, Chukwuebuka Enekwechi, washing his jersey ahead of his final game at the ongoing Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\n\nThe caption in the video indicated that the athlete was given one jersey for the competition.\n\n\u201cWhen you made the Olympic Finals, but you only have one jersey,\u201d he wrote.",

We gave the kits out, the ministry said they were not going to use the kits.\u201d\n\nThe sports ministry\u2019s had insisted that Nigerian athletes at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics will not wear PUMA because of the leadership tussle between the Gusau-led AFN board and the one being championed by the sports minister, Dare.\n\nIt was learnt that several efforts were made to give the athletes the PUMA kits, including shipping bags of kits with 40 items each to Tokyo through the Nigerian Embassy in Japan but to no avail.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of State Services (DSS) last year cleared Gusau and his vice president, Adeleye over corruption allegations levelled against them by the sports ministry.\n\nThe sports ministry in 2020 petitioned the DSS over the AFN\u2019s partnership deal with PUMA to kit Nigeria\u2019s track and field teams until 2023.\n\nThe DSS' response to the sports ministry\u2019s petition, titled \u201cRe: Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development (FMYSD), Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) and Alhaji Shehu Gusau\u201d, dated September 3, 2020, and signed on behalf of the Director-General of the DSS by Bello Mustapha, was received on September 4, 2020, by the sports ministry.\n\nIn the letter, the DSS stated, \u201cThis Service (DSS) has thoroughly investigated the matter regarding the Puma deal. The under-listed findings were established:\n\n\u201cAthletics Federation of Nigeria entered into a valid contract with Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited.\n\n\u201cThe AFN gave Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited the mandate to source for sponsors for Nigeria\u2019s track and field teams on her behalf in a letter dated September 4, 2018, signed by Ademu A. Elijah, Secretary-General of the AFN.\n\n\u201cThe AFN duly authorised Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited to deal with Puma on behalf of the federation in a letter dated June 23, 2019, signed by Patrick Estate, Head Marketing; and there is no evidence that Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited received money meant for AFN from Puma.\n\n\u201cIn view, therefore, it is reiterated that the FMYSD and the AFN board should employ an internal mechanism to resolve the lingering dispute between them.\u201d\n\nThe contract termination comes a few hours after a trending video showed Nigeria\u2019s shot put medal hopeful, Chukwuebuka Enekwechi, washing his jersey ahead of his final game at the ongoing Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\n\nThe caption in the video indicated that the athlete was given one jersey for the competition.\n\n\u201cWhen you made the Olympic Finals, but you only have one jersey,\u201d he wrote.",
          "summary": "German sportswear manufacturing giant, PUMA plans to sue the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) and the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports.\nThe deal, signed by the Gusau-led AFN, was due to expire in 2022, Punch reports.\nIn the latest development, PUMA officials have got in touch with officials of Gusau-led AFN informing them of an intention to sue.\nIn the letter, the DSS stated, \u201cThis Service (DSS) has thoroughly investigated the matter regarding the Puma deal.\nThe under-listed findings were established:\u201cAthletics Federation of Nigeria entered into a valid contract with Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited.",

          "title": "Olumide Soyombo: The journey from startup founder to investment mogul",
          "text": "\u201cWhat turns me off is when someone just tells me they have this idea and they haven\u2019t done anything but want me to invest. I always say you have to take a risk on yourself before anybody can take a risk on you.\u201d\n\nUp until October 2020 when Nigerian fintech startup Paystack was acquired by Stripe for $200m, Olumide Soyombo was still relatively investing in the background. He was mostly known by a few as the co-founder of Bluechip technologies, a company that provided data management solutions to companies.\n\nWhat changed? Word got out that he was one of the earliest investors in Paystack. Beyond that, his investment portfolio showed that he had also invested in over 20 notable startups. As a result of these revelations, requests by others to co-invest along with him increased.\n\nHe tried to keep up with the requests but it soon became impossible to carry others along effectively without setting up a more formal structure. So last week he announced that he was launching Voltron Capital, a pan-African venture capital fund.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of FOMO (fear of missing out). Everybody\u2019s keen on having tech in their portfolio. The whole idea of Voltron was to bring people together to form the \u2018Defender of the Universe\u2019,\u201d he told me.\n\nOver a call, we talked about Soyombo\u2019s early influences, building his company and what he\u2019s most excited about right now.\n\nThe early days\n\nAt first, being a doctor was all Soyombo wanted to be until he was given a personal computer.\n\nHe grew up in the 90s with access to a personal computer and to the internet, at a time when most people didn\u2019t have access to such.\n\n\u201cAt first I wanted to be a medical doctor but in secondary school, I got exposed to using the computer and then I knew I was going to do something in technology.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, he got into the University of Lagos (UNILAG) to study Systems Engineering. Notably, he was part of the first set for the newly launched degree program in UNILAG. The degree was less about computers and more about systems, which equipped him with the ability to oversee and understand the different aspects of a project or a system.\n\nWhile pursuing this degree, he enrolled in professional exams such as MCSE, MCP, CCNA and CCNP and passed them before he was 19. He passed the CCNA exam \u2013 a networking exam \u2013 before even seeing a router.\n\n\u201cThis helped build my profile and knowledge of tech. Back then, tech wasn\u2019t as sexy as this but it was still a profession that many aspired to get into.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nEarly bird or worm?\n\nAmerican psychologist Adam Grant is credited with saying that while it\u2019s true that the early bird gets the worm, the early worm also gets caught. For Soyombo, was being a part of the pioneer set of a newly created degree a case of the early bird or worm?\n\n\u201cThe good part about being the first set was that a lot of focus was placed on us because they needed the success of the first set to generate more interest in the department. We were one of the few people in the UNILAG at that time that had their lectures delivered via PowerPoint.\u201d Clearly, the case of the early bird here.\n\nAfter his first degree, Soyombo went on to get a master\u2019s degree in business and information technology from Aston Business school. During his time in Aston, he learned how to use technology to solve business problems. Upon completion of his master\u2019s degree, he returned back to Nigeria, where for the next year he was a consultant for a bank that needed to build a data warehouse.\n\nWhile on that job he met his future business partner, Kazeem Tewogbade, who was then the lead consultant on the project.\n\nBuilding solutions for banks and telcos\n\nThe two decided to focus on building data warehouses and business intelligence solutions for banks and telcos. In 2008, they founded Bluechip Technologies which has gone to build those solutions and partnered with a number of companies like Oracle and Microsoft.\n\nAt the core of Bluechip technologies, products is business analytics \u2014 bringing data from disparate sources and building models from that data to help businesses to predict things like customer churn, lifetime value of the customer and help the business make better decisions. The company also provides enterprise solutions like voucher management systems that the telcos use.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re buying any airtime from one of the telcos, it\u2019s likely running from one of our solutions. We are basically just looking for problems within businesses and solving them with technology.\u201d\n\nBluechip Technologies is in its 13th year and has expanded beyond Nigeria to four other African countries \u2014 Kenya, DRC Congo, Zambia and Ghana.\n\nWhat has been the driving force behind this growth and expansion? Referrals.\n\n\u201cReferrals are the building blocks for success in the B2B world. For example, we deliver a data warehouse in bank A, when the chief information officer leaves there and goes to bank B, he remembers that we delivered a project successfully for him and he reaches out to us. The price of failure in enterprise startups is high. If you fail on a large project you\u2019re out. So everyone tries to rely on a vendor who can deliver consistently.\u201d\n\nEvery business faces competition. Despite many competing companies coming into the business intelligence space, Soyombo believes the market is big enough for others to come in.\n\n\u201cSometimes people say, when someone says the market is big enough you shouldn\u2019t listen to them, but in this case I can tell you that we can\u2019t do everything ourselves. The market is truly big enough.\u201d\n\nLife outside of work\n\nCredit: Olumide Soyombo\n\nWhen he\u2019s not working, Soyombo can be found at the Lagos Polo Club, where he\u2019s the social secretary. He doesn\u2019t play but enjoys watching others play \u2014 there\u2019s a Bluechip polo team that competes during tournaments \u2014 and meeting new people.\n\nThe world of investing in startups\n\nIn 2014, when Soyombo and his business partner Tewogbade noticed the buzzing tech scene in Lagos, backed the increase in internet penetration and clusters of talents in Yaba, they knew they had to be a part of it.\n\nSo they created Leadpath as an investment vehicle to invest in startups, at first the approach was to invest $25,000 \u2013 $100,000 in local tech startups, similar to the Y-combinator accelerator model. But this didn\u2019t work out as planned, as there were no other investors to further invest in the companies.\n\nThey ditched the accelerator model and started investing individually as angel investors. And finally, in 2021 Voltron Capital was launched to bridge the gap of angel investing between his corporate friends and colleagues who have not typically invested in tech and startups that need their money.\n\nAs an influential figure in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem, Soyombo has access to almost any important deal in the market but he\u2019s had to pass up on a few.\n\nHe could have invested in Flutterwave but decided not to because of a personal relationship with one of the founders of Paystack.\n\n\u201cSometimes you put personal relationships with super founders ahead of personal financial gain.\u201d\n\nAnother investment opportunity he passed up on was that of a new startup whose founder didn\u2019t handle the winding down of his previous company well. The bitter taste of how the founder handled the first company didn\u2019t allow Soyombo to invest in the second company.\n\nWhen he thinks about the future, Soyombo is excited about the fact that the African tech ecosystem is maturing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting seeing that employees, former product leads and engineers, from maturing startups are going on to start their own companies because they\u2019ve seen how things work in high growth companies. Mono\u2019s founder is ex-paystack, Brass\u2019 founder is ex-paystack and Kudi. Now think about what the current employees in different logistics, eCommerce and healthtech companies would build in the next few years.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s MTN Group has repatriated its last year\u2019s dividend of around $280 million (R4.2 billion) from its local unit in Nigeria. The company reported the payout on Monday during the release of preliminary financial results for the six months to June 30, 2021.\n\nThe funds from Nigeria are part of approximately $650 million (R9.3 billion) in cash the pan-African telecoms giant returned from its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Johannesburg-based group had been struggling to get dividends out of its subsidiaries due to the challenges of securing foreign currency in Nigeria and some other markets where it operates.\n\nAs a result, MTN was forced to suspend dividend payout for the 2020 financial year. The company also cited other reasons for the suspension, such as the timing of proceeds from an ongoing asset realisation programme (ARP) and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnnounced in March 2019, the ARP seeks to simplify the group\u2019s portfolio, reduce debt and improve returns. Over a three-year period, the programme is expected to bring in proceeds of at least R15 billion ($1 billion).\n\n\u201cCash upstreaming from Nigeria remained challenging in terms of securing foreign currency in the market. During 2020, we upstreamed the equivalent of approximately R286 million from Nigeria, with approximately R4.2 billion yet to be repatriated as of 31 December 2020,\u201d the company said back in March.\n\nThe group has now fully secured its cash dividend from Nigeria, in what is one of the two positive developments concerning MTN that will come as a relief to shareholders.\n\nRespite in U.S. court case\n\nIn addition to the news from Nigeria, MTN also revealed \u201cpositive developments\u201d in a United States court case related to the group and its subsidiaries, MTN Afghanistan and MTN Dubai.\n\nAccording to the company, the magistrate assessing complaints of alleged violations of U.S. anti-terrorism regulation had recommended the dismissal of the case.\n\nThe Group had argued that the court has no jurisdiction over the company given it does not operate in the U.S. It also claims the complaint \u201cdoes not allege any conduct by MTN defendants that violated the Anti-Terrorism Act.\u201d\n\nAfter the news of repatriating money from Nigeria and progress in the U.S. court case, MTN shares reportedly finished 6% higher on Monday at R111.30 (around $7).\n\nThe group\u2019s complete half-year results are expected to be released on August 12 and it has told investors to expect between 75% to 85% drop in profit or earnings per share (EPS). This is due to an impairment charge involving its Yemeni business and the decoupling of its operation in Syria.\n\nThe sale of MTN Group\u2019s 75% stake in MTN Syria is part of ongoing attempts to exit markets in the Middle East over the next three to five years, with a plan to fully focus on core African markets.\n\nMTN plans to raise about R15 billion ($1 billion) from shareholding sales in markets outside Africa, proceeds which will be used to reduce its huge debt of nearly R50 billion ($3.5 billion) for the year to December 2020 as well as allocate more capital investments in Africa by 2025.\n\nIn Nigeria, MTN, through its local unit, has earmarked \u20a6600 billion ($1.5 billion) over the next three years to expand broadband access in Africa\u2019s most populous economy.\n\nMobile subscribers decline in Nigeria\n\nFor MTN Nigeria, results for the past half-year showed that service revenue increased by 24.1% year-on-year, despite the number of its mobile subscribers declining by 7.6 million (nearly 10%).\n\nIn December 2020, Nigerian authorities ordered telecom companies to suspend the sale of SIM cards (until April this year). The directive was part of efforts to verify the identities of all mobile subscribers, who were asked to link their phone numbers with national identity numbers.\n\n\u201cOperationally, our mobile subscribers closed H1 at 68.9 million, down 9.9% from December 2020. This was due to the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations, which was lifted on 19 April 2021,\u201d MTN Nigeria\u2019s CEO, Karl Toriola, said on an analyst call.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile user numbers fell, MTN Nigeria company managed to increase service revenue to \u20a6790.3 billion (about R27 billion, $1.9 billion) driven by a surge in data usage.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 27.6% to \u20a6417.2 billion ($1 billion) while transaction volume for mobile money increased by 280.8% year-on-year to 55.6 million. Its total MoMo active subscribers reached 6.1 million.\n\nMTN Nigeria aims to sustain \u201cdouble-digit service revenue growth ahead of inflation, driving 4G and rural network expansion,\u201d Toriola said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Can mobile applications help solve Africa's healthcare access problem?",
          "text": "In 2019, Abubakar Yusuf saw his medical condition deteriorate rapidly. The 43-year old carpenter in Nigeria\u2019s Borno State has been suffering from Malaria and experiencing a deadly mix of fever, chills, headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n\u201cI would go to the only public health centre in the area but I just don\u2019t think I can wait. There\u2019s likely going to be 20 or 30 people before me and they often attend those that arrived first. So there\u2019s no guarantee I will even see a doctor on time.\u201d\n\nAfter staying indoors for days, the bedridden Yusuf was visited by one of his closest clients who eventually told him about a mobile app that can help him find a doctor and get easy access to treatment.\n\nHe downloaded Zuri Health, booked an appointment for the day after with one of the doctors listed on the platform, and received confirmation by SMS. Through the app, Yusuf was instructed to take some initial measures to help alleviate his condition after which he met with the doctor with a wait time of just 10 minutes. He recovered fully a week later.\n\nYusuf is a fictional figure but his predicament is as real \u2013 for many Africans \u2013 as Zuri Health is. Without discovering the mobile app, he could easily have been one of the more than 400,000 Africans malaria killed in 2019.\n\nAfrica carries a disproportionately high share of the global burden of deaths from diseases: in the same year, the continent accounted for a troubling 94% of all malaria cases and deaths. Approximately 1.6 million Africans died of tuberculosis, malaria, or HIV-related illnesses in 2015 alone.\n\nWhat is even more worrisome is the fact that with proper medication, these diseases can be prevented, treated, or even cured. But there\u2019s a well-documented lack of access to healthcare in Africa.\n\nLess than 50% of people in Africa can access modern health facilities and 80% rely on the chronically underfunded public health services, which suffer from a shortage of everything from drugs to power blackouts.\n\nZuri Health mobile app.\n\nMobile-based healthcare to the rescue\n\nA number of startups have come up with innovative ways to solve the key challenge of accessing healthcare in Africa using technology. One such is Zuri Health, a relatively new player in the continent\u2019s nascent telemedicine (the use of digital devices such as mobile devices and computers to deliver health care) space.\n\nZuri Health is a mobile application that gives patients the opportunity to chat with a doctor, buy medication from a pharmacy, book labs and diagnostic tests or have a doctor visit them at home.\n\nThe company launched in Kenya earlier this year and aims to provide affordable and accessible healthcare solutions via mobile technology with dedicated apps, wap, and SMS services.\n\n\u201cZuri Health is very personal to me,\u201d said founder and CEO Ikechukwu Anoke, in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThe app is named after my daughter, Zuri, who was born in 2012. Despite being at one of the best hospitals in Kenya, we could not get a doctor to attend to my wife on time while she was in labour.\u201d\n\nThe incident made Ikechukwu realise that even if an individual could afford medical care, the distribution and logistics of healthcare in the country still posed a challenge. But it wasn\u2019t until eight years later, when he himself had a life-threatening experience in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, that he started working on Zuri.\n\n\u201cI had personal health issues before the pandemic which made me even more vulnerable to the virus. With an underlying health problem in a Covid environment, it was vital to think about the provision of healthcare in a different way,\u201d Ikechukwu recalled.\n\nWith most hospitals shut and doctors unavailable in the heat of the pandemic, he says telemedicine and remote care became extremely important at that point.\n\n\u201cIt made sense to build an app through which people could get basic tests done without leaving the comfort of their home and further risk their lives. If we had known earlier, maybe we would have built apps and launched them during the pandemic. The experience of Covid helped what we\u2019ve built today.\u201d\n\nZuri Health launched a beta version in November 2020 and rolled out officially in Nairobi two months later. Since January, Zuri has onboarded more than 250 doctors, who earn extra income from the service they provide, onto its platform.\n\nArthur Ikechukwu Anoke and Daisy Isiaho, co-founders of the mobile app, Zuri Health.\n\nThe opportunity to chat with a doctor and receive diagnoses remotely helps thousands of subscribers that currently use the application save transportation and other logistical costs while receiving necessary medical care.\n\n\u201cZuri Health gives doctors a wider and easier platform to reach patients who need them while the underserved populace can now access affordable and sustainable healthcare,\u201d Ikechukwu said.\n\nThe company, at the end of July, launched an updated version of its app, called Zuri 2.0, which comes with improved features.\n\nZuri Health has also secured partnerships in multiple African countries, which is expected to pave the way for a planned continental expansion. Over the next few months, Zuri wants to enter other markets \u2013 including Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Zambia, Cote D\u00cdvoire, Mozambique, Angola, and Senegal.\n\nAfrica\u2019s e-health industry on the rise\n\nIncreasing mobile penetration and a thriving tech startup scene give hopes that technology can make a big impact in improving access to medical care in Africa.\n\nThe continent is slowly witnessing a proliferation of healthcare apps, which include South Africa\u2019s Hello Doctor, ChanjoPlus and M-Tiba in Kenya, Benin Republic\u2019s GoMedical, and mTrac in Uganda; and more recently, Zuri Health.\n\nThere are clear signs of a coming explosion in the use of mobile technologies in African healthcare similar to the one that\u2019s been seen in financial services. However, recurring key challenges still need to be addressed.\n\nPrevailing issues such as prohibitive smartphone costs for Africans, the majority of which live on less than $1.90 a day, could pose as barriers to the uptake of digital health. Phone penetration in the region stands at just 44% compared to the global average of 66%.\n\nThere is also a large rural-urban digital divide with the greater part of rural Africa suffering from low connectivity and low levels of digital literacy among dwellers in such areas.\n\nFixing healthcare is beyond just tech\n\nHealth sectors in Africa stand to benefit hugely from digital solutions. But more than just the technology is needed for these innovations to scale and make a significant impact across the continent.\n\nThe increasing number of apps that aim to make healthcare widely accessible have to be integrated into public healthcare systems and national health strategies. This is where support from the government is needed.\n\nBeyond just funding, public authorities have to come up with inclusive telemedicine or mobile health (mHealth) policies that address regulatory and data governance issues. Governmental policies will help hold digital healthcare companies accountable and protect the information and data of citizens that use the technologies.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAs the field of mHealth matures, effective policy will become increasingly important, according to a World Health Organisation report.\n\n\u201cThere is an urgent need to drive more meaningful conversations in relation to frameworks around telemedicine because in Africa very few countries have these. Yet it\u2019s fundamental if we should achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,\u201d said Daisy Isiaho, Zuri Health Co-founder and Chief Product Officer.\n\nWhile thousands of Africans like Yusuf continue to have their lives saved by mobile health applications, going forward, governments will have to \u201cplay an active role through regulation and setting up legal frameworks in the growing telemedicine space.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Inconsistent policies are killing African startups",
          "text": "Policies & African startups is a monthly series written by Titi Akinsanmi. All musings are hers and not attributable to TechCabal or any organisations she is serving, working or affiliated with.\n\nFirst of all, introduction\n\nIt has taken many years for me to put pen to paper \u2013 in this form. Why? Well I focused and hoped \u2018those\u2019 who have the expertise, the skills to write etc, etc, etc would get round to doing this. But\u2026the impactful change one seeks truly does begin with one. So here goes\u2026\n\nI write as I speak \u2013 painting pictures with words, sometimes rambling and stopping at bus stops to share an extra nugget, insight or to detour completely. And sometimes I will enter the rabbit hole of writing in formal academic language to address a specific issue.\n\nYou see, this \u2018column\u2019, my writing is not your typical treatise or intellectual exposition on the what, why and how of policy making in the digital economy. It\u2019s a peek into my perfectly imperfect policy wonk mind. A sharing of my thoughts in progress around shenanigans in this space \u2013 the good, bad and ugly.\n\nMusings.\n\nMy goal? Tripartite (that means in three parts!). First is to let the words out of my head beyond when I take the \u2018stage\u2019 and speak to a select few who know; second is to normalize conversations on policy implications of all the innovations happening \u2013 and if just 0.1%, get more innovators thinking on this before and when they hit the market! Third, and for me the most important is to bring this discourse to you \u2013 the end user, the customer, the target of all these innovations. So you understand, get it \u2013 and use the power to influence in an informed way. You see that latter? Well You have the power to be the instigator of the change you want to see.\n\nSo here goes: this first piece is like a get to know you more, more information gathering before a possible first date (I hope we make it to the latter ;-))\n\nBefore we go on though \u2013 what is Policy making? Again no assumptions made right?\n\nSee, Policy making is far from \u2018sexzy\u2019 work \u2013 except for wonks like me :-). It is typically a long and arduous \u2018figuring out\u2019, drafting, negotiations, convincing and consensus building. In plain english: It takes a good amount of time to get close to having the right policy backed by law \u2013 from development to influencing process to adoption, influencing, implementation and then impact tracking (and its measurement).\n\nThe policy making process\n\nIt can seem like it\u2019s overnight, that hardly the case \u2013 but it does happen. [For instance, the Murambatsvina policy and the \u2018look East\u2019 policy in Zimbabwe]. The thing you don\u2019t know, having not paid attention or invested time, resources or built a network, is that it\u2019s likely been brewing under the surface (think lava, volcano eruption; or an underlying like that catches you unawares). Or you have done all this yet still\u2026\n\nLet\u2019s make this practical\u2026use our imaginations (for some reading this is a reality I know).\n\nImagine: You are a startup in some city or town in a tier 2 African country. You practice some solid frugal innovation and come up with a needed product and or service. You worked hard (alone or with a small team) and hit the market. You have a frugal marketing and reputation building strategy that harnesses the power of social media across jurisdictions. You begin to see a return on investment, just a trickle at first and then it steadily (or maybe not \u2013 dips are normal!) and then wham! The government \u2018sees\u2019 you.\n\nJisoos!\n\nWell that imaginning is a reality lived by many businesses across our continent \u2013 in these times seemingly targeting Tech enabled StartUps. The world more than ever before is at terms with the fact that digitisation is important for the growth of the economy and society. For the economically disparate economies on our continent however it seems players are working in different directions \u2013 albeit looking to reach the same goal of a thriving digital economy, apart. With the Covid-enabled growth of the last 18 months these \u2018high IQ toddler\u2019 businesses have faced stiff regulatory actions and inconsistent policies, \u2013 regardless of the intentions behind them. This at a time when African startup ecosystem is garnering global recognition and investor confidence.\n\nHere are a few examples of shifts in policy based on laws (sometimes not!) across our continent in the last 18 months.\n\nFintech in Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya\n\nNigeria\u2019s technology sector was its second-fastest-growing sector from Q1 2018 to Q4 2019. A look at the well appraised Nigerian fintech sector reveals the recently released regulatory directory of the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which states that \u201cby the provisions of Sections 67-70 of the Investments and Securities Act (ISA), 2007 and Rules 414 & 415 of the SEC Rules and Regulations, only foreign securities listed on any Exchange registered in Nigeria may be issued, sold or offered for sale or subscription to the Nigerian public. Accordingly, CMOs who work in concert with the referenced online platforms are hereby notified of the Commission\u2019s position and advised to desist henceforth.\u201d\n\nThe South African Reserve Bank\u2019s (SARB) cautious attitude towards virtual currencies like Bitcoin, as stated in Article 5.1 in its Position Paper on Virtual Currencies NPS 02/2014 that \u2018the Bank does not oversee, supervise or regulate the VC (virtual currencies) landscape, systems or intermediaries for effectiveness, soundness, integrity or robustness. Consequently, any and all activities related to the acquisition, trading or use of VCs (particularly DCVCs) are performed at the end-user\u2019s sole and independent risk and have no recourse to the Bank.\u2019\n\nIn 2015 Central Bank of Kenya(CBK) with regard to the legal status of virtual currencies, issued a public notice cautioning the public that \u201cBitcoin and similar products are not legal tender nor are they regulated in Kenya. The public should therefore desist from transacting in Bitcoin and similar products\u201d. On 18 December, 2015 the CBK again issued Banking Circular No 14 of 2015, which cautioned, \u2018all financial institutions against dealing in virtual currencies or transacting with entities that are engaged in virtual currencies. Financial institutions are expressly advised not to open accounts for any person dealing in virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. Failure to comply with this directive would lead to appropriate remedial action from the Central Bank\u2019.\n\nJust like South Africa, Kenya also has no specific legal framework tailored specially for its Fintech sector. One therefore sees the fintech sphere being regulated by a variety of statutes and rules governing various financial products, services and market participants, as well as other provisions of more general application.\n\nThe lack of specifically tailored regulations to govern the fintech sector, seen in Kenya and South AFrica, leaves regulators at each point, responding to issues that arise individually. This leaves a gap for potential conflicts in regulating fintech, and reveals a situation where the regulatory environment would keep lagging behind technology.\n\nThe ban by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) negatively impacted thousands of Nigerians who have lately been drawn by technology to investing in foreign securities. Untoward hardship to fintech platforms such as Bamboo, Trove, and Risevest who work with local and foreign brokerage firms in allowing Nigerians to invest and trade in stocks listed on the Nigerian and foreign stock exchanges.\n\nLogistics policies in Nigeria\n\nThe Lagos State Government on 27 January 2020 enforced a regulatory ban which restricted the operation of commercial bikes and tricycles on major roads within the state, stating that \u201cafter consultations with stakeholders, the State Security Council, in compliance with the extant Transport Sector Reform Law 2018, has decided to commence enforcement of the law which bans the operation of Okada and Keke in six Local Government Areas and nine Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs)\u201d. This ban forced unplanned pivots and total shutdowns of services for hitherto thriving local organisations like Gokada and ORide. The regulatory blizz also extended to the regulation of online ride-hailing companies like Uber and Bolt with the enforcement of the requirement for a service entity regulatory permit provisional application/renewal \u2013 \u20a610 million licence fee for service entities with 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; \u20a625 million for those with more than 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; with the provisional license subject to an annual renewal with a renewable fee of \u20a65 million for every 1000 and \u20a610 million for every 1001 and above unit of e-hailing taxi. It also mandated that 10% of every transaction by the passenger to the ride-hailing operators must be paid to the state government. At the national level the new guideline for the regulation of logistics and courier companies which increased the license fees for logistics companies and courier services was also approved on July 23, 2020. The amount mandated as licensing and renewal fees is shocking, as it creates an impediment for most players in the sector, who are mostly struggling MSMEs without the economic wherewithal to afford the fees.\n\nAn immediate implication of the ban of commercial bikes and tricycles was the drastic unemployment it resulted in across a broad base of lagos. Unemployment directly correlates to an upsurge in crimes and insecurity.\n\nData and Infrastructure in South Africa and Kenya\n\nThe draft National Policy on Data and Cloud which is generally aimed at \u201cexploiting opportunities presented by the digital economy, through the development of policy frameworks that harness the economic and social potential of data and cloud computing\u201d was recently released (April 1 2021) .\n\nThe Draft Data Protection (General) Regulations 2021 of Kenya also introduces data localisation, while among other provisions, requiring countries or territories to which personal data is transferred, to have ratified the African Union Convention on CyberSecurity and Personal Data Protection. This provision apart from restricting the free flow of data needed for a digital economy to thrive, includes a requirement for ratification of a convention which Kenya itself is yet to ratify.\n\nAlthough the goal of the policies might be applauded, their restriction on cross-border transfer of data through local storage and processing of data is capable of affecting productivity and innovation, and ousting the countries\u2019 startups.\n\nDigital Tax policies in South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda and Kenya\n\nSouth Africa was the first, in 2014, to tax digital services by imposing a 14% value added tax (VAT) on digital imports. Several African countries have since followed its steps.\n\nThe Nigerian Finance Act for instance imposes 5% VAT on online transactions.\n\nIn Uganda 74% of businesses reported a reduction in earnings following the imposition of digital tax \u2013 excise duty on over-the-top services over the internet \u2013 in the country. This same proposal for digital tax was only shut down by the Benin Government after a peaceful protest was staged by its people.\n\nIn 2013, the National Treasury of Kenya introduced a 10% excise duty on money transfer services.\n\nGovernments rightly claim taxing digital services helps to raise revenue for ailing economies \u2013 totally plausible IF funds raised were channeled into providing infrastructure and enabling more innovation. This has not been the case however \u2013 digital tax policies and laws have mainly been used to restrict digital activity of citizens, infringing on their digital rights.\n\nSo why should YOU care, I hear you ask? This long story, we know all about it \u2013 it\u2019s not stopping bread from getting to my table.\n\nQuestion is: is it not?\n\nFrom an increased cost in basic services you have come to take for granted \u2013 from hailing a bike by app, phone call or on the side of the road to the inability to afford to continue to feed your family with premium turkey or listen to your favourite artiste due to new Copyright rules that don\u2019t support Fair Use principles.\n\nWhy? Because hey you can no longer ride uber at an affordable rate (Hi, Hackney permit), through to it getting harder to shop for that item from Senegal since the taxes on it are higher (that\u2019s if the customs barriers are surmounted by AfCFTA) and it becoming significantly harder (if at all possible) for you to get timely help by raising a social media cry for help.\n\nSo you see, it matters. It touches you. Not just the \u2018big businesses\u2019 or the start ups \u2013 You. As Nigerians like to say, \u201c\u2026 o di kwa serious?!\u201c\n\nOver the next few \u2018musings\u2019 I will ponder on what we should be prioritising and why. If the data allows and my brain strings the words I will project on the impact \u2013 possibly speak to the future.\n\nTill next time \u2013 keep musing \ud83d\ude09\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Cabal | Author @techcabal",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, July 5, 2021, Nigeria-based digital freight startup, MVX, announced a $1.3 million seed round to tackle the challenge of financing and booking freight operations in Africa. Investors in this round include Kepple Africa Ventures, Launch Africa Ventures, Founders Factory and some angel investors\n\nThis comes after the startup secured a $100,000 pre-seed investment from Oui Capital in 2019.\n\nPer TechCrunch, MVX wants to ease trade finance and freight shipping in Africa by making the process available online.\n\nAccording to Tonye Membere-Otaji, CEO, \u201cWe make it easy and convenient for businesses. We handle everything because we have all these service providers in one platform. So as shippers work with us, MVX works with like seven to ten other service providers.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Membere-Otaji, working at a maritime logistics company, came up with the idea for MVX when he found that there was no online marketplace for vessels. He launched the company with Tobi Amusan, CTO, in 2019 as MVXchange.\n\nAt that point, the company was only a support vehicle booking platform. It connected vessel requests with available Offshore Support Vessels (OSVs).\n\nHowever, the company needed to change its model in 2020 after the oil demand dwindled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Membere-Otaji told TechCrunch that the demand for fossil fuels would reduce over the next few decades.\n\nNow, the company helps businesses to move freight, provides finance and payment solutions for freight operators. This means merchants without adequate capital can request loans to help facilitate freight services. These services are now available on one platform \u2014 MVX.\n\nIn 2021, the company says it has recorded over 300 shipments and plans to reach 1500 before year-end.\n\nTrade Africa still has a long way to go. According to The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTD), Africa accounts for only 2.5% and 3% of exports and imports of world merchandise trade value, respectively. MVX hopes to empower trade on the continent offline and online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Jimmy\u2019s experience in the technology, start-up and innovation space greatly enhances our team\u2019s credentials for expansion into the US market,\u201d Agboola says.\n\nAlthough Ku\u2019s appointment implies Flutterwave will begin focusing on the US market, it\u2019s unclear how it intends to compete in such a competitive market. The startup will be going against some of the biggest fintech companies like Square, and PayPal, which operates in more than 200 countries.\n\nWe reached out to Flutterwave for some clarity on its business strategy but were yet to get a response as of press time.\n\nWhile Flutterwave\u2019s expansion into the US could encourage more African startups to penetrate the world\u2019s largest economy, it\u2019s unclear if Flutterwave will continue the same business model it runs in Africa.\n\nRecall that Flutterwave partnered with PayPal, an American online payments system, to allow African merchants to receive payments from PayPal users across the globe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, it recently partnered with other US fintech giants like Forter and Worldpay FIS to accelerate digital financial payments solutions around the world.\n\nIn March 2021, Flutterwave became a unicorn after raising $170 million in Series C funding. And in July 2021, the payments platform appointed former MTN and Visa executive, Oluwabankole Falade, as its new Chief Regulatory and Government Relations Officer.\n\nFlutterwave believes that the US market is a huge market for local businesses looking to simplify payments while providing goods and services to their customers.\n\nAgboola expects Ku\u2019s experience in the tech and startup space to help Flutterwave\u2019s US expansion while he helps to create new products and services.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Having occupied seven roles before this in the company, hers is a story of perseverance and growth.\n\nFrom overcoming financial challenges during university to writing 25 job applications daily post-NYSC, it is safe to say Akalia has a never-say-die spirit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGuess what! She\u2019s only just begun.\n\nOur Senior Reporter, Oluwanifemi Kolawole, takes us on an interesting journey through the life of Akalia: Rachael Akalia\u2019s remarkable journey to becoming Patricia Technologies\u2019 brand manager\n\nAlida School and Africa\u2019s tech talents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlida School co-founder and CEO, Dauda Barry at Adama Robotics. Source: Supplied\n\nThe issue of small tech talent pools plagues Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem. With tech startups springing up on the continent, finding the right talents in Africa could become increasingly difficult.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s Joy Matthew takes a look at how an online coding school is doing its part to ensure the continent\u2019s tech ecosystem is not starved of talents in the future.\n\nRead: Inside Alida School\u2019s plans to raise Africa\u2019s next generation of tech talents\n\nKoo plans official registration in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: The Heritage Times\n\nOn Tuesday, August 3, 2021, Indian microblogging platform, Koo, announced plans to register in Nigeria. Per The Guardian, the platform\u2019s Business Development Consultant, Sameer Yeshwanth, said the social media platform would be the first to do so.\n\n\u201cWe are going to register with the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC); Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), and comply with all relevant local content laws of the country through the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA).\u201d\n\nWhat does this mean? A formal registration by Koo means it\u2019ll pay taxes. Recently, the Federal Government of Nigeria announced plans to tax profits made by tech firms \u2014 Google, Twitter, and Facebook \u2014 not based in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKoo\u2019s announcement is coming after a ban on Twitter was announced on Friday, June 4, 2021.\n\nInterestingly, the Nigerian government created an account on Koo two weeks after the Twitter ban.\n\nAnother interesting fact: According to Republic TV, the Koo app was created at the AatmaNirbhar App Innovation Challenge \u2014 an event hosted by the Indian government.\n\nLike Nigeria, India has had a falling out with Twitter. What do you think this means?\n\n$10,000 per month for YouTube creators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: The Verge\n\nWhat\u2019s going on? YouTube wants to start paying YouTube Shorts creators $10,000 monthly.\n\nWhat\u2019s YouTube Shorts? YouTube Shorts, is in simple terms, TikTok on YouTube. It\u2019s a feature that allows you to scroll through short videos. It was launched in the US in March as TikTok\u2019s competition.\n\nSo you earn $10k monthly for being a creator? Not so fast. According to The Verge, monthly payments will be made, but this is not guaranteed. YouTube has terms and conditions for eligible creators.\n\nTerms and conditions? Yes, your videos need a certain number of views. Although YouTube was not specific, it said the amount of the views required to be eligibl will be based on how much people use the feature.\n\nBased on viewership, creators can earn between $100 and $10,000. The videos also need to be original, meaning you cannot make a video on TikTok and post it on YouTube.\n\nThis is part of YouTube\u2019s $100 million Shorts fund that will be paid to creators throughout next year. However, the video streaming platform will start the first round of payments this month.\n\nSign me up! Sadly, the payout is only available in ten countries for now. Per Variety, the countries include the US, UK, Nigeria, South Africa, and Japan.\n\nShort-form videos: YouTube isn\u2019t the only platform with short-form videos. Since TikTok started it in 2017, Instagram rivalled it with Reels and Snapchat with Spotlight.\n\nWhat does this mean? We might see some cross-carpeting. Would TikTok creators turn to YouTube to get a piece of the $100 million?\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nWhat If You Could Do It All Over? Read\n\nWhy Apple Employees Are Quitting.

The scheme is borne out of our desire to fast-track development of infrastructure across the state, as the government can\u2019t do it alone.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI want to encourage companies, shareholders and individuals who have business interests in Edo State, or companies making money through production, that the government is ready to further partner with them in the area of giving them tax credit, which will be utilised to expand Infrastructure in the state.\u201d\n\nObaseki urged those already collecting tax credits from Federal Government but operating in the state to apply such tax credits to some of the communities where they do their businesses, adding, \u201cthis country is going to grow on the back of the investment being made by the private sector and their tax contributions will finance both state and federal governments in the years ahead\u201d.\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cThe Federal Government is doing the same as some major companies are benefiting and some of them have operations in Edo, but using it in other states. We encourage them to utilize the tax credit in the area they are making money rather than taking it somewhere else.\n\n\u201cWe want to encourage more Investors to invest in Edo State as the government has put all measures on ground to protect investors coming into the state, as we would not allow those that want to discourage investors in the state.\n\n\u201cToday is historic because the state is doing something that has not been done before except by the federal government. We have realized that looking into the future, the sources of financing government activities will come mostly from the private sector.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Chief Executive Officer of Saro Group of Companies, Mr. Rasheed Sarumi, hailed the governor for the tax credit.\n\n...",

          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Board of Trustees (BoT) met on Thursday to resolve the leadership and other internal crises rocking the party.\n\nThe BoT Chairman, Walid Jibrin, in his remarks at the meeting held at the PDP national secretariat in Abuja, said that it became necessary to tackle numerous problems requiring the attention of the highest advisory body and conscience of the party.\n\nHe said now was the right time for PDP to put its house in order to enable it prepare for its upcoming elective convention for the election of its national leaders, as well as prepare for the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cIn order to achieve complete success, we must do away with personal interest and unnecessary in-house fighting, capable of killing the objectives set by the party.\u201d\n\nHe said the board must look critically at the party approved organs, advising all to wake up by functioning very well, in order to fulfil the dreams of PDP\u2019s forefathers.\n\n\u201cIn the light of the foregoing, it is very important therefore, that the BoT being the conscience of the party, must today come up with necessary strategy for election of our national leadership, based on free and fair election that will produce credible and competent officers of our party,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Jibrin noted that the BoT was always ready to listen to any group, committee, or individual with good intentions for the party, aimed at promoting peace and unity in PDP and Nigeria.\n\nHe urged the BoT to put their collective interest ahead any personal interests, in making sure that PDP new leaders emerged only through free and fair election at the national convention.\n\n\u201cThere is also need to take a firm stand to drastically reduce suits by aggrieved members, by following procedures enshrined in the PDP constitution, before referring any matter to court.\n\n\u201cAnyone that takes the party to court should be seriously disciplined,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Jibrin, a former senator, stressed the need to look at why many past PDP national chairmen, Audu Ogbeh, Okwesilieze Nwodo, Bamanga Tukur, Ahmed Mua\u2019zu and Ali Modu Sheriff, did not complete their tenures successfully.\n\n\u201cWe must sit with the national chairman and the NWC, to come out with decisions that will make our party strongest.\n\n\u201cWhile truth is bitter, we must cope with the bitterness by taking serious actions to handle this situation,\u201d he added.\n\nMr Jibrin also disclosed that he had completed all arrangements with the PDP Governor\u2019s Forum, the National Assembly Caucus and Forum of State Chairmen, for effective consultation on the way forward for the party.\n\nIn his remarks, the PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus, said the meeting was critical, not only for members of the NWC, but the entire PDP.\n\nMr Secondus said it was time for the party to brace up and come out very strong and even stronger.\n\n\u201cI believe that in every human endeavour where there are issues, the issues must be tabled, discussed and solutions proffered. Those solutions will make our party strong,\u201d Secondus said.\n\nBriefing the BoT on the state of the party, including the pending congress in nine states, Mr Secondus said the reconciliation committee had done great work in Plateau and Niger.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said for the remaining states, forms were being sold to those who wanted to contest.\n\nMr Secondus said that after the state congresses, PDP was looking forward to a smooth and peaceful convention coming up in December, adding that the office of the national organising secretary was already preparing.\n\n\u201cSoon, the schedule of events, timetable and others shall be presented before the caucus, BoT, NEC and all organs of our party for action, leading to the convention,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the seven deputy members of principal working committee of the party that resigned, he said the NWC met them on the day they tendered their letters.\n\n\u201cWe also met with them on Wednesday. We quickly deployed the internal conflict resolution mechanism so that the issues are not escalated to the point that our party will be greatly damaged.\n\n\u201cYou are aware that the national youth leader took a stand that is outside the conduct of our normal process of settling grievances.\n\n\u201cWe believe that issues of this nature must be handled quickly and swiftly, so that we can get back to the business of conducting free and fair conventions for a smooth transition,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Secondus said that anything contrary to the smooth running of the party in the remaining three months would not be good for the PDP.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the meeting had Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers, PDP National Secretary, Umar Tsauri, Deputy National Chairman, North, Suleiman Nazif and immediate past president of the senate, Bukola Saraki, in attendance.\n\nOthers included former senate presidents, David Mark and Adolphus Wabara; former Kaduna State governor, Ahmed Makarfi, former Niger governor, Babangida Aliyu; and former ministers Tanimu Turaki and Tom Ikimi.\n\n(NAN)",

Sections 177 and 182 of the 1999 Constitution which make provisions for qualifications and disqualification of candidates for governorship election are exhaustive and leave no room for any addition.\n\n\u201cThat no other law/act can be relied upon to disqualify a candidate in an election save for the provisions of Section 182 of the 1999 Constitution.

          "text": "A young boy named Ezekiel, 27, has been killed while five others have sustained several gunshot injuries when the Borno Geographic Information Service (BOGIS) destroyed a church located at Moduganari area of Maiduguri, Borno state.\n\nThe staff of the Borno Geographic Information Service, which is responsible for land maintenance, were said to have entered the community with a grading truck around 11 a.m. and brought down the worship Centre without informing the church\u2019s owners.\n\nAccording to sources, the incident was properly managed to ensure it did not spread to other parts of the state that have been ravaged by insurgent activities in the last 13 years, even as the Christian victim\u2019s body was deposited at the Mortuary, University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital, UMTH, while others who sustained gunshot wounds awaited treatment.\n\nBOGIS is a state-run body founded by Governor Babagana Umara Zulum\u2019s current administration and responsible with managing land issues in the state.\n\nEngineer Adam Bababe, the agency\u2019s leader, could not be reached for comment when journalists went to see him in his office.\n\nHowever, Reverend Shawulu Auta Ndahi, the Reverend in charge of the Local Church a.k.a Church of Brethren in Nigeria (Ecliziyan Yanuwa a Nigeria, E.Y.N) in Hausa parlance, Maduganari, Maiduguri metropolis, confirmed the incident to our correspondent, saying, \u201cWe received a distress call this morning that some of my people, mostly Youths at one of our Local Church Branch.\n\n\u201cFrom the information, I have at hand, it clear was that some BOGIS officials went and demolished one of our Church in Maduganari, unfortunately, the said church and the land was never marked for demolition, and this did not go down well with our Christian Youths who started protesting, in the process, some security men suspected to be members of civilian JTF opened fire on our protesting youths, killing one of them and injured five. As I am talking to you right now, I am with the victims at the Accident and Emergency Unit, UMTH.\n\n\u201cBut I promised to get in touch with our leaders and the next step forward\u201d. Ndahi stated.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, late Ezekiel was shot at the chest by men of the civilian joint taskforce who accompanied and provided protection for the men of the agency while demolishing the Church.\n\nAnother witness, Helen Moyo disclosed that the CJTF were in Hilux vans fully armed with guns and immediately they alighted from the vans they headed to the labourers at Church building site and seized their gadgets, \u201cimmediately they came down from their vehicles they headed to the labourers and began seizing their phones.

The Church decided to extend and erect a befitting building, it was in the process of building the Church that the BOGIS officials came and destroyed the building without giving them the chance to bring out any belongings.\n\n\u201cCanopies were used to cover the site for worshippers, the local church council at Maduganari decided to erect a building to replace the canopies. But then, the Church council also approved for the extension of the Church, so we dug the foundation for the extension and we are yet to even lay a block on the dug foundation.

          "text": "secession is not the solution to the challenges confronting the country. Kano state governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, has urged secession agitators in the country to embrace dialogue as an option in the interest of national unity, adding that\n\nThe Kano State governor also warned that the continent of Africa will lose its respect in the committee of nations in the world if Nigeria ceases to exist as a Nation.\n\nGanduje spoke Thursday in Abuja at the second public lecture series organized by the APC Press Corps with the topic; \u201cSustaining a united and indivisible Nigeria: A myth or reality\u201d.\n\nThe Kano governor said the advocates of secession should have a change of heart and recommended dialogue as a crucial option for addressing their problems.\n\n\u201cThe world will not respect Africa anymore if Nigeria comes to harm and our \u2018Mandela The Great\u2019 won\u2019t sleep well if we blow up this opportunity to lead the black race. That is why we the leaders need to come together to appeal to our aggrieved people who are agitating for self-determination at this time.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Biafran\u2019 agitators and a small section of the Yoruba nation agitating for Oduduwa Republic should therefore always have this at the back of their minds in their political calculations and transformations. It is on record that the great Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first president of Nigeria, was an Igbo man and also a perfect negotiator and foremost champion of Nigeria\u2019s unity.\n\n\u201cThe same for the great Chief Obafemi Awolowo. He never agitated for secession. He was loud and clear on restructuring the federation. And that demand is even louder and the debate is on and no one is troubling agitators for agitating for restructuring of the federation. What is more, the governing party, the APC has a working document already on this (restructuring). This is the way we should all go. There should be no secession distraction at this time.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ganduje, there is a National Assembly where some of the grievances can be addressed. Because dialogue is a far better alternative that costs less than the consequences of the wedge that has been erected to frustrate more flow of conversations between the government and citizens to arrive at a national consensus.\n\n\u201cIt is very important at this time that we should use the media for the promotion of peace and stability and change the viewpoints that could alter public views and sentiment toward a more peaceful resolution of our multi-faceted current crises.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, Nigeria will remain united. Let\u2019s not entertain any fear. We have become too fused to be divided. Where do you want Aliko Dangote, Africa\u2019s richest man whose net worth is more than $15.9 billion with his business headquarters in Lagos to go? He is more of a Lagos person than Kano. What of his brother of the BUA Group, Abdussamad Isyaka Rabiu who owns a Nigerian conglomerate active in cement production too? He too is entrenched in the South. Do we see them in Kano as much as we see them in Lagos and the South?\n\n\u201cSimilarly, what do we do with the likes of Rochas Okorocha, former Imo state governor and now Senator representing Imo West Senatorial District in the South East. His investments in northern Nigeria and other parts of the country, providing free education for many years now. So also the Sarki (Oba) Yoruba in Kano, Engr. Murtala Alimi Otisese, a business magnate, an entrepreneur, and a philanthropist. He is from Ibadan in the South West but with flourishing business in the North.\n\nIn his welcome address, chairman APC Press corps, Mr. Jide Orintunsin, said the lecture series was part of APC Press Corps\u2019 contributions towards deepening Nigeria\u2019s thriving democracy.\n\n\u201cThe series is aimed at providing workable template options for effective good governance and to serve as a medium for the deepening of democratic norms and institutions by engaging key players in politics, public administration, academia, and the economy.",

Sonny Echono has expressed dissatisfaction over the poor examination facilities in most Nigerian Schools.\n\nDisclosing this during the monitoring of the conduct of the ongoing internal NECO exams in Abuja Thursday, Echono encouraged schools to not only keep exam halls clean but also make them comfortable places for students to write exams.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary, who noted there was a marginal improvement in the lighting and ventilation in the two schools visited, Government Secondary School Garki, Abuja and Federal Government Boys College Apo, Abuja, also observed with dismay that, some examination desks and hall tiles were broken.\n\nAccording to him, molding the children is not only in academics but also in their character and environment.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned about places they write exams. I saw marginal improvement in terms of lightening and ventilation of examination hall but still, bot satisfy with the facilities of the exam like a desk, some are broken down even the halls themselves, the broken tiles,\u201d he said.\n\nHe encouraged schools to make sure hygiene and cleanliness are part of the exam arrangements.\n\nStressing the need to embrace technical education, Echono revealed that NECO and NABTEB registration numbers dropped due to economic hardship in the country and the widespread acceptance of WAEC over the two aforementioned.\n\nNigerian Pilot gathered that 1.3million students registered for 2021 SSCE against 1.5 that registered last year.\n\nEchono blamed the state government for being responsible for the low registration, saying that most NECO candidates lack support as states are still owing them, therefore, called for full enforcement to ensure that they are supported.\n\n\u201cEconomic hardship is what parents complain about the number of exams they register for. Parents register for WAEC due to the general belief that WAEC is widely accepted both outside the country than NECO but both of them have the same recognition nationally. But when it comes to kids going abroad WAEC is higher than NECO which explains the decision parents take when they are unable to pay for the two examinations. The same with what NABTEB is suffering from,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on the security situation of schools, Echono said the Nigerian government has put all the necessary security measures to ensure that schools are safe.\n\nHe said the report of the Sub Committee on the provision of security for schools will soon be submitted.\n\nEchono also revealed that the government is involving Police and vigilante groups to ensure schools are safe.",

          "text": "Governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, have welcomed the Supreme court written judgment that has put paid to speculations about the legality of the governor Mai Mala Buni-led national caretaker of the party.\n\nIn a statement signed by the chairman of Progressive Governors Forum and governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, the APC governors lauded the apex court for being explicit in its written judgment released on Wednesday, August 4, 2021.\n\nThe highest court of the land had on Wednesday, July 28, 2021, pronounced its split decision on the Appeal and Counter Appeals before it in the judgment of Ondo Gubernatorial Election petition affirming the election of governor Rotimi Akeredolu.\n\nBut the minority judgment of three justices of the supreme court had prompted cause to question the legality of the position of Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni , as national chairman of APC.\n\nPrior to the release of the written judgment, a lot of analysis and interpretations had been made, with some opinions suggesting the immediate resignation of Buni, dissolution of the caretaker committee as well as suspension of the planned ward congresses.\n\nAccording to the governors, the early release of the written judgement had availed the public with the judgement of the court, which settled issues conclusively.\n\nParts of the statement reads, \u201cWe thank the Supreme Court for this landmark judgement, which among others have dealt conclusively with legality of the APC Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, its composition and all its decisions.\n\n\u201d The Supreme Court upheld the finding of the Court of Appeal that the National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee \u201cwas set up to act on behalf of the National Executive Committee to temporarily carry out the function of the National Working Committee until new members were democratically elected.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court upheld further the ruling of the Court of Appeal that \u201cit is evident that the said Governor Mai Mala Buni was appointed only in an acting capacity on a temporary basis to temporarily carry out and fill in the seat of the National Chairman of the party pending the elections of new members.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe holding of the Court of Appeal was not appealed against by the appellants i.e. Eyitayo Jegede S.A.N, Gubernatorial Candidate of the PDP in the last election in Ondo state and the Peoples Democratic Party. According to the Supreme Court \u201cby not appealing against this holding, the parties herein accept it as correct, conclusive and binding upon them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe judgement has also settled the legality of the National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee. The court has correctly ruled that in line with section 13.3 of the APC Constitution, the National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee was constituted by the National Executive Council of the APC to act as the National Working Committee. This ruling is consistent with the legal advice available to APC in creating the Committee and we commend the Party\u2019s legal team for the proper and lawful guidance.\n\n\u201cGovernor Mai Mala Buni was appointed in acting capacity, on a temporary basis to temporarily carryout and fill in the seat of the National Chairman of the party pending the election of new National Chairman. This has settled conclusively that the APC National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee and its composition is not in conflict with the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and is consistent with provisions of the Constitution of the APC.\n\n\u201cWe congratulate all Nigerians, in particular APC members and supporters across the country. We celebrate this landmark judgement together with all APC leaders, especially President Muhammadu Buhari whose zeal to bequeath a democratic party built bottom up for the benefit of Nigerians. We congratulate our colleague, His Excellency Rotimi Akeredolu S.A.N. for the reaffirmation of his electoral victory, which has now ended all electoral disputes around the Ondo State 2020 Governorship elections.\u201d",

This, he explained, is because they are not being owed.\n\nThe doctors had insisted that they had no choice but to opt for the strike at the start of the action.\n\nThey argued that the government never hold talks with them until they take drastic action.\n\n\u201cUsually there is no negotiation done until we go on a strike,\u201d said the President of the Association of Resident Doctors at the National Hospital in Abuja, Dr Akanimo Ebong told Channels Television on Monday.\n\nThe resident doctors had gone on strike earlier this year, suspending the action after 10 days on April 10.\n\nThey are unhappy with what happened after that.\n\n\u201cWe never called it (the strike) off, we only suspended it to give time for negotiations. But since we called off the strike on April 10, barely anything has been done,\u201d Dr Ebong said.\n\nThe latest strike followed a meeting of the National Executive Council (NEC) of NARD in Umuahia, the Abia State capital.\n\nIssues raised by the medical practitioners include the immediate payment of all salaries owed to all house officers, including March salaries (regardless of quota system) before the end of business on March 31.\n\nThey are also asking for an upward review of the hazard allowance to 50 per cent of consolidated basic salaries of all health workers and payment of the outstanding COVID-19 inducement allowance, especially in state-owned-tertiary institutions.",
