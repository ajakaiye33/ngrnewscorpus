          "title": "Arrested at 17, scavenger cries for help from prison; suffered stroke",
          "text": "Ibrahim Sarafa\u2026 bedridden.\n\nBy Henry Ojelu\n\nGrowing up in the streets of Ibadan, Oyo State, Ibrahim Sarafa didn\u2019t have big dreams like his mates. Raised by a single mother with many other siblings after his father died, Sarafa could only manage to attend a local primary school which he never completed.\n\nHis chances of completing primary education and proceeding to secondary school were further dashed when his mother who later remarried into a polygamous home, died, leaving him and his siblings under the care of their stepfather.\n\nRead Also:\n\nAt 14, Sarafa broke ranks with his second family, took to the streets and began to fend for himself.\n\nA huge refuse dump in the Sabo area of Ibadan soon became his permanent residence as he joined other homeless children and scavengers to ransack the dumpsite for useful scraps to sell. The proceeds from selling scraps weren\u2019t much but it was enough to keep him from hunger.\n\nFor three years, Sarafa was contented with his little income and dirty sleeping corner beside the dumpsite until one fateful day in 2018 when suddenly, Abolongo Medium Costodial Centre became his new residence.\n\nJourney to prison\n\nAccording to extract from a Police report, a phone accessory shop in Sabo was burgled on the night of June 16, 2018. When the shop owner and workers arrived in the morning and raised the alarm over the incident, a security guard in the area claimed he suspected Sarafa to be one of the armed robbers that broke into the shop.\n\nWhen asked for a proper means of identification to clear him of the suspicion, Sarafa had none. With no proof of the allegation or any of the items stolen from the shop found on him, Sarafa was handed over to the Amotekun Security Corps where he spent two weeks in a cell. No further suspect was arrested in connection with the allegation against Sarafa prompting the transfer of the matter to the State Criminal Investigation Department.\n\nAt the State SCID, Sarafa was tortured for weeks and later charged to court for armed robbery. From the Magistrate Court where his case was initially lodged on holden charge, the matter was moved to Ogun State High Court in 2019. After Sarafa\u2019s formal arraignment before the High Court, the matter suffered several adjournments due to failure of prosecution to produce witnesses in the matter.\n\nSafara suffers stroke in prison\n\nSarafa\u2019s ordeal took a turn for the worst when he suddenly fell sick while awaiting trial in prison. Attempts by the prison welfare officers to administer some form of treatment did not yield any positive result. His condition kept deteriorating by the day until he suffered a partial stroke.\n\nWith swollen legs and face and unable to move, Sarafa depended on the goodwill of fellow inmates for feeding and defecating. The stench from his prison corner was too horrible for inmates close to him to bear. With no relatives to reach out to, for help, Sarafa resigned to fate, hoping for the worst.\n\nJudge shows compassion\n\nAt the next hearing of his case, Sarafa was assisted by fellow inmates into the courtroom after the prison bus had conveyed them to court. He was also assisted into the dock when his case was announced. Moved by Sarafa\u2019s horrible condition, the trial judge, Justice M.O Ishola consulted with prison officials in court about his health and resolved to release him on bail for better medical attention by his family.\n\nOn the orders of the judge, Sarafa later led prison warders to his stepfather\u2019s house in Akanran Ibadan. While the stepfather claimed he knew Sarafa as the first born of his late wife, the man however refused to show up in court to take custody of him. At a subsequent hearing date, the judge, worried about the defendant\u2019s health, asked who could take up his case.\n\nCJMR intervenes\n\nLuckily for Sarafa, a lawyer who is familiar with the activities of the Centre for Justice, Mercy and Reconciliation, CJMR, suggested the NGO to the court. The court registrar later contacted Pastor Hezekiah Olujobi who appeared before the court the next day and Sarafa was officially released to him for medical attention.\n\nSarafa speaks of his ordeal\n\nFollowing the effort of CJMR, Sarafa is currently receiving treatment at a private hospital in Ibadan. When Encounter sought to interview Sarafa on his hospital bed, he could barely talk. He, however, managed to say a few words: \u201cI didn\u2019t do what they accused me of doing.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to prison, I became very sick and later suffered a stroke. I was abandoned to die until the judge had mercy on me. Nobody came to visit me throughout my stay in prison. It is this Pastor that has been taking care of me since my release. I need help. People should please help me.\u201d\n\nCFMR appeals for support\n\nSpeaking on the challenges in rehabilitating Sarafa, Executive Director of CJMR, Pastor Hezekiah Olujobi described Sarafa as a collapsed building that needed to be rebuilt again. He explained that from the beginning, Sarafa\u2019s state of health was a source of worry because his condition was deplorable as he could not walk and his fellow inmates had to carry him to the dock.\n\n\u201cImmediately Sarafa was released to our organisation, we took him to a hospital which usually offers free medical attention to released inmates. Because of the critical nature of his health, he was admitted and placed in intensive care.\n\n\u201cCurrently, he needs somebody, a caregiver to stand by him, carry him, bathe him and take good care of him till his full recovery. He needs the care of a physiotherapist till he regains his health.\n\n\u201cDaily, Sarafa needs N12,000 to put him on the path of survival in addition to the free bed space already given by a doctor that partners CJMR. We appeal to all well-meaning Nigerians to help him.\u201d\n\nTo render help, financial assistance can be sent to: Save Ibrahim Sarafa with First Bank account: 2013454021.\n\nVanguard News",

He urged the people to desist from being used by overzealous politicians to witch-hunt others and that such a situation is rather worrisome.\n\n\u201cSadly enough, some of our people in Delta State are being used to disorganise our own people for selfish political gains. A situation where some people could arrogantly betray their own brothers is very much worrisome. This situation is rather satanic and not a politics\n\n\u201cWe have to promote ourselves because we are lacking in human capital development and we must look out for every opportunity to assist ourselves because it is when there are many trees in the forest that they can stand against the storm.\n\n\u201cWe must look for opportunities politically, socially and economically in order to position Urhobos for the task ahead because if you are not well fed, you cannot even play politics.\n\n\u201cAs a nation, we must build people to stand and defend Urhobo nation tomorrow. The Urhobo nation is not where it should be at all levels and this must change.\n\n\u201cWhatever support I am giving today is for our children to stand up for the Urhobo nation tomorrow. We need to build people now through human capital development.\u201d\n\n\u201cUrhobo nation should deviate from in-fighting because this has brought it down economically, politically and otherwise. Economic empowerment should get to everybody and human capital development is the key,\u201d Adjogbe added.\n\nOn his part, the President-General of Urhobo Progressive Ambassadors, Hon. Mayor O. Mayor said, \u201cWe have seen that Adjogbe has the interest of Urhobo and the Urhobos should rely on him.\n\n\u201cWe have the pain of Urhobo and as the largest ethnicity in Delta and in Delta central, it has now become a minority in all sectors.\n\n\u201cWe came to award Olorogun Samuel Adjogbe, the Oyinvwin of Urhobo nation as the Universal Grand Ambassador of the Urhobo Progressive Ambassadors, we have seen his passion for the Urhobo nation and the society at large, thus we have made him our leader.\u201d\n\nThe occasion was attended by Chief Felix Ayovwe, the Otota of Evwreni kingdom, Prince Matthew Uba, Barr Mumakai Unagha and Mr. Fidelis Adjogbe. Others were Mr Peter Maison, the President-General of Unenurhie, Mr Tobi Edirin and a host of other members of the UPA and guests.",

But let me just say that if a matter is in court, the matter is sub-judice and we are not supposed to comment on it.

But it goes ahead to say that provided that in the case of such a withdrawal or death of the candidate, the political parties affected shall within the occurrence of the event hold a fresh primary election to produce and submit a fresh candidate to the commission for the election concerned.\u201d\n\nInitially, Tinubu had submitted Masari\u2019s name to INEC as a placeholder ahead of the deadline for submission of running mates.\n\nAlso, Obi submitted the name of Okupe as his placeholder.\n\nHowever, Tinubu and Obi substituted the initial names with Kashim Shettima and Baba-Ahmed respectively.",

He made the clarification on while constituting the panel on Thursday. The Nation reports that the move followed a directed issued to the CJ by the state lawmakers in a bid to remove the deputy governor from office.\n\nRecall that an Oyo State High Court presided over by Justice Ladiran Akintola on Thursday dismissed a suit filed by Olaniyan challenging the propriety of the procedures by the lawmakers.

          "title": "As deadline for submission of running mates\u2019 names expires : Muslim-Muslim ticket: APC adamant",
          "text": "From Fred Itua, Aidoghie Paulinus, Fred Ezeh, Abuja and Gyang Bere, Jos\n\nAs the deadline for the submission of substantive running mates to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) expires, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and its presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu appear to be sticking to their choice of Kashim Shettima as Vice Presidential candidate, in spite of pleas and agitations from Christian leaders and leaders of his party for them to rescind the decision.\n\nThis is even as Christian leaders, especially the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and Catholic Bishops Conference, have renewed their hostility against APC\u2019s same-faith ticket.\n\nTinubu, a Yoruba Muslim from the South West, following his emergence as the candidate of the APC, had been under pressure to pick a Northern Christian as his running mate.\n\nThere were pressures from Christian leaders and moderate Muslims from the North on the former Lagos State governor to respect the country\u2019s religious sensitivity and diversity in picking a running mate.\n\nDespite the pressure, however, Tinubu settled for a former governor of Borno State, Kashim Shettima, who is also a Muslim. The choice has not gone down well with many Nigerians, notably Northern Christians, who threatened to work against Tinubu if he didn\u2019t rescind his decision.\n\nTheir agitations seemed to have hit the rocks when President Muhammadu Buhari, who in 2015 rejected a same-faith ticket, endorsed Tinubu\u2019s choice. APC governors and the leaders of the party, also endorsed the candidacy of Shetima, as Tinubu\u2019s potential deputy.\n\nSaturday Sun reliably gathered that the choice of Shettima, has pitted Christian leaders against their Muslim counterparts. It also revealed that the decision has energised the Muslim base in the North, who are comfortable with a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nThe source, who doesn\u2019t want to he named, said if the current squabbles continue, it may work in Tinubu\u2019s favour when elections hold in February, 2023.\n\nHe revealed that though Atiku is a Northern Muslim, his traditional strongholds are the South East and South South. He lamented that Peter Obi, who is the candidate of the Labour Party, will drastically reduce Atiku\u2019s votes in the South.\n\nHe claimed that the North West, which appears to be indifferent, will play a deciding role in 2023 and may likely endorse Tinubu/Shetima.\n\nThe source claimed that Tinubu\u2019s men have started reaching out to top and respected Islamic leaders and clerics in the North, to push the narrative during Jumat on Fridays and urge their followers to endorse a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nThe source some moderate Muslim and APC leaders, who are opposed to the same-faith ticket, have warned that the move could lead to a religious crisis if not properly handled.\n\nHe said Kano, Kaduna, Katsina, Sokoto, Kebbi and Jigawa are the key states where Muslim clerics are being wooed by Tinubu\u2019s men.\n\n\u201cIn the coming days and weeks, we will see top Islamic clerics and leaders issuing statements and preaching in mosques to counter the position of Christian leaders. Once this squabble starts, it will energise APC\u2019s Muslim base in the North.\n\n\u201cIf Atiku and his men don\u2019t move fast, they\u2019ll be pushed to the defensive. Tinubu is a strategist and his men are working to change the narrative. The media will be recruited too to push this,\u201d the source told Saturday Sun.\n\nMeanwhile, Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of Nigeria (CBCN), has said as far as the 2023 election is concerned, its position on religious balancing of the presidential ticket remains unchanged.\n\nPresident of the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of Nigeria and Catholic Archbishop of Owerri, Most Revd (Dr) Lucius Ugorji, gave the hint while responding to Saturday Sun\u2019s inquiry.\n\nUgorji who was asked if the All Progressives Congress (APC) had reached out to the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of Nigeria on why they chose a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket and what condition the CBCN will give to APC in order to back down on the issue, referred our correspondent to a June 14, 2022, press statement issued by the Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria.\n\nIn the statement signed by the Secretary-General of the Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria, Very Rev. Fr. Zacharia Nyantiso Samjumi, and the Director, Social Communications, Very Rev. Fr. Michael Nsikak Umoh, the Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria noted that \u201cit is disheartening to observe that the conduct of most of our politicians seem to be going from bad to worse as we witnessed a show of shame and heightened ugly culture of money politics during the recently held primaries.\n\n\u201cWhile all this is going on, we must not lose sight of the fact that the unity of this country has, over the years, been maintained by a delicate balancing of the religious and the regional,\u201d the Catholic Secretariat of Nigeria said.\n\nThe Catholic Secretariat said with the present glaring crisis and division in the nation, a Muslim-Muslim ticket would be most insensitive and a tacit endorsement of the negative voices of many non-state actors who have been threatening this nation\u2019s unity and peaceful coexistence without an arrest.\n\n\u201cGoing by the Kaduna experience, we can perceive the havoc the Muslim-Muslim ticket has brought upon the predominantly Christian people of Southern Kaduna.\n\n\u201cWe therefore strongly advise those political parties toying with the divisive agenda to have a rethink by presenting a more inclusive ticket, while calling on all people of goodwill to resist this budding injustice that may be hatched against a cross section of the people.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), has debunked reports that Tinubu, had reached out to the Association to pacify it and secure its support ahead of the elections.\n\nPastor Bayo Oladeji, the media aide to CAN President, confirmed to Saturday Sun that neither APC nor its presidential candidate, Tinubu, had reached out to CAN as a kind of lobbying for not meeting their demand of fielding a northern Christian as his running mate.\n\n\u201cNothing like that has happened. Besides, whatever Tinubu or APC do now is already late because they know what they want to do and they have taken a decision on that. I raised several concerns long before the choice of Kashim Shettima, as APC vice presidential candidate was made public,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, chairman of CAN, Plateau State, Rev. Fr. Polycarp Lubo has declared that under no circumstance will Christians support the Muslim-Muslim ticket of APC.\n\nHe noted that unless the party reverses its decision, CAN will not encourage Christians to support the ticket in the spirit of fairness, justice and equity, taking into cognizance the peculiarity and diversity of Nigeria as a nation.\n\nFr. Lubo in an interview with Saturday Sun in Jos, said since the declaration, no APC stakeholder within or outside the state has reached out to CAN to solicit its support.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any channel of communication with the APC since the Muslim-Muslim ticket was mentioned. There is no information, no discussion and nobody has consulted us,\u201d he said.\n\nFr. Lubo expressed worry that if the APC gets away with its current decision, the country will continue to run on Muslim-Muslim ticket subsequently and insisted that the ticked should be opposed.",

          "title": "Dr Pogu, President, Middle Belt Forum:",
          "text": "National President of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr. Bitrus Pogu, has declared that there is a clear difference between the North and the Middle Belt, noting that the minority nationalities in the North which were never under the Sokoto Caliphate or the Borno Sultanate are regarded as Middle Belters. He asserted that the Fulani and the Kanuri had used the people of the Middle Belt in the past to actualise certain objectives but noted that such would no longer work, as the people had become wiser.\n\nIn an interview with VINCENT KALU, he lampooned the Muslim-Muslim ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, wondering if there was no competent Christian outside the Southern states. He also insisted that the Federal Government is insincere in its war against terrorists.\n\nWhat are your expectations from the 2023 general elections?\n\nIt\u2019s very clear. First of all, the expectations have to be on the premise of what you perceive will be very good for Nigeria. We have already indicated that by insisting that we wanted the emergence of a Southern president, who would take over from Buhari, a Northerner after eight years of governance of this country. Secondly, we want that Southerner to be somebody of character, who will reunite Nigeria and his behaviour would be devoid of the nepotism that we are seeing now. He will bring development in Nigeria having been dogged and committed to addressing insecurity, and from there, economic revival would come because without security, you cannot have economic push.\n\nThese are the main expectations. And given these facts, of course, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu has written himself off because in a pluralistic Nigeria, where we have seen insurgency of different forms that originated from the North, all of Islamic extraction \u2013 whether it is Boko Haram, Fulani herdsmen militia, etc. These are all Islamic and we want a president that would be devoid of these.\n\nSo, a president that selects his deputy also from the Islamic extraction; he is a Muslim and picks a vice president who is also a Muslim cannot be the kind of president that would address this situation. It can be perceived that such a person is automatically a Muslim bigot. We believe in a plural Nigeria, such should not be allowed. Unfortunately, the APC has written itself off in the equation of the president from the South.\n\nThen we look at who will do this job for us. Of course, you look at somebody who has the pedigree, who has the capacity and by 2023, someone like me as a person and I believe that the majority of the Middle Belters shared this view that someone like Peter Obi is a better candidate to carry us to the next level in Nigeria. I\u2019m not mincing words, I would say the North is not in the equation because we cannot have eight years of Northern misrule under whatever guise or pretence and have another eight years of another Northerner. So, I\u2019m not considering any Northern candidate. We should base our arguments, debates on principle, fair play, and equity and justice.\n\nBy 2023, I want a president from Southern extraction to resolve the problems that we are now facing so that we can have a better Nigeria and as things stand, I will not change and I believe Obi will do the job.\n\nBut has religion ever developed any country? And Tinubu said he picked his running mate based on competence\n\nIt has never. Countries like Turkey and others have jettisoned religious considerations in their development. However, the truth remains that if competence is the issue, then take a trip to Borno State and ask the people what competence that Kashim Shettima has to bring or add to the so-called \u2018competence\u2019 to make Nigeria a better place. They use this argument to justify the skewed nature of their reasoning because they are coming with Islamic agenda rather than Nigerian agenda.\n\nThey are toeing the line of religious bigotry, which is going to divide this country farther rather than pull it out of the kind of situation it is in. It is also telling on the APC. It is unfortunate that a party that people looked up onto in 2015 to save Nigeria has taken on this lane and everybody is lamenting. They started through propaganda and they are ending up in a mess, and I believe that Nigerians will teach them the right lesson.\n\nBut in 1979, Azikiwe the presidential candidate of Nigerian Peoples Party (NPP), a Southern Christian picked Ishaya Audu, a Northern Christian as running mate. Awolowo, a Southerner of the Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN) picked Philip Umeadi, a fellow Southern Christian as deputy. We saw it in 1993; Abiola and Kingibe were both Muslims. Why all this noise this time?\n\nWe are now suffering a serious insurgency situation, which we never experienced; it is a hydra headed insurgency situation. Staring from Boko Haram, we now have Fulani militia herdsmen, we have all sort of characters plaguing the whole country. All these characters have Islamic origin. Then, we are in a situation where Christians feel unsafe and where they say this one is Islamic; that one is Islamic. This started in the North-East and has spread across the North and has gone down the South by the same Northern groups of Islamic origin.\n\nAt a time like this, somebody will be so insensitive to feel that we can have a Muslim- Muslim ticket to add salt to injury. Such a person or group is totally insensitive or wants to inflame this country; wants to destroy it completely, or use religion to subdue this country. Anybody doing that is not a lover of Nigeria; he is a lover of his section or of his ideology or belief rather than Nigeria. You want to have Muslim- Muslim ticket in Nigeria? It is unthinkable; you think Nigerians are all fools that don\u2019t reason, and you said, you are looking for competence.\n\nIs he saying that it is only Shettima who is competent in the North and there is no Christian that is there to balance up? Then, something is wrong here. The APC and Tinubu himself are on a mission and that mission cannot be saving Nigeria or moving Nigeria forward.\n\nWhat do you make of the security situation in the country, with the recent spate of attacks?\n\nThese things are reaffirming what we continually say. Government through intelligence knows the location of bandits and terrorists. Secondly, the government has continually refused to allow our military free hands, especially the air force to bomb these people out of existence, which implies that the government is complicit. Thirdly, people are continually kidnapped, abducted by terrorists and bandits and they are using this ransom money to fund their programme. Before now, there were lots of speculations as to where their funding was coming from. Maybe, it became difficult for the people funding them to directly use the known channels and therefore to kidnap people for ransom became the norm. But, a government that acquired even some specialised aircraft like the Tuncano, helicopter gunships, etc. that knows the location of these people and wouldn\u2019t want to bomb them out of existence so that Nigeria will have peace, is a government that we believe is a party to this criminality. Whether it is acceptable in terms of debate, arguments, there are indices to show that this government is not interested in rooting out insurgency. Forget about the rhetoric by the president that, \u2018I have given the service chiefs order.\u2019 He is the Commander-in-Chief. The service chiefs get instructions from the Commander-in-Chief.\n\nThey leave our soldiers out there even though there is a lot of intelligence, air craft; we have drones that can survey whatever area, yet soldiers are left as lame ducks in their locations and these people will come and pounce on them unprepared and kill many of our troops. No wonder, some soldiers are deserting because they know that this system as constituted doesn\u2019t protect them. Let me start from the latest, the Kuje Prison, the attack on the president\u2019s convoy and the killing of the soldiers and other paramilitary forces in Niger. These things are part of plans by forces within the system, which we call government to undermine the territorial integrity of our nation. Kuje Prison is not in far away Maiduguri, Port Harcourt or Abia. It is in the federal capital, where you have all forms of military formations; all forms of police formations, including even in Kuje and these people can come and operate for over two hours and walk away. Any fighter aircraft can traverse the length and breadth of Nigeria in less than 30 minutes because of the speed they move at. We have helicopter gunships and with the air force all over the place, and these people, after their operation, walked away.\n\nThis government must be complicit, if not, even when they had operated; they cannot walk away. So, anybody telling me about the attack on the convoy of Mr. President, it could be arranged to make us feel that the president himself is also under attack. We are not a bunch of fools. If Kuje prison in Abuja can be attacked for two hours and then the attackers, including the inmates who were mainly Boko Haram officers can walk way, and not one arrested and nothing happened, it means this government doesn\u2019t deserve to be one.\n\nThen the second one, could these things that are happening be a pointer towards 2023? Nobody knows. They may be planning that if things are not moving their own way, they may truncate the entire process, but that one time will tell, but let all be prepared and watch and then know what to do because these people have clearly shown that they love themselves and what they believe rather than Nigeria. Anybody who loves Nigeria will not allow dangerous criminals to come to the federal capital and walk away. It is even a disgrace to the nation, but they don\u2019t mind whether it is a disgrace provided that their intension is satisfied. It is a pity that we have such ruler-ship at this time.\n\nWhat should be the campaign issues in 2023?\n\nWe need people who can take us out of the woods that we are in. What are the woods? Firstly, it is the security problems. We need somebody who would treat criminals out there as criminals, whether they are religious criminals or whatever type of criminals. Secondly, having addressed that, we need the person to tackle this economy head on. This government started, though with a lot of propaganda at an exchange rate of one dollar to about N198. Today, one dollar is about N612 or more. That is unacceptable. Prices of things from when they took over till now have tripled. I\u2019m not exaggerating. I used to buy one bag of 10kg of Semo for N1, 600, but today, it is selling for N6, 000. Fuel price has gone up. Things are just in a mess, and yet because it serves some interests, they use propaganda all over the place. We need a government that will correct this economic downturn. We need a government that will leave nepotism behind and take every Nigerian for who he is and make Nigerians to feel and have a sense of belonging that this country actually belongs to them, and not have appointments and everything important to the president\u2019s zone, tribes, religion. We need a president that will take off nepotism and take on nationhood and see Nigeria as a nation, not to have several nations within a country. We want a situation where the president will be a listening president, who will listen to wise counsel and wise counsel will direct him in the right direction. We want a president that will truly and seriously fight corruption. Economy cannot grow in a corrupt environment; so the president must be upright and also in the true sense of it, and not as Oshiomhole said one time that once you join APC, your sins are forgiven. We want a president that will say whether you are in my party or not, you are a Nigerian and you will be treated as a Nigerian and not as a sacred cow. With such attributes and others that would make Nigeria a better place, we will then have a government that would bring revival, bring reconstruction, bring renewal, bring sense of belonging, bring out the patriotism in Nigerians so that we can have a better nation, a nation that all of us can be proud of.\n\nYou seem to be quite angry today\n\nWhen some people think that we are a bunch of fools and treat us as such, then we have to speak to them strongly. It is unfortunate that we are in this kind of situation because they feel that we have not been reacting the way we should. They, from stage one, go to stage two and go to stage three and they continue. Otherwise, why would somebody say that he was choosing his deputy based on competence. Are there not competent people from the other sides of the divide to accommodate the plurality of Nigeria?\n\nNortherners will say that there should be no zoning because they have their agenda. Didn\u2019t we support Atiku in 2019? We did. Because we said it was the turn of the North at that time, and Southerners stayed off. Today, they came and said no zoning because they feel that they are the only ones who can be president in Nigeria. All others are incompetent and don\u2019t have brains. They are all first class geniuses and every other person is a moron or imbecile.\n\nBut you are a Northerner?\n\nRight from the time of former President Obasanjo, the North was defined. Even before Obasanjo when some Northern Christians from the Middle Belt extraction were appointed to some important positions, they came out and complained that these people appointed were not Northerners. Obasanjo asked them what is North, who is a Northerner? They feel you have to be a Fulani or Kanuri and a Muslim to be a Northerner. The others are accommodated, including minority Muslims, as second-class citizens within the process.\n\nI\u2019m a Middle Belter. When the British came, they met my little tribe and we had to be negotiated into the protectorate and so many other nationalities that now accept that they are Middle Belters. When the British came in 1902, they went to Biu and from there to Chibok, though our people resisted and there they went to Mungonu. They came to my place before they went to the Kanuri. At that time, the Shua Arabs ravaged the Kanuri nation. Our people, because of their resistance, the British had to come back and to fight them between November 1906 and February 1907. The records are there, it was not written by my tribe\u2019s man. There is a book trending where the British even called us the small Chibok tribe of savages because our people resisted the British.\n\nThese people in the North, who are neither under the caliphate nor the sultanate of Borno when the British came, are the Middle Belters. The Fulani and Kanuri don\u2019t regard us as Northerners. They used us as Northerners to achieve their objectives, to add to their numbers just as the British did even after the Wilinks Commission was established to carve a region each for the majorities of the North and the minorities. They don\u2019t consider us as Northerners and we thank them for that. They have used our forefathers, but we are now wiser. We know the history and we know what is going on and we stand as proud Middle Belters and we will fight our way through to get our correct position in Nigeria. We will partner with others to pull Nigeria out of the woods because these people for parochial, sectional interests want to deep Nigeria into a situation where nobody would say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m proud of my country.\u2019 We have to pull Nigeria out of the situation. Let them continue, everybody has the right to do whatever he feels like, but they don\u2019t see us as Northerners, but we would continue to fight for the right of our people and will unite with others who want Nigeria to move forward as a united nation.",
          "summary": "National President of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr. Bitrus Pogu, has declared that there is a clear difference between the North and the Middle Belt, noting that the minority nationalities in the North which were never under the Sokoto Caliphate or the Borno Sultanate are regarded as Middle Belters.\nSo, a president that selects his deputy also from the Islamic extraction; he is a Muslim and picks a vice president who is also a Muslim cannot be the kind of president that would address this situation.\nAt a time like this, somebody will be so insensitive to feel that we can have a Muslim- Muslim ticket to add salt to injury.\nYou want to have Muslim- Muslim ticket in Nigeria?\nToday, they came and said no zoning because they feel that they are the only ones who can be president in Nigeria.",

          "title": "My plan for IPOB, other agitators -Peter Obi",
          "text": "From Jude Chinedu, Enugu\n\nPresidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Mr. Peter Obi has explained reasons behind his decision to run for president in the 2023 election.\n\nSpeaking as guest on a radio breakfast programme in Enugu, which was monitored by Saturday Sun, Obi said Nigeria was in a critical state and needed the citizens to take it back.\n\nHow has it been these couple of weeks that you\u2019ve traversed Nigeria as Labour Party standard bearer?\n\nFor me, it is not an issue of being busy; it is the issue of trying to let Nigerians know that this country belongs to them and they must take it back. We must take it back to make sure that the country is united, the country is secure and it is productive. Because at this moment, we are insecure, we are not united and we are not productive. So, these are my commitments to get people to understand that we can turn into a great nation if only we do the right things.\n\nThere are so many problems bedevilling the country at the moment. Are you eager to be the president of the country given the circumstances that the Nigerian state finds itself in?\n\nNot just eager to become president but eager to mobilise Nigerians. To mobilise Nigerians to take over their country and start doing the right things that would turn around their country.\n\nIt is not one person\u2019s job. It\u2019s a job you have to do with everybody around to start changing their conception, their perception of life, their values, education, everything. So, that is the eagerness. It is not just the eagerness to be president. It is eagerness to start following the right direction for the country.\n\nWhy the choice of Labour Party?\n\nWell, it is not just the choice of the Labour Party. The party actually encompasses everything to do with what I\u2019m talking about, because I want to move the country from consumption to production. And you can\u2019t talk about production without labour. If you go and check the means of production, it is material, machine and labour. Labour being the most critical because no matter how you assemble resources, unless you have educated labour, you won\u2019t get it right. Labour is the most critical because it directs all the machines and other resources that you make available. So, being in the Labour Party is like being part of it.\n\nOne of the major challenges you would face in the Labour Party is funding. What has been the case since you joined?\n\nI think you encounter the issue of funding even if you stay in your house. You have to buy food, you have to do everything. So, being in the Labour Party, I\u2019m sure mobilising Nigerians will make the funding not as difficult as it seems. What is important is to make people understand that it is not about me or any individual but about themselves. We want to make the country productive and when it is productive, everybody benefits from it. Go to every other part of the world where things are working, everybody is involved. It is not about me going to borrow money or to look for sponsors who will tomorrow be living off the resources of the state. I want the people to contribute in such a way that when we get there we don\u2019t have to be owing anybody. We just have to use whatever available resources to start rebuilding our country.\n\nBased on what we have, the debt profile is over N41 trillion. How will you tackle this challenge if you emerge president?\n\nNigerian debt is about N60 trillion. N40 trillion is what you see from the Debt Management Office (DMO). There are also ways and means for the Central Bank which is about N20 trillion. So, it\u2019s about N60 trillion which is approximately $120 billion, which is today 30 per cent of our GDP. Huge debt but it is not impossible. The only reason it is worrisome is that the money was not rightly invested. There is nothing wrong with borrowing. Every nation in the world borrows. But when you borrow for consumption it becomes a problem. Everybody wants to go to America today. America owes almost 100 percent of its GDP. Their GDP is $21 trillion and they are owing $20 trillion. The same with Canada and Japan. Japan\u2019s debt is 200 per cent of their GDP. So, every country is owing.\n\nDo you intend to continue borrowing?\n\nNigeria will continue to borrow but borrow for investment. The first law I am going to put in place is that all borrowings must be for investment. If you borrow for investment, you will get it right. First time Nigeria borrowed money was in 1964. Tafawa Belewa wrote to the World Bank to borrow $82 million to build Kainji Dam to generate 760 megawatts of electricity and it\u2019s still there. So, imagine if you use an equivalent of $82 million in 1964 till today it is about $1 billion. And we are owing $120 billion. So if they had borrowed then to generate 1000 megawatts of electricity, that means if we had spent 20 billion which is one sixth of our debt today in generating power, we would have been generating and distributing about 20,000 megawatts. If we were producing 20,000 megawatts of electricity today, our GDP will be growing at over 4 per cent.\n\nSome people have criticised the investment you have made in a brewery and said that it hasn\u2019t appreciated over time for Anambra State\n\nThey are only criticising one investment. You don\u2019t criticise one and leave the other. Go and check the value of that investment in 2018. If you buy a property today in Enugu because things are stable, the prices will go up. But if there is a downturn in the economy, the value will go down. Investments go up and down and you can never say this is the value of an investment until you sell it. So, there is no value in savings. And that investment was meant to create jobs. Go there and see the amount of jobs and the tax paid to the government. The biggest tax payer to Enugu State now is the Nigerian Brewery. So, you don\u2019t just do investment; some are to create employment and jobs. We had a target in Anambra State. We followed the MDG goals for 2015. We followed the SDG goals hoping that by 2030 we will have the resources to implement what is required.\n\nWhat are your plans regarding insecurity in the country?\n\nThere are two means of fighting insecurity. The number one method is what we call natural security. You must pull people out of poverty. You can\u2019t have millions of people living in poverty and you expect security. You can\u2019t have millions of youth in their productive age doing nothing and expect security. You can\u2019t shut down your schools and think you can go home and sleep. It\u2019s been shown everywhere in the world that the more you pull people out of poverty, the more you reduce criminality. If you go to your village, there are people stealing because people are hungry. I\u2019m talking about the country being productive. If they have something they are doing, they won\u2019t have time for crime. I have been in prison and interviewed some kidnappers on the motive behind their action. And if you see how much they are given; some N20,000 and some N30,000. That means if they have a steady job, they won\u2019t engage in such. And then you have to equip your security agencies properly. The number of security operatives we have in Nigeria is very low for the country. You also need to motivate them properly.\n\nThe APC candidate has chosen a Muslim and he too is a Muslim. Did you put in religion and ethnic considerations when you made the choice of Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed?\n\nEverything was considered but above all, competence, merit and ability to complement me in what we are doing. I needed a younger person who shares my ideas, who understands my journey of turning this place to be a productive country and that\u2019s what I did. But every other thing was considered. I said that priority should not be tribe, should not be religion but that doesn\u2019t mean it should not be a consideration because when you come from a diverse country like ours where there are so many sensitivities, you have to make it inclusive. You have to tolerate each other. So, for me, everything was there.\n\nWhat was the consideration when the Labour Party was in talks with NNPP regarding Kwankwaso being your running mate?\n\nKwakwanso did a lot on education; I was a champion of education. I moved Anambra from 26 to number one in the country. Anambra is most advanced in recent years. I believe the first infrastructure you have to build is human infrastructure not physical infrastructure.\n\nYou said Kwankwaso\u2019s reason for not wanting to be your deputy is the same reason Nigeria has not moved forward. Someone who thinks like that, do you think he is in tandem with what you want?\n\nNo, what he said in terms of us working together is that the Northerners will not vote for a South Easterner. That doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t share some similarities in terms of education. I said that people not voting for A because he is from B is the reason why Nigeria is where we are not. And I stand by that statement. You have to vote for people based on their competence. I don\u2019t want people in the South East to vote for Peter Obi because he is from the South East.\n\nI don\u2019t want South South to vote for me because of any special consideration. I don\u2019t want the North to vote for me because of any special consideration. I want them to vote for me because I am competent; because I am capable; because I know what I will do to turn around Nigeria. I tell you, whoever is coming after this administration is going to inherit a nation in a bad shape. But I have been a turnaround expert. I have turned around businesses that have failed.\n\nKwakwanso raised fears about the secessionist movement in the South East being the reason the North might be afraid to vote for anyone in the South East. How would you handle this agitation?\n\nThe South East is not the only place where there is agitation. There is agitation also in the South West. Igboho and his people are also agitating for a Yoruba state. We have problems in the North-East, Boko Haram and ISWAP. We have in the South South and North West. There are problems all over the place. But I have said it repeatedly; I will deal with all agitators decisively, through dialogue, engagement and then remove the criminals who are operating under this government and deal with them as criminals. It is something that you can achieve by engagement and dialogue. I am contesting elections as a Nigerian. I am a Nigerian, I believe in Nigeria and I want to change Nigeria. I know what it takes to change Nigeria. Because I know that it is a great country that I can make productive for the interest of everybody.\n\nHow do you intend to handle issue of structure so that Labour Party would have agents in all the polling units, bearing in mind the role money plays in politics?\n\nLike I said before, I am urging the people to take back their country. So, money will not play that role you think it is going to play. The people now know that the people who are giving them money are actually the ones that are taking their money. The people will own it. This movement we are doing today, we are not giving anybody money. I am not giving anybody money because the people own it. What people talk of social media, when we go out in the streets now, you will see that it is not social media. I\u2019ve been to places in Nigeria and you see that it is not social media. Let\u2019s go out to the markets and you will see that it is not social media. I was at the airport this morning and those people are not on social media. The people know that they are in a country that is collapsing. This country today in terms of security is just next after Afghanistan and Somalia. We have met all the requirements of a failed state. We are no longer in control of our territory; we are no longer in control of our economy. So, it\u2019s not going to be business as usual. The people will collect the money and still do the right thing.\n\nYou asked your supporters to tone it down on social media and a lot of people are saying that you are soft. And being soft is not the Nigerian brand of politics. What is your view?\n\nMost of those people you see lashing out on other people are not my supporters. They are actually people who were paid to say these are his supporters. They now bring people who will be threatening war and everything. You are in the South East here, is there a war in Enugu here? Enugu is far more secure than most states in Nigeria. But the way to paint it is that when you come here, they have declared a war. There is no war. When our opponents declare war, we show them love. I am not in the politics of discussing people or quarrelling with people. I am in the politics of ideas.\n\nIf you do not win, will you accept an offer from Tinubu or Atiku to work with them in their administration?\n\nWell, nobody has said that Peter Obi is not competent. He is competent in economics. What is Nigeria\u2019s problem? If it is economy, why will you put on the bench a player that will start the match? This is the problem that I talked about before. You cannot see a pilot sitting down and you go and hire a driver. I am not looking for a job. I want to save Nigeria. Peter Obi wants to save Nigeria. I want to turn Nigeria into a production site where things are manufactured.\n\nThere is an App in circulation called the Peter Obi Nation. I don\u2019t know if you are aware of this App. Is it from you?\n\nI have never seen such. It is not from me. I don\u2019t know what is in it. And it is not from any of my support groups. People will do everything to bring Peter Obi down. Just go and verify about Peter Obi and what he intends to do. And the earlier the youths believe in me and follow me, we would take back this country. You know those who live off the confusion will do everything. When you bring a change, you have an enemy; all those who live off the old order. I am bringing a new order, so many people will be my enemy.\n\nWhat would be your response to Reno Omokri\u2019s recent comments which could cause ethnic tension?\n\nNo, I am not campaigning based on ethnic background. I said do not vote for Peter Obi because he is an Igbo man. Vote for me because I am the most competent. I have shown you my credentials. I lived in the Western world and I made a success of it. I can show you. I was a businessman in the UK. By the time I left the UK, I have the highest credit record any UK citizen can get.\n\nThat is my proof that I can be trusted. I have the highest credit rating and it is documented. So, it is not a question of ethnicity. Nobody has said they found Peter Obi claiming what he did not do. I am the youngest chairman of a bank ever in Nigeria. Have you ever heard someone say it is not true? Have you ever heard anyone say I did not leave money in Anambra State? I have shown the bank; I have shown the statement. So, why do you leave all these things and be going to say ethnicity. I am not campaigning as an Igbo man. I am campaigning as a Nigerian. But I said let\u2019s bring every other person in this race; that\u2019s 18 of us. Let\u2019s show our background. I was a businessman. And I can show my businesses. I have paid my taxes. I have done very well. Don\u2019t listen to those who want to make it an ethnic thing because the people who are hiring me should look at my profile. Judge me on the criteria for the person who is coming for the job of president. Where am I coming from? Yes, I am an Igbo man. Other people come from different places. Another person will say he is a Nigerian but a Yoruba man. Another will say he is Nigerian but a Hausa man. Am I Igbo person? Yes, number one Igbo man, but I am campaigning as a Nigerian. You don\u2019t ask the man who is piloting your plane where he comes from. Is he a qualified pilot? Yes. Nobody knows who is in that cockpit.",

          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed July 31 for the suspension of the ongoing nationwide Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise, ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe commission disclosed this in a statement by Mr Festus Okoye, INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, after an extraordinary meeting of the commission in Abuja on Friday.\n\nThe decision according to him is to allow the commission perform the legal requirements it has to undertake before the general elections.\n\nHe disclosed that to ensure that more Nigerians were registered before the date, the hours of registration had been extended to eight hours daily from 9am to 5pm, including weekends.\n\nOkoye said the commission took the decision at its extraordinary meeting where it discussed among other things, the suspension of the ongoing CVR.\n\nThis followed the judgment delivered by the Federal High Court on Wednesday July 13 2022 in which it dismissed the suit filed by the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) seeking an extension of the exercise beyond June, 30 2022.\n\nThe Court had affirmed that INEC remained at liberty to appoint a date of its choice to suspend the CVR, provided it was not later than 90 days before the date fixed for the general elections as provided in Sec. 9(6) of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nOkoye said that in compliance with the interim injunction of the Court pending the determination of the substantive suit, and in order to enable more Nigerians to register, INEC continued with the CVR beyond June 30.\n\nHe said that for that reason, the CVR had already been extended beyond June 30 for a period of 15 days.\n\n\u201cWith the judgment of the Federal High Court, all legal encumbrances have now been removed. Accordingly, the commission has taken the following decisions:\n\n\u201cThe CVR is hereby extended for another two weeks until Sunday July 31 , thereby bringing the total duration of the extension to 31 days (July 1 to July 31, 2022).\n\n\u201cThe exercise has also been extended to eight hours daily from 9am \u2013 5pm instead of the current duration of six hours (9am \u2013 3pm) daily; and\n\n\u201cThe exercise is also extended to include weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) as against only weekdays.\u201d\n\nOkoye said that INEC appreciated that the timeframe might be tight for many prospective registrants, but there was a lot that the commission was required to do under the electoral legal framework in relation to voter registration and compilation of the register that would require time to accomplish.\n\nHe said that for instance, INEC was required to: \u201cClean-up the register to remove multiple registrants using the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS);\n\n\u201cConsolidate the national register of voters (existing voters and new registrants) and display same on Polling Unit basis for each of the 8,809 Registration Areas (Wards) across the 774 Local Government Areas nationwide for public scrutiny which lasts for a period of one week.\u201d\n\nOkoye said that on the basis of a new projection of 95 million voters, on the basis of 10 voters per page, the commission had to print 9,500,000 pages for the display;\n\nHe added that INEC was also required to print millions of Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs) for all fresh registrants and applicants for transfer and replacement of lost or damaged PVCs;\n\n\u201cINEC is required to: Ensure that there is ample time for voters to collect their PVCs ahead of the 2023 general elections;\n\n\u201cPrint the final register of voters in triplicate for the 2023 general elections involving a projected 28,500,000 pages for accreditation and display at 176,846 polling units for national elections (Presidential and National Assembly) on Feb. 25, 2023 and State elections (Governorship and State Assembly) on March 11, 2023; and\n\n\u201cMake copies of the updated national register of voters available to political parties not later than 30 days to the date fixed for the general elections .\n\n\u201cWe appeal for patience and understanding of all Nigerians as we conclude the exercise which will resume after the 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nOkoye noted that INEC observed that following the continuation of the exercise beyond June 30, many of the registration centres recorded low turnout of prospective registrants.\n\nHe said that with the two-week extension, INEC appealed to eligible citizens not to wait until the last few days before they inundated the centres again to register.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the interest of Nigerians to register and participate in the electoral process and once again, reiterate our commitment to credible and transparent elections.\n\n\u201cThis can only be achieved with the support and cooperation of all Nigerians,\u201d he said.

          "text": "The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN) has dismissed a claim by Williams Uchemba that its members begged for money and food.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actor had recently claimed he got a distress call from some lecturers at the varsity seeking financial help amid the ongoing strike by the union.\n\nASUU has been on strike since February 14 over the federal government\u2019s alleged failure to meet its demands.\n\nUchemba had pleaded with the public to support the lecturers with their donations, adding that some of them told him they can no longer feed their families.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in a statement on Wednesday by Christian Opata, UNN ASUU chairman, and Michael Nwokedi, its secretary, the union asked the public to disregard the actor\u2019s claim.\n\nThe union alleged that when it confronted Uchemba over his post, he was \u201cvery apologetic\u201d.\n\nASUU also said it has already put measures in place to cushion the effects of the strike on its members.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe attention of the leadership of ASUU-UNN has been drawn to a video credited to one Mr Williams Uchemba seeking the support of well-meaning and good spirited individuals to help lecturers in UNN feed their families. The maker of the video claimed that the help arose from a request by one lecturer in the branch,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cHowever when the leadership of the branch got in touch with him, he was very apologetic and went ahead to put his apology in writing and posted some social media, especially on his Facebook page.\n\n\u201cASUU-UNN wish to inform the general public that our union is not aware of any such plea and never initiated same. Our shock is that we have a very welfare scheme for cushioning the effects of the withheld salaries on our members and majority of members who applied for help under the scheme were attended to.\n\n\u201cThis is not limited to feeding but extends to payment for health challenges, school fees of wards, members and other challenges that require financial assistance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nASUU said while the actor\u2019s claim looks suspicious, it is commendable if such was indeed to draw the attention of the government to the plights of varsities in the country.\n\n\u201cWe suspect that this may be one of the antics of government to break the ranks of ASUU. Our suspicion is premised on the coincidence in the timing of the said post and President Mohammed Buhari\u2019s misplaced, unfounded and ill-informed threat of \u2018enough is enough,\u201d it added.\n\n\u201cHowever, if his intention is genuine, we thank him for calling the attention of the public and government to the plight of Nigerian universities and equally ask other Nigerians to join him to prevail on government to end the strike and get our children back to school.\n\n\u201cWe therefore call on the general public to disregard the mischievous call for assistance.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopyright 2022 TheCable.

          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Swvl Holdings Corp, a multinational mobility as a service provider, has announced an agreement to acquire Urbvan, a mobility platform that provides tech-enabled mobility services in Mexico. With this acquisition, the Egyptian-born startup will be expanding into Mexico, the second most populated country in Latin America.\n\nThe ongoing acquisition process, which is set to be completed in Q3 of 2021, will be one of the uncommon cases of acquisitions by African startups.\n\nThe move follows Swvl\u2019s decision to lay off 32% of its employees earlier in May 2022, citing their need to turn cash flow positive as the reason for the lay-offs.\n\nUrbvan provides tech-enabled mobility services that aim to ensure a safe, comfortable, and efficient commute for riders. Founded in 2016, Urbvan set out with the intent of using shared mobility as a catalyst to improve living conditions for Mexicans. The company operates in 18 cities across Mexico with solutions for urban routes, intercity routes, for private organisations and for private on-demand needs.\n\nSix years down the line, Swvl will be acquiring the company and leveraging Urbvan\u2019s networks to accelerate Swvl\u2019s mission to provide safer, faster, smarter, and more affordable mass transport for everyone, no matter where they live.\n\nIn a statement seen by TechCabal, Mostafa Kandil, Swvl founder and CEO, highlighted the similarities between the 2 companies, maintaining that Urbvan\u2019s footprints in Mexico will be beneficial and instrumental to Swvl\u2019s expansion in the region.\n\n\u201cUrbvan was founded on the same principles as Swvl: to address the inefficiencies found in traditional mass transit in many parts of the world. With a significant footprint in Mexico, an impressive suite of transport-as-a-service (TaaS) offerings, and strong relationships with local government players, this acquisition reinforces Swvl\u2019s position as a leading provider of safer and more reliable mobility solutions which are required for vulnerable people living in densely populated, challenging markets with vast geographies,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSwvl and Urbvan share a vision to remodel mass transit to be safer for everyone, no matter their gender or social class, in the most challenging and densely populated urban neighbourhoods in Latin America,\u201d Renato Picard, Urbvan co-Founder and co-CEO, said in the statement.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to partner with Swvl as we work to illustrate best practices for tech-optimised day-to-day travel in Mexico. This transaction positions Urbvan to leverage Swvl\u2019s global offerings to scale the platform both within the region and beyond. We look forward to using our combined capabilities to provide safe, efficient, and affordable shared mobility options across the world,\u201d he added.\n\nSwvl, which went public in 2021, was the first African startup to go public via a SPAC and is currently valued at $1.5 billion.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Before now, Africans preferred to make payments with cash and physically go to retail shops to get their goods themselves. Many of them did not possess bank accounts or have debit or credit cards. Mobile phone ownership and internet access were also not commonplace. In fact, it took a lot of trust to get them to shop online. Businesses that wanted consumers to pay online struggled to make bank in African markets.\n\nBut this is fast changing as this historical infrastructure deficit gets corrected and COVID-19 pushes consumers to adopt online commerce.\n\nToday, there are an estimated 495 million (or 46%) of the continent\u2019s population owning a mobile phone and 303 million subscribed to mobile internet. These numbers are expected to grow to 615 million and 74 million by 2025 respectively, per GSMA data. According to reports, 86% of adults in Kenya, 48% in Nigeria, and 79% in South Africa have access to bank accounts. Africans are also getting comfortable with moving money on their mobile phones, with Africa accounting for $701.4 million (or 70%) of the world\u2019s $1 trillion worth in mobile money transactions.\n\nWhile online shopping is still nascent on the continent, African tech startups are jumping in to solve the hard problems of making ecommerce work in Africa. One of them is Nigerian ecommerce company Klasha which, since its launch in May last year, has raised a $4.5 million seed round, over 2 tranches last October and June, with investors such AMEX Ventures, Global Ventures, Greycroft, and Seedcamp participating.\n\nKlasha\u2019s success reflects the massive potential ecommerce has on the continent, especially the appetite of Africans to seek and pay for goods and services outside the continent. It is tapping into this huge potential by solving payment issues merchants and consumers face when they pay for products online via different payment methods across countries.\n\nKlasha has an ecosystem of consumer and business-facing solutions that are connected to one API and help facilitate cross-border commerce. Klasha\u2019s core product is the Klasha Checkout which allows ecommerce platforms, websites, apps and consumers to pay international online merchants in African currencies, while the merchants receive the payout in G20 currencies: dollar, euro, and pound. This incentivises these global merchants to expand their services to African consumers.\n\nKlasha Cart, an app, started out by allowing Nigerian customers to generate virtual dollar cards they can fund to send and receive money worldwide. It also allowed them to spend beyond the $20\u2013100 monthly limit imposed by the Central Bank of Nigeria on debit cards issued by deposit money banks. The app has evolved to allow African consumers to pay global retailers including fashion products on Asos, Zara, and H&M, and streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music.\n\nAnother of Klasha\u2019s products, KlashaWire, allows small businesses to make payments with their local currencies to their suppliers in other countries, who according to Klasha, will receive the payment within 3 working days.\n\nPayment Links allows merchants without an online storefront to receive payments from African customers by just generating a simple payment page they can share via social media or email.\n\nSince launching in May 2021, Klasha has signed up over 1,700 merchants, processed over 210,000 transactions, and is experiencing 15% MoM merchant growth.\n\nTechCabal caught up with Klasha CEO and co-founder Jessica Anuna on a video call to understand Klasha\u2019s progress in the past year. She explained that slow delivery of customer goods, the unreliability of payment methods, and the refusal of ecommerce platforms to allow African consumers to pay with their currency pushed her to build their ecommerce solutions in the first place, notably the checkout and logistics feature.\n\nBut Anuna doesn\u2019t believe that one company can tackle the big problems ecommerce is known for on the continent, which is why she encourages partnerships between ecommerce players and data analytics, logistics, storage, and warehouse service providers to solve some of the biggest problems in the space.\n\n\u201cThe core mission and vision for Klasha are to streamline cross-border payments, help African consumers frictionlessly reach the goods and services they want outside of the continent, and in turn merchants outside of Africa can access consumers in Africa who want to buy and access their goods and services,\u201d Anuna told TechCabal on the call.\n\nAnuna said that Africa\u2019s fast-growing population, a growing middle class, and consequential increase in consumer spending have created a huge market for merchants and a lucrative opportunity for venture capitalists to fund the tech startups that connect merchants to the continent.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of VC funds looking at Africa right now are able to see the route to scalability which, ultimately, is what VCs want to see. The market here in Africa is very nascent. Ecommerce is less than 10 years old. So that means there are a lot of opportunities to develop and scale the business. And we know that the fastest growth happens when there\u2019s a lack of development,\u201d Anuna added.\n\nKlasha is also choosing its investors wisely, and one of the ways it has done that is by receiving investment from AMEX, the investment arm of the American Express bank. AMEX\u2019s support will give Klasha access to the vast expertise and network of the giant bank, giving them a firsthand look at how it handles payment processing, scaling businesses across borders, and other challenges she is sure Klasha will soon face as the startup continues to grow.\n\nImage Source: Klasha\n\nKlashaCart, its consumer product, has an in-app store that allows consumers to purchase fashion and electronics products with naira and get them delivered at their doorsteps between 7\u201314 working days. Anuna said that the app is growing about 15% MoM, and has accumulated over 45,000 users since October.\n\nOn top of the Checkout and Cart is Klasha Logistics, which allows merchants\u2019 and retailers\u2019 goods and services to reach African buyers\u2019 doorstep within 7\u201314 days.\n\nAs Africa\u2019s middle class grows, consumer spending on ecommerce on the continent is expected to rise from $16 billion in 2016 to $75 billion by 2025, coupled with a solid 1.3 billion population poised to reach a quarter of the world\u2019s population by 2050 are all critical indicators for Klasha to build a suite of ecommerce products.\n\nKlasha\u2019s expansion strategy\n\nFlushed with funding, Klasha wants to deepen product penetration in the 6 African countries it currently operates: Nigeria, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda, South Africa, and Kenya. It plans eventually to scale to other African countries and currencies. It wants to deepen its product by doubling down on consumer and merchant marketing to raise awareness about them. It intends to relaunch its consumer app, KlashaCarts, and expand to Kenya in the coming month.\n\nDue to the nascency of ecommerce in these countries, Anuna said Klasha has had to engage in education campaigns to effectively sell ecommerce as an alternative to commerce. Another thing Klasha has to worry about is localising payment methods, marketing and its overall messaging.\n\nKlasha\u2019s marketing strategy ranges from ensuring that its product is solving an actual problem for its new market and targeting the right customer segment.\n\nLast year, in an interview with TechCabal right in the middle of Klasha\u2019s launch, Anuna revealed that a key metric to measuring Klasha\u2019s growth will be the number of major online stores and marketplaces it has convinced to integrate Klasha Checkout. Klasha has made considerable progress on that end by landing integration with WooCommerce, OpenCart, Wix, and Squarespace.\n\nAnother metric, she said, would be its ability to acquire 5,000 merchants, and when TechCabal asked her how that was coming along, she said that Klasha\u2019s merchant acquisition is growing at about 20% month-on-month (MoM). She also revealed that Klasha has seen a 17.5% MoM growth in terms of transaction volume and has processed over 210,000 transactions.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "Meet Burna Boy's monitor engineer, Precious Tawo as he takes us on his journey into sound engineering",
          "text": "Today\u2019s guest on Everyday People is someone whose magic you\u2019ve probably experienced at any Burna Boy, Wizkid, or Fireboy DML\u2019s concerts. Without further ado, let\u2019s meet Precious Tawo, freelance sound engineer and production manager. He has worked with firms like Google, IBM, and MultiChoice, and is a die-hard perfectionist, perhaps in recovery. He also runs Decibelz Production Limited, a one-stop-shop for all your audio rental needs.\n\nThere\u2019s this saying my sister made all of us get used to, which is still on my email address now:\n\nGood, better, best.\n\nI will never rest,\n\nUntil my good is better\n\nAnd my better best\n\nWe grew up singing that. We always lived by that mantra.\n\nSo I kept on putting my best into what I was doing. Everybody was interested in sitting on the console, but I was interested in knowing the whole craft.\n\nOn the 20th day [of the Calabar festival], we were doing a sound check in the stadium for the band, and my boss was not on the stage.\n\nSo he said, \u201cPrecious, please go to the console in front and mute the whole Front of House.\u201d\n\nFront of House is basically the mix the engineer mixes for the audience. So I ran there and quickly muted it. And he was shocked. Because he knew that at this point, he had not shown me anything that concerned the board.\n\n\u201cHow did you know how to mute the board?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been reading.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou this boy! You are a Puma!\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know how they say it in Yoruba, but he called me Puma because he says I jump. At the end of the festival, I became the first trainee to join the main crew in less than three weeks. I was paid \u20a6230,000 ($1,403)*, which was the highest [amount of] money I had ever received.\n\nPrecious Tawo\u2019s journey into sound engineering\n\nPrecious Tawo\n\nI didn\u2019t choose the path; the path chose me. So sometime after I finished secondary school, I wanted to study marine engineering real bad because I had friends in the marine space.\n\nI even had to wait one year at home for the entrance exam period. And I even went as far as Ibadan [Oyo State, Nigeria] to write for Polaris Marine Academy entrance exam. Then I went to the Maritime Academy in Oron to write the exam.\n\nFortunately, I got admission into the Maritime Academy, Oron, but before it came out, I was already working as a facility manager in a hotel in Calabar [Cross River State, Nigeria] because I just wanted to while away time.\n\nI\u2019m not an idle person. And then I\u2019ve always been someone that\u2019s been independent, and I wanted my little stipend. I got to work in a hotel thanks to my dad\u2019s South African friend \u2014 the manager \u2014 who gave me a job as one of the facility guys.\n\nBecause of how fast I was and everything, I was transferred from the hotel to the event centre, where I worked for over six months. And this was when I wrote the Polaris entrance exam. As at November, I knew full well that my time there was done because I know when it\u2019s time for me to leave somewhere.\n\nI don\u2019t need to pray about it; I feel it in my tummy that it\u2019s time to go, and I leave without a plan, but I always have something all worked out later on. So I felt it was time to leave.\n\nAnd in 2013, the Calabar Festival was very popular. This was something that we normally went to the stadium to watch every December and wish that we were on stage or part of the crew.\n\nAt this point, I had no audio background. The only knowledge I had about audio came in November [2013] when we had the Beer Festival in 520 [Hotel, Calabar], and they wanted to rent equipment worth about \u20a65,000,000 ($31,645)**.\n\nI made the company give me \u20a6700,000 ($4,430)** to buy some equipment, and I was like, \u201cI am gonna make this work.\u201d\n\nAnd I did DJ for the Beer Festival with Virtual DJ on my laptop and saved them over \u20a63,000,000 ($18,987)**. That\u2019s the only thing I knew about audio, which was basically from YouTube; plug this here, plug this there, turn this here, turn this there.\n\nWorking at The Voice in 2021\n\nSo on November 25, 2013, I resigned and told my dad that I would like to work with the crew for the Calabar Festival because he had his friend there.\n\nMy dad was an immigration officer in the Tourism Bureau, so he sorted out the passports for most foreigners working in Calabar. So he had relationships with these guys.\n\nThe production manager then was one of his friends, and he told him his son was interested in working with the guys for the December festival.\n\nI heard they were paying them \u20a6200,000 ($1,255)***. And how much was I earning at my place of work? It was just \u20a618,000 ($113)*** initially, then it went up to \u20a625,000 ($156)***. If I could make \u20a6200,000 a month, it\u2019d actually be better than what I was making in a year or close to what I made in a year if I stayed at the event centre.\n\nI planned to join them only for that month and then use the \u20a6200,000 to start school when results come out in January or February.\n\nOn the first day, I was told to go to the Governor\u2019s office for the interview. I dressed in my nicely starched shirt and trousers, and a nice pair of shoes.\n\nOnly for me to walk into the office and they were like, \u201cOh, you are the Precious. Okay, no problem. Hop into the Hilux; let\u2019s go to the warehouse and show you around.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I going to change?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no. Just come.\u201d\n\nWhen I arrived, they were loading trucks to move the equipment to the studio. This was the 28th of November. And when I got there, I had this whole \u201cbig boy\u201d thingy going on, so seeing boys loading trucks, I was like, \u201cNah, that\u2019s not what I came for; I came for the cool stuff.\u201d\n\nSo they asked me what I wanted to do, and I said, \u201cThe sound department,\u201d because I really loved the whole sound thing. When you went to the Festival, you could hear the speakers pumping from miles away, and I really wanted to be a part of that.\n\nPlus, I had just finished the Beer Festival and wanted something higher than I\u2019d experienced. They introduced me to Aigbovosa Giwa-Osagie, my boss. They took me around and showed me speakers I\u2019d never seen before up close.\n\nThen they introduced me to another person who would be my head.\n\nI was like, \u201cOkay, cool. I\u2019ll resume tomorrow. Nice meeting you guys.\u201d\n\nNext thing, \u201cNo o!. You are resuming now and joining them to load that truck.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, no problem. Easy thing,\u201d I told him.\n\nLuckily, I had a singlet and a pair of jeans in my bag because I was supposed to go somewhere from there. Nice pair of jeans o!\n\nWizkid\u2019s concert\n\nSo, I started loading with the guys. The equipment was very heavy, and there I was, not used to carrying heavy things, seeing young people like me doing it, and told myself I could too.\n\nWe finished loading four trucks after almost four hours and headed to the venue for the Festival\u2019s first event. And I was told to jump into the back of the truck because the Hilux was full.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: senior crew sits in the Hilux, junior crew at the back, and trainees like me sit on the equipment inside the 40-foot truck like the one used to convey cows.\n\nAt first, I was like no way, especially since Calabar is such a small place, but I eventually jumped in. Part of the price you have to pay, you know. At this point, my jeans were gone, and my singlet was like rags.\n\nWe got there, and my boss walked up to me and asked me what audio background I had. And I told him I had none, but the only thing I knew was the entry stuff, but I was willing to learn.\n\nSo when we started setting up, he asked me to go and get the 10 mm ep5 cable. In my head, I was supposed to go and see a cable labelled 10mm ep5.\n\nHe pointed in a direction of over 65 open cases, so I went there straight, and for like 40 minutes, I was searching for the ep5 cable, and I didn\u2019t even know what I was looking for. And then I couldn\u2019t even ask because the way he said it, it was like I was supposed to know the cable.\n\nSo I did not ask, and I didn\u2019t want to look small. After 40 minutes, I went back to him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t find the cable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I see it, what should I do to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you want to do, but I can\u2019t find the cable in the box.\u201d\n\nAnd then he asked another guy that had been there for like four years to get the cable for him and take me and show me the cable.\n\nThis guy just opened the case, stretched his hand, and picked up the cable.\n\nMixing in a studio.\n\nYo! It was super embarrassing. And I didn\u2019t like the way everyone was laughing and everything. So I told myself that I was going to know everything in the company, how it works, and I was going to know all their needs.\n\nSo that night, I started downloading the PDF files for the equipment manuals and spent another hour downloading more when I got home at 3:00 a.m. before I slept.\n\nThe next night, since I was just a trainee, I sat in one corner with all the loud music and was just reading stuff, checking stuff, and going behind the Front of House to peep and see what they were doing even though it looked like they were running a spaceship.\n\nAfter the Festival, my boss gave me the opportunity to go to an event in Lagos for IBM computers. Then I also did Love Like a Movie by Darey Art Alade in February 2014, the outdoor version with Kelly Rowland.\n\nLong story short, I kept on growing, going from event to event. I\u2019m a sucker for information, always trying to keep myself updated. People were recommending me because no matter how good you are, you need people to recommend you.\n\nOn February 20 [2014], my mom called me to tell me that the result for the Academy was out, and I passed. My name was announced on NTA [a state-owned broadcasting station]. But, I had no plans to go to school anymore.\n\nThat February, I was also offered a position with the company, but my boss advised me not to take it.\n\nHe said, \u201cEvery week and every day, experts fly in from South Africa and the United States or wherever to come and work in Nigeria. And if you are good at what you do, they\u2019ll fly you from whatever hole you are in to come and do an event.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve worked with different companies and been exposed to various equipment and clients.\n\nAnd I will not put this achievement on one company. If I was working with one company, I\u2019d be stuck with their clients and the kind of events they do. I learn from everybody, and I also like the way I\u2019m being treated like the golden egg.\n\nI love my job. I\u2019ve done stuff for Google, Amazon, IBM, Airtel, MTN, MultiChoice, and The Voice. Presently I\u2019m Burna Boy\u2019s monitor engineer and Fireboy\u2019s Front of House engineer. I\u2019ve mixed for Wizkid\u2019s December concerts, Cardi B, and Davido; any big artiste really.\n\nLearning from mistakes\n\nMixing at Burna Boy\u2019s Dakar concert in 2022\n\nSometime in 2015, we had an event in Eko Atlantic; it was supposed to be the launch for Majestic Voyage and ten minutes before the show, we did the sound check. Everything was sounding all right and I was mixing monitors.\n\nFive minutes to the show, I tapped my screen and it was frozen. I tried restarting the console, but nothing. That meant every artiste who climbed that stage was not going to hear jack!\n\nI felt like the ground should open for me to enter. We tried everything and eventually had to plug my monitors into my boss\u2019 equipment. By this time, the first artiste, Yemi Sax, was already on stage. I had already explained to him and everything but the first three minutes of the show were hell.\n\nI somehow survived the performance and my boss stabilised everything and that\u2019s how we ran the show. Another moment was when I was doing a show at Calabar Cultural Centre, and then we had power issues in the middle of the show and the console went off.\n\nThe show was cancelled and they had to fix another date. I spent four years trying to correct that mistake. I was hard on myself for four years. I\u2019m a perfectionist so I like to give 110%. Eventually, I had to accept that every engineer has bad days.\n\nGiving back\n\nIn line with what I\u2019ve learnt over the years, I decided to try and pass on this knowledge because I found out that, at the end of the day, we have to leave a legacy.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about money to me, my job is like my life right now. And I\u2019ve seen that many engineers have come and gone but there\u2019s nothing anybody can point to that they made. And so I started sharing knowledge at every opportunity I got. If I went to an event, I\u2019d teach the in-house engineer things I knew they would need if they asked politely, of course.\n\nI run a clinic for engineers, although I haven\u2019t done it since 2019. I also have some people I mentor, all so I can give back.\n\n*Average dollar to naira to rates in February 2014.\n\n**Dollar to naira rate in November 2013.\n\n***Average dollar to naira rates in 2013.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe National Centre of the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons (NCCSALW) has engaged with the Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in the fight against illicit arms proliferation in Nigeria.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that NCCSALW on Thursday gathered a number of local and international CSOs in Abuja to address the issue of arms proliferation in the country.\n\nThe National Security Adviser (NSA), retired Maj.-Gen. Babagana Monguno said the event was part of many multilateral engagements that the government intended to pursue with all stakeholders.\n\nHe said this was in its bid to secure Nigeria from the menace of illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW).\n\nMonguno was represented by his Special Assistant, Special Duties, Amb. Ahmed Muhammed.\n\nHe said the proliferation of SALW in many regions of West Africa had been a matter of grave concern to countries and regional organisations alike for decades.\n\nMonguno said proliferation of illicit arms had become a major source of insecurity in the society, saying it had fueled violent conflict, crime and terrorism.\n\nAccording to him, it requires no emphasis that the uncontrolled availability of SALW, especially the illicit ones, have continued to undermine global peace and significantly hinder development.\n\nHe said the threat and the use of SALW had been directly responsible for much of the untold human suffering in the society.\n\nAccording to him, it is important to emphasise that these weapons themselves do not cause conflict.\n\n\u201cRather, it is the easy access to them and the simplicity of their use that make violence more lethal and conflicts more protracted.\n\n\u201cTherefore, SALW have become weapons of choice for criminals, terrorists and bandits in Nigeria and beyond, posing a significant challenge to the country, especially in the wake of insecurity that has recently engulfed the Sahel Region.\n\n\u201cHence the need to stop the proliferation of these deadly weapons,\u201d he said.\n\nMonguno said it was on the backdrop of the proliferation of weapons and its attendant consequences that President Muhammadu Buhari authorised the establishment of the centre.\n\nHe said the centre was established to serve as the institutional platform to stem the proliferation of small arms within the framework of the various international protocols and instruments to which Nigeria was committed.\n\nAccording to him, the president has further demonstrated Nigeria\u2019s commitment to the provisions of Article 24 of the ECOWAS Convention on SALW.\n\n\u201cWhich requires each member state to establish national institutions to promote a multilateral approach to stamping out illicit arms trade in the Sub-region.\n\n\u201cThe efforts towards eradicating illicit arms globally is one that has involved all stakeholders including the international and regional community, nations, states and most importantly, the civil society.\n\n\u201cIn spite of our best efforts, it has become apparent that West Africa and indeed the global community are losing the war to transnational organised criminal networks, terrorist groups, domestic criminal elements and weapons manufacturers,\u201d Monguno said.\n\nThe NSA said the activities of arms manufacturers to keep the security space awash with illicit small arms and light weapons must not be allowed to continue.\n\nHe said numerous studies conducted by Small Arms Survey, OXFAM and SBM Intelligence suggested that Nigeria currently account for about 60 to 70 per cent of the 10 million illicit weapons believed to be in West Africa.\n\nAccording to him, this has already manifested as evidenced in the level of armed violence witnessed across Nigeria.\n\nHe, therefore, called for the support of CSOs for the government\u2019s avowed commitment to rid the society of illicit weapons.\n\nHe commended the centre for its efforts in ridding the nation of illicit small arms and light weapons.\n\nThe National Coordinator, NCCSALW, retired Maj.-Gen. Abba Dikko, said the engagement with the theme: \u201cHarnessing the Capacities of the Civil Society towards Promoting an Illicit Arms-free Society in Nigeria\u201d was the second since the establishment of the centre.\n\nDikko said the proliferation of SALW had negatively impacted peace, security and socio-economic wellbeing of the nation.\n\nHe said that illicit arms proliferation had remained a key driver for terrorism, ethno-religious conflicts, violent separatism and sundry organised criminal activities within and across borders.\n\nAccording to him, it is also common knowledge that Nigeria has borne the brunt of the instability in the Sahel region occasioned by the push-and-pull effect of arms trafficking.\n\n\u201cConsequently, Nigeria has closed ranks with her neighbours, ECOWAS and other international stakeholders over the years to eradicate illicit SALW in the hands of unauthorised persons or at least, halt their proliferation.\n\n\u201cEven though the progress made in this area has remained a subject of debate, Nigeria has continued to tackle the challenge head-on.\u2019\u2019\n\nDikko said the centre had made giant strides within the short time frame of its establishment to achieve full operationalisation with the establishment of regional offices in six geopolitical zones.\n\n\u201cThe operationalisation of the centre has focused on discharging its core function of providing a strategic platform for arms control in Nigeria through close partnership with stakeholders, especially the civil society, both locally and internationally.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe said the meeting would seek to solicit CSOs support in implementation of the various government initiatives and programmes that the centre would roll out in due course, especially commencing grassroots engagements through the zonal offices.

Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu, while constituting a task force to enforce the clampdown at the Government House, Benin City, charged owners and operators of unregistered vehicles in the state to register such vehicles on or before 31st July, 2022 to avoid prosecution.\n\nThe acting governor said the directive became imperative following the need to sustain security in the state, noting that recent security findings have revealed how criminal elements operate in the state using unregistered vehicles.\n\nThe task force is headed by the Commissioner for Transportation, Osasere Evbuomwan, while the Commissioner for Local Government, Monday Osaigbovo is a member. Other members of the committee are drawn from the Edo State Internal Generated Revenue Service (EIRS), Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), the Edo Public Works Volunteers (PUWOV), and the Nigerian Police.\n\nShaibu said, \u201cAll motorcycles, tricycles, and vehicles, both private and commercial, especially Toyota Yaris, must be registered in the state. We are giving them till July 31, 2022, to register as any vehicle that is not registered will be seized.\n\n\u201cWe urge them to comply or face the consequences of disobeying government directives. We want to ensure that these vehicles are providing legal services in the state as our findings have shown that some of these people provide illegal services with their vehicles.\u201d\n\nThe acting governor added, \u201cThe Edo State Government is working to ensure a peaceful and safe state for our people. We are dealing with security issues in our state. We want to clear our state of criminal elements.\u201d\n\nWarning that violators of the government\u2019s directive will be prosecuted in accordance with the state\u2019s extant laws, Shaibu noted, \u201cThe registration will help us to also guarantee the safety of your vehicles as the particulars of the vehicles and plate numbers will be used to trace such a missing vehicle.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cIf you want a safe Edo State, please register your vehicles. We urge cart pushers in the state not to allow themselves to be used for criminal activities or else they will be made to face the full wrath of the law. Let me also reiterate that the ban on motorcycles within the Benin metropolis still remains.\n\n\u201cVehicle owners must carry out a background check before giving their vehicles to drivers because any vehicle whose driver is caught using such a vehicle for kidnapping or any other criminal activity, such vehicle owners will be arrested along with the drivers and they will be duly prosecuted.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n...",

I have monitored the fight against corruption in Africa and I can see both successes and drawbacks.\n\n\u201dThe battle must continue for the sake of the continent and its people no matter the difficulties.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, the fight against corruption has been vigorous since 2015. A lot has been achieved in the areas of arrest, prosecution, conviction, asset recovery and anti-corruption laws.\n\n\u201cI must admit that the fight has not been a bed of roses. Truly, a lot of more work in many fronts is required.\n\n\u201dFor example, civil and public servants must be ethical and professional at all times. The private sector must contribute in curving corruption. The international community needs to close safe havens.\n\n\u201dThe judiciary requires more impetus. Perhaps, an International Anti-corruption Criminal Court is needed,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari said family and religious values would have to be upgraded, and schools have a lot of work to do for a better society.\n\n\u201cI am extremely delighted to address the participants as we celebrate the Africa Day of Anti-Corruption. Distinguished participants, we have come a long way in the fight against corruption in Nigeria and Africa in general.\n\n\u201cMay I use this opportunity to appreciate fellow African leaders for their individual and collective efforts in fighting corruption on our continent. I appreciate all of you for the confidence reposed in me being the Africa Champion on Anti-Corruption.\n\n\u201cI understand that the theme for 2022 is \u2018Strategy and Mechanisms for the Transparent Management of Covid-19 Funds, Lessons from the Pandemic.\u2019 In Nigeria.\n\n\u201dWe responded to the Covid-19 Pandemic swiftly and having tamed it, we have realized the need for more awareness campaigns on health issues and more investment in the health sector.\n\n\u201dAgain, service delivery requires checkmating corruption,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, African leaders must get rid of corruption in Africa if the continent is to realize its full potentials.\n\n\u201cI have come to realize that nations in Africa have to ensure that national resources are not taken to safe havens around the world and we must curtail Illicit Financial Flows in all its ramifications.\n\n\u201dAlso, we must work collectively to recover all resources taken abroad. We must show looters that crime does not pay by depriving them of the proceeds of their crime.\n\n\u201dAlso, elite greed and irresponsibility must be eradicated in Africa. Again, ethics, decency, decorum and respect for rule of law must be promoted in Africa.\n\n\u201dIt is important to develop strategies for behavioral change in Africa if corruption is to be tamed. This will ensure that national resources are allowed to serve the population and not a tiny few,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also said anti-corruption agencies must be empowered and allowed to deliver on their mandates.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, I am very proud of our Anti-Corruption Agencies, our law enforcement agencies and our regulatory bodies for their efforts at checking criminality including corruption.\n\n\u201dI very deeply appreciate them for their sacrifices,\u201d the President said.\n\nBuhari noted that the fight against corruption must be sustained for the benefit of present and future generations.\n\n\u201cOur youths have no place to go and live with dignity but in Africa. As I am leaving office next year, I am proud to leave behind a legacy of fighting corruption among others.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I abhor corruption and I will render my best in or out office to get rid of corruption in Nigeria and Africa in general.\n\n\u201dI urge our youths to join me in this noble cause,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged African leaders to work together at whatever level to get rid of corruption in Africa, adding \u201cposterity will judge us right if we deal with corruption as appropriate.\u201d\n\nThe president said it was imperative to kill corruption in Nigeria and Africa.\n\n\u201cIt will give our citizens a better life,\u201d he said.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) July 11 marks the day the African Union (AU) adopted the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combatting Corruption (AUCPCC) in Maputo, Mozambique on 11 July 2003.\n\nNAN reports that on the day, Africans pause to reflect on anti-corruption progress in their communities, what is working, what is not, and what remains to be tried.\n\nThe Convention came into force in 2006.\n\nAs of August 2021, the Convention has been ratified by 44 Member States of the African Union.\n\nThe Anti-Corruption Day also helps Africa\u2019s anti-corruption fighters share good lessons and practices. Asset recovery efforts are paying off in some member states.\n\nNAN also reports that on June 21, Buhari said around 386 million dollars was recovered in 2021 through the whistleblowing policy enacted by his administration in an attempt to repatriate looted funds back into the country and curb corruption.\n\nThe president made this known in an interview with Bloomberg on the performance of his administration in the area of economic growth, security, and corruption since 2015 when he was elected president.\n\nHe said through the whistleblowing policy, established in the first year of his government, hundreds of millions in stolen funds have been returned to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAs an illustration, monetary recoveries (January-December) 2021 show that more [than] N152 billion has been recovered.\n\n\u201dDollar recoveries for the year amount to over USD 386 million; GBP, more than 1.1 million; Euro, about 157,000; Saudi Riyals about 1.7 million some more in Digital and other currencies,\u201d Buhari said.

          "summary": "He also urged African leaders to intensify the fight against corruption, and create more disincentives for pilfering of public funds.\n\u201cDistinguished participants and fellow African leaders, corruption is evil and all efforts at tackling it are desirable.\n\u201cI am extremely delighted to address the participants as we celebrate the Africa Day of Anti-Corruption.\nAccording to him, African leaders must get rid of corruption in Africa if the continent is to realize its full potentials.\nThe Anti-Corruption Day also helps Africa\u2019s anti-corruption fighters share good lessons and practices.",

          "title": "Baba Ijesha: The journey to prison, blow by blow account",
          "text": "By Adenike Ayodele\n\nOn April 19, 2021, a video clip showing popular Nollywood actor Olanrewaju James Omiyinka (alias Baba Ijesha) sexually assaulting a minor went viral on social media.\n\nThe 14-year-old is a foster daughter of actress and comedienne Damilola Adekoya (alias Princess).\n\nOn the same date, Princess reported a case of sexual assault of a minor to the Sabo Police Station, Yaba, Lagos State.\n\nShe told the police that the crime took place at her residence.\n\nThe case was transferred to the Gender Unit of the State Criminal Investigation Department, Panti, Yaba, for investigation. Baba Ijesha was, thus, arrested on April 22, 2021.\n\nThe case attracted public attention from the time of his arraignment on June 24, 2021, until Thursday, July 14, 2022, when Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo of an Ikeja Special Offences Court delivered judgment in the case.\n\nJustice Taiwo convicted Baba Ijesha and sentenced him to a total of 16 years in jail which will, however, run concurrently for five years.\n\nThe criminal trial had the prosecution team presenting six witnesses.\n\nThe prosecution team was initially led by Mrs Olayinka Adeyemi, the then Lagos State Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). She was replaced by Dr Babajide Martins, following her appointment as a judge in the Lagos State Judiciary.\n\nDefence team presented four witnesses including Baba Ijesha. The actor\u2019s defence team of over 10 lawyers was led by two Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SAN), Messrs Babatunde Ogala and Dada Awosika.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) presents a timeline of the trial which lasted for a year and three weeks and culminated in a guilty verdict in a courtroom filled with lawyers, Nollywood actors and actresses, fans and other sympathisers, and members of the public.\n\n\n\nJUNE 16, 2021:\n\nLagos State Government arraigned Baba Ijesha before a Yaba Magistrates\u2019 Court on charges of indecent treatment of a child, defilement of a child, sexual assault by penetration, attempted sexual assault by penetration and sexual assault.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty to the charge but was remanded in custody by Magistrate P.E. Nwaka due to indications that the matter was before a Lagos High Court.\n\nMagistrate Nwaka ruled: \u201cSince there are indications that the matter is before the high court and the defendant will appear before the court, no bail can be given.\n\n\u201cThe defendant must be accorded full medical attention by the authorities pending his arraignment at the high court.\u201d\n\nJUNE 24, 2021\n\nThe Lagos State Government arraigned Baba Ijesha on a six-count charge bordering on indecent treatment of a child, sexual assault, attempted sexual assault by penetration and sexual assault by penetration.\n\nJustice Oluwatoyin Taiwo granted the actor bail in the sum of two million Naira with two sureties in like sum. She ordered that the actor should perfect his bail within seven days.\n\nBaba Ijesha was, however, released to the custody of his counsel, Ogala, pending perfection of his bail.\n\nThe case was adjourned until July 26, 2021, for trial.\n\nJULY 26, 2021\n\nProsecution presented its first witness, Princess, the foster mother of the defiled minor.\n\nLed in evidence by Adeyemi, the then DPP, Princess narrated how Baba Ijesha first defiled her foster daughter in 2013 when the minor was seven years old. The witness said the first defilement occurred when Baba Ijesha paid her a visit while she was recuperating from an illness.\n\nShe said that the first defilement occurred when she left her apartment for approximately seven minutes to see off a visitor while the actor was alone with her then seven-year-old daughter who was watching cartoons.\n\nPrincess told the court that the minor told her about the sexual molestation seven years after.\n\nShe testified that in order to gather evidence and possibly catch the defendant in the act, she set up a \u2018sting operation\u2019 in her home.\n\nShe narrated further how Baba Ijesha was caught in her home with the aid of Close Circuit Television (CCTV) on April 19, 2021, molesting her daughter.\n\n\n\nJULY 27, 2021\n\nCross-examining Princess, defence counsel, Awosika, submitted that the actor did not sexually assault the minor in the CCTV footage. He argued that the footage was scripted.\n\n\u201cThe defendant did not at anytime move his hand toward any sensitive part of your daughter\u2019s body. No where did he touch her boobs, slip his hands into her private part or caress any sensitive part,\u201d Awosika said.\n\nResponding, Princess said: \u201cIf you call her breasts, her laps, her ears and her tongue not sensitive, then I do not agree with you.\u201d Princess also denied releasing the viral CCTV footage of Baba Ijesha molesting her daughter to the public.\n\nAfter Princess\u2019s cross-examination, her 14-year-old daughter gave evidence. In order to protect her identity, members of the public and press were ordered by Taiwo to vacate the courtroom.\n\nSEPT. 28, 2021\n\nThe third prosecution witness, a childcare expert, Mrs Olabisi Ajayi-Kayode, narrated how the actor defiled the minor. She told the court that Baba Ijesha\u2019s interactions with the minor were the typical dynamics of child sexual abuse and the modus operandi of perpetrators.\n\nShe said that the actor used the weapons of inculcation of secrecy, intimidation, threat or coercion.\n\nOct. 20, 2021\n\nDuring cross-examination of Ajayi-Kayode by Ogala, a tape recording of child forensic interview conducted on the minor by the expert on May 15, 2021, was played in court. In the video, the minor told Ajayi-Kayode that Baba Ijesha told her he was her boyfriend.\n\nThe witness told the court that during the forensic interview, the minor gave a \u201cfree narrative recall\u201d of events that transpired seven years ago, adding that she had asked her neutral, open-ended questions to determine whether she was lying or coached.\n\nOCT. 21, 2021\n\nA medical doctor, Dr Aniekan Makanjuola, testified that medical examinations revealed that the minor had been defiled. \u201cOur findings were that there was a blunt penetration of the vagina which was consistent with the client\u2019s history,\u201d she said.\n\nOn cross-examination by Ogala, she said she said, \u201cThe lacerations found in the genitalia were not recent, my lord,\u201d Makanjuola said.\n\nNOV. 5, 2021\n\nASP Wahab Kareem told the court that Baba Ijesha was facing another allegation of defilement of a minor.\n\n\u201cDuring our investigation, another girl (name withheld) came forward and said that the defendant assaulted her when she was 12 years old,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring cross-examination by Ogala, the police officer admitted that a lawyer was not present when the actor gave an initial statement to the police.\n\n\n\nNOV. 12, 2021\n\nProsecution counsel, Mr Yusuf Sule, told the court that one of the remaining two prosecution witnesses was scared to testify in court.\n\n\u201cMy lord, the first witness is a police officer but could not come to court today because he has been transferred and needs to get permission from where he is posted.\n\n\u201cThe second witness could not come to court. He is jittery, he is scared to come to court,\u201d he said.\n\nYusuf, however, assured the court that the witnesses will be available by the next adjourned date.\n\nNOV. 19, 2022\n\nDuring evidence by the sixth prosecution witness, Insp Abigail Omane, defence team led by Ogala alleged that Baba Ijesha\u2019s confessional statement to the police was made under duress. The judge consequently ordered a trial-within-trial to determine the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statement to the police.\n\nDEC. 2, 2021\n\nFollowing adoption of written addresses in the trial-within-trial by the prosecution and defence, the judge scheduled ruling on the admissibility of the actor\u2019s confessional statement for Dec. 15.\n\nDEC. 15, 2021\n\nThe judge ruled that Baba Ijesha\u2019s confessional statement to the police was admissible. Taiwo said that there was no evidence before the court which showed that the actor was tortured into giving the statement to the police.\n\nFollowing the ruling, the then DPP, Adeyemi, told the court that Lagos State Government had closed its case against the defendant.\n\nA member of defence team, Mr Kayode Olabiran, informed the court that defence intended to file a no-case submission. The case was adjourned until Jan. 26 for adoption of the no-case submission by defence.\n\nJAN. 26, 2022\n\nBaba Ijesha made a U-turn, ditched plans to make a no-case submission. A member of the defence team, Mr A.O Alo, said, \u201cThe defendant has decided to put in his defence, and we have decided not to file a no-case submission again.\u201d\n\nFEB. 17, 2022\n\nThe first defence witness, Mr Lawrence Ayeni, a graduate of mechanical engineering with experience in video production and CCTV installation and maintenance, testified that portions of the CCTV footage were edited. The witness claimed that the minor and the actor were both acting out a script in the footage.\n\nDuring cross-examination by Martins, the new DPP, the witness admitted that tampering with the recording or using various devices to record the footage could not change the content.\n\nMARCH 4, 2022\n\nBaba Ijesha took the witness stand. He told the court that Princess, the foster mother of the defiled minor, was his former lover. He added that he was acting a script in the viral video and that he and Princess were both the directors of the production. He denied defiling the minor at Princess\u2019s home seven years earlier.\n\nUnder cross-examination, Martins asked the actor that since he claimed that the CCTV footage was part of a movie, whether it was appropriate for him to mimic the act or actually sexual assault an underage as part of acting. Baba Ijesha, in his response, said the scenes he acted with the minor were appropriate.\n\nMARCH 11, 2022\n\nThe third defence witness, a Clinical Psychologist, Dr Olukayode Olugbemi, told the court that the minor appeared to have been tutored in her narration of what transpired. Under cross-examination by Martins, the witness admitted that he could not be absolutely certain that the defilement did not happen.\n\nAPRIL 1, 2022\n\nThe fourth and final defence witness, a Nollywood actor, Mr Olukayode Ogunbanjo alias \u2018Pastor Jerosi\u2019, told the court that Baba Ijesha and Princess were in a relationship.\n\nDefence closed its case and Taiwo adjourned the case until June 6 for the adoption of final written address.\n\nJUNE 6, 2022\n\nProsecution and the defence adopted their final written addresses. Defence counsel, Awosika, in adopting his final written address dated May 12, urged the court to dismiss the suit and discharge the actor. Awosika argued that the CCTV footage was illegally obtained, adding that the alleged defilement seven years earlier was never reported to authorities. He also said that Baba Ijesha\u2019s confessional statement was made under duress.\n\nIn the prosecution\u2019s written address dated May 31, Martins urged the court to convict the defendant.

          "text": "Nigerian superstar musician, Adekunle Kosoko, also known well as Adekunle Gold has shared an emotional story about the struggles he had with his health growing up.\n\nThe \u201cHigh\u201d crooner, in a lengthy letter to his fans disclosed that he was much younger he struggled with his health as he was born with sickle cell anaemia.\n\n\u201cIt feels liberating to finally be able to share this part of my life with you, to finally be able to speak my truth.\n\nWhen I talk about how I struggled to get to where I am today, I need you to know that my struggle was real.\n\nI was born with sickle cell disease. It was life and death, it was physical, mental, financial, you name it and I went through it all. It was tough, painful and frustrating. I lived with a sickness no one around me understood, I lived with restrictions all my childhood. I wasn\u2019t able to join some of the most minor child play and liberating activities like going out in the rain.\n\nThe times when I insisted and rebelled against my parents orders and went out in the rain, I would end up having a crisis.\n\nThe nights were painful and lonely, nights that no one could help me get through. It was just me, God and my mind. The pains and shivers were unbearable.\n\nThey always came in the night, when my family had no means to transport me to a hospital. We simply couldn\u2019t afford the constant hospital bills so I had no choice but to endure the pain.\n\nMy mum wanted me to be well, she did her best. She took me to all the churches she could find, I\u2019m grateful for her because she saw a future for me.\n\nA future where no illness or sickness could hold me back from my purpose. From the life I was destined to live.\n\nSickle cell disease took away my freedom, my childhood. I lost friends, a lot of them. Some didn\u2019t understand the restrictions and rules I had to live by, some just didn\u2019t want to deal with my Illness or thought it was a nasty or contagious disease that they could catch. I was a burden for some. Living with sickle cell is far from living a normal life.\n\nOne of the most intense crisis I had was at the age of 20, I remember laying in my bed in the middle of the night asking for an end to it all. I begged God to take my life away because I couldn\u2019t understand what I did to deserve the pain my body and mind was under. As usual with sickle crisis after some days, the pain subsided and God asked me; \u201cThat end you begged me for, do you still want it?\u201d Of course I said no and that\u2019s when everything changed for me. That\u2019s when I realised that I had been given another opportunity to live my dreams and to show those that mocked me that sickle cell anemia was never going to end me, that it was never going to hold me back from my dreams and aspirations.\n\nMy body caves in once in a while, some symptoms come back but what this disease has taught me is resilience. Sickle cell anemia gave me hope, made me tough, gave me the discipline I needed to be who I am today, built my character. I mean I went through a whole 5 weeks of back to back performances and didn\u2019t fall sick. Grace.\n\nMy mind and body were challenged and I\u2019m stronger, more determined and ready to take on the world. I\u2019m ready for Adekunle Gold Supremacy, I\u2019m ready to live and enjoy the 5 Star life that I deserve, that my body toiled for.\n\nI\u2019m sharing my testimony with you because I hope that you can find strength in my truth.\n\nSome ailments hold us back but I\u2019m thankful this hasn\u2019t. I want to encourage you in whatever it is you\u2019re going through, know that there is hope. You are strong and you must not give up. YOU CAN DO THIS!\n\nVictory lies at the end for you just as it did for me.\n\nIf you know anyone going through any struggle, physical, health, mental. Be kind, show compassion. In fact be kind to everyone, you just never know what they\u2019re dealing with privately. Be supportive, be gentle and love endlessly.\n\nIf you are a sickler, know that the disease does not define you. Don\u2019t allow it to limit your dreams or cap your potential. Spread your wings and dream big! Hope to see you soaring the big skies.\u201d He said.",

          "text": "\u2018We don\u2019t need money from anybody, we\u2019re independent of govt\u2019 (2) \u2026We\u2019ll reclaim our stolen mandate, Adeleke all the way \u2013 PDP chieftain \u2026Voters\u2019ll stick with Oyetola to continue his good work \u2013 Resident \u2026Tight security as human, vehicular movements restricted \u2026NSCDC assures of corps members\u2019 safety \u2026Resist unethical behaviour, Yakubu tells INEC staffers\n\nOsun state governor Adegboyega Oyetola has a pretty good fight in his re-election bid today as he again squares up with Senator Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in a repeat of the 2018 battle.\n\nAlready, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has released a list of 15 political parties that would participate in today\u2019s election where 1,955,657 eligible indigenes had been registered and 1,475,595 have already collected their voter cards ready to determine the winner of the election.\n\nThe list released by INEC showed Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of the APC, Senator Ademola Adeleke of the PDP, Akinade Ogunbiyi of the Accord Party, former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yusuf Lasun, of the Labour Party.\n\nAlso, the AAC has presented Awojide Segun, Kehinde Atanda of the ADP, Awoyemi Lukuman of the APM, Adebayo Elisha of the APP, Adeleke Adedapo of the BP, Rasaq Saliu of the NNPP, Abede Samuel of the NRM, Ayowole Adedeji of the PRP, Omigbodun Akinrinola of the SDP, Ademola Adeseye of the YPP and Adesuyi Olufemi of the ZLP.\n\nHowever, the election is certain to be a re-match between Oyetola and Adeleke as they lead the strongest, more formidable political parties to the election.\n\nOyetola\u2019s strengths\n\nIt would be recalled that a former Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, dumped the APC before the 2018 election and pulled about 50,000 votes in the APC. Though Adeoti has not declared his support for Oyetola, some of his followers and people of his local government in Iwo have returned to the camp of Oyetola.\n\nAlso, the recent declaration by Aregbesola\u2019s allies and splinter group within the APC, The Osun Progressives (TOP), that they have recognised Oyetola as their governorship candidate has further boosted the strength of APC.\n\nA former Speaker of the Osun state House of Assembly, Najeem Salam, a former member of the National Assembly, Senator Mudashiru Hussain, and their supporters at a meeting of the TOP held at Ejigbo, recently, for the first time since the wrangling within the APC started, agreed to work for Oyetola in the election.\n\nThis was followed by the defection of the chairman of Ede North local government of the TOP, Oladejo Afeez, who recently joined Oyetola\u2019s faction, saying that his decision was informed by the directive given to them by the Minister of Interior that they should not leave the party, but instead work for APC.\n\nAfeez, while confirming the change of disposition, said: \u201cYes, it is true that I have left TOP together with my people in Ede North local government. Aregbesola said we should not work against APC and we should not decamp to another party. I will rather stop being in politics than decamp to PDP.\n\n\u201cAll the party executives, including the women leader have followed me to join Oyetola. Since our leader has told us not to work against the party, we should stay in the party and work for the candidate of the party.\u201d\n\nMonarchs,\u2019 religious, youth\u2019s support\n\nAside from the fact that some chieftains of the APC and political appointees have formed political groups many of which would be mobilised for the election, the involvement of some traditional rulers is obvious in the electoral processes in the state. Some traditional rulers, in apparent neglect of tradition, have been involved in open partisanship and declared their support for Oyetola.\n\nThe candidate of PDP, Adeleke, in the usual practice, to pay homage to the traditional ruler of a town before embarking on an open campaign where they usually address members and supporters, got his apparent rejection from the Owa-Obokun of Ijesaland, Oba Adekunle Aromolaran, who he had visited to seek prayers and blessings.\n\nIn his usual manner, Adeleke had lamentably poured out his mind about the poor living condition of the people, as well as the deplorable state of the roads within Ijesa land and promised that he would bring development to the people of the area if elected. He said, \u201cIlesa as a major town in Ijesa land ought not to be like this. I want to assure you that when I win come July 16, it will change. When we were coming to the palace and the people thronged out to meet us, we noted that the suffering was too much. The roads in Ilesa are also bad even the road that leads to the palace is in a bad condition. We will do the needful,\u201d he enthusiastically declared.\n\nBut the monarch said, \u201cWe don\u2019t need money from anybody. You said the other time that the people of Ijesa are suffering, we are hungry truly, but God will continue to feed us. In Ijesa, we are independent of the government; we built the palace ourselves without collecting a dime from outsiders. The current governor wanted to give us money, but we did not collect. The only thing we demanded from the governor was to help us to inaugurate it.\u201d\n\nThe Oluwo of Iwoland, Oba Abdur-Rasheed Akanbi, who has never hidden his support for Oyetola, recently took the trend a notch higher and organised a special prayer for the APC candidate, pledging to deliver 90,000 votes for the APC in his town.\n\nEarlier, some traditional rulers held at the palace of Olu of Ile-Ogbo, Oba Abeeb Agbaje, where the monarchs in attendance unanimously endorsed the candidature of Governor Oyetola, directing the Muslims, Christians, traditionalists, artisans, motorcycle and Okada transporters, students, applicants, civil and public servants, men, and women organizations to support and vote for Oyetola in the coming governorship election.\n\nAnother factor that further boosted the strength of governor Oyetola is the recent declaration of 20,000 students under the umbrella of the National Association of Nigeria Students/Joint Campus Committee, (NANS/JCC), Osun Axis, and the National Association of Osun State Students (NAOSS) to mobilize their colleagues in the four state-owned institutions for the reelection of Oyetola.\n\nThe intra-state commercial bus driver, Muslim Students\u2019 Society of Nigeria (MSSN), the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Trade Union Congress and the Joint Negotiating Council, have openly declared their support for Oyetola and this has increased his chances.\n\nAdeleke\u2019s strengths\n\nThere is no gainsaying the fact that Adeleke has the total support of his billionaire uncle, Deji; the father of the popular singer, Davido, and he has the financial muscle to flesh. This, according to analysts, propelled the PDP candidate to declare the election as \u201cfire for fire,\u201d saying he has brought dollars, pounds sterling and Euros.\n\nAlso, the PDP\u2019s structure in all the local governments is well-established and each of the contestants on the party\u2019s platform is expected to play a certain role in their different political zones. His considerable performance in the 2018 governorship election has made him a strong force.\n\nAdeleke\u2019s weaknesses\n\nThe gale of defections that hit the PDP recently has posed a serious threat to the chances of its candidate. Those who defected to APC include the running mate of Senator Adeleke in the 2018 governorship election, Albert Adeogun, and the factional chairman of PDP, Wale Ojo.\n\nThe former co-contestant of Adeleke in the 2018 governorship primary, Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi, who pulled out from the PDP to pick the ticket of the Accord Party, is likely to affect the chances of Adeleke. It\u2019s believed that Ogunbiyi is a third force in the election and so it\u2019s been predicted that Adeoti\u2019s incident in 2018 may happen to the PDP this time.\n\nTight security\n\nOur correspondents report that military armoured personnel carriers were seen patrolling around Osogbo town. Men of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) were also seen at strategic places.\n\nThe Deputy Inspector General of Police in charge of the election, Mr. Johnson Kokumo, said at the end of Police interactive session with \u2018Accredited Election Observer Groups\u2019, NGOs and the media, ahead of the election that human and vehicular movements would be restricted from midnight of Saturday till 6.00pm of the same date (Election Day), but essential workers and accredited election observers and media would be allowed to operate.\n\nAlso, the NSCDC had deployed 11,226 personnel to provide security for the election.\n\nThis was contained in a statement by NSCDC Public Relations Officer, Olusola Odumosu, in Abuja.\n\nThe FRSC had also deployed 1, 500 personnel, 35 vehicles and two trucks and ambulances to clear road obstructions, carry out rescue operations in case of emergencies, and maintain orderliness in polling booths. FRSC made this known in a statement by the Corps\u2019 Public Education Officer, Bisi Kareem, in Abuja.\n\nMeanwhile, the NSCDC assured members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) deployed for the election of their safety.\n\nThe deputy commandant-general (DCG) in charge of operations, Dauda Mungadi, gave the assurance while receiving the NYSC director-general, Brig.-Gen. Mohammed Fada, on Friday at the NSCDC Osun state Command headquarters, Osogbo.\n\nMungadi, who described corps members as \u201cessential\u201d in the electoral process, said their security was imperative.\n\n\u201cGiving them the security that they deserve is not doing them a favour, but it is our statutory responsibility as a law enforcement agency to provide the much needed security. NYSC members are among the most important variables in the election administration of Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nMungadi reiterated the Corps\u2019 commitment to take corps members\u2019 safety seriously.\n\n\u201cWe have been in synergy with NYSC over time especially in the deployment of our men to mount orientation camps, so this is not the first time we are interfacing. We have been doing it and Osun will not be an exemption as we will even do more. We appreciate your visit and we assure you that Nigeria\u2019s security architecture will only get better,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, in his remarks, the NYSC boss appreciated the NSCDC\u2019s service to the nation and by extension to corps members.\n\nFada said his visit was to consolidate the existing synergy between the NSCDC and NYSC.\n\n\u201cWe partnered in Ekiti to ensure a hitch-free election and I am confident that Osun will not make a difference. This can only be achieved with the synergy, cooperation and commitment of officers and men of the corps and other security agencies,\u201d he said.\n\nINEC\u2019s charge to staff\n\nMeanwhile, the chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, has urged the Commission\u2019s staff members to resist any unethical behaviour in the election.\n\nYakubu gave the charge in his message to INEC members of staff on Friday, appealing to them to uphold the INEC Code of Conduct, displaying the usual sense of commitment and professionalism.\n\nHe said exactly 27 days ago, INEC conducted and concluded the Ekiti state governorship election that was widely judged to be free, fair, credible and inclusive.\n\nAccording to him, the feat was an elongation of the earlier successes recorded in Edo on September 15 2020; Ondo state on October 10, 2020 and in Anambra on November 6, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe sheer determination, resilience and competence displayed by all of you, our members of staff, made it possible for the Commission to achieve these lofty goals. As you are aware, the Osun state governorship election will be held on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI have assured our stakeholders and the people of Osun that the Commission will not do anything to the advantage or disadvantage of any political party or candidate. We have made adequate arrangements for the election. We have promised a level playing field for all. The security agencies have assured us of safety,\u201d he said.\n\nThe chairman said the people of Osun state and Nigerians would understandably hold INEC to its promise on the Election Day, adding that the people would also observe INEC attitude and behaviour from the opening to the closing of polls.\n\n\u201cThey will particularly observe our management of the election results and measure the extent of our adherence to the extant laws through every stage of the electoral process.\n\n\u201cI appeal to you to uphold our Code of Conduct, display your usual sense of commitment and professionalism, remain above board and firmly resist any unethical behaviour.\n\n\u201cYou must also stick to the Oath of Neutrality to which we have all subscribed. I have the confidence in your ability to consolidate on our recent successes.\u201d\n\n\n\nElectorate\u2019s preference\n\nSpeaking with Blueprint Weekend on who the electorate would prefer, a resident of Osogbo, Ajibola Oyebanji, said, \u201cMany of us will vote for Oyetola on Saturday because he has done well. Despite the paucity of funds, he paid salaries, pensions, improved security and other social amenities.\n\n\u201cHe has also reduced the debt profile of the state. Under Oyetola we have seen many constructed hospital buildings and many on-going projects. Hundreds of kilometres of roads are also constructed across the state. Many love him and they will vote for him.\u201d\n\nPDP chieftain\u2019s boasts\n\nSpeaking on the chances of the PDP, a former chairman of the party in the state, Alhaji Gani Olaoluwa, expressed confidence that the electorate would help the party and Adeleke to reclaim the 2018 mandate allegedly stolen.\n\nIn a phone chat with our correspondent, Olaoluwa said: \u201cIt\u2019s a known fact that we, that is the PDP, won the 2018 governorship election, but our mandate was stolen.\n\n\u201cMany of our people are tired of the APC government. They are tired of suffering and I am sure they will come out enmasse to vote for the PDP.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",
          "summary": "However, the election is certain to be a re-match between Oyetola and Adeleke as they lead the strongest, more formidable political parties to the election.\nSome traditional rulers, in apparent neglect of tradition, have been involved in open partisanship and declared their support for Oyetola.\nThe deputy commandant-general (DCG) in charge of operations, Dauda Mungadi, gave the assurance while receiving the NYSC director-general, Brig.-Gen. Mohammed Fada, on Friday at the NSCDC Osun state Command headquarters, Osogbo.\n\u201cWe partnered in Ekiti to ensure a hitch-free election and I am confident that Osun will not make a difference.\nAs you are aware, the Osun state governorship election will be held on Saturday.",

          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Friday, said it will suspend the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR), exercise as from July 31, 2022, following a court affirmation on the commission\u2019s choice to suspend the exercise provided it is not later than 90 days before the 2023 general election.\n\nIt explained that the suspension was to enable the commission clean up the registration data and prepare ahead of the 2023 polls.\n\nThe National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye Esq, disclosed this in a statement.\n\nPart of the statement reads, \u201cThe Commission met in an extraordinary session today, Friday 15th July 2022, and discussed among other things, the suspension of the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR). This followed the judgement delivered by the Federal High Court on Wednesday 13th July 2022 in which it dismissed the suit filed by the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) which is seeking an extension of the exercise beyond 30th June 2022.\n\n\u201cThe Court has affirmed that INEC is at liberty to appoint a date of its choice to suspend the CVR, provided it is not later than 90 days before the date fixed for the General Election as provided in Sec. 9(6) of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\n\u201cIn compliance with the interim injunction of the Court pending the determination of the substantive suit, and in order to enable more Nigerians to register, the Commission continued with the CVR beyond 30th June 2022. For this reason, the CVR has already been extended beyond 30th June 2022 for a period of 15 days.\n\n\u201cWith the judgement of the Federal High Court, all legal encumbrances have now been removed. Accordingly, the Commission has taken the following decisions:\n\n\u201cThe CVR is hereby extended for another two weeks until Sunday 31st July 2022, thereby bringing the total duration of the extension to 31 days (1st \u2013 31st July 2022).\n\n\u201cThe exercise has also been extended to eight hours daily from 9.00am \u2013 5.00pm instead of the current duration of six hours (9.00am \u2013 3.00pm) daily; and\n\n\u201cThe exercise is also extended to include weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) as against only weekdays.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate that the timeframe may be tight for many prospective registrants, but there is a lot that the Commission is required to do under the electoral legal framework in relation to voter registration and compilation of the register that will require time to accomplish. For instance, the Commission is required to:\n\n\u201cClean-up of the register to remove multiple registrants using the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS);\n\n\u201cConsolidate the national register of voters (existing voters and new registrants) and display same on Polling Unit basis for each of the 8,809 Registration Areas (Wards) across the 774 Local Government Areas nationwide for public scrutiny. This lasts for a period of one week. On the basis of a new projection of 95 million voters, on the basis of 10 voters per page, the Commission has to print 9,500,000 pages for the display;\n\n\u201cPrint millions of Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs) for all fresh registrants and applicants for transfer and replacement of lost or damaged PVCs;\n\n\u201cEnsure that there is ample time for voters to collect their PVCs ahead of the 2023 General Election;\n\n\u201cPrint the final register of voters in triplicate for the 2023 General Election involving a projected 28,500,000 pages for accreditation and display at 176,846 polling units for national elections (Presidential and National Assembly) on 25th February 2023 and State elections (Governorship and State Assembly) on 11th March 2023.\n\n\u201cMake copies of the updated national register of voters available to political parties not later than 30 days to the date fixed for the General Election.\n\n\u201cWe appeal for the patience and understanding of all Nigerians as we conclude the exercise which will resume after the 2023 General Election.\n\n\u201cWe observed that following the continuation of the exercise beyond 30th June 2022, many of the registration centres recorded low turnout of prospective registrants. With this two-week extension, we appeal to eligible citizens not to wait until the last few days before they inundate the centres again to register.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the interest of Nigerians to register and participate in the electoral process and once again reiterate our commitment to credible and transparent elections. This can only be achieved with the support and cooperation of all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "By Onu Okorie\n\nIn Nigeria today, when agents of transformations in the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari are being counted, the Director General of Securities and Exchange Commission SEC, Mr. Lamido Yuguda will definitely standout, if the numerous reforms he has introduced is anything to go by.\n\nIn less than two years after assuming office the SEC management under Mr. Yuguda has not only set strategic goals but also continued to expand the frontiers of investment space thereby attracting improved local and foreign direct investment, FDIs into the economy through innovative regulatory guidelines and collaboration with other relevant institutions.\n\nFor instance, on market-wide issues, the Commission has drafted and presented an amendment to ISA Bill to the National Assembly as part of its efforts to enhance the regulatory framework of the Nigerian capital market, lead to the introduction of new products into the market, and increase the effectiveness of the Investments and Securities Tribunal, amongst other benefits to ensure that the provisions of the Bill represent realities in the nation\u2019s investment climate.\n\nAlso, the Commission is collaborating with National Assembly Business Environment Roundtable NASSBER to prepare a roadmap towards passage of the Bill within the shortest time frame.\n\nAlso, the Yuguda-led executive management team has been implementing capital market development goals set out in the Capital Market Master Plan (CMMP) (2015-2025) and successfully completed the review of CMMP to realign the initiatives/deliverables to prevailing market conditions and keep the document relevant in the dynamic capital market due to issues related to Fintech, sustainability and regional integration.\n\nTo resolve legacy issues of Identity Management which is a crucial driver in improving market participation and solving unclaimed dividends and related problems, the management also inaugurated a market-wide Identity Management Committee with mandate to harmonize the various databases of investors in Nigerian capital market, facilitate data accuracy in the market, mitigate fraud, improve KYC requirements and manage AML/CFT risks, among others.\n\nThe report of the committee is expected to resolve issues that have hindered growth of the Market, hampered investor confidence, and matters that serve as barriers to entry for potential investors, amongst other benefits.\n\nOn primary market activities, the Yuguda-led executive management of the SEC has also in the past two years approved 41 new equities issues valued at N656.9 billion, 37 bonds valued at N776.2 billion, 28 applications for shelf programmes valued at N2.5 trillion and 21 Exchange Traded Derivatives Contracts.\n\nThis is even as it processed six Schemes of Merger, seven Acquisitions, 21 Corporate Restructurings, and three Takeovers during the period. It also ensured that over N11 billions of untraceable shareholders\u2019 funds from Schemes of Arrangement in the custody of Registrars were transferred to the National Investor Protection Fund NIPF.\n\nAs part of the process of improving time to market of transactions and fast tracking the review process, the Commission conducted training for issuing houses to help improve the quality of applications submitted.\n\nSimilarly, Commission also recorded a landmark achievement on the first electronic offering with combined feature of book building to Qualified Institutions and use of the price discovered from book-build for sales to Retail Investors. It also granted approval for the first 21 derivatives contracts which had seven and 14 different contracts from both the NGX and FMDQ Exchanges respectively in the past two years.\n\nOn Collective Investment Scheme CIS, the Yuguda-led management has also, following completion of series of monitoring and evaluation processes, commenced implementation of 100 per cent custody requirement in the CIS sector to protect investors. As a result, all clients\u2019 assets currently managed under discretionary and non-discretionary mandates are to be held under independent custodial agreements in custodial banks.\n\nThe Commission has also recorded remarkable milestones in its secondary market activities in the past years with successful demutualization of the Nigerian Exchange Limited NGX which investment analysts see as milestone in the development of Nigerian capital market.\n\nThis is even as the management collaborated with University of Cambridge\u2019s Centre for Alternative Finance, UK for the training of its select employees on a certified course on Fintech & Regulatory Innovation, to enhance the Commission\u2019s capacity in regulating Fintech.\n\nAlso, it collaborated with the World Bank to commission a Fintech Scoping project and held collaborative engagements with 15 International and local Fintech stakeholders to guide the Commission on its Fintech policies.\n\nThe Regulatory Incubation Guidelines to operationalize provisional regulation for aspiring Fintech firms were released within the period. In furtherance of its market regulation roles, management of the Commission was able to ascertain the quantum of unclaimed dividends of publicly traded companies that fall within the categories eligible to be borrowed by the Federal Government.\n\nThis amounted to N56, 584,795,648.71 and $8,153,118.41 respectively. In addition, it also facilitated the transfer into the SEC/CNB NIPF Account of N2.3 billion in excess of return monies and N11.4 billion in Schemes consideration money, both of which had previously been held in the custody of the Registrars.\n\nOn the pesky issue of Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing Of Terrorism AML/CFT, following the GIABA Mutual Evaluation of Nigeria, the Yuguda-led executive management had made concerted efforts in the capital market to meet both the GIABA Mutual Evaluation Report MER Follow-Up Process and the FATF International Cooperation Review Group ICRG requirements in order to avoid Nigeria being placed on the FATF public grey list at the Plenary when the grace period expires in October, 2022.\n\nFor instance, following the MER findings that Nigeria had several important deficiencies in its AML/CFT/CPF system in relation to Technical Compliance, and that its effectiveness controls were insufficient to mitigate its high ML/TF/PF risks, the Commission championed the amendments of Rules and Regulations of the Virtual Asset Service providers; the sector specific regulations to repeal the 2013 SEC AML/CFT Regulations and enactment of the 2022 AML/CFT Regulations; the SEC AML/CFT RBS Framework.\n\nThese new rules and amendments were done in order to address Nigeria\u2019s MER deficiencies and broaden the scope of preventive measures available to VASPs. In furtherance of its regulatory mandate, the Commission conducted investigations into complaints by investors and out of the 250 complaints brought forward into the period, 182 were resolved.\n\nAlso, out of the 58 complaints in relation to Ponzi schemes received, 45 were resolved. The Commission was able to recover 10,659,168 units of various companies\u2019 shares as well as the sum of N1, 384,255,526.73 recovered for investors during the period under review.\n\nIt issued New Rules on Robo-Advisory Services to guide the regulatory requirements and expectations for providing automated advisory services in the market and released the Rules on Trade Repositories during the period under review.\n\nSimilarly, the Yuguda-led executive management of the Commission also introduced new rules on Crowd Funding, Social bonds, Digital Assets Exchange DAX, Digital Assets Custodians DACs, Issuance of Digital Assets as Securities and Requirements for registration of Digital Assets Offering Platforms as part of its efforts to guarantee security of investments in the capital market.\n\nOn Corporate Governance measures, the Commission also released guidelines on the Implementation of Sections 60-63 of Investments and Securities Act (ISA), 2007 and in order to strengthen the disclosure regime in capital market, the Commission in a circular dated January 19, 2022 provided public companies a fast track option for filing Audited Financial Statements.\n\nIn addition, the Commission also developed the SEC Corporate Governance Guidelines SCGG to address corporate governance issues not considered in the NCCG, and released same in October 2020. As part of its efforts to harmonise the reporting timeline of the SEC Corporate Governance Guideline SCGG with that of the National Code of Corporate Governance NCCG, it also in year 2021 exposed to the public for comments an amendment to Rules 42(2).\n\nThe Commission has also as part of its regulatory interventions to amicably resolve disputes between the board and shareholders of listed companies resolved the disputes between Alhaji Muneer Alade Bankole (the Chief Executive Officer and Sheikh Abdulmohsen A. Al-Thunayan Chairman of the Board, of Medview Airlines, resolved those between major shareholders of Ikeja Hotels Plc and returned the company to profitability and also reached a settlement with Oando Plc in 2021 after concluding investigation of Corporate Governance allegations levelled against the company.\n\nIn regard to its market development mandate, the Commission has continued its Investor Education and Public enlightenment programmes by organizing workshops on infusion of Capital Market Studies into the curricula of Basic and Secondary Schools in Nigeria and also collaborated with the Standards Organization of Nigeria SON and other partners to organize Stakeholders\u2019 Sensitization Workshops on Commodities Standards in Lagos and Kano during the period under review.\n\nFurthermore, the Commission held webinars on Non-Interest Capital Market Products, Financial Inclusion, Ponzi Schemes and Solid Minerals targeted at the pension industry, investor protection, women, Youth/millennial and the commodities segment of the market.\n\nAlso in pursuit of non-interest market education and enlightenment programmes, the Commission collaborated with Islamic Financial Services Board IFSB and the Auditing and Accounting Organisation of Islamic Financial Institutions AAOIFI to organize Non-Interest Capital Market training for over 1000 participants.\n\nAlso, the Yuguda-led executive management of the Commission has led the team to improve the capacity of the Nigerian Capital Market Institute NCMI by providing it with necessary tools to train Capital Market Operators CMO in different fields.\n\nOn international engagements, Mr Yuguda is now saddled with leadership of West African Securities Regulators Association WASRA. Under his leadership, rules for the integrated West African Capital Market were developed and reviewed.\n\nOn human capital development, the Commission had in 2019 conducted an internal capacity assessment that outlined staffing deficits and needs.\n\nAlso, in furtherance of its drive to leverage its operations by deploying innovative technologies and solutions to its departments and units, the Commission conducted a review of its IT infrastructure and determined that it was in a poor state.\n\nThe investigations focused on the internal and external perceptions of the Commission with the conclusion that the IT infrastructure was out dated and needed to be upgraded to international standards of securities regulators.\n\nAlso, on its Risk-Based Supervision Framework Implementation and Capacity Building Project the Commission secured a $400,000 grant from the African Development Bank AfDB to support capacity building projects in the areas of RBS, Derivatives and Green Bonds.\n\nThe Commission has also secured counterpart funding of $450,000 from AfDB on its Nigeria Securities Market Surveillance System Project to support the deployment of a real-time market surveillance system for the Nigerian capital market.\n\nIn addition, it has also secured from the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN the sum of N3.5 billion for Information Technology transformation project. Given the unparalleled achievements recorded so far, it has been argued by some financial experts that there is nexus between Yuguda\u2019s reforms and investors\u2019 making Nigeria a preferred destination in recent times.",

          "title": "Naira Marley Made Use Of E-tools To Access Compromised Credit Cards \u2013 EFCC",
          "text": "A third prosecution witness in the ongoing trial of Azeez Fashola popularly known as Naira Marley has told Justice Nicholas Oweibo of the Federal High Court sitting in Lagos how electronic tools used for accessing compromised credit card information was found on the laptop of the defendant.\n\nThe witness, Dein Whyte, who is the Chief Detective Officer and Head of the Cybercrime Section of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), continued his testimony before the court while being led in evidence by the prosecuting counsel, Rotimi Oyedepo.\n\nWhyte said \u201cFrom my findings, it was clearly established that the defendant through his phone had in his possession credit card details that did not belong to him. That he shared this credit card information with another person and it was also discovered that a fraud report had been generated for the same credit card stating that it had been used fraudulently.\n\n\u2018Investigation also revealed that the defendant had on his laptop which is registered to him, and recovered from him, electronic tools that are specifically used for accessing compromised credit card information as well as other electronic tools that are used to disguise both the identity and location of anybody accessing compromised credit cards in real time on the internet. Those were my findings\u201d.\n\nWhen he was asked by Oyedepo the role played by him and his team before Exhibit E (the forensic analysis) was produced, he answered saying, \u201cAs is procedural in investigation, where recovered digital evidences are of direct importance and value evidentially to a case, the procedure demands of an investigator or investigating team, where such evidences are recovered, to make a request to the Digital Forensic and Crime Laboratory Services Department to carry out forensic analysis of the content of these devices.\n\n\u201cIn doing so, the investigator or investigating team, will include specifics to guide the forensic as to what is of utmost importance to the investigation. These specifics guide the Forensic examiner in narrowing down the analysis and search, extraction in these devices to areas of utmost importance as specified by the investigator or investigating team. On the request form, there is a section where the investigator may state these specifics. Examples might be SMS, Mails, pictures and websites\u201d, Whyte said.\n\nWhile analyzing the forensics report, Whyte revealed that the defendant has running on his computer, a VPN called IP Varnish (a tool used to disguise identity and location of the user).\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn relation to the contents found on the NOTES (a software application) on the devices of the defendant, wherein counterfeit card number was found alongside the details of the cardholder and an IP address, It would suggest that the only reason the possessor of this information will need an IP address attached to it, would be to satisfy the location specifics for consumption of transaction for merchants who require cards to be used only within countries and locations recognized by them.\n\n\u201cIf these cards were to be used on the internet from Nigeria, the browser that is stated here will attribute in real time the location of the user to the IP address. And If Nigeria is not the compliant location of the card issuer, the transaction will be blocked. But if this card when being used passes through a VPN and assigned with the IP address to conform with the compliant location of the card issuer, the Nigerian Location will be disguised and substituted to be Cardiff, thereby giving the merchant the impression that the card is being used from Cardiff or otherwise the compliant location\u201d he testified.\n\nCounsel to the defendant, Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Olalekan raised objections to the evidence of witness.\n\nOjo said \u201cPW3 is attempting to give evidence on what must have operated on the mind of the user, as to why certain things were saved on the NOTE. The basis of my humble suggestion is that this witness is not competent to give evidence of the state of mind of the user of laptop without the existence of evidence before your lordship that the particular state of mind exists.\n\nHe also added, \u201cI wish to rely on the Provisions of S11(2) of Evidence Act in support of my objection. An investigating officer is not competent to ascribe a state of mind to any defendant. Whether the state of mind exists or not is a matter for judicial determination. PW3, though an investigator is not a psychologist but a forensic officer who cannot give evidence on the state of mind of a defendant\u201d, he submitted.\n\nResponding to the objection raised by the defence, Oyedepo retorted that the objection raised by the SAN missed its target. He said \u201cFirstly, the question being answered by the witness is to connect (if any), the relationship between Pages 8 & 27 of Exhibit E (the forensic analysis). The witness is not only competent to give that evidence, but in the circumstance of this case, is in the best position to bring life to it, by explaining the relevance of the report of the forensic analysis that he sought for and obtained.\n\n\u201cI agree that the state of mind of the defendant is for the court to determine, however it is also the power of the court to rely on the facts and evidence supplied which is what PW3 is doing.\n\n\u201cFinally, the witness has not used the word intention. The SAN is mainly imputing that the word \u201csuggests\u201d as used by PW3 is him interpreting that there was an intention by the defendant. He misconstrued the choice of words of the witness; I hereby urge the court to discountenance the submissions of the defense, Oyedepo concluded.\n\nIn a short ruling, the Judge overruled the objection, saying that \u201cthe witness can give evidence on the reason he believes the defendant had those documents in his possession\u201d.\n\nJustice Oweibo had earlier dismissed the defendant\u2019s objections to the forensic evidence presented by the witness at a previous proceeding.\n\nIn dismissing the objection, the court held that \u201cIt is the duty of the law enforcement agencies or police charging a person to court to investigate if the defendant committed the crime or not. The investigator must be able to link the defendant to the commission of the crime. The prosecutor must have made up his mind as to the involvement of the defendant before bringing the case to court. I do not agree the prosecution has declared the defendant guilty\u201d, the Judge ruled.\n\nJustice Oweibo has adjourned to September 26 & 30 2022 for continuation of the trial.\n\nBackground\n\nOn May 20, 2019, the anti-graft agency had arraigned the artiste Naira Marley, who sang the popular song: \u201cAm I a Yahoo Boy\u201d, before the Federal High Court, Lagos.\n\nA large crowd of his supporters turned up to witness his arraignment on an 11-count charge bordering on money laundering and Internet fraud.\n\nThe anti-graft agency said the offences were committed on different dates between Nov. 26, 2018 and Dec.11, 2018, as well as May 10, 2019.\n\nThe commission alleged that Naira Marley and his accomplices conspired to use different Access Bank ATM cards to defraud their victims.\n\nThe EFCC also said that the defendant possessed and used counterfeit credit cards belonging to different people, with intent to defraud others.\n\nThe alleged offences are said to contravene the provisions of Sections 1 23 (1) (b), 27 (1) and 33(9) of Cyber Crime (Prohibition) Prevention Act, 2015.\n\nBefore Justice Nicholas Oweibo, Naira Marley pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe court granted him bail in the sum of two million naira, with two sureties in like sum.",

          "text": "US President Joe Biden will discuss energy supply, human rights, and security cooperation in Saudi Arabia on Friday on a trip designed to reset the U.S. relationship with a country he once pledged to make a \u201cpariah\u201d on the world stage.\n\nThe White House said Biden would hold a bilateral meeting with Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz at the royal palace in Jeddah and then the president and his team would have a working session with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MbS, and Saudi ministers at the palace.\n\nEnergy and security interests prompted the president and his aides to decide not to isolate the kingdom, the world\u2019s top oil exporter and regional powerhouse that has been strengthening ties with Russia and China.\n\nA U.S. official told Reuters on Friday that Washington is not expecting Saudi Arabia to immediately boost oil production and that the United States was eyeing what the OPEC+ group decides in its next meeting on Aug. 3.\n\nThe visit will be closely watched for body language and rhetoric. U.S. intelligence concluded that MbS directly approved the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, while the crown prince denies having a role in the killing.\n\nWhite House advisers have declined to say whether Biden will shake hands with the prince, the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler. Biden will meet with a broader set of Arab leaders at a summit in the Red Sea port city of Jeddah on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s going to meet about a dozen leaders and he\u2019ll greet them as he usually does,\u201d a senior Biden administration official told reporters.\n\nAt the start of Biden\u2019s trip to the Middle East, officials said he would avoid close contacts, such as shaking hands, as a precaution against COVID-19. But the president ended up engaging in hand-shaking in Israel. read more\n\nBiden said on Thursday his position on Khashoggi\u2019s murder was \u201cabsolutely\u201d clear. Biden made his \u201cpariah\u201d comment less than two years ago after the journalist\u2019s killing and while campaigning for president.\n\nBiden said he would raise human rights issues in Saudi Arabia, but he did not say specifically if he would broach the Khashoggi murder with its leaders.\n\nSaudi ambassador to the United States Reema bint Bandar Al Saud, writing in U.S. magazine Politico, reiterated the kingdom\u2019s \u201cabhorrence\u201d of the killing, describing it as a gruesome atrocity, and said it cannot define U.S.-Saudi ties.\n\nShe said the relationship should also not be seen in the \u201coutdated and reductionist\u201d oil-for-security paradigm.\n\n\u201cThe world has changed and the existential dangers facing us all, including food and energy security and climate change, cannot be resolved without an effective U.S.-Saudi alliance.\u201d\n\nThe United States is eager to see Saudi Arabia and its OPEC partners pump more oil to help bring down the high cost of gasoline and ease the highest U.S. inflation in four decades.\n\nRiyadh faces its own balancing act as it seeks to improve ties with Washington while shoring up the OPEC+ oil alliance with Russia.\n\n\u201cThe Saudis definitely are intending to boost capacity and with oil prices so high they have the wherewithal to do that, particularly as they see production constraints elsewhere in a market that is still growing,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, S&P Global vice chairman and an expert in world energy markets.\n\nBiden will encourage peace and press for a more integrated Middle East during his trip, the administration official said. Topics include strengthening a truce in Yemen, \u201cbalance\u201d in energy markets and technological cooperation in 5G and 6G.\n\nAhead of the visit, Saudi Arabia said it would open its airspace to all air carriers, paving the way for more overflights to and from Israel, in what Biden described as a historic and important step towards building a more integrated and stable Middle East. read more\n\n\u201cThanks to months of steady diplomacy between my administration and Saudi Arabia, it is finally a reality,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cI will do all that I can, through direct diplomacy and leader-to-leader engagement, to keep advancing this groundbreaking process.\u201d\n\nBiden will be the first American president to fly from Israel directly to Jeddah, a step the White House says represents a \u201csmall symbol\u201d of warming Israeli-Saudi ties. Two years ago, Riyadh gave a tacit nod for the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to normalise relations with Israel.\n\nThe U.S.-brokered deals known as the Abraham Accords established a new axis in the region, where Gulf states share Israel\u2019s concerns about Iran\u2019s nuclear and missiles programmes and proxy network. Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi\u2019ite Muslim Iran have for years vied for regional influence but launched direct talks last year in an effort to contain tensions.\n\nThe Saudi ambassador said U.S.-Saudi efforts to ensure peace and security should focus on enhancing cooperation and \u201creinforcing a rules-based system\u201d to confront the \u201cvision of chaos promoted by Iran\u201d.\n\nDuring his visit to Israel, Biden and Prime Minister Yair Lapid signed a joint pledge to deny Iran nuclear weapons, which the Islamic Republic denies seeking.\n\nReuters",

Manuri Pabasari, told the BBC at the time that a protest rally against Ranil Wickremesinghe was expected in the coming days.\n\n\u201cHe has no people\u2019s mandate [and] is a well known Rajapaksa supporter,\u201d she added. \u201cI mean the new president and the new prime minister should be not a Rajapaksa supporter.\u201d\n\nThe governor of Sri Lanka\u2019s central bank, Nandalal Weerasinghe, has warned the country may shut down if no stable government is formed soon.\n\nThere was a \u201clot of uncertainty\u201d over whether enough foreign exchange can be found to pay for essential petroleum, he told the BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme, and progress on getting an international bailout package depended on having a stable administration.\n\nMeanwhile, Singapore says the ousted president Gotabaya Rajapaksa did not ask for political asylum when he arrived there.\n\nThe former president, who arrived with his wife and two bodyguards, no longer has legal immunity as a head of state and his position is now more precarious as he tries to find a safe country to shelter in.\n\nHe is expected to stay in Singapore for some time before possibly moving to the United Arab Emirates, Sri Lankan security sources told AFP news agency.\n\nSri Lanka: The basics\n\nSri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948.
