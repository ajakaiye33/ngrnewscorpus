          "text": "*Most crime cases induced by Rohypnol, tramadol, d5\n\nGombe State Command of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency has lamented the increase of psychotropic substances in the state, adding that it has an overwhelming influence on users.\n\nThe State Commander, Ekaete Egwunwoke, made this revelation in Gombe during the Implementation of National Security Sensitization Programme against political thuggery, kidnapping, drug abuse, radicalization, and violent extremism organised by the National Orientation Agency.\n\nEgwunwoke revealed that Rohypnol had aided rape cases, noting that drugs have dire consequences. Represented by Deputy Commander Olisaemeka Okafor, the commander urged all hands to be on deck.\n\nThe commander noted that out of about 100 per cent of seizures by the agency over 80 per cent are prescribed drugs.\n\nShe said, \u201cMost of them are prescription drugs but people abuse them. Many boys use it to hypnotize women. Generally, psychotropic substances usage is on the increase.\n\n\u201cAlso, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes stated that Indian hemp should be the highest drug of abuse in the whole world but in Gombe State, it is prescription drugs that are psychotropic substances and they are; tramadol, Rohypnol, d5 all those prescription drugs including cough syrup and codeine.\n\n\u201cCannabis, that is Indian hemp, has 20 per cent. That will tell you the way people are abusing d5, tramadol, Rohypnol and the rest of them. Recently, we seized tramadol of 25,700 capsules from a student and it was worth millions of Naira.\n\nShe added that if the seizure was not made it would have circulated in Gombe, \u201cThis prescription drugs immediately they enter Gombe under three days they will be sold. They are making high turnover but we are working assiduously to catch up with them,\u201d Egwunwoke said.\n\nAlso speaking, State Director of NOA Adaline Patari noted that securing lives and property is a dire need for any thriving country.\n\nPatari urged relevant agencies and stakeholders to team up with her agency towards curbing the vices induced by drug abuse.\n\nShe said, \u201cWithout security, a country remains exposed to threats, and is vulnerable. In this state, the attainment of such a country\u2019s objectives and projects becomes a herculean task.\n\n\u201cAs an agency of government involved in community mobilization in its programme implementation, experience has shown that dugs are often associated with virtually all anti-social behaviours bedevilling the country.\n\n\u201cIt is enabler and trigger which propels people to go into crimes and criminalities such as; political thuggery, banditry, political and religious radicalism, kidnapping, violent extremism, armed robbery, vandalism and wanton destruction of public assets and infrastructure.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Follow up to ensure isolation, linkage to clinical care, contact tracing and other relevant response activities have commenced,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Equally, arrangements are also being made to notify country where travel originated according to the provisions of the International Health Regulations.\u2019\n\nThe NCDC assumes that Omicron variant is widespread globally given the increasing number of countries reporting it. \u2018Therefore, it is a matter of when not if, we will identify more cases.\n\n\u2018We would continue to expand our sequencing capacity in-country at the NCDC-NRL, through our network of public health laboratories and other partners.\n\n\u2018Our focus is to complete sequencing of recently accrued samples of SARS-COV-2 positive travelers from all countries, especially those from countries that have reported the Omicron variant already,\u2019 Dr Adetifa said.\n\nHe said that since reports of the emergence of the Omicron variant, the Federal Ministry of Health through the NCDC has intensified public health response measures to COVID-19 in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018The national travel advisory has also been revised by the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19, and now requires all inbound travelers to Nigeria present a negative COVID-19 test result done not more than 48 hours before departure,\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018Similarly, pre-booking and payment for all day two and day seven COVID-19 PCR tests are prerequisites for travel. In addition, all outbound passengers regardless of the requirements of destination countries are expected to present evidence of full vaccination or a negative COVID-19 PCR test done not later than 48 hours before departure.\u2019\n\nHe appealed to Nigerians to adhere strictly to these travel protocols and other public safety measures to protect themselves, families, friends, the community at large and to prevent a fourth wave of COVID-19 in the country.\n\nThe NCDC recommended that states ensure sample collection and testing should remain widely accessible so that people who have symptoms or have been exposed to a positive case get tested quickly in healthcare and other settings.\n\nThis, it said, can be achieved through increased COVID-19 testing using approved antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) that are being rolled out by the NCDC and partners as well as PCR tests where applicable.\n\n\u2018Vaccination also reduces community transmission and States should effectively implement ongoing mass vaccination campaigns and encourage citizens to make use of every available opportunity to get vaccination,\u2019 the NCDC suggested.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) said, yesterday, the review of the 2021 budget has led to discovery of 257 duplicated projects worth N20.138 billion.\n\nChairman of ICPC, Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, made the disclosure at the third national summit on Diminishing Corruption in Public Sector, with the theme: Corruption and Coat of Government New Imperatives for Fiscal Transparency, organised by the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC).\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nHe said the commission also uncovered a syndicate of corrupt individuals within the service which corruptly employed unsuspecting Nigerians, issued them fake letters of employment, fraudulently enrolled them on IPPIS and post them to equally unsuspecting MDAs to commence work. He said ICPC was already prosecuting one of the leaders of the syndicate from whose custody led to the retrieval of several fake letters of recommendation purportedly signed by Chief of Staff to the President, ministers, federal civil service commission and other high ranking Nigerians.\n\nOwasanoye added that ICPC\u2019s projects tracking covered 1,083 projects across entire country with exception of Borno and Zamfara due to security challenges.\n\nHe said the exercise verified implementation of executive and zip projects of legislators. He added that so far, action has been initiated against 67 contractors and forced them back to site and ensured completion of 966 projects worth N310 billion some of which were hitherto abandoned.\n\nThe ICPC boss added that there was a mini civil wars going on between the Board and management and sometimes within the board. He added that the squabbles were as a result of abuse of power prohibited by ICPC Act and unreasonable demands by some Board members for privileges contrary to extant circulars and laws and government\u2019s resolve to minimise cost of governance.\n\nHe identified illegal recruitment, illegal and unilateral increase in wages and remuneration by some MDAs as some of the factors responsible for high cost of governance and rising personnel budget. Other factors, he said, were indiscriminate local and international travels, unreasonable demands by some political appointee board members of MDAs and budget padding.\n\nAccording to him, ICPC is investigating some cases of illegal recruitment forwarded to it by the Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation.\n\nHe said the Ministry of Labour and the University College Hospital, Ibadan, and some employees of other MDAs had been implicated in illegal recruitments.\n\n\u201cThis abuse of power is consummated with complicity of compromised elements in IPPIS. These cases are currently under investigation. At another level, a syndicate of corrupt individuals within the service corruptly employ unsuspecting Nigerians and issue them fake letters of employment.\n\nHowever, President Muhammadu Buhari has threatened that his administration would not hesitate to punish heads of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) that fraudulently present new projects as ongoing projects in the budget.\n\nThis is even as he warned that his administration would sanction those who bring in personnel into the public workforce by illegal recruitment, pad their payroll and retain ghost workers.\n\n\u201cWe reduced the cost of governance by maintaining our promise to complete abandoned or ongoing projects commenced by previous administrations and have ensured that MDAs do not put forward new capital projects at the expense of ongoing projects.\n\n\u2018\u2018Government has, however, noted from the activities of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) that some MDAs have devised the fraudulent practice of presenting new projects as ongoing projects.\n\n\u201cNecessary action and sanctions will continue against the heads of such errant MDAs. I am confident that ICPC will continue to maintain the vigilance required of her by the ICPC Act in this regard,\u201d he said.\n\nBut reacting to the ICPC\u2019s allegation, Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, said he was the one that initiated an investigation when he discovered the employment scam in his ministry.\n\nA statement by the Deputy Director Press and Public Relations in the Ministry, Charles Akpan, said the case was an old but ongoing investigation which the ICPC ought to have completed since Senator Ngige reported the matter, upon re-appointment as Minister in August 2021.\n\n\u201cYes, there was an illegal recruitment perpetrated between May 29, 2019 and August 2019 when the president dissolved his first term cabinet and Senator Ngige temporarily out of office. However, upon re-appointment and resumption of duties in August 2021, Sen. Ngige discovered the illegality and promptly raised it at the Federal Executive Council, necessitating a preliminary investigation by the office of the Head of Service of the Federation.\n\n\u201cThe minister subsequently empaneled an internal investigative committee in the ministry to unearth how 752 senior and 532 junior staff members were recruited in the ministry without ministerial and Head of Civil Service of the Federation approval, as stipulated in the extant circular on recruitment .\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the activities of the Committee were stalled by the then Permanent Secretary who claimed that the ICPC had stepped into the matter .\n\n\u201cThe onus, therefore, lies squarely on the ICPC to break the syndicate which the Minister appropriately reported first at the Federal Executive Council and subsequently taken over by the ICPC two and half years ago.\n\n\u201cThis is the right step instead of rehashing an old development and singling out for bad publicity, a ministry whose Minister decided to blow the whistle on fraud as the Deputy Chairman of the Presidential Committee on Salaries saddled with the responsibility of bringing down undue personnel cost , especially via illegal recruitment .\n\n\u201cThe ministry wishes to further note that every recruitment, especially of senior civil servants, passes through the Federal Civil Service Commission, in fact, solely authorized by it. The ICPC should therefore expand its investigation into the Federal Civil Service Commission to break the syndicate, a commendable step in this direction, no doubt.\n\n\u202260% of overhead expenditure on travels, stationery, reveals SGF\n\nSecretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, in his opening remarks said in three years, 60 per cent of its overhead expenditure were on travels, maintenance, welfare and stationery in three years.\n\nHe said it was no longer acceptable for the country\u2019s resources to be expended on frivolities, fake projects and meaningless capital projects.\n\nHe added that the Federal Government is working towards reducing the cost of governance and utilising its resources efficiently.\n\nHe added that the Buhari\u2019s administration has so far demonstrated and still continues to demonstrate its determination to fight corruption and improve governance no matter what it takes and howsoever corruption fights back with the stolen resources at its disposal.\n\nHe urge Nigerians to support the anti-corruption agencies in its fight against graft, because it is a collective responsibility.\n\n\u2022746 corruption cases dispensed with \u2013CJN\n\nIn his good will message, the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Tanko Muhammad, said the judiciary has been in the forefront in the fight against graft.\n\nHe said despite the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in virtually the whole of 2020 and a better part of 2021, 746 corruption cases were dispensed with.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the number of forfeited non-cash recoveries made, include 51 Automobiles, 16 Real Estates, 11 Barge/Tug Boats and 2 Schools. Between 2nd January and 14th November, 2021, a total number of 1,144 suspects were convicted of various corruption and financial related crimes, while the number of non-cash forfeited assets has also risen to include: eight Aircrafts, seven Filling Stations, 48 Real Estates and 149 Vehicles, amongst others. Similarly, various cash forfeiture were made in hundreds of millions of Naira. We shall not rest on our oars until every trace of corruption and undue exercise of influence to negatively secure unmerited advantage over others is stamped out of our clime.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "text": "By Lukman Olabiyi\n\nThe Lagos State Government, yesterday, picked holes in the report of the Judicial Panel of Inquiry as it identified several inconsistence in the much-expected the White Paper released last night.\n\nThe Justice Doris Okuwobi (retd) headed panel inaugurated on October 19, 2020, to look into complaints of citizens against human rights abuses by the police had submitted its report a fortnight ago.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nSpecifically, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, in the White Paper, dismissed the panel\u2019s report that nine persons were killed at the tollgate when soldiers and the police shot reportedly at peaceful protesters as \u201cassumptions and speculations.\u201d\n\nThe submission of the panel that there was indeed a massacre has since attracted the outrage of Nigerians and the international community who called for the prosecution of the offending officers.\n\nHowever, the White Paper faulted the \u201cmassacre\u201d claim. It stated that the report listed names of people who died at the Lekki Tollgate but failed to offer explanation regarding circumstances of their death.\n\nThe four-member committee led by Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN) had Commissioner for Youths and Social Development, Mr Segun Dawodu, Special Adviser, Works and Infrastructure, Mrs Aramide Adeyoye and Permanent Secretary, Cabinet Office, Mrs Tolani Oshodi.\n\nPart of their report read: \u201cIt is quite astonishing that in the list of 11 deaths set on pages 297-298, two of the names appeared twice (Kolade Salam, Folorunsho Olabisi as Nos. 37 and 38). Furthermore, the person listed at No. 46 Nathaniel Solomon who testified as a witness and petitioned the Judicial Panel Inquiry in respect of his brother who he allegedly died at Lekki Tollgate was also listed dead person.\u201d\n\nOut of the 32 recommendations made by the Judicial Panel of Inquiry in its report of November 15, 2021, the state government accepted 11, rejected one and accepted six with modifications but said 14 of the recommendations fell outside the powers of Lagos State Government and would be forwarded to the Federal Government for consideration.\n\nOn issue of award of compensation to victims and dead\u2019s people family, the White Paper held that it was marred with inconsistence\n\nEarlier at a press conference, Governor Sanwo-Olu had restated his administration\u2019s commitment to ensure peace in the state.\n\nHe also assured that government\u2019s decision and action on the report would be based on law.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the much-expected White Paper, the governor said the state faces the hard choice of restoring harmony or doing itself a great harm and urged residents to join his administration in strengthening harmony and put the state on the path of peace.\n\nHe asked residents to reject those fueling anarchy and suspicion, clinging to unsubstantiated belief that carried no weight of verifiable evidence, while choosing emotion over facts.\n\nHis administration, he said, is ready to facilitate better communication between the youths and the State\u2019s security machinery to resolve issues before they become intractable.\n\nHe said he would be leading \u2018A Walk for Peace\u2019 in December to herald the healing of the land and extended an open invitation to the youths, members of the diplomatic corps, civil society groups, students and the media.\n\nThe governor specifically invited Folarin Falana (Falz), Debo Adebayo (Mr. Marcaroni), Dele Farotimi, Temitope Majekodunmi, Segun Awosanya (Segalinks), Adedotun (Just Detoun), Seun Kuti, Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu and Commander of Rapid Response Squad (RRS), CSP Yinka Egbeyemi and others to join him in the \u201chistoric march for our dear Lagos.\u201d\n\nHowever, some of the youths have rejected the call.\n\nRegardless, the governor said: \u201cNobody will build this city for us. Let us show the world who we are. We are Lagosians.\n\nA people of great renown, driven by the irrepressible spirit of Lagos. It is a testimony to our strength and resilience as a people that, despite the huge losses incurred because of these terrible incidents, we have bounced back, with our economy as vibrant and virile as ever. I have no doubt whatsoever that our prospects are as bright as ever and the best lies ahead of Lagos State and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe will make it easier for our young people to initiate formal complaints on human rights violations through the Ministry of Justice. We will also improve the coordination between the state government and the security agencies, including the police and the military. In this vein, we are studying how to improve security policy formulation, information sharing, and clarifying rules of engagement in times of social unrest.\n\n\u201cJust as we have established a mechanism to compensate all those who lost homes, businesses, and livelihoods to the violent destruction of October 2020, we shall also establish a detailed procedure for the just compensation of citizens with verified claims of police brutality committed during the protests.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on last year\u2019s EndSARS protests and the events that followed, especially the hijack of the protests by hoodlums, which led to the destruction of public and private property worth billions of naira, the Governor said the Government, the youth, protesters, the Police and other security agencies have learned the appropriate lessons from the EndSARS protests, particularly the Lekki Tollgate incident, with a view to averting any recurrence to the detriment of the State.\n\nOn mixed reactions following the release of the report of the Judicial Panel of Inquiry, Sanwo-Olu said his administration remained committed to the process that would bring a closure to a \u201cpainful episode\u201d in the history of the State.\n\nHe recalled that the panel was originally inaugurated to investigate allegations of police brutality committed by the disbanded SARS and in the aftermath of what happened on October 20, 2020, he decided to expand the mandate to include investigating what happened at the Lekki Tollgate that night.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of good faith and a sincere commitment to uncovering the truth, we constituted a panel of individuals that we believed were independent, credible, and representative of the various stakeholder communities interested in the movement against police brutality.\n\n\u201cApart from the chairman of the panel being a respected retired jurist, various stakeholders including the youths, #EndSARS protesters, the police and civil society groups were represented on the panel. I am sure no member of the panel can claim that the State Government made any attempt to influence them in any way throughout the duration of its sitting.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "text": "\u2022$20bn spent on EPC, oil sector services in four years, says NCDMB\n\n\u2022Sylva optimistic about investments inflow\n\nEjiofor Alike in Lagos, Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Olusegun Samuel in Yenagoa\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited yesterday attributed the current global gas crisis to shortage of investments in the oil sector as activists, investors, and climate change advocates continue to mount pressure on banks and oil companies to withdraw funding for fossil fuel related projects.\n\nNNPC said there might be no end in sight to the overheating of the oil market, which could even worsen if the required financing of major oil and gas projects continued to lag.\n\nSpeaking in Yenagoa during the 10th Practical Nigerian Content (PNC) Conference organised by Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), the Group Executive Director, Upstream, NNPC, Adokiye Tombomieye, urged Nigeria to look inwards for financing of major projects.\n\nThe event was attended by several industry and non-sector players, including the governor of Bayelsa State, Douye Diri; Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, who was represented by the Director, Human Resources Management, Dr. Famous Eseduwo; and the NCDMB Executive Secretary, Simbi Wabote.\n\nOthers at the event included Country Chair, Shell Nigeria, Osagie Okunbor; Group Managing Director, NNPC, Mele Kyari, who attended virtually; Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Petroleum Agency (NURPC), Mr Gbenga Komolafe; and several top shots in the oil and gas industry.\n\nTombomieye, who was represented by the Group General Manager, National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS) Bala Wunti, said there had been a downward spiral in investment in the oil and gas industry since 2000. But he stressed that with the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) things would change from 2022.\n\nTagged, \u201cDriving Nigerian Content in the New Dawn of the Petroleum Industry Act,\u201d the NNPC top official, who spoke during one of the sessions, maintained that there was an on-going trend of upward movement in the industry.\n\n\u201cThe reason is not far-fetched,\u201d Tombomieye stated, adding, \u201cWe have seen the consequence of uncertainty in the industry. Investment and uncertainty never mix.\u201d\n\nTombomieye explained, \u201cWhether we go ahead with the energy transition or not we have already created a monster and that monster is that we now have finance activists, investment activists that have come into the space to create problems for energy investment.\n\n\u201cEnergy investment is being attacked and will continue to be attacked in the fossil fuels industry. Investment capital is now very discriminatory against fossil fuels, but not only that, it has become more and more impatient.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to invest today and recoup the money tomorrow. Nobody wants to invest that money for 10 years, but I need to let you know that the upstream space is not a day\u2019s job. You will invest today and wait for 10 years. These issues have created an impediment to investment.\u201d\n\nAccording to the GED, the crunch on finance and investment has not created the new energy crisis across the globe, but has seen the prices of gas skyrocketing in the last few months.\n\nHowever, he stated that the situation had also brought about significant opportunities for Nigeria, which would now have to look elsewhere to finance major projects.\n\nHe said, \u201cIf I\u2019m not getting money from JP Morgan and I\u2019m not getting money from Blackwell, if Shell is running away, where else will the money come from. And this is a challenge for the service contractors. We do know that there should be active collaborations by the service contractors.\u201d\n\nTombomieye argued that though many players within the industry liked to cut corners, with the advent of the PIA, that would soon stop. He said major investments would start rolling in by 2022 as pending disputes are being resolved.\n\nDuring the event, the NCDMB Executive Secretary, Wabote, formally signed a deal with Amal Technologies for the setting up a state-of-the-art factory to produce hardware, embedded systems, and other technological devices in Nigeria. He said the plant could produce as much as two million electricity meters.\n\nWabote stated, \u201cThe plant will produce smart gas/smoke detector alarm devices that monitor and detect smoke and all types of gas leakages (especially LPG), call the user\u2019s mobile phone if the intensity of the gas is getting high, and automatically shut off the valve of the gas cylinder using Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence technology.\u201d\n\nOn the board\u2019s 10-year roadmap, Wabote said while there was a total of 96 initiatives, 56 were on track, 24 were on-going, 16 initiatives were not yet due, while overall, 75 per cent of the roadmap was on-track as at November 2021.\n\nAccording to Wabote, \u201cFive areas monitored for evaluation of Nigerian content are engineering, procurement, fabrication, project management, and services. Based on projects covered by our monitoring and evaluation directorate, a total of $20.4 billion was spent on these five categories between 2016 and 2020.\n\n\u201cThe top three industries\u2019 spend are $8.07 billion on fabrication, representing 39 per cent of spend; $4.74billion on engineering services, representing 23 per cent of spending, and $5.67 billion on procurement of manufactured materials representing 28 per cent of spend.\n\n\u201cThe low spends were $1.18 billion on services, representing six per cent of spend, and $746 million on project management, representing four per cent of spend.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, Sylva called for closer collaboration among the various agencies of the ministry with implementation of the PIA about to come into force. He said the conference had continued to grow every year, adding that the NCDMB had consistently broken new grounds with the implementation of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development (NOGICD) Act.\n\nHe enjoined the board to continue its upward trajectory and stay focused on the implementation of the Nigerian Content 10-Year Strategic Roadmap to grow Nigerian content to the targeted level of 70 per cent by 2027.\n\nWabote said, \u201cGovernment expects that with the PIA now in place and supported by the enabling structures to ease doing business, new Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) should begin to happen rapidly in the Nigerian oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cWith over $42 billion worth of investment agreement signed by various Nigerian entities at the just concluded Intra African Trade Fair (IATF) in South Africa, there is strong optimism that so many new projects would soon commence in the Nigerian oil and gas industry.\u201d\n\nKomolafe, in his comments read by the Senior Technical Adviser NUPRC, Mr. Abel Nsa, said over a decade since the enactment of the NOGICD Act, so much had been achieved by the NCDMB over the years in the development of indigenous capacity. He said this had helped in stimulating the local economy and brought about the resurgence of new businesses, creation of jobs for the youth and unemployed, in addition to the retention of wealth in the country.\n\nShell Chair in Nigeria said the company in 2016 spent over N2 billion in the construction, upgrade and provision of equipment for the Nigerian Institute of Welding (NIW) in a bid to enhance welding technology in-country.\n\n\u201cWith this investment, the institute is now able to perform destructive and non-destructive testing of materials in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nDiri urged the stakeholders to create \u201clocal contentment\u201d, to foster a conducive environment for the operations of the oil companies.\n\nShell MD, Okunbor Urges Nigeria to Optimise Energy Resources\n\nOkunbor said Nigeria should adopt a two-pronged strategy for its energy transition programme in response to global calls for reduction in the exploitation of fossil fuels and production of Green House Gases (GHG).\n\nOkunbor spoke while delivering the 51st Founders\u2019 Day Lecture of the University of Benin, titled, \u201cThe Global Energy Transition and The Imperatives for Nigeria.\u201d He called for an urgent optimisation of Nigeria\u2019s energy resources for speedy economic and industrial development of the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cNigeria has gas in abundance \u2013 around 202 trillion cubic feet of proven gas reserves and about 600 trillion cubic feet of unproven reserves. Harnessing these vast gas resources, and on time too, is key in the next decade of Nigeria\u2019s existence.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the second approach for Nigeria\u2019s successful energy transition would be an intentional growth of the off-grid power and renewables industry taking advantage of foreign financial support and technology transfer.\n\nOkunbor stated, \u201cThe on-going energy transition is here with us. As with other transitions, it is a journey that will involve multiple approaches, collective action and undoubtedly present new challenges and opportunities.\n\n\u201cNigeria is well positioned to ride the wave of the current energy transition with its abundance of natural fossil fuels and renewable solar energy. We need to move with a greater sense of urgency and a clear sense of direction.\u201d\n\nOkunbor, who is also the Managing Director of The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC), said, \u201cNigeria, as a country with abundant natural fossil fuel resources, cannot afford for international and multilateral agencies to stop funding the development of fossil fuels, particularly gas projects.\n\n\u201cThe transition is underway,\u201d Okunbor said, \u201cbut it will move at different paces and produce different outcomes in different countries, depending on local factors. Society, as a whole, faces a dual challenge to transition to a low-carbon energy future, dealing with how to manage the risk of climate change, while also extending the benefits of energy to everyone on the planet. This is a challenge that requires changes in the way energy is produced, used and made accessible to people.\u201d\n\nDespite the efforts at decarbonisation, Okunbor said oil and gas would remain in the energy mix for some decades to come. He said, \u201cThis is partly a consequence of the time needed for renewables to reach the necessary level of materiality. In part, it is also a consequence of the lack of substitution options in some parts of the economy. But the world will need to meet its energy needs at the same time as it tackles climate change.\u201d\n\nHe noted that to make the federal government\u2019s \u201dDecade of Gas\u201d agenda a success, the country would need to unlock the domestic gas-to-power value chain; accelerate infrastructure development; drive gas-based industrialisation; and deepen domestic liquefied petroleum gas penetration.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Lagos White Paper Rips Apart Panel\u2019s Report on #EndSARS",
          "text": "\u2022Accepts 11 of 32 recommendations, rejects one, agrees on six with modifications, sends 14 to FG\n\n\u2022\u201cThe inconsistencies and contradictions in the entire JPI report concerning the number of persons, who died at LTG on 20th October 2020, and their cause of death rendered the JPI\u2019s findings and conclusions thereon as totally unreliable and therefore unacceptable.\u201d\n\n\u2022Sanwo-Olu: We\u2019ll bring closure to the painful episode\n\nBy Segun James\n\nThe Lagos State Government, last night, released its much-awaited White Papers on the report of the Judicial Panel of Inquiry over alleged police brutality, especially, the October 20, 2020 incident at the Lekki toll plaza and ripped it apart.\n\nAccording to the White paper, of the 32 recommendations made by the panel on the Lekki toll gate shooting, the state government only accepted 11, rejected one outright, agreed on six, albeit with modifications, while 14, which fell outside its powers would be forwarded to the federal government for consideration.\n\nImportantly, the White Paper, which addressed each of the recommendations and passed a verdict, rejected claims that nine people died at the Lekki toll plaza.\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who for the first time, reacted to the panel\u2019s report in a broadcast yesterday at the Lagos House, Ikeja, promised that his government would bring closure to the painful episode of the #EndSARS with the White Paper.\n\nBut the government, while disputing some of the claims in the report, insisted it was full of discrepancies, irregularities and inaccuracies with claims of deaths of victims, even when some paragraphs of the same report revealed different claims and assertion.\n\nIn the White Paper released by the Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotoso, the government described as baffling, the report that nine protesters were killed during the protest, saying apart from listing out their names in tabular form on pages 297-298, the JPI offered no explanation regarding circumstances of their deaths, adding that the names only sprang up at 297-298 of the report without any justification.\n\n\u201cIt is quite astonishing that in the list of eleven (11) deaths set at pages 297-298, two (2) of the names appeared twice (Kolade Salam, Folorunsho Olabisi as Nos. 37 and 38). Furthermore, the person listed, as No. 46, Nathaniel Solomon, who testified as a witness and petitioned the JPI in respect of his brother, who he alleged died at LTC, himself listed as having died at LTG on 20th October 2020.\n\n\u201cRemarkably, Nathaniel Solomon\u2019s deceased brother (Abata Soloma, was then also listed as No 2 on the list of persons, who died at LTG. The only victim of gunshot injury from LTG was picked up at 7:43, on 21th October 2020 after the curfew commenced (see page 99). Furthermore, there was no shred of evidence regarding, who shot him.\n\n\u201cAnother substantial inconsistency in the JPI Report was the award of compensation to only one (1) out of the alleged nine (9), listed as \u2018deceased\u2019, which showed that the JPI itself had doubts as to the deaths of eight (8) other allegedly deceased persons on its list. See page 304 of the JPI Report,\u201d the White Paper stated.\n\nThe government also picked hole in the justification for the award of money to one Serah Ibrahim, saying she was neither a petitioner nor a claimant before the JPI.\n\n\u201cThe JPI also surprisingly awarded the sum of N10m to one Serah Ibrahim (listed as No. 14 on Page 304 of the Report). Serah Ibrahi was neither a Petitioner nor a Claimant before the JPI. At Page 179 of the report, Serah Ibrahim testified on oath that she did not have any petition before the panel, neither did she have any claims for compensation.\n\n\u201cThis award to Serah Ibrahim is also contrary to the provisions of Section 13, Tribunal of Inquiry Law 2015 (Cap. T6 La of Lagos State), which prescribes that only witnesses requested summoned by a Tribunal of Inquiry are entitled to witness fees subject to consent of the Attorney General. Serah Ibrahim did not testify at the request or summons of the Tribunal. See pages 17-18 of the report for the list of summoned witnesses,\u201d the paper stated.\n\nOn what it considered as fundamental inconsistencies in the findings of the JPI regarding the nine (9) deaths at LTG, the state government maintained that it rejected the claim, because the finding were clearly and manifestly not supported by evidence.\n\nThe government added that the JPI attested to the fact that there was nothing contrary to that of Professor Obafunwa, that only one person died at LTG of gunshot wounds on 21st October, 2020.\n\n\u201cThe JPI\u2019s finding of nine (9) deaths is, therefore, irreconcilable with the evidence of Prof. Obafunwa, that only one (1) person died of gunshot wounds at 7:43pm at LTG on 21stOctober, 2020.\n\n\u201cHaving held that there was no evidence before it to the contrary of what Prof. Obafunwa said, the question is, where did the JPI then get its finding of nine (9) deaths? (see table at pages 297-298).\n\n\u201cIt also follows the irresistible conclusions to be drawn from the JPI\u2019s acceptance of Prof. Obafunwa\u2019s testimony that only one (1) person died of gunshot wounds at LTG on 21stOctober 2020 is that there was no massacre at LTG, contextual or otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe findings of the JPI that nine (9) people died at LTG on 21st October 2020 from gunshots fired by the military are based on assumptions speculations.\n\n\u201cThe inconsistencies and contradictions in the entire JPI report concerning the number of persons, who died at LTG on 20th October 2020, and their cause of death rendered the JPI\u2019s findings and conclusions thereon as totally unreliable and therefore unacceptable.\u201d\n\nFurther on other recommendations, the Lagos government said, it has no control over the internal affairs of the Nigeria Police Force, and that the recommendation would be forwarded to the appropriate authorities, namely the federal government of Nigeria, National Economic Council, Police Service Commission and Nigeria Police Force.\n\nGovernment, however, promised to set up a separate statewide Helpline for human rights abuses in addition to its existing Emergency Toll-Free (767 & 112) Helplines, assuring the people that the recommendations would also be forwarded to the National Economic Council.\n\nSpecifically, on police brutality, the government said out of the 22 recommendations, it would only accept four and forward 18 to the federal government, three of which overlap and have also been accepted.\n\nThe state government further added that it lacked the powers to investigate and fish out police officers as recommended by the JPI at pages 249-254 of the report.\n\nHowever, speaking yesterday, Sanwo-Olu, who sounded emotional in his broadcast and seemed willing to put the matter behind him as quickly as possible, noted that though he believed in the credibility of the panel members to have appointed them for the assignment, their work as well as the eventual leakage of the report had only reopened deep wound.\n\nWhile promising that the decision of his government would be based entirely on the law, the weight of evidence and an unblemished respect for the truth, the governor also invited some of the youths, who were actively involved in the protests for a peace walk to herald the \u201chealing of Lagos\u201d.\n\nSanwo-Olu spoke in a broadcast held at the State House, Alausa, on the government\u2019s position on the panel\u2019s recommendations.\n\n\u201cI will start by saying that we, as an administration, are determined that the next steps that will be taken in this process of coming to terms with the events of October 2020, must bring closure to a painful episode in the history of our State, with the release of the White Paper later today. This, in my view, is a moment that beckons us to define who and what we are as a people,\u201d he said.\n\nContinuing, the governor explained that, \u201cIt is with great sense of responsibility that I address you today on the reactions that have trailed the release of the #EndSARS Judicial Panel of Inquiry Report submitted to me two weeks ago, and how it has played out in public discourse since then.\n\n\u201cI believe \u2014 and have always been vocal about this \u2014 that we owe it to you, the people of Lagos, to constantly speak and engage with you. In easy times, in difficult circumstances, we will never shy away from making our case to you, while also ensuring that we listen to you.\n\n\u201cTo be a Centre of Excellence, we must be a Centre of Truth. To be a smart city, we first must be a just one. To be a prosperous state, we must establish ourselves as a peaceful entity. And to achieve the Greater Lagos of our dreams, we must learn to live in harmony, even amidst inevitable disagreement.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu also said, in times like these, \u201cwith anger and animosity too quick and fast at hand, it is easy to hide behind our own prejudices, treating them as deeper truths instead of the superficial lies they are.\n\n\u201cIt is far too easy to take sides and choose emotion over fact, even when the truth is to be found in shades of nuances. It is easy to choose darkness over light; to take perverse delight in playing unhelpful games of cynicism and suspicion; to cling to beliefs that do not carry the weight of verifiable evidence.\n\n\u201cTo become a champion of prejudice is to own a fleeting and false victory. It is a victory of rancour over reason, of vengeance over justice, of anger over compassion. Today, I stand before you to declare that I reject this path; and I invite you all to do same.\u201d\n\nFor some important context, he claimed that there were certain things the people must never lose sight of, recalling that the Judicial Panel of Inquiry was originally inaugurated to investigate allegations of police brutality committed by the disbanded SARS in the state.\n\n\u201cIn the aftermath of what happened on October 20, 2020, I decided to expand the mandate of the Panel to include investigating what really happened at the Lekki Tollgate that night. As a matter of good faith and a sincere commitment to uncovering the truth, we constituted a panel of individuals that we believed were independent, credible, and representative of the various stakeholder community interested in the movement against police brutality.\n\n\u201cApart from the Chairman of the panel being a respected retired jurist, various stakeholders including the youths, #EndSARS protesters, the police and civil society groups were represented on the panel. I am sure no member of the panel can claim that the state government made any attempt to influence them in any way throughout the duration of its sitting.\n\n\u201cWhile I commend the panel for undertaking its task to the best of its abilities, it is however regrettable that the panel\u2019s work and the leakage of an unauthorised version of the report have generated much tension. Sadly, a deep wound has been reopened.\n\n\u201cThe heated exchanges among various shades of opinion on the report have unfortunately put us all at the risk of missing the larger picture; the fact that what we all seek in common is a land in which we are all safe and secure, law enforcement agents are trusted, and justice is guaranteed for all.\u201d\n\nThe governor reiterated that he had no intention to engage in histrionics or further inflame passion on a matter that had generated intense interest and controversy nationally and internationally, but maintained that, \u201cOur decisions and actions will be based entirely on the law, the weight of evidence and an unblemished respect for the truth.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI have never been in any doubt as to the sincerity, patriotism and noble motivations of both organisers of and participants in the movement to see an end to the human rights abuses by the now disbanded Special Anti- Robbery Squad (SARS).\n\n\u201cIt is also on record that the federal government accepted all the demands of the protesters, including the immediate scrapping of SARS. The National Economic Council (NEC) also recommended the establishment of State Panels of Inquiry into cases of police brutality. And the Lagos State Government was the first to set up its own panel.\n\n\u201cI can boldly say that no state took the advocacy for police reforms and justice in the face of documented brutality more seriously than we did in Lagos. We have so far paid N420million in compensation to victims of police brutality, in line with the recommendations of the panel.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu further recalled that, in solidarity with the protesters, \u201cI joined our youths at various points during the demonstrations, particularly at the Lekki Tollgate and Alausa. I received the charter of demands of the protesters and promised to pass them on to the President and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces, President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cI kept my word and passed on the demands to the President, who promised to act promptly on the issues raised. However, perhaps as a result of entrenched lack of trust between the government and the governed over the years, the protesters responded to the government\u2019s concessions with skepticism, and the demonstrations continued, even growing in intensity.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu acknowledged that what had been \u201cwell organised and peaceful protests were subsequently hijacked in different parts of the country, particularly in Lagos. In the ensuing descent into anarchy, many of our compatriots were caught up in the violence. Several policemen were killed. Public and private property, including critical infrastructure, were set on fire, leading to losses estimated at several billions of naira,\u201d forcing the imposition of a curfew.\n\nWhile hoping that everyone, including the government, the youth, protesters, the police, and other security agencies, would have learned the appropriate lessons from the #EndSARSprotests, particularly the Lekki Tollgate incident, with a view to averting a recurrence, he said \u201cIt is a testimony to our strength and resilience as a people that, despite the huge losses incurred because of these terrible incidents, we have bounced back, with our economy as vibrant and virile as ever.\u201d\n\nTo that extent, Sanwo-Olu said he would be leading \u2018A WALK FOR PEACE\u2019 this December to \u201cherald the healing of our land. Let me use this occasion to extend an open invitation to our youths, members of the diplomatic corps, civil society groups, students and the media as well as other stakeholders to join me.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu, however, identified such individuals as Folarin Falana (Falz), Debo Adebayo (Mr. Marcaroni), Dele Farotimi, Temitope Majekodunmi, Segun Awosanya (Segalinks), Adetoun (Just Detoun), Seun Kuti, CP Hakeem Odumosu and CSP Yinka Egbeyemi as some of those he would like to have join him on the historic march for Lagos.\n\n\u201cNobody will build this city for us. Let us show the world who we are. We are Lagosians \u2013 a people of great renown, driven by the irrepressible spirit of Lagos,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Nigeria\u2019s lawmakers urge NCDC to step up national response\n\nChinedu Eze in Lagos and Udora Orizu in Abuja with agency report\n\nCanada yesterday banned travellers from Nigeria, Egypt, and Malawi over fears of the spread of the new Omicron coronavirus variant, bringing to 10 the number of African countries targeted by Ottawa, according to the AFP.\n\nThis is just as members of Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives at plenary yesterday, mandated the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to step up national response to control the emergence and spread of new COVID-19 omicron variant in order to spare Nigeria the full brunt of the third wave of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cForeign nationals who have transited or stayed in these 10 countries cannot enter Canada if they have been in those countries in the last two weeks,\u201d the AFP quoted Canadian Health Minister, Jean-Yves Duclos, to have said at a press conference.\n\nHe also said all air travelers arriving from outside Canada, apart from the United States, would now need to be tested for Covid-19 at their point of entry, \u201cwhether they are vaccinated or unvaccinated,\u201d and that those travelers would need to isolate until their test results are available.\n\nFirst reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) less than a week ago after being detected in southern Africa earlier in November, the Omicron variant has already appeared in several countries, stoking global fears about a coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than five million people and savaged economies worldwide.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic is not over,\u201d Transport Minister Omar Alghabra added. \u201cTravel measures could change at any moment.\u201d\n\nCanada on Friday banned entry to all travelers from seven southern African countries: Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.\n\nAnd on Sunday, Canada confirmed it had detected its first cases of the new Omicron strain, in two people who had traveled recently to Nigeria.\n\nCanada however, has no direct flight with Nigeria.\n\nMeanwhile, in Nigeria, the House of Representatives have also mandated the NCDC to ensure intensive observation and check on travel protocols for inbound passengers.\n\nIt further mandated the Federal Ministry of Health to mandate the COVID-19 Task Force to immediately activate strategies to be implemented in monitoring adherence to COVID-19 guidelines and ensure residents continue to comply with all advisories aimed at curtailing the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe resolutions of the lawmakers were sequel to the adoption of a motion of urgent national importance sponsored by Hon. Dachung Bagos (PDP, Plateau).\n\nMoving the motion, Bagos said the House was aware that on November 26th, 2021 a new, heavily mutated COVID-19 variant named Omicron was discovered in South Africa and had spread across the globe on Sunday, shutting borders and renewing curbs as the EU chief said governments faced a \u201crace against time\u201d to understand.\n\nHe said the House was also aware that on November 26, 2021, WHO designated the variant B.1.1.529 a variant of concern, named Omicron, on the advice of WHO\u2019s Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution (TAG-VE).\n\nThis decision, he noted was based on the evidence presented to the TAG-VE that Omicron has several mutations that may have an impact on how it behaves, for example, on how easily it spreads or the severity of illness it causes.\n\nHe expressed concerns that Canada said on Sunday it had detected its first cases of the new Omicron strain of COVID in two people who had travelled recently to Nigeria.\n\nHe noted that the NCDC, said it was monitoring emerging evidence on Omicron variant and its implication, to inform Nigeria\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe government of Ontario confirmed that the two cases are In the Capital, Ottawa and also preliminary evidence suggests there may be an increased risk of reinfection with Omicron (ie, people who have previously had COVID-19 could become re-infected more easily with Omicron), as compared to other variants of concern.\n\n\u201cConcerned that a total of 126 genomes of this variant have been detected globally and published on GISAID, a global mechanism for sharing sequencing data, and there seem to be a high number of mutations present in the Omicron variant and the exponential rise suggesting the virus to be highly transmissible and may also present an increased risk of reinfection compared to other variant of concern (VOC).\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, Hon. Henry Nwawuba (PDP, Imo) opined that the provisions which the controversial infectious diseases Bill sought to achieve is playing out today.\n\nHe said the government should be proactive and not wait for other countries to take actions that will affect Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI want to raise the consciousness of Nigerians on the Omicron variant of COVID-19 which has led to travel restrictions placed in some countries. Last year this house moved for the control of infectious diseases bill at the time there was an outcry saying that the bill was draconian and the house was overstepping its boundary, that we are giving too much power to the NCDC.\n\n\u201cAll those things that we proposed in the infectious diseases bill that led to the outcry have happened in the world today. Today there are travel restrictions, vaccine mandate, everything we did is playing out today. The truth about COVID-19 is that we have to be proactive. We can\u2019t sit back and wait.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Herconomy raised $600,000 in a day. Here's how they did it",
          "text": "Herconomy, a startup empowering women through financial services, capacity building, jobs, and networking, has announced the close of a $600,000 pre-seed round to expand the product offerings on their platform.\n\nThe pre-seed round was led by members of the Herconomy\u2019s community, venture capitalist firm Oui Capital and a host of angel investors including Zephans & Co CEO Nkiru Ayemere; Ehi Onwudiwe, Director of Business Transformation at Ernst & Young; Head of Reserve at Diageo, Ope Makinwa; Ama Akpata, co-founder of Jand2Gidi and a host of others. According to the founder and CEO, Ife Durosinmi-Etti, when the round started, the startup got commitments worth $5.7 million from 509 community members within 24 hours but decided to only accept what it needed to scale\u2014$600,000.\n\nBuilding a tribe\n\nIn June 2018, Ife Durosinmi-Etti published Accessing Grants for Startups, a book that showcases local and international opportunities like grants, fellowships and other opportunities available to entrepreneurs in Africa. The book was a culmination of all the opportunities Durosinmi-Etti had been sharing on her personal Instagram profile for months.\n\nFounder, Ife Durosinmi-Etti\n\nMonths after publication, in December, Durosinmi-Etti decided to create an instagram page for the troves of people who had begun following her to get access to the opportunities on her page. She named the page, AGS Tribe, building a community where women get access to several opportunities globally. In Nigeria, women dominate the unpaid job sector, twice the figure of men. There are also more male wage earners\u2014 about 65.67%\u2014than female wage earners\u201434.33%.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to create a place where women could get access to opportunities, grants and fellowships,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cWhen people saw how much value we had to offer, they started following us and discussions around these opportunities grew. It was at that point we knew that it was more than just an opportunity board, it was a community.\u201d\n\nBy 2019, the AGS Tribe had grown to amass thousands in following. Handling the page and community became a full-time job for Durosinmi-Etti, and she decided to launch a paid community platform where people could access these opportunities seamlessly. The initial plan was to create a web platform to this effect, but that proved impossible when the platform crashed on the launch date on the 6th December 2019. That same evening, the Tribe moved to Telegram group offering people access at \u20a65,000 ($12) a month or \u20a650,000 ($120) a year.\n\nA year after launch, AGS Tribe had grown to a community of over 1,500 paying members who could access the community\u2019s opportunities as well as weekly capacity building workshops focusing on a variety of subjects from investments and finance, to SGBV and health issues.\n\nScaling, however, became a barrier as the team behind AGS began to find it difficult to coordinate the number of conversations the Telegram community had. \u201cIt was a bit hectic,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti admitted. \u201cWe had such a large number of people in one group. Logging off for hours could mean you\u2019d return to see thousands of messages in the community. And because opportunities are shared between conversations, people would sometimes have to read through every single message to find what they want. It was imperative to find a solution.\u201d\n\nHerconomy\n\nOne of the global issues exacerbated by COVID was the wage gap. Millions of people lost their jobs due to the lockdown, but women were hit harder with 5.5 million of them affected, almost 1 million more than men. In addition, many more women faced increased responsibilities at home as the lockdown mandated work/school-from-home situations everywhere.\n\nRealising this, AGS Tribe expanded their outlook to other opportunities by launching an app.\n\nHerconomy\u2019s product offerings\n\nThe launch of the app also came with the realisation that not all women would be able to afford the membership fees and they wanted to reach even more women. \u201cThe mobile app also included a free membership option,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti added. The app has a three-tier membership structure: a freemium subscription which gives members access to their community and opportunity board for free; Silver membership which gives you access to their weekly capacity building workshops called the Lightbox; and a Gold subscription which offers access to the community\u2019s affinity network where members can get discounts from over 60 brands including Raddison Blu Lagos, Qatar Airways and Adidas. The mobile app came with additional benefits for their Gold members (people who pay $120 yearly). They also introduced a job board and eventually became Amazon\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria for their EU region.\n\nMoving forward\n\nPresently, Herconomy has a community base of over 15,000 people with 20% of them as paying members. The startup plans to introduce financial services to its community members which it believes will be of great benefit to them. Over the years, it has run several saving challenges overseeing at least 500 women who have saved over $100,000 in total. With its new funding, Herconomy plans to introduce a savings feature where members can earn high interests.\n\nWhile most of Herconomy\u2019s funding has come from bootstrapping, the startup has gotten funding from various individuals and corporates who contributed grants and gifts in kind for its community members. Till date, Herconomy claims to have disbursed about \u20a630,000,000 ($71,600) in grants to forty-two women and men as part of its annual grants programme.\n\n\u201cI pitched the idea of Herconomy to several investors but we didn\u2019t get any yeses at first,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti said. The game-changer for them was getting selected for the Startup Bootcamp Accelerator program. During the program, they fine-tuned their business model, got advisors on the program. \u201cI quickly figured that many female-led startups do not get funding easily, so I decided to create a table for herself,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti commented. In August, she made a post via Instagram stories, asking if anyone was interested in investing in Herconomy. Within a day, as Durosinmi-Etti explains, she got \u201chundreds of responses\u201d from community members who were interested in investing.\n\n\u201cIn the end, we had 509 people who pledged $5.7 million, but we only needed $600,000. We also noticed not everyone could afford our $20,000 minimums, so we decided to create a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for the people who couldn\u2019t. They did this because it was extremely important for their community members to be part of this raise. So we went on GetEquity, created a private deal room and invited specific people that had indicated to invest,\u201d the founder shared. While the round did include investments from venture capital firms like Oui Capital, most of it came from Herconomy\u2019s own community of users who were interested in building the brand, 70% of whom were women.\n\n\u201cIt all worked out for the best,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti said. \u201cWe were able to ensure that women could easily invest. I\u2019m excited about creating the mindset of investing in women which is what we preach at Herconomy.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on their investment, Olu Oyinsan, Managing Partner of Oui Capital said, \u201cOur thesis is that community is very key to the future of consumer fintech in Africa. The company has a very strong community element, and also focuses on creating financial products and prosperity for women- who have historically been underserved with financial services. We like the company very much and are happy to be on this journey with the team.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "By creating more secure saving and trading options as well as frictionless cross-border payment and instant local remittance, crypto continues to solve the persistent inefficiencies in Africa\u2019s conventional financial systems.\n\nBut as good as this may sound, navigating through most of the available crypto products still feels like Chinese arithmetic to many Africans. And this experience is shutting out a large number of Africans from the crypto economy, thereby hindering even wider adoption.\n\nIn a bid to solve this problem, a handful of startups are entering the market. One of them, Payourse, a Lagos-based blockchain startup that builds user-friendly products and tools to accelerate the adoption of crypto in Africa, has secured a $600,000 pre-seed investment to scale its products, hire more talent and expand into new markets.\n\nJoining this round is Micheal Ugwu, one of the biggest NFT collectors in Africa, Flori Ventures, Olumide Soyombo\u2019s Voltron Capital, and Allegory Capital. Other angel investors like CELO Co-founders Marek Olszewski and Rene Reinsberg, Kola Aina of Ventures Platform, Angel Touch Holdings, and Oluwatobi Anisere, also participated.\n\nFounded in September 2019 by Bashir Aminu (CEO) and John Anisere (CTO), Payourse is solving the problem of accessibility and adoption of the Web3 economy by providing the core infrastructure and tools that help African businesses build user-friendly crypto and Web3 products.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIt all started as a pet project\n\nWhile working at Busha, a crypto exchange that recently raised $4.2 seed funding, as its first product designer, Aminu got the idea to build a simple platform that collects wallet addresses and then generates shareable links. So he shared the idea with Anisere, who was a colleague and a front-end engineer then at Busha. Anisere bought into the idea and after a few concepts deliberation, they launched into action. In September 2019, Coinprofile was launched, as a pet project.\n\nBut because of its seamless experience, Coinprofile began to gain traction among crypto users. The more people got on the product the more the duo realised how powerful and important their product can get. So they continued to find product-market fit and collect customer feedback to improve Coinprofile.\n\n\u201cIn May 2020, after acquiring a handful of users and considering the feedback and requests we\u2019ve pulled, we added a remittance functionality that allows users to make payment with their wallets,\u201d Aminu told TechCabal.\n\nNow, a little over two years, Coinprofile has morphed into an easy, fast and cheap crypto-fiat payment gateway that allows users anywhere in the world to directly send crypto and receive fiat value in any chosen African bank account within minutes, starting with Nigerian bank accounts.\n\nThe Big Pivot\n\nAccording to the CEO, in the process of building several web3 tools and APIs around the Coinprofile product, it became evident that they have not only built a great financial product, they have also sort of built infrastructures powerful and flexible enough for other businesses to incorporate, build and thrive on.\n\nThe Payourse team\n\n\u201cBecause of their ease of use, we realised that we could open up our technologies to other businesses to build sustainable and user-friendly web3 products on,\u201d Aminu said. \u201cThis, we believe, will lead to the launching of more products the ecosystem needs to mature and encourage mass crypto adoption across the continent.\u201d\n\nAs a result of this, the company last month announced that it\u2019d be consolidating all its present and future products under a parent company, Payourse. The parent company has three core functionalities that power its infrastructure: wallets, remittances and liquidity.\n\nThe company said it has also started building use cases to display its ambition to power the next hundreds of crypto-enable businesses. For instance, it has built Simpa, which is an easy and fast no-code platform available for anybody to quickly launch a fully customisable crypto exchange within minutes.\n\nJust like building web apps on the Bubble platform without writing a single line of code, Payourse wants to make sure people can build no-code crypto products and has already started with Simpa\u2014with more to come.\n\nWhen you say remittance, what about CBN?\n\nIt\u2019s been over 10 months since the Central Bank of Nigeria ordered all financial institutions to stop facilitating crypto transactions. Thanks to startups like Helicarrier, Binance, Paxful and others that started using the peer-to-peer (P2P) model to minimize the effect of the crackdown on the market.\n\nIt was difficult to trade crypto in the early days of the sanction, but as these companies continued to improvise and improve their P2P offerings, things began to ease up. But how has Payourse, particularly, dealt with the elephant in the room?\n\nWhile P2P is a good necessary alternative, it can be slow and insecure. Most of the exchange platforms don\u2019t want to serve as escrow; for them, it\u2019s like picking up another business entirely. So they only provide a P2P marketplace and leave everyone to their fate.\n\nPayourse didn\u2019t follow this P2P route, instead, they employ the service of liquidity partners. This means they\u2019ve partnered with some entities that provide liquidity (Fiat currencies like the Naira) whenever somebody performs a transaction. Once you send your crypto, their partners get the signal and fulfill your transaction, within minutes.\n\nTraction and growth\n\nAccording to the company, there are currently over 5,000 users on Coinprofile who process millions of dollars on the platform. Payourse also said that in 2021, its payment gateway has grown 15,000% across all metrics, maintaining a 150% month-on-month growth rate.\n\nMeanwhile, the new no-code tool Simpa which is on schedule to launch in the coming weeks is currently collecting data for early users to access the beta version.\n\nUnlike other companies that charge fees on every transaction, Coinprofile doesn\u2019t charge users on a transaction. So if it\u2019s free to use, how then does the company make money?\n\n\u201cWe make money from the little exchange margin we make from our liquidity partners on every transaction. This way, everybody wins,\u201d said Aminu.\n\nSpeaking on the new investment, Aminu said the team is proud of the quality of their investors. \u201cThis new funding will help us improve our existing use-cases and then build more as we extend into new markets and accelerate crypto adoption on the continent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI worked closely with Bashir as a visiting Partner at Flori Ventures. I\u2019ve spent 4 batches at YC and rarely do I see a company with this kind of knockout performance and a founder who is willing to put in the hard work to continue to nurture it.\u201d Holly Liu, Visiting Partner at Flori Ventures, said. \u201cBashir is capable of meeting the demands of a crazy growth startup and also ramp up fundraising.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on their investment in Payourse, Olumide Soyombo, Managing Partner at Voltron Capital, said: \u201cWe are excited to back the Payourse mission as we believe this team is a super technical team with subject matter expertise. The team is solving an important problem by providing the key infrastructure for Africans and African businesses to adopt crypto.\u201d\n\nPayourse believes the future of finance in Africa will be defined by crypto and has set its goal to help more African businesses and individuals get on board, by positioning itself as the go-to platform for anything crypto on the continent. And it has already earmarked Ghana and Kenya as the next markets to push that ambition.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Are Ugandan telcos equipped to protect user data?",
          "text": "A recent report from Unwanted Witness, a Uganda-based civil society organisation, reveals that two years on from the implementation of Uganda\u2019s Data Protection and Privacy Act, the nation\u2019s tech companies are still struggling with compliance.\n\nTelecommunication operators are at the core of Uganda\u2019s digital development, and yet are among the worst offenders on privacy violations, raising questions about their ability to protect sensitive user data.\n\nLaw in action\n\nUganda implemented its first codified legislation on data protection, the Data Protection, and Privacy Act, in 2019. The act, which establishes principles surrounding the protection, collection, and storage of customers\u2019 personal data, designates the National Information Technology Authority \u2013 Uganda (NITA-U) as the official regulator for data protection in the country and lays out penalties for violators.\n\nSince its implementation, Uganda\u2019s core data privacy act has proven to be an effective regulator, to some extent.\n\nIn 2020, Unwanted Witness investigated motorcycle ride-hailing startup Safeboda\u2019s compliance with data privacy regulations in the country. Their findings revealed that the company was not only guilty of using a privacy policy that did not comply with Uganda\u2019s data protection standards but also using a third-party tracker called CleverTap. When asked about its use of CleverTap, Safeboda\u2019s Chief Financial Officer claimed it was for \u201ctracking marketing communication and identifying product issues\u201d.\n\nThough no punitive measures were taken against Safeboda, the NITA-U did publish a report on its own investigation into the company\u2019s practices in early 2021. The regulator concluded that Safeboda was, in fact, in violation of the Data Protection and Privacy Act and ordered the company to address \u201call areas of non-compliance\u201d over a four-month period.\n\nTelecom offenders\n\nWhile the work of Unwanted Witness and Uganda\u2019s Data Privacy Act helped stop some of Safeboda\u2019s practices, Uganda\u2019s telecommunication operators are still among the worst offenders.\n\nThe Privacy Scorecard Report 2021 revealed that telecom operators in Uganda failed to give adequate information to data subjects, mention third-party sharing of personal data, and give information on the quantity of information shared.\n\nThis resulted in a low overall score of 35% for the industry when it came to data compliance.\n\nThese digital failures have real-life consequences.\n\nAccording to Dorothy Mukasa, CEO at Unwanted Witness, \u201cTelecom companies are the highest data collectors [in Uganda]\u201d, and they are still struggling to ensure that they protect individuals.\u201d\n\nThis is particularly dangerous in an environment where telecom companies occupy a fundamental position in a nation\u2019s economy and tech industry.\n\nThe number of mobile subscribers in Uganda is rapidly on the rise, increasing by 21,200% from 2000\u20132020. As mobile subscriptions have grown, telcos in Uganda have also received new access to personal information from Ugandan citizens.\n\nIn 2018, the Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) issued new SIM card validation guidelines that required telcos to verify a registered mobile number against a citizen\u2019s National Identification Number (NIN). The regulation was meant to tackle fraud and crime, but, in the hands of telcos with suboptimal data privacy frameworks, it offered new capabilities for exploitation.\n\nHacking\n\nSince the onset of COVID-19, the use of mobile money\u2014of which MTN and Airtel Uganda maintain a 90% share of the market\u2014has increased by around 12.7%.\n\nAlongside this jump in users has also been more frequent instances of cyber fraud aimed at telecom companies, revealing just how essential proper data management and protection is.\n\nA 2019 Uganda Police Annual Crime Report revealed a 25% increase in cybercrime over a one-year period, leading to a loss of around $11 million from SIM card swapping and hacking digital financial accounts.\n\nIn 2020, MTN and Airtel Uganda were forced to temporarily suspend mobile money operations after their systems were compromised by hackers. Unconfirmed reports estimate that billions of Ugandan shillings were lost in the breach.\n\nWhy tech offends\n\nBeyond the value that an application garners from its products and services is the data it collects. Generally, a tech company, in its early stages, is not profitable in the traditional sense. At this point, its value is, in part, based on the data the company has access to through its user base.\n\nOften, as in the case of Safeboda, tech companies add trackers and third-party software on top of their applications to process the data they collect. Updating users each and every time a company adds a new tracker and explaining exactly what that tracker does can be bad for business.\n\nWhen Apple rolled out a new update allowing customers to opt-out of data trackers used by social media platforms earlier this year, digital citizens leaped at the opportunity, resulting in an estimated loss of $9.85 billion in revenue by Snap, Meta (formerly Facebook), Twitter, and YouTube.\n\nIn Uganda\u2019s case, the tech companies that operate there gather data on a traditionally underserved tech market where there is \u201clow awareness of the power that they have to change and control their personal data,\u201d according to Mukasa.\n\nThis leaves Uganda\u2019s digital citizens vulnerable to unscrupulous tech companies who \u201care exploiting the low levels of awareness among the population to be able to collect as much as they can,\u201d said Mukasa.\n\nCountries around the world whose tech industries developed faster than regulation could keep up with had to learn hard lessons about digital privacy.\n\nThe Cybersecurity Administration of China (CAC) has embarked on a year-long campaign to rein in powerful tech companies the government feels have had unchecked access to user data for far too long.\n\nFacebook has also been in and out of courts in the US and UK over data privacy issues, since 2018.\n\nAs Uganda\u2019s tech industry continues to develop, it too will have to contend with the benefits and costs of tech development.\n\nWhile this is going on, monitoring and evaluation by independent, civil society organisations like Unwanted Witness will become more important than ever.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "African female founders need access to high-impact mentors",
          "text": "Beyond funding, African female entrepreneurs need access to high-impact mentors and who are willing to open up their network and teach what they know.\n\nA few weeks into January this year, Eloho Omame and Odunayo Eweniyi announced their female-focused angel investment fund. Aptly named FirstCheck Africa, the angel fund is on a mission to \u201cadvance equity, capital and leadership for a generation of women in Africa through technology & entrepreneurship\u201d. While FirstCheck argues that African women in tech are \u201cover-mentored\u201d and \u201cunder-funded\u201d, early-stage female founders need some handholding. Our ecosystem is still male-dominated, and female entrepreneurs need experienced mentors to guide them on their journey to success.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to not have a cart-before-the-horse mentality when it comes to helping African female entrepreneurs succeed. Of course, funding women-led businesses is important because entrepreneurs need capital to scale. But it\u2019s also important to level the playing field, invite female founders to join active networks, and connect them to successful high-impact mentors.\n\nFor Africa to build a more equitable tech ecosystem, mentoring and funding African women in tech must work hand-in-hand, not one after the other. Local and global investors must do the work of creating short-term or long-term mentorship programs that cater to underrepresented female founders. These mentorship programs should teach African women in tech how to network, grow their social equity, pitch to accelerators or funds with larger check sizes, and much more.\n\nThe conversation about mentorship is tricky because most female entrepreneurs are interested in getting the capital they need to run their businesses. But venture capitalists like Sohaila Ouffata believe that working with highly trained and experienced mentors is just as important as applying to receive funding from accelerators and venture funds. So Ouffata founded The African Tech Vision (ATV) to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for ambitious African female founders and executive leaders.\n\nEmpowering African female entrepreneurs at scale\n\nThe African Tech Vision is a free entrepreneurial programme designed to support early-stage African female founders and help them achieve their goals. Over six weeks, selected female founders are paired with mentors and industry experts from local and international startup scenes and technology hubs. During the programme, participants gain access to hands-on mentoring and coaching sessions provided by vetted ATV mentors. While most accelerator and mentorship programs are held in-person at specific locations, ATV kicked off its inaugural program online in April of this year. Hosting virtual mentoring sessions means more African female founders can apply to the programme without worrying about visa applications, travel fees, and sourcing for accommodation.\n\n\u201cThe style of the hands-on mentoring session is based on virtual interactions. Most mentors prefer video calls and structure the session based on the needs of the entrepreneur,\u201d said Ouffata in an emailed response to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cWe spent time with each entrepreneur at the beginning of the programme to define areas in which they are looking for mentorship. This is also the basis for matchmaking with selected mentors. For example, some founders prefer to speak multiple times a week with some of their mentors. Others prefer to ping their mentors with questions over WhatsApp. As we are a founder-friendly programme, we leave the decision to the founders and their mentors.\u201d\n\nATV offered its inaugural cohort a mix of recorded and live workshops, founder stories (events where experienced founders shared stories of success, challenges, and failures in their fields), and social activities every week. In the last programme, some of the content models made available to the cohort of African female founders include \u2018Engaging with Mentors\u2019, \u2018Elevator Pitch\u2018, \u2018Investors 101\u2018, \u2018Product Market Fit\u2019, and \u2018Sales Fundamentals\u2018.\n\nSome of the previous cohort\u2019s early-stage female founders were from Ghana, Rwanda, Morocco, Tunisia, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. Therefore, Ouffata and her team need to pull as many female founders from different African countries as possible before their next program kicks off in 2022.\n\nSource: TechCabal Insights\n\nWhy is The African Tech Vision betting on African women?\n\nFor Ouffata, betting on African female founders is a personal decision that fits into the larger vision of The African Tech Vision program.\n\n\u201cThe African Tech Vision was born out of a desire to honour my African heritage and to create and open up entrepreneurial pathways for other African women,\u201d said Ouffata. \u201cOur vision is to connect female entrepreneurs with experienced international role models and aim to inspire and nurture the next generation of purpose-driven African female entrepreneurs.\u201d\n\nNo doubt ATV\u2019s vision is audacious, but Africa\u2019s male-dominated technology and business ecosystem is a reality that can longer be ignored or explained away. ATV\u2019s model is designed to spotlight, empower, and back high-impact female founders in Africa.\n\nBeyond sentiments and national pride, ATV\u2019s reasons for backing female entrepreneurs are also rooted in profitability and nation-building. Businesses owned or founded by women are said to deliver higher revenue and better bet to a group of niche investors. Additionally, women typically reinvest up to 90% of their income back into their families and extended communities. This means that more girls and women need to be included in the global economy through education, employment, and mentorship.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn most stories, there are almost always two sides of the coin. When it comes to fundraising, for some, it could be as easy as getting funds in two hours, and for others, it could take as much as nine years\n\nThe fundraising journey can be very tedious, and as Bashir Aminu, Payourse CEO, told Techpoint Africa on a call yesterday, it took a while for everything to come together.\n\nToday, Payourse announces a $600,000 pre-seed, which saw participation from Michael Ugwu, Flori Ventures, Voltron Capital, and Allegory Capital. Others include CELO Co-founders Marek Olszewski and Rene Reinsberg; Kola Aina, Managing Partner, Ventures Platform; Angel Touch Holdings; and Oluwatobi Anisere.\n\nThis is the company\u2019s first real funding round, with the combination of a $100,000 raise from Ugwu in March 2021, another $100,000 from Flori Ventures in July 2021 and an angel investment from Payourse\u2019s co-founder\u2019s \u2014 John Anisere \u2014 brother, Oluwatobi Anisere in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Aminu tells Techpoint that they never actually reached out to investors. Ugwu sent a Direct Message to one of the co-founders on Twitter, Flori Ventures was introduced through a partner and so was Olumide Soyombo, Founder of Volton Capital.\n\nBut the early days of applying to accelerators and getting rejected \u2014 they applied to Y Combinator twice and got rejected both times \u2014 taught them an important lesson.\n\n\u201cIt was getting the meeting with the investors that was the problem. We realised that once we actually get a meeting with an investor and talk to them, they want to invest. The first day we had a call with Michael, he wanted to invest.\u201d The same story with Flori Ventures, Aminu says.\n\nThe journey into entrepreneurship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2019, Aminu, Anisere, and Hakeem Oyewole co-founded Payourse, launching the company\u2019s first product, Coinprofile.\n\nAminu had dropped out of a five-year programme in the Federal University of Technology, Minna in 2017, but had caught the crypto bug before then.\n\n\u201cI found out about crypto from a friend and then I bought some and since then I became obsessed. Because it was interesting to me and I was someone who was really curious back in school, and II didn\u2019t really understand how it could be money and wanted to understand it. I kind of went into a rabbit hole of trying to understand how bitcoin and crypto works.\u201d\n\nThat same year, he met Oyewole on an online crypto forum and the two became good friends. So good that both founded a crypto startup in the same year.\n\nUnfortunately, it failed because, as Aminu laughingly says, \u201cI was very young then and didn\u2019t know anything.\u201d They went on to found another startup in 2018, but this one \u201cfailed even faster.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt this point, Aminu decided the startup life was not for him and decided to take his chances in the labour market.\n\nDuring his undergraduate days, he had learnt graphic design and soon got a job with an Australian company where he learnt a little bit of product designing while in his role as a graphic designer.\n\nHe moved to Busha \u2014 where he met Anisere \u2014 and then to TeamApt, Yellow Card, Interswitch, and finally Binance.\n\nWhat is a Payourse?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayourse\u2019s homepage\n\nOn Monday, November 22, 2021, Aminu announced on Twitter a new parent company, Payourse.\n\nToday, I'm excited to introduce our new parent brand.\n\n\n\nMeet Payourse @payourse. We're passionate about accelerating access to crypto for Africans by providing tools that make it easier, faster and cheaper for businesses to build user-friendly crypto products like @coinpHQ. \u2014 Bash \u6211\u521b\u9020 \u272a (@scozky) November 22, 2021\n\nBut as he tells Techpoint during our call, Payourse has been in existence since 2019, when they first founded Coinprofile.\n\n\u201cWell, we actually created Payourse, a long time ago, in 2019 as a parent company, but we never really announced it to the world. But it\u2019s always been the parent company. And we\u2019ve always had this long term vision of a company which would build user-friendly products on top of crypto.\u201d\n\nThe idea is to make crypto accessible to everyone, as Aminu strongly believes it is the future of finance in Africa.\n\nAfrica is one of the fastest-growing crypto markets globally with six countries \u2014 Kenya, Nigeria, Togo, South Africa, Ghana, and Tanzania \u2014 making it into the 2021 Global Crypto Adoption Index Top 20.\n\nThe Web3 \u2014 a decentralised version of the Internet built on public blockchains \u2014 craze has also been making waves, with increasing noise being made in crypto and blockchain spaces.\n\nHowever, apart from creating accessible products is the vision to be the crypto powerhouse, a go-to for any organisation looking to build or integrate Web3 or crypto products.\n\nPayourse currently has two major products, Coinprofile and Simpa.\n\nThe first iteration of Coinprofile was a Disha but for crypto wallets.\n\n\u201cI used to be an OTC (over-the-counter) trader, so anytime someone wants to send me crypto, and I always have to go to my wallet address and copy wallet address and send it to them. It was a very tedious process.\u201d\n\nFrom experience, he knew that other traders faced the same issues, so the idea was for people to create an account and store all their wallet addresses, and a unique link is created, leading to a landing page. This was where the name coinprofile came from. It doesn\u2019t require sign-ups, and there are no transaction charges.\n\nThe current remittance product came in May. Now, users can send cryptocurrency to anyone and receive it in cash in their bank accounts.\n\nThen there\u2019s Simpa, a no-code tool that enables businesses to create their own crypto exchange.\n\nThe numbers and the challenges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith free transfers, how does Payourse make money? Well, Aminu tells Techpoint that they earn an average of 1.5 \u2013 2% and sometimes even as much as 10% per transaction.\n\nAccording to the company, there are currently over 5,000 users on Coinprofile, with millions of dollars processed on the platform. Since its launch, the exchange has grown 15,000% across all touchpoints and maintained a 150% month-on-month growth rate.\n\nAminu says Simpa is currently collecting data for early users to access the beta version and is scheduled to launch in the coming weeks.\n\nBut building a company always comes with its challenges. And two of the biggest have been talent and marketing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve faced challenges in hiring. In fact, we\u2019ve had to let go of two of our employees. We had to hire them at that point because we hadn\u2019t raised a lot of funding, and we couldn\u2019t get a lot of really good people to apply for our roles.\u201d\n\nIn the end, they\u2019ve had to settle for junior to mid-level developers, with most senior developers opting to work for international companies.\n\nWith a team of eight and three technical founders, they\u2019ve had to rely on word of mouth and judging by their numbers, they might not be doing too badly, but Aminu tells us that an essential hire in the wake of this raise is hiring a Growth or Marketing person.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApart from hiring, Aminu outlines two critical things this fund would be used for: building out current products to package them for sales and making existing use cases better.\n\nIn a round that was oversubscribed up to $2 million, Aminu says there\u2019s no rush to get more funding.\n\n\u201cFor us, we believe Payourse will be the powerhouse of crypto in Africa. When a business wants to develop crypto products for the African market or wants to integrate crypto into what they already have, we are the go-to.\n\n\u201cOur plan is not just to build infrastructure, but also build use cases around the infrastructure. We already have Coinprofile and Simpa. It might take a while, but we are not honestly looking to raise a $100 million very quickly. We want to, first of all, have a business and a clear path to revenue. The funding will come.\u201d\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nWelcome to the last month of 2021. We hope it\u2019s been an amazing year but if not there\u2019s still time to end the year on a high.\n\nNow to the news.\n\nExcept you\u2019ve not been following the news, by now, you must have heard that Twitter\u2019s co-founder, Jack Dorsey, has resigned from his role as CEO to be replaced by the CTO, Parag Agrawal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDorsey was CEO across two spells and led the company through its most successful period since it was founded.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about today. There\u2019s a subtle sub-plot involving Dorsey\u2019s successor, the Indian-American Agrawal, that bears some looking at.\n\nThe former CTO is the latest to join the ranks of Indian-American CEOs at global tech companies.\n\nAs cliche as it may sound, it seems there\u2019s something people of Indian descent know that Africans don\u2019t.\n\nFirst, a disclaimer: While Africa is not a country, I compare it to India because they possess similarities in population, stage of development, and percentage of young people.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get to it.\n\nWe\u2019ve had Adobe, IBM, WeWork, Microsoft, Google, and now Twitter appoint first-generation Indian-Americans as CEOs in the last five years.\n\nThrow in PepsiCo, Mastercard, and Deutsche Bank, who have had Indian CEOs at some point in the recent past, and it no longer looks like a coincidence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, what has been responsible for this? And what lessons can Africans learn from this?\n\nThe state of India\u2019s economy was responsible for a massive exodus of Indians in the 80s and 90s. With little hope of getting a job at home, they moved to the US for further education. At the end of their studies, a lot stayed back, taking up positions in the country.\n\nAfrica is going through something similar now. With rising unemployment rates and an educational system that cannot meet the needs of its young population, more Africans are moving away for studies and better career opportunities.\n\nThe United States, Canada, China, and the United Kingdom are the most popular destinations. However, these students are not all returning to the continent, with a good number deciding to get jobs that keep them in these countries.\n\nAlready, we have several Africans working at global tech companies like Twitter, Facebook, Spotify, Netflix, and Youtube.\n\nAt this rate, it\u2019s probably only a matter of time before we see Africans heading global tech giants.\n\nSo here\u2019s why I think that would happen. One, our largely youthful population. About 60% of the African population is under the age of 25.\n\nNow, depending on how you look at it, this could be a curse or a blessing. A massive investment in education could see humans become Africa\u2019s biggest export. On the other hand, an army of uneducated and unemployed youths could lead to increased insecurity.\n\nDuring a Techpoint-hosted townhall with the Twitter team in 2019, Agrawal and Dorsey disclosed plans to hire more Nigerians. With Twitter situating its headquarters in Ghana, we could see more Africans join global tech companies.\n\nTwo, one of colonialism\u2019s legacies is cultural diversity. Most African countries have at least two major ethnic groups and religions. Nigeria, for example, has over 300 tribes. As a result, Africans have an easy time adapting when they move abroad.\n\nWhile there is no guarantee that we would have Africans head global tech companies, the success of Africans in international organisations offers some insight into what could happen when talent meets opportunities.\n\nWhat do you think? Am I just being a hopeless optimist? Could we one day see an Ivorian CEO for a global tech company?\n\nOr is it going to be a case of Africans building their own companies instead of climbing up the ladders in global companies as the likes of Agrawal did?\n\nPlease, send in your thoughts.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nBlackouts, social media bans, and digital surveillance continue to rise across Africa. Read\n\nHave a nice day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArt is evolving. Before now, art could only depict meaning in the real world \u2014 an image of a known person or a familiar sunset over a known hill. The idea of drawing, moulding or sculpting something that didn\u2019t or had never existed before was inconceivable.\n\nBy 1915, Kazimir Malevich, a Russian artist, proved art could be anything through his painting \u2014 a black square. With Malevich\u2019s work, art transcended from being a form of representation to a form of expression.\n\nPresently, evolution has brought art to an age where it is intangible yet valuable.\n\nAn idea of what NFTs are\n\nInherently, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital art that have been given a unique identity on the blockchain. See them as a digital certificate that shows the original owner of something even though there are several copies of that same thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey\u2019re called non-fungible because, unlike fungible tokens, they\u2019re unique and cannot be replicated.\n\nA fungible token, for instance, is Bitcoin (BTC). That\u2019s because one BTC in my wallet is the same as one BTC in someone else\u2019s wallet, and if we exchange it, we still have the same thing.\n\nBut, if we own Anthony Azekwoh\u2019s Red Man NFT and someone else owns an NFT by another artist, we will have completely different things if we exchange it. Hence, non-fungible.\n\nInterestingly, NFTs could be anything; art, picture, video, or music.\n\nNFTs got popular with the birth of CryptoKitties \u2014 digital cats \u2014 which sold for as much as $110,707 in December 2017. However, the first-ever NFT is known as Quantum, minted on the Ethereum network in 2014.\n\nNFTs are stored on the blockchain like other cryptocurrencies but with a different token standard that contains additional information.\n\nIn straightforward terms, a token standard contains a set of information that tells which blockchain network a token belongs to. For example, on the Ethereum blockchain, the common token standard for a fungible token is ERC-20, while for NFTs, it is ERC-721.\n\nHowever, knowing all that technical jargon isn\u2019t so important in creating and selling your own NFT. By now, it is clear that apart from a platform to display creativity; it is also a money-making stream. Beautiful times, we must say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe age of non-fungible tokens (NFTs)\n\nIt\u2019s the age where Anthony Azekwoh, a 21-year old NFT artist, is making a fortune from creating digital art such as his famous Red Man or historical Black Samurai.\n\nThis new dispensation presents an opportunity for people to showcase their artistic expressions and get appreciated immediately.\n\nWith over $10 billion exchanging hands in the NFT market this year alone, the era of digital art is starting to become one many do not want to miss out on.\n\nHowever, like most blockchain innovations, getting into NFTs can be complicated for newbies in the blockchain universe.\n\nGetting into NFTs isn\u2019t so complicated. All that\u2019s needed is to have the necessary tools to build your experience in the field.\n\nLet us walk you through the process\n\n\n\nThis is a Techpoint Extra article, reserved for readers in our Membership Programme.

          "text": "Nigeria has recorded its first cases of the new Omicron COVID-19 variant, days after it was first discovered in South Africa, and suffered a travel ban from some countries.\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on Wednesday announced it identified and confirmed three cases in individuals with travel history to South Africa.\n\nSamples obtained for the stipulated day two test for all travellers to Nigeria were positive for this variant in these persons after the NCDC mounted genomic surveillance on inbound international travellers at the National Reference Laboratory (NRL), Abuja, and a network of other testing laboratories.\n\nThe disease police said it is now racing to complete sequencing of samples of coronavirus collected recently in positive travellers from all countries, particularly those that have reported the Omicron variant.\n\nNew travel rule\n\nIn the bid to beef up public health response against the new variant, the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 revised the national travel advisory to now require a negative COVID-19 test result done not more than 48hrs before departure from all inbound travelers to Nigeria.\n\nAll outbound passengers are also required to present evidence of full vaccination or a negative COVID-19 PCR test done not later than 48 hours before departure.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to Nigerians to adhere strictly to these travel protocols and other public safety measures to protect themselves, families, friends, the community at large and to prevent a fourth wave of COVID-19 in the country as we combat the pandemic and these emerging variants including the Delta variant,\u201d the NCDC said in a statement signed Ifedayo Adetifa, director-general\n\nRead also: Omicron variant: Canada adds Nigeria to travel ban list\n\nFacts on Omicron\n\nOmicron has now been identified in 22 countries with Nigeria and Brazil among the latest, as of Wednesday.\n\nConclusions on the severity of the variant have continued to generate mixed reactions, as doctors in South Africa, for instance, say the symptoms are unusual but extremely mild, while the US says it\u2019s too soon to determine the severity.\n\nAdrian Puren, the acting executive director of South Africa\u2019s communicable disease institute said Omicron could be the most likely candidate to displace the highly contagious Delta variant, in terms of the rate of infection, in a report monitored by BusinessDay.\n\nBut it could be too early to say with less than 100 genomic sequences produced on it.\n\nIf Omicron proves even more transmissible than the Delta variant, it could lead to a sharp spike in infections that could put pressure on hospitals.\n\nPuren said scientists should know within four weeks to what extent Omicron can evade the immunity generated by vaccines or prior infection, and whether it leads to worse clinical symptoms than other variants.\n\nAnecdotal accounts by doctors who have treated South African COVID-19 patients say Omicron appears to be producing mild symptoms, including a dry cough, fever, and night sweats.\n\nHowever, the United Nations has warned against the use of a travell ban to curb the spread, saying it is not effective.\n\nVaccination in Nigeria\n\nIn its recommendation to states, the NCDC urged that sample collection and testing remain widely accessible, for those exposed to be identified quickly.\n\nIt also called for increased vaccination to reduce community transmission, states should effectively implement ongoing mass vaccination campaigns and encourage citizens to take up vaccines.\n\nUnfortunately, Nigeria\u2019s vaccination course has been slack.\n\nThe country has only administered slightly over 9.6 million doses, with just 6.26 percent of its population covered, data from the African Centre for Disease Control and Prevention shows.\n\nDespite having over 21 million doses of vaccine supplies including AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson, and Moderna, the country suffers a 54.4 percent (11.5 million) gap in uptake.\n\nThis, amid a stock of vaccine supplies that is nowhere near adequate, and poor capacity for genomic surveillance nationwide underscores how ill-equipped the country is to tackle the latest COVID-19 strain if it turns out very violent.\n\nThe country still relies heavily on donated vaccines, which is more likely to decline as the new variant gives vaccine-producing countries new reasons to focus on themselves first.\n\nOn November 30, 105 new cases and one death brought the total to 214, 218 confirmed cases and 2,977 deaths recorded in 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory.\n\nNigeria\u2019s best bet could be to tighten surveillance at all borders and within communities and stop the disease on its track as experts have urged.",

Two out of three generator users in Nigeria complained of hearing impairment, according to data cited in a 2019 report by the Access to Energy Institute (A2EI), a non-profit research and development institute working to advance the use of solar energy in developing countries.\n\n\u201cThe noise is delirious,\u201d Bello Ajayi, a businessman who works close to one of the government\u2019s major agencies, told BusinessDay. \u201cEvery time a nearby generator goes off, it\u2019s like a part of your soul you never knew was missing returns.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody hates them,\u201d he added, \u201cbut everybody, including government officials, has one.\u201d\n\nMost Nigerians are aware of more health and environmentally friendly options such as solar energy, but cost, quality, and lack of expertise make implementing them difficult. That is why more investment in solar energy is needed, said Segun Adaju, the president of the Renewable Energy Association of Nigeria.",

There are lots of factors militating against the maritime industry in Nigeria, including lack of infrastructure like scanners to speed up cargo examination by Customs and other government agencies.\u201d\n\nThe ANLCA boss however criticised the duplicity of functions by agencies of government at the industry, which he identified as one of the drawbacks.\n\nHe also identified other challenges which include the perennial traffic gridlock along the ports access roads, lack of functional railway system for immediate evacuation of containers out of the port, activities of miscreants within the port corridors, corruption and sabotage in the system.\n\n\u201cNumerous agencies of governments at the seaport are carrying out similar functions. Perennial traffic gridlock is hindering easy access to the seaport; including poor road network within the port vicinity\u201d.\n\nIn his welcome address, the President of AMJON, Mr. Paul Ogbuokiri said the apologized for the failure of 2020 edition which he attributed to the outbreak of Covid-19; and expressed confidence that the transport and logics chain industry unhappily slowed down by the virus will redouble their efforts at capacity performance.\n\nThe AMJON leader urged the Federal Government to complete the rehabilitation of the Lagos ports roads timely, and also enjoined the management of the Nigerian Ports Authority and the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency to recommit to their determination to raise the growth index and increase the tempo of sub regional competitiveness.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have noted that the leadership of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency has commenced a campaign for the removal of the war risk insurance on Nigerian bound cargoes and is also inching closer to returning Nigerian to a position of importance in global maritime politics.\n\n\u201cIt has also come to our notice that the new leadership at the Nigerian Ports Authority has reworked the Electronic Truck Call System (ETO) to the extent that it brought down the notorious Apapa traffic gridlock by about 60 per cent. We\u2019re looking forward that this magic Wang will put traffic completely under control so that Apapa, Nigeria\u2019s foremost port city will regain its grove.\n\n\u201cTo this end we urge the Federal Government to ensure that the Nigerian ports access roads, particularly the about 10 kilometers Oshodi-Apapa expressway which has been under construction for more than 20 is completed as experts have said that completion of construction work on the road will reduce the Apapa gridlock by 40 per cent.\u201d\n\nPresident General of the Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria, Comrade Adewale Adeyanju, Dr. Kayode Farinto, Hajia Bola Muse, General Manager, Lagos Operations, National Inland Waterways Authority, Engr. (Mrs) Sarat Braimoh, were among those honoured at the prestigious event by AMJON.\n\n...",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s low tax-to-GDP ratio not reason to increase taxes \u2013 Adesina",
          "text": "President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Akinwumi Adesina, has said the federal government must exercise restraint in tax increment, noting that the fact that the country\u2019s tax to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio at 6.1 percent remained relatively low was not an excuse for incessant tax increase.\n\nThe AfDB boss said this on Tuesday in Abuja while delivering a lecture at the 51st annual conference of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) themed \u2018Trust in Governance,\u2019 Cable reported.\n\nTo increase tax revenue, Nigeria raised its value-added tax (VAT) rate from five percent to 7.5 percent in 2020.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) had advised Nigeria to increase its VAT rate to at least 10 percent by 2022 and 15 percent by 2025, which it says is the average rate in countries belonging to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).\n\nBut Adesina said that while other countries with high tax rates have functional free education and free health care systems, such cannot be said for Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, it will be double jeopardy to overtax citizens who provide basic amenities the government has failed to offer.\n\n\u201cWhile tax rates are relatively low in Nigeria, it simply is not an excuse to keep increasing taxes,\u201d Adesina said.\n\n\u201cTake the case of Norway for example. Its tax-to-GDP ratio is 39 percent. Singapore\u2019s tax-to-GDP ratio is 13.2 percent. And Nigeria\u2019s tax-to-GDP is 6.1 percent. It is easy to make the comparison and say Nigeria needs to raise its taxes to similar levels as in Norway or Singapore.\n\n\u201cBut also consider the following \u2013 In Norway, education is free through university. Singapore, a country that had only 1/3 of Nigeria\u2019s per capita income at its independence in 1965, today has 100 percent access to electricity and 100 percent access to water.\n\n\u201cWhile progress is being made the challenge, however, is that in many parts of Nigeria, citizens do not have access to basic services that governments should be providing as part of the social contract.\n\n\u201cPeople sink their private boreholes to get water. They generate their own electricity oftentimes with diesel. They build roads to their neighbourhoods. They provide security services themselves.\n\n\u201cThese are implicit taxes, borne by society due to either inefficient government or government failure. As such, we must distinguish between nominal taxes and implicit taxes \u2014 taxes that are borne by the people but are not seen nor recorded.\n\n\u201cIt has become so common that we do not even bother to question it. But the fact is governments can simply transfer its responsibility to citizens without being held accountable for its social contract obligations.\u201d\n\nAdesina pointed out that to build trust with the society, governments must fulfil their part of the social contract, and citizens must also pay their fair share of taxes adding that there must be mutual accountability.\n\nHe said governments should be opened up and allow the citizens a right to know how public finances are being used, according to the Cable.\n\n\u201cThis is why I believe that we must develop a \u2018People\u2019s Index of Governance\u2019 with citizen accountability forums,\u201d the AfDB boss said.\n\n\u201cBut when people feel that their resources are mismanaged or being used for opulence, widening the gap between the leaders and those they are leading, it builds distrust and despondency, which then permeates the fabric of society.\n\n\u201cLeaders must not only be accountable; they must live simply. Power is not judged by wealth, but by transforming the lives of people. To earn the trust of people, we must create people\u2019s wealth, not simply personal wealth.\u201d",

In addition, the Agency has procured and deployed Med Safety App for improved ADR reporting\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe mobile phone application enables users to report ADRs and other drug-related products experience, track drug-related safety information, build watch list of medications and view numbers of reports received in WHO database of suspected ADRs\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Agency has procured and deployed Med Safety App for improved ADR for improved reporting.

The Agency through the support of our development partners carried out assessments of one hundred and sixty-five (165) Local Pharmaceutical Manufacturers in Nigeria with a view to developing a GMP Roadmap for NAFDAC and the pharmaceutical industry\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe outcome enabled NAFDAC to make risk categorization of companies and advise on the path of GMP Certification and ensure compliance with respect to clinical sites respectively\u201d.\n\nShe also emphasized that promotion of local manufacturing has been on her priority list.\n\n\u201cThis is to reverse the trend of 30% locally manufactured drug products toward 70%. This building block has 106 recommendations that needed to be fulfilled. Through many self-audits, NAFDAC has met the expectations of the WHO Global Benchmarking requirements\u201d.\n\nOn Laboratory Services, Adeyeye said in 2018, about 80% of NAFDAC equipment pieces were not working and with that situation, ensuring the quality of medicines that are released or approved for use.\n\n\u201cSince 2018, NAFDAC laboratories are changing rapidly with improvement in new laboratory equipment and supplies.

This directorate is the mainstay of our business as a regulatory agency. A large chunk of our internally generated revenue also goes into funding of the laboratories across the country\u201d.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 intervention fund was also predominantly expended on procurement of necessary equipment for the labs.\n\n\u201cAbout N997m of the COVID -19 intervention fund has been spent on the laboratory\u2019s equipment. OPCW gave us N735m, and everything was spent on lab equipment\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs part of strengthening the Agency\u2019s processes, the Yaba Drug and Biologics/Vaccine laboratories are currently being expanded and under construction.

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nAll Progressives Congress (APC) leaders in Ede/Egbedore/ Ejigbo Federal Constituency in Osun state on Tuesday backed the second term bid of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, saying that nobody from the federal Constituency should challenge him at the primary election.\n\nThe APC leaders who converged at the Ido-Osun in their numbers for the federal constituency meeting noted that Governor Oyetola has done well in terms of infrastructural development in the area, adding that whoever contests the primary against the governor from the federal Constituency is not known to them and he or she would not have their support in any form whatsoever.\n\nThe APC leaders said the decision to declare Governor Oyetola as their sole candidate for the upcoming gubernatorial election was borne out of the conviction they have that he would definitely take the state to an enviable status among the comity of states.\n\nAddressing a press conference, the APC chairman in the federal constituency, elders Alh. Gbadebo Ajao said they were impressed by the administrative style and unprecedented achievements of the governor, despite the myriad of economic challenges and humongous debt burden inherited from the previous administration .\n\nIn the text Titled \u201cDeclaration Of Unwavering Support For Oyetola\u2019s Second Term\u201d, the party members stressed \u201cwhosoever contests against the incumbent Governor is Not known to them and does NOT/would not have their support in any form whatsoever.\n\n\u201cWe are saying OYETOLA LEEKAN SI as we continue to strategise as a Federal Constituency to take the governorship position from Alh Isiaka Adegboyega Oyetola coming 2026.\n\n\u201cThis Conference becomes highly INEVITABLE at this time after wide consultations across all divides within our Federal Constituency.\n\n\u201cThe precarious political situation in the Country wherein everyone sees his/her Party/Group as the most popular to win any election at whatever level without weighing nor possessing all prerequisites for winning a good election calls for this Conference since our Federal Constituency is not an island\n\n\u201cSince democracy permits free expression of views, agitations, interests, demonstrations and any means of driving home your needs at a point in time, it has grossly been misused in the recent past.\n\n\u201cBased on the above premise, our agitations in 2018 tagged \u201c-WEST LOKAN\u201d was borne out of perceived and adjudged marginalization and total neglect in the preceding years which served as fueling pads for the movement.\n\n\u201cHowever, the election of Alh Isiaka Adegboyega Oyetola with his pragmatic, all inclusive, BOTTOM-UP approach and sterling administrative style of his administration have brought solace and comfort to our Federal Constituency in many facets and spheres including and not limited to-Educational, Health, Security, Massive infrastructural development, Welfarism, Party rejuvenation, prompt and timely payment of full salaries and approval of minimums wage across board remain convincing proofs while His Excellency-Alh Isiaka Adegboyega Oyetola should be given our unwavering support for his re-election come July 16th 2022.\n\n\u201cWe are amazed that despite the myriads of economic challenges and inherited humongous debt burden, the Oyetola\u2019s administration has continued regular issuance of pensionable bond certificates, payment of monthly pension to pensioners on the old pension scheme and constant release of funds for the settlement of gratuities to the tune of N40billion within the last three years\n\n\u201cOur Federal constituency has benefited greatly from Oyetola\u2019s administration massive infrastructural rejuvenation, our age long infrastructural decay is becoming a thing of the past, notably are the reconstruction of the over 25km Ede- Ara Junction to Ejigbo that was in sorry state for a number of years, reconstruction of Ido Osun township road with spur to Palace, the reconstruction of Oke Gada.\n\n\u201cEde \u2013 Army Barracks (Ede) -Ara Junction, rehabilitation of Ofatedo road, rehabilitation of Akoda Junction to Cottage junction to Oke Gada Ede, the nearly completed 3.8km reconstruction of Ejigbo township road, rehabilitation of Ejigbo market to UNIOSUN Junction, rehabilitation of Osogbo \u2013 Iwo road to mention but a few.\n\n\u201cAlh Isiaka Adegboyega Oyetola also announced few days ago the approval of reconstruction of LAMECO to Agunbelowo \u2013 Okinini- Ilobu \u2013 ifon road, construction of Hallelujah road networks and reconstruction of Okinin township road.\n\n\u201cThe most recent of Oyetola\u2019s administration collaborative efforts with Nigerian Air Force, towards developing the Ido-Osun Airport Corridor are yielding positive results with the establishment of an Airforce Base in Ido Osun.\n\n\u201cHEALTH SECTOR:\n\nAlmost all Primary Health Centres in the 42 electoral Wards within this Federal Constituency were rebuilt, furnished, equipped, stocked, Staffed and operational we are talking which were not so prior to agitation time of 2018 as well as the rehabilitation of Ejigbo General Hospital, other aforementioned sectors have equally witnessed and still witnessing positive unprecedented transformation.\n\n\u201cAt this juncture, we leaders of APC EDE/EGBEDORE/EJIGBO FEDERAL CONSTITUENCY are declaring OUR HEARTY RESOLUTION as a Federal Constituency to remain committed, loyal, supportive and dependable allies of His Excellency Isiaka Adegboyega Oyetola in working selflessly for the realization of his Second Term come 16th day of July 2022.\n\n\u201cBased on this stand, we are also declaring to the World that none of APC members from EDE/EGBEDORE/EJIGBO FEDERAL CONSTITUENCY will contest Party Primaries with the incumbent performing Governor and whosoever does that is Not known to us and does NOT/would not have our support in any form whatsoever but we are saying OYETOLA LEEKAN SI as we continue to strategise as a Federal Constituency to take from Alh Isiaka Adegboyega Oyetola coming 2026.\n\n\u201cAlso on behalf of this Federal Constituency, I wholeheartedly register our profound gratitude and appreciation for uncommon supports from all citizens and residents of this State always accorded our Party led Government under His Excellency -Alh Isiaka Adegboyega Oyetola.\n\n\u201cParty members and our teaming supporters are further enjoined to redouble their efforts towards realization and actualization of second Term bid via gubernatorial election presently slated for the 16th day of July 2022.\u201d",

          "text": "By TANKO ALI\n\nThe Federal Government will sanction those who bring in personnel into the public workforce by illegal recruitment, pad their payroll and retain ghost workers, President Muhammadu Buhari said Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nDeclaring open the 3rd National Summit on Diminishing Corruption in the Public Sector, the President warned that his administration would not hesitate to punish Heads of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) that fraudulently present new projects as ongoing projects in the budget.\n\n\u2018\u2018We reduced the cost of governance by maintaining our promise to complete abandoned or ongoing projects commenced by previous administrations and have ensured that MDAs do not put forward new capital projects at the expense of ongoing projects.\n\n\u2018\u2018Government has, however, noted from the activities of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) that some MDAs have devised the fraudulent practice of presenting new projects as ongoing projects.\n\n\u2018\u2018Necessary action and sanctions will continue against the heads of such errant MDAs. I am confident that ICPC will continue to maintain the vigilance required of her by the ICPC Act in this regard,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President described the summit with the theme \u201cCorruption and Cost of Governance: New Imperatives for Fiscal Transparency,\u201d as auspicious.\n\nHe noted that it reminds us of the negative impacts of unnecessary cost of governance and offers an opportunity for critical stakeholders to offer suggestions on ways to further reduce the cost of governance and promote transparency and accountability in government expenditure.\n\n\u2018\u2018I am delighted that the Legislative and Judicial arms of government are also under focus on managing the cost of governance because government is a collective and is not the business of the Executive branch alone.\n\n\u2018\u2018On 19th August 2020, the Federal Executive Council adopted the National Ethics and Integrity Policy which I launched on 25th September 2020.\n\n\u2018\u2018I am delighted that some public officers continue not only to demonstrate the core values of ethics, integrity and patriotism but have been identified for their sterling anti-corruption disposition in their workplace,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nA highpoint of the event attended by the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad and a representative of the Senate President Ahmed Lawan was the presentation of the 2021 Public Service Integrity Awards to three distinguished Nigerians.\n\nThey are Nelson Okoronkwo, Deputy Director, Legal, Federal Ministry of Information and Culture, Muhammad Ahmad, Assistant Commander of Narcotics, National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) and Ikenna Nweke, a PhD student, from Imo State, studying in Japan.\n\nOkoronkwo, who was recognised for his consistent acts of integrity in the different ministries where he served, is a committee member on fertilizer distribution that led to the recovery of billions of naira from racketeers with collaborators within the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.\n\nHe was credited to have reported corrupt practices that led to the Ogoni cleanup investigation in the Federal Ministry Environment.\n\nAs Committee Chairman on Illegal Recruitment in the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture, the Deputy Director facilitated the detection and removal of over 3000 fake employers from the Service thereby saving the government millions of naira in terms of salaries and emoluments.\n\nThe NDLEA officer, Ahmad, was recognised for demonstrating the highest ideals and standards of the public service in the discharge of his responsibilities.\n\nAlso a recipient of the Chairman/Chief Executive Award for Outstanding Performance and Integrity, Ahmad recently recovered and declared to his Agency the sum of 24,500 USD offered to him as bribe by a drug baron to compromise an investigation of 27.950 kg of cocaine, worth billions of naira\n\nNweke, the Nigerian PhD student in Japan who found a wallet containing a very large amount of money and other valuables returned it to the Japanese police.\n\nHe declined 10 per cent of the money offered to him as a reward.\n\nThe Nigerian, who joined the event virtually from his base in Japan, was recognised for his act of \u2018\u2018honesty and integrity,\u2019\u2019 by the President.\n\nOn Nweke, President Buhari said:\n\n\u2018\u2018I am also happy to note the ICPC special award to Ikenna Steve Nweke, a Nigerian Ph.D student from Imo State studying in Japan.\n\n\u2018\u2018He has done Nigeria proud in far-away Japan by displaying traditional Nigerian values of honesty and integrity and returning a wallet containing a very large sum of money and other valuables to the police.\n\n\u2018\u2018He also declined 10% of the money found as a reward offered to him.\n\n\u2018\u2018I join the ICPC in declaring him ICPC CITIZENS ANTI-CORRUPTION VOLUNTEER GROUP ICON.\n\n\u2018\u2018He is indeed an icon and a beacon for our youths. I also congratulate all those to be awarded the ICPC Certificate of Integrity through their agencies.\u2019\u2019\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "By TANKO ALI\n\nThe Federal Government will sanction those who bring in personnel into the public workforce by illegal recruitment, pad their payroll and retain ghost workers, President Muhammadu Buhari said Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nDeclaring open the 3rd National Summit on Diminishing Corruption in the Public Sector, the President warned that his administration would not hesitate to punish Heads of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) that fraudulently present new projects as ongoing projects in the budget.\n\n\u2018\u2018We reduced the cost of governance by maintaining our promise to complete abandoned or ongoing projects commenced by previous administrations and have ensured that MDAs do not put forward new capital projects at the expense of ongoing projects.\n\n\u2018\u2018Government has, however, noted from the activities of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) that some MDAs have devised the fraudulent practice of presenting new projects as ongoing projects.\n\n\u2018\u2018Necessary action and sanctions will continue against the heads of such errant MDAs. I am confident that ICPC will continue to maintain the vigilance required of her by the ICPC Act in this regard,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President described the summit with the theme \u201cCorruption and Cost of Governance: New Imperatives for Fiscal Transparency,\u201d as auspicious.\n\nHe noted that it reminds us of the negative impacts of unnecessary cost of governance and offers an opportunity for critical stakeholders to offer suggestions on ways to further reduce the cost of governance and promote transparency and accountability in government expenditure.\n\n\u2018\u2018I am delighted that the Legislative and Judicial arms of government are also under focus on managing the cost of governance because government is a collective and is not the business of the Executive branch alone.\n\n\u2018\u2018On 19th August 2020, the Federal Executive Council adopted the National Ethics and Integrity Policy which I launched on 25th September 2020.\n\n\u2018\u2018I am delighted that some public officers continue not only to demonstrate the core values of ethics, integrity and patriotism but have been identified for their sterling anti-corruption disposition in their workplace,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nA highpoint of the event attended by the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad and a representative of the Senate President Ahmed Lawan was the presentation of the 2021 Public Service Integrity Awards to three distinguished Nigerians.\n\nThey are Nelson Okoronkwo, Deputy Director, Legal, Federal Ministry of Information and Culture, Muhammad Ahmad, Assistant Commander of Narcotics, National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) and Ikenna Nweke, a PhD student, from Imo State, studying in Japan.\n\nOkoronkwo, who was recognised for his consistent acts of integrity in the different ministries where he served, is a committee member on fertilizer distribution that led to the recovery of billions of naira from racketeers with collaborators within the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.\n\nHe was credited to have reported corrupt practices that led to the Ogoni cleanup investigation in the Federal Ministry Environment.\n\nAs Committee Chairman on Illegal Recruitment in the Federal Ministry of Information and Culture, the Deputy Director facilitated the detection and removal of over 3000 fake employers from the Service thereby saving the government millions of naira in terms of salaries and emoluments.\n\nThe NDLEA officer, Ahmad, was recognised for demonstrating the highest ideals and standards of the public service in the discharge of his responsibilities.\n\nAlso a recipient of the Chairman/Chief Executive Award for Outstanding Performance and Integrity, Ahmad recently recovered and declared to his Agency the sum of 24,500 USD offered to him as bribe by a drug baron to compromise an investigation of 27.950 kg of cocaine, worth billions of naira\n\nNweke, the Nigerian PhD student in Japan who found a wallet containing a very large amount of money and other valuables returned it to the Japanese police.\n\nHe declined 10 per cent of the money offered to him as a reward.\n\nThe Nigerian, who joined the event virtually from his base in Japan, was recognised for his act of \u2018\u2018honesty and integrity,\u2019\u2019 by the President.\n\nOn Nweke, President Buhari said:\n\n\u2018\u2018I am also happy to note the ICPC special award to Ikenna Steve Nweke, a Nigerian Ph.D student from Imo State studying in Japan.\n\n\u2018\u2018He has done Nigeria proud in far-away Japan by displaying traditional Nigerian values of honesty and integrity and returning a wallet containing a very large sum of money and other valuables to the police.\n\n\u2018\u2018He also declined 10% of the money found as a reward offered to him.\n\n\u2018\u2018I join the ICPC in declaring him ICPC CITIZENS ANTI-CORRUPTION VOLUNTEER GROUP ICON.\n\n\u2018\u2018He is indeed an icon and a beacon for our youths. I also congratulate all those to be awarded the ICPC Certificate of Integrity through their agencies.\u2019\u2019\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

I met him in good health and care and we discussed as \u2018Umunne\u2019 (brothers).\n\n\u201cIn 2001 when I was Governor, I made his father Eze Israel Okwu Kanu traditional ruler of Akwara Ukwu and since then the family has been very close to me.\n\n\u201cI understand that Nnamdi has an insane amount of people rooting for his back home and I encouraged him to consider the consequences of certain actions and utterances for the sake of the same people.\n\n\u201cEven though, my ideology and his ideology are totally different, God has made us brothers and we can\u2019t run away from each other. I owe him and Nigerians good counseling \u2026Whether he and his family listen to me or not, I will continue counseling him as I have always done in the past. What we need most is a peaceful and secured society.\u201d\n\nIn a swift reaction, Kanu\u2019s family warned Sen.

Is he saying that millions of followers of Nnamdi Kanu who feel disenchanted by the protracted and provocative marginalization and injustice perpetrated against Biafrans by the Nigerian authorities are insane?\n\n\u201cWho is Kalu working for? Must he advertise his visit to our brother? If he thinks he has any solution to offer can\u2019t he work from behind the scene?

He must understand that our brother is not being persecuted because he stole, or committed any crime.

How can he be trusted by the people? We have not forgotten his role in 2017 when our brother was in Kuje prison. What is his mission?

          "text": "The Department of State Services (DSS) has indicated that it is still examining the mobile phones confiscated from Omoyele Sowore, a pro-democracy campaigner and human rights activist, in August 2019.\n\nSowore, the proprietor of SaharaReporters, had filed a lawsuit against the DSS, demanding that the agency release his phones, which had been taken since his arrest in August 2019.\n\nThe case was heard by Justice Anwuli Chikere of the Federal High Court in Abuja on Wednesday.\n\nMrs Funmi Falana, Sowore\u2019s counsel, pressed the DSS lawyer on the illegality of the seizures in her opening remarks.\n\nThe DSS lawyer rambled on while attempting to explain why the lawless organization, which is notorious for human rights breaches, was unable to present a proper court order that allowed them to confiscate the phones and steal N10,000 from his hotel room during his kidnapping in August 2019.\n\nThe phones were \u201crecovered\u201d during his detention, not seized, the DSS said Justice Chikere.\n\nThe phones are currently being scrutinized for any links to terrorism, according to the agency.\n\nBecause Sowore was being tried by a different federal judge, two lawyers from the Ministry of Justice stated that they were presenting preliminary objections to the lawsuit.\n\nFalana, on the other hand, criticized the arguments, telling the judge that, in addition to failing to get a court order to seize the phones, the government had also refused to restore the phones and funds after repeated requests.\n\nShe went on to say that the charge papers in court did not specify that the phones were part of the evidence presented to the federal judge.\n\nShe requested the judge to dismiss the preliminary objections, order the return of Sowore\u2019s phones, and award the petitioner N20 million in damages.\n\nThe case has been delayed until December 8, 2021, when Justice Chikere will rule.\n\nThough the DSS released Sowore following an order from the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), SaharaReporters reported on December 24, 2019, that officials of the secret police failed to return his mobile phones, ostensibly in an attempt to monitor his communication and deprive him of important contacts stored on the devices.\n\nSowore was detained for the first time on August 3, 2019, after calling for Nigerians to come to the streets in peaceful protests to demand that the government provide a better country.\n\nHe was held in custody until December 5, 2019, when he was freed on bond for a short time.\n\nDSS operatives re-arrested him on December 6 inside the Federal High Court in Abuja, and he was held in detention until Tuesday, December 24, 2019, when Malami issued the current release order.",

          "title": "Factional APC caretaker c\u2019ttee impostors \u2013 Akpanudoedehe",
          "text": "There appears to be a confusion of sort in the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) with some members forming a parallel national caretaker committee, purportedly sacking the Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/ Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and scheduling the party\u2019s convention for February 26, 2022.\n\nBut the Buni-led CECPC has disowned the group which it described as impostors, and asked security agents to swoop on them.\n\nThe new group which appointed President Muhammadu Buhari as head of its advisory committee also named Speaker House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila, Lagos state Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and others as members of the new caretaker Committee.\n\nAddressing journalists Monday in Abuja, the group under the aegis of Progressive Youth Movement (PYM) announced the sack of the Buni-led committee and announced a new national caretaker committee with Mustapha Audu as chairman.\n\nAudu, who briefed journalists on the development, also announced the formation of a national reconciliation committee with a mandate to reconcile aggrieved members before its national convention slated for February, 26, 2021.\n\nHe said a zoning formula for positions in the new National Working Committee is expected to emerge at a national convention slated for February 26, 2022.\n\nWhile inaugurating the new committee, Audu the self-acclaimed national chairman said: \u201cToday, we are here to inaugurate the PYM \u2013 CECPC, these young men and women of noble repute have been carefully selected and mandated by all the well-meaning young stakeholders of our great party- the APC- to plan and execute our convention before the end of February 2022.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the plethora of issues within the party. Our party has had a history of shying away from true reconciliation and in many cases inflicting chastisement on members that should have been rewarded for their effort towards building the APC. We will also be setting up a reconciliatory committee to help reconcile aggrieved members within the party.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that in the last couple of years, the party has been on a regressive course and it is necessary for all well-meaning party members to roll up our sleeves and do the needful to ensure that we correct the mistakes that have been made to ensure victory in 2023 for all stakeholders.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would advise all party members to look inwards and understand the need to do things differently so that we can ensure we win back the trust of the Nigerian people as we move closer to the election year.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s join hands and strengthen our internal democracy in our dear party- the APC- and show Nigerians that we have what it takes and we deserve their votes in 2023,\u201d Audu added.\n\nCCEPC reacts\n\nReacting to the development in a statement, National Secretary of the Buni-led CECPC, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, described the new group as a \u201cpaid and misguided group.\u201d\n\nAkpanudoedehe said: \u201cWe have received several enquiries from the media and concerned APC members on the felonious activities of a purported group parading themselves as \u201cProgressive Youth Movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe purported group and membership are unknown to the Party, its structure or as a registered support group. Hence, we completely disown them and cannot account for their activities or join issues with them.\n\n\u201cHowever laughable, the criminal attempt of the purported group to usurp the leadership of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC now bothers (sic) on treasonable felony. Relevant security bodies must now check and address their unscrupulous activities.\n\n\u201cThe attention the purported group seeks will not be given to them by the party. We can only advise that the general public completely disregard them. Members of this group are not registered members of the APC and are being used by opposition elements and fifth columnists to cause confusion.\n\n\u201cAs widely reported, the successful meeting between the APC leadership, Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum and the President produced February 2022 as the timeframe for the party\u2019s National Convention.\n\n\u201cOur focus now is preparing the ground for a rancour-free exercise.\u201d\n\nSheriff tackles Buhari, govs\n\nIn a related development, an APC national chairmanship aspirant and former Borno state Governor Alimodu Sheriff has warned President Buhari and governors elected on the party platform against jettisoning the party\u2019s constitutional requirements for a national convention.\n\nThe former governor said both the president and the APC governors lacked the power to fix a date for the party\u2019s national convention unless a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting is summoned.\n\nSheriff spoke through his campaign media director, Senator Victor Lar in Abuja Monday.\n\nHe said the February date must therefore be rectified by the party\u2019s NEC to make it constitutional.\n\n\u201cWe want to add that though we have commended the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) for taking the initiative to meet with President Muhammadu Buhari on the need for the party\u2019s National Convention to hold, the decision to hold the convention in February 2022 has to be by the party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC).\n\n\u201cIt is normal for members of the party\u2019s national caucus to meet that meeting between the PGF and the president was maybe a partial caucus meeting, even though it was not properly constituted and convened.\n\n\u201cBut both the governors and the president do not have the constitutional powers to take such decision. That decision is supposed to be taken by the party\u2019s NEC. So, we suggest that the APC governors, the president and the party should call a NEC meeting to rectify that February 2022 suggestion for the party\u2019s national convention.\n\n\u201cThe president does not have the constitutional powers to call for a meeting, neither do the governors. It is only the party\u2019s NEC that can take such decision as regards when its national convention will hold.\n\n\u201cWe, however, appeal to our members and supporters to remain calm and focused, we are on course and victory is certain,\u201d Modu Sheriff said.\n\nWhen asked to comment on media reports that APC has zoned the national chairmanship position to the North-central, Senator Lar described the report as laughable.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Modu Sheriff Campaign Organisation finds the purported story as very laughable because the organs of the party that are supposed to communicate that kind of information, are not the ones communicating it, for that reason, we will take it with a pinch of salt.\n\n\u201cAgain, the All Progressives Congress (APC) as a party has never adopted zoning. At what point did they start zoning that they are talking about zoning the party\u2019s national championship position to the North Central?\n\n\u201cWe believe that this is an open contest and the best candidate should emerge for the party to be galvanised for victory in 2023 and Sheriff remains the best candidate. We find the report as the very poor scheming of people who are scared of contesting the position with Sheriff.\u201d\n\nParty denies zoning\n\nSpeaking on zoning, the APC said it did not discuss or reach any decision to zone its national chairmanship position to the North-central zone as reported in a section of the media.\n\nThe party\u2019s scribe, Senator Akpanudoedehe, said the issue of zoning was not in the mandate of the CECPC. \u201cI have the mandate to report whatever decision the CECPC takes and to the best of my knowledge, the committee has not discussed zoning.\u201d\n\nHe added that with the party\u2019s national convention fixed for February 2022, it was expected that party members would come up with different zoning speculations.\n\n\u201cPeople are just flying what will favour their interest, all I know is that the caretaker committee has not discussed or reached a zoning decision,\u201d he said.\n\nMustapha lauds Buni c\u2019teee\n\nAlso speaking on the party leadership, a top national chairman ship aspirant, Malam Salihu Mustapha said the Buni-led committee was on course in its given assignment.\n\nHe said contrary to expectations in certain quarters, there was no uncertainty in the direction of the party under Buni\u2019s watch.\n\nMustapha said this at an interactive session with journalists recently in Lagos.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere should be no blame game at this stage in our party. Honestly, there should be no blame game. Don\u2019t forget the caretaker committee has the mandate to stabilise the party, and that Governor Buni is doing creditably well. I think we should give it to him. This is not the time to be pointing accusing fingers. We must come together to ensure the committee realises its set objective of stabilising the party.\n\n\u201cYes, the committee is on course. No uncertainty in party direction. We are on the right course and we must not allow this collective effort to be derailed. The prayer is that we (referring to his chances) come out victorious so we, as a party, under my watch In Shaa Allah, can deliver dividends of democracy to Nigeria beyond the tenure of the present administration.\u201d\n\nOn what he hopes to do differently if he emerges as the party\u2019s chair, Mustapha, who was the deputy national chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) led by Buhari, said \u201cwhat I will do differently is looking at the future via what is obtainable now.\n\n\u201cIt is against this background that the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) made a 25-year-old man its national youth leader. So, if making a woman the national chairman is a strategy for a party to win election, why not?\u201d\n\nAssuring of a brighter chance over all fellow top contenders, the youthful politician said \u201cmy youthful age is an added advantage. Any party that wants to win in 2023 has to factor in the young generation because 75 per cent of the votes belong to the youths.\n\n\u201cThe ENDSARS has revealed some lessons. The message the ENDSARS was trying to pass before it was hijacked and mismanaged was that the youth should be effectively be part in the scheme of things. So, for me, having seen it all, I will perfectly fit into ensuring a kind of synergy between the old and the youth.\u201d\n\nWhile priding himself as having the endorsement of party stakeholders, Mustapha also said he looked forward to being the chairman for all.\n\n\u201cI want to be the chairman for all, and those contesting with me will be the first people I would approach after the election for them to buy into my programmes,\u201d he said.\n\nThe APC chieftain also identified the imposition of candidates on political parties as a major source of conflict in the nation\u2019s polity, saying this comes with a consequence.\n\n\u201cWe have seen several cases of imposition of unpopular candidates within our polity. You, as will suffer within and the party will also suffer outside because the ultimate of any political contest is to win election after which you settle down to good governance,\u201d Mustapha further added.\n\nThe former governorship aspirant in Kwara state also promised to bring about a leadership that would ensure equity and justice in the party and hold governors accountable to their manifestoes.",

          "text": "The Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to ignore the request of Igbo elders to terminate the trial of Nnamdi Kanu and release him unconditionally.\n\nIn a statement made available to Blueprint in Abuja Monday and signed by NEF\u2019s Director, Publicity and Advocacy, Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, the forum said Buhari would be interfering in the judicial process should he consider the request of the Igbo elders.\n\nIt reads: \u201cNorthern Elders Forum has carefully studied the request of Igbo Elders for President Muhammadu Buhari to terminate the trial of Nnamdi Kanu and release him unconditionally. It has also noted President Buhari\u2019s response which both raised very weighty issues related to the request, and his commitment to consider it.\n\n\u201cThe Forum notes that there are no safe, constructive or informed grounds for granting the request and advises that President Buhari will do serious injury to a country already threatened by multiple challenges to its security and territorial integrity if he delays announcing the only responsible response, which is that the judicial process in the case of Kanu must be allowed to run its course.\n\n\u201cThe Forum noted a judicial decision to label bandits and kidnappers as terrorists, and recommends greater clarity in terms of the targets of this development. In any event, the Forum cautions against profiling and targeting all Fulani as terrorists. Millions of law-abiding Fulani exist, who should be encouraged to stay on the side of the law, while those who have chosen to continue on the path of criminality should feel the full weight of the law.\n\n\u201cThe Forum advises that the National census planned for 2022 should be postponed until after the 2023 elections. The integrity and success of a sensitive and vital activity such as this will be compromised by destabilized and threatened communities and proximity to another sensitive activity such as general elections.\n\n\u201cThe Forum invites attention to the hardship under which the vast majority of the population lives. Increasing poverty levels and widespread insecurity demand that leaders should exercise extreme caution in taking economic and security-related decisions.\n\n\u201cIncrease in the price of fuel in particular will compound the already desperate condition of living of most Nigerians. It is important that decisions on this matter include considerations of the interests of the national economy, welfare of the citizen and reactions of a hard-pressed citizenry.\u201d",

These cases were recent arrivals in the country in the past week.\n\n\u201cFollow up to ensure isolation, linkage to clinical care, contact tracing and other relevant response activities have commenced.

In addition, all outbound passengers regardless of the requirements of destination countries are expected to present evidence of full vaccination or a negative COVID-19 PCR test done not later than 48 hours before departure.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to Nigerians to adhere strictly to these travel protocols and other public safety measures to protect themselves, families, friends, the community at large and to prevent a fourth wave of COVID-19 in the country as we combat the pandemic and these emerging variants, including the Delta variant,\u201d Adetifa pleaded.",

          "text": "Canada on Tuesday banned travellers from Nigeria, Egypt, and Malawi over fears of the spread of the new Omicron coronavirus variant, bringing to 10 the number of African countries targeted by Ottawa, according to the AFP.\n\nThis is just as members of Nigeria\u2019s House of Representatives at plenary on Tuesday, mandated the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to step up national response to control the emergence and spread of new COVID-19 omicron variant in order to spare Nigeria the full brunt of the third wave of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cForeign nationals who have transited or stayed in these 10 countries cannot enter Canada if they have been in those countries in the last two weeks,\u201d the AFP quoted Canadian Health Minister, Jean-Yves Duclos, to have said at a press conference.\n\nHe also said all air travelers arriving from outside Canada, apart from the United States, would now need to be tested for Covid-19 at their point of entry, \u201cwhether they are vaccinated or unvaccinated,\u201d and that those travelers would need to isolate until their test results are available.\n\nFirst reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) less than a week ago after being detected in southern Africa earlier in November, the Omicron variant has already appeared in several countries, stoking global fears about a coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than five million people and savaged economies worldwide.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic is not over,\u201d Transport Minister Omar Alghabra added. \u201cTravel measures could change at any moment.\u201d\n\nCanada on Friday banned entry to all travelers from seven southern African countries: Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.\n\nAnd on Sunday, Canada confirmed it had detected its first cases of the new Omicron strain, in two people who had traveled recently to Nigeria.\n\nCanada however, has no direct flight with Nigeria.\n\nMeanwhile, in Nigeria, the House of Representatives have also mandated the NCDC to ensure intensive observation and check on travel protocols for inbound passengers.\n\nIt further mandated the Federal Ministry of Health to mandate the COVID-19 Task Force to immediately activate strategies to be implemented in monitoring adherence to COVID-19 guidelines and ensure residents continue to comply with all advisories aimed at curtailing the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe resolutions of the lawmakers were sequel to the adoption of a motion of urgent national importance sponsored by Hon. Dachung Bagos (PDP, Plateau).\n\nMoving the motion, Bagos said the House was aware that on November 26th, 2021 a new, heavily mutated COVID-19 variant named Omicron was discovered in South Africa and had spread across the globe on Sunday, shutting borders and renewing curbs as the EU chief said governments faced a \u201crace against time\u201d to understand.\n\nHe said the House was also aware that on November 26, 2021, WHO designated the variant B.1.1.529 a variant of concern, named Omicron, on the advice of WHO\u2019s Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution (TAG-VE).\n\nThis decision, he noted was based on the evidence presented to the TAG-VE that Omicron has several mutations that may have an impact on how it behaves, for example, on how easily it spreads or the severity of illness it causes.\n\nHe expressed concerns that Canada said on Sunday it had detected its first cases of the new Omicron strain of COVID in two people who had travelled recently to Nigeria.\n\nHe noted that the NCDC, said it was monitoring emerging evidence on Omicron variant and its implication, to inform Nigeria\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe government of Ontario confirmed that the two cases are In the Capital, Ottawa and also preliminary evidence suggests there may be an increased risk of reinfection with Omicron (ie, people who have previously had COVID-19 could become re-infected more easily with Omicron), as compared to other variants of concern.\n\n\u201cConcerned that a total of 126 genomes of this variant have been detected globally and published on GISAID, a global mechanism for sharing sequencing data, and there seem to be a high number of mutations present in the Omicron variant and the exponential rise suggesting the virus to be highly transmissible and may also present an increased risk of reinfection compared to other variant of concern (VOC).\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, Hon. Henry Nwawuba (PDP, Imo) opined that the provisions which the controversial infectious diseases Bill sought to achieve is playing out today.\n\nHe said the government should be proactive and not wait for other countries to take actions that will affect Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI want to raise the consciousness of Nigerians on the Omicron variant of COVID-19 which has led to travel restrictions placed in some countries. Last year this house moved for the control of infectious diseases bill at the time there was an outcry saying that the bill was draconian and the house was overstepping its boundary, that we are giving too much power to the NCDC.\n\n\u201cAll those things that we proposed in the infectious diseases bill that led to the outcry have happened in the world today. Today there are travel restrictions, vaccine mandate, everything we did is playing out today. The truth about COVID-19 is that we have to be proactive. We can\u2019t sit back and wait.\u201d\n\nChinedu Eze in Lagos and Udora Orizu in Abuja with agency report",
