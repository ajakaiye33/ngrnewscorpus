I tried to get to the minister, but I couldn\u2019t get her.\n\n\u201cGenerally, assistance from the Federal Government doesn\u2019t get us in Taraba, and even when it does, it comes through some certain proxies. This is an unknown procedure.\n\n\u201cAny help that is coming to Taraba should come through the government. We have established ways of doing things in the state. We have the State Emergency Management Agency and the ministry of Humanitarian Affairs exists in the state.\n\n\u201cI see no reason why the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs cannot liaise with her counterpart ministry in the state in reaching out to the people.\u201d\n\nWhile pledging the state government\u2019s support to the victims of the flood, Ishaku said they would be relocated to other areas to avoid a repeat of the incident.\n\nOur correspondent reports that the flood submerged over 300 houses and washed away farmlands in Lau, Karim Lamido, Jalingo and Ibi local government areas of the state.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Maryam Ahmad further decried the high rate of out of school children in the country which stands at 13.5 million.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cThere are over 13.5 million children in Nigeria who are unable to access free and quality basic education, with the girl child in North Eastern states having a higher percentage of this figure. Crisis, insecurity, cultural and religious dispositions and poor funding have been limiting factors to quality education in these states.\n\n\u201cThe emergence of the novel COVID-19 pandemic has further put a strain on child education. It is a known fact that schools in Nigeria remained closed throughout the COVID-19 lockdown. This situation has increased the number of children especially girls who are unable to access free, compulsory, quality and basic education.\n\n\u201cAgainst this backdrop, LEDAP in conjunction with Malala Fund is raising awareness on the right to free, compulsory and quality basic education in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe project is aimed at providing solution to the low education enrollment and high rate of school drop out for children in Nigeria, and in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic; to mitigate its impact on the education of children in the state by ensuring that the Kano state government takes appropriate action to promote free and quality basic education for all, especially girls.\u201d\n\nShe further called on the ministries of Education and Justice of each state to prioritize right to education of the child in their agenda and to guarantee that no child in the state is denied access to free, basic and quality education.\n\n\u201cThe Government must bring back better by introducing gender responsive measures that will transform education system and address the barriers inhibiting girl child education in the state.\n\n\u201cLEDAP urges the government to commit resources to education through increased budget allocation and funding so as to ensure that no child is denied access to free basic education by any school and to drastically reduce the number of out of school children in Nigeria.\n\n\n\nIf this is done, there would be improved learning infrastructure, deployment and provision of incentives for qualified teachers and a massive enrolment of school children especially girls,\u201d Okoroigwe however stated.",

Adeosun, reportedly narrated the story to a few Government officials at the time.\n\nThe sources affirmed that the former chairman of the Board of African Export\u2013Import Bank (AfreximBank) was not coerced, forced or asked to resign under any guise by anyone.\n\n\u201cIt is not true that she was forced to resign. Or that it was when she was told of a report was what twisted her hands. Mr. Dele Ogun\u2019s account on a recent ARISE TV show is quite misleading if it is read that anyone in the Presidency forced her to leave. What actually happened was that she tendered her resignation after meeting with President Buhari.:\n\nThe sources at the SGF said \u201cthe choice to resign was totally her decision, because she wanted a decent exit that preserved her reputation after being lured into the whole saga by otherwise trusted mentors who then later exposed the whole thing, although she never knew anything beforehand.\u201d\n\nReacting to the claim by Dele Ogun, the brother of Mrs Adeosun that she was told that there was an investigation into the matter, the top NYSC official said that there was indeed an investigation to the matter.\n\n\u201cIf there was no investigation, then why did NYSC issue a statement at the time that she indeed applied for an exemption certificate? It was because an investigation was carried out that we were able to ascertain this fact.\n\n\u201cI think her brother\u2019s claim is misleading and even false because it was not up to the Vice President or his office to make the call. Since when has the Vice President of Nigeria or his office have the powers to ask ministers to resign?, the source quizzed.\n\n\u201cAfter the investigation was done, a report was communicated to the Secretary to the Government of the Federation by NYSC. This report is not a secret, notable federal government officials are aware of this report.\n\n\u201cHer brother accused Premium Times of getting their facts wrong but he is also doing same thing. The facts of this matter are there for all to see and there is no need sugar coating the matter,\u201d the official said.\n\nIt would be recalled that in June 2021, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo launched Mrs Adeosun\u2019s charity organization, DashMe Store, an event by itself indicating that Mr. Ogun\u2019s claims must be closely questioned.",

          "text": "By Obas Esiedesa, Abuja\n\nThe cost of providing security for the smooth operation of the Oil and Gas Industry in Nigeria is driving up production cost per barrel in the country, the Minister of State Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva has said.\n\nSylva who stated this in Abuja on Monday at the 4th annual Valuechain lecture and award, pointed out that for oil production cost per barrel to fall, cost of security has to be lower.\n\nThe Minister, who expressed satisfaction at new measures put in place by Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, NIMASA, to check insecurity in Nigerian waters, said the petroleum industry must work in synergy with NIMASA for coordinated approach to the challenge.\n\nHe said: \u201cI am very happy with the facilities NIMASA have in place to tackle insecurity in the maritime sector because if you want to really talk about reducing the cost of production in the oil and gas sector, you must touch security.\n\n\u201cSecurity is one of the main cost drivers in the industry and that is what we have been discussing. So if they are going to tackle security in the maritime sector they must work with the oil and gas sector for it impact Nigeria\u2019s economy fully.\n\n\u201cThis is because today the oil and gas sector is bedeviled by a lot of security issues which have brought up the cost of production to levels that are too high\u201d, he added.\n\nHe pointed out that with the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB, activities will pick in the industry, noting that for sustainability, the security challenge must be addressed.\n\nChief Sylva who also represented Vice President Yemi Osinbajo said Federal Government has ordered the reduction of Nigerian Port Authority charge and NIMASA fee in the petrol pricing template as measures to lower the cost and impact on Nigerians.\n\nHe said the government was working out ways to ensure that indigenous ship owners are patronized to grow local participation in the maritime sector.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, the Director/CEO, Department of Petroleum Resources, DPR, Engr. Sarki Auwalu in his lead paper, pointed out that for hundreds of years, the maritime and the oil and gas industry have enjoyed Siamese-twin type relationship creating and sharing value together.\n\n\u201cAs an example\u201d, Auwalu explained, \u201cthe maritime industry is responsible for hauling oil and gas all around the world while oil and gas has fueled the maritime industry. Imagine about 700 million barrels of crude cargoes and 22 million tonnes of LNG are transported by over a thousand ocean going vessels from Nigeria to destinations across the globe annually!\n\n\u201cTo put this into context, in 2019, the year before the global COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the value of total foreign trade recorded for Nigeria stood at N36.1 trillion.\n\n\u201cThis was a 14 percent increase over 2018, and the maritime industry was responsible for the transportation and facilitation of 90% of these trades. Meanwhile, of these trades, Petroleum and Petroleum Products account for about 76 percent of the export\u201d, he added.\n\nIn his key note address, the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari said there are over 20,000 ships working for the oil and gas in the Nigeria waters with an annual expenditure of over $600 million in the upstream sector.\n\nRepresented by the COO, Gas and Power, Engr. Yusuf Usman, Kayri added: \u201cThe oil sector spend $3 billion on marine vessels between 2014 and 2018 of which 73% was spent on crude boat, security and power supply intervention.\n\n\u201cThis reflects the huge potential in the sector as we aspire to grow our production to 3 million barrels per day. Without doubt, the potential of the Nigeria blue economy is huge and remain largely untapped for the benefit of the country\u201d.\n\nEarlier in his welcome remark, the Publisher and Editor in Chief of Valuechain Magazine, Musa Bashir Usman noted that the lecture with the theme: \u201cEnhancing Effective Synergy between Oil & Gas and Maritime sectors for a greater value creation,\u201d is very fitting, considering the fact that maritime had always been of strategic importance to the oil and gas industry ever since Nigeria began exporting crude oil.\n\n\u201cThe importance of the two sectors is attested to by the value they add to the Nigerian economy.

          "text": "Olabode Ladipo, the Oyo State Incident Manager and Coordinator of the Emergency Operations Centre, says it is misleading to say COVID-19 Delta variant has killed two persons in the state.\n\nLadipo made the clarification while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Ibadan, following reports that two residents of the state were killed by the deadly virus.\n\n\u201cThat the Delta variant killed two people in the state was not what I said.\n\n\u201cAs part of our surveillance strategy for COVID-19, we took samples from quite a number of people, including some dead persons.\n\n\u201cWe sent the samples to The African Centre of Excellence for the Genomics of Infectious Disease (ACEGID), Redeemer\u2019s University, Ede, Osun State.\n\n\u201cWe then discovered that some of the cases had the Delta variant of the Coronavirus.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that those dead persons were killed by the Delta variant; let us not create unnecessary public panic,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, I made it clear that the sample was taken after death, and so it would be unfair to say they died from complications of the Delta strain.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have much opportunity to assess the client for a long period before death.\n\n\u201cIt could have arisen from a coexisting morbidity which complicated the infection\n\n\u201cAs such, the point is that the variant was isolated from samples taken from the deceased,\u201d Oladipo explained.\n\nHe, therefore, appealed to the state residents to consistently apply all guidelines earlier stipulated by the task force.\n\n\u201cI will be more comfortable, if I see people wearing their masks again; lots of people have abandoned some of these crucial preventive measures.\n\n\u201cThe Delta variant has virtually the same symptoms as the earlier ones: coughs, breathlessness, but with this variant, which is more transmissible, significantly, there is muscular pain and more diarrhoea.\n\n\u201cAlso, yesterday, we admitted two people based on breathlessness.\n\n\u201cIt is not true that the Delta variant doesn\u2019t have symptoms, it does have symptoms,\u201d he said.",

This must be avoided.\n\n\u201cTwo, the National Assembly will further erode its credibility if it decides against a reasonable and popular legislative demand. This will further delegitimise the country\u2019s democracy.\n\n\u201cThree, by specifically disallowing INEC from using electronic means to transmit election results, the National Assembly would be passing a law that hamstrings an institution of the state from carrying out its function to the best possible outcome.\n\n\u201cFour, without electronic transmission of results, a new electoral law would, at best, only introduce cosmetic changes, while essentially helping to perpetuate rigging of elections.\u201d\n\nMoghalu recalled that in an earlier statement, TBAN outlined the benefits of electronic transmission of results.\n\nThese include curbing election rigging and violence, including arsonist attacks on INEC facilities and polling materials.\n\nThe organisation insisted the transmission method is also an important framework for enabling diaspora voting.\n\nTBAN disclosed that its findings confirm the availability of practical and inexpensive technological solutions for e-transmission of results from any polling unit Nigeria.\n\nThe statement said the excuse of impracticality being mentioned in some quarters means the denial of reality.\n\nTBAN told the National Assembly to pass the new electoral bill allowing electronic transmission of results, adding that INEC needs time to operationalise the provisions of a new Electoral Act ahead of the 2023 general election.",

          "text": "By Collins Nweze\n\nConvener of \u201cMoghalu4Nigeria Movement (M4N) Prof. Kingsley Moghalu has proffered solutions to Nigeria\u2019s rising debt profile. The debt stood at $32.85 billion as at March 2021.\n\nThe way out, he said, was for the Federal Government to embrace Public Private Partnership (PPP) and focus on increasing domestic revenue by expanding the tax base.\n\nMoghalu, a one-time former deputy governor (Financial System Stability) at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), kicked against raising tax rates as the government did with the Value Added Tax (VAT).\n\nRather, he suggested the introduction of reforms for ease of paying taxes and abolishing multiple taxation.\n\nTaxation, Moghalu insists, requires the government to maintain a social contract with the people, including restoring security to enable citizens can go about their businesses.\n\nHe disclosed that Nigeria\u2019s public debt profile rises by over N3.6 trillion annually, making it difficult for the government to deliver economic growth.\n\nHe said that the massive borrowing, and the infrastructure investment that has been used to justify it, have grossly under-performed.\n\nMoghalu urged the government to quickly halt the borrowing binge, which is exposing the country to possible future debt slavery.\n\nThe former CBN chief said the advice became necessary considering the fact that Nigeria\u2019s external debt of $10.31 in 2015 had doubled six years after.\n\nHe spoke of the possibility of a rising debt portfolio by 2023 when President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s two-term tenure of eight years will end.\n\nMoghalu said the debt profile was not only unprecedented but unsustainable and alarming.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis borrowing binge represents a 218 per cent increase. The total outstanding public debt stock increased by 173 percent in the same period, from N12.11 trillion to N33.10 trillion.\u201d\n\nHe described as unfortunate that the economy, instead of delivering economic growth, had been in recession twice, and when out of it, growth had recorded at best two per cent.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAnd rather than the debt-funded infrastructure projects creating ample number of jobs for the citizens, the national unemployment rate has increased to 33.1 per cent while youth unemployment has reached 42.5 percent\u201d, he said.\n\nInsisting on PPP as the dominant approach to infrastructure development, the erstwhile CBN official kicked against contract awards.\n\nRelying on information from comparable projects in Ghana and Ethiopia, among others, he said projects are at best overvalued and grossly inflated.\n\nBut due to the incompetence of the government in the last six years, he said, businesses have been groaning and FDI inflows have decreased.\n\nOver the past months, debt service cost has taken up more than 90 per cent of government revenue.\n\nHe explained that for every one naira generated in public revenue, more than 90 kobo is used to pay the interest on government\u2019s loans.\n\nMoghalu said: \u201dIt is debilitating that Nigeria is spending so much money that should go to development toward merely servicing the interest on our debt, not repaying the debt. It also makes justifications based on our debt to GDP ratio off-point.\n\n\u201dThe Government of Nigeria is mortgaging the future of our country\u2019s youth. We have to stop further borrowing and start to manage the current obligations in order to avoid a sovereign debt default or, at best, a costly restructuring,\u201d he said.\n\nFurther borrowing, Moghalu advised, would lead to a disastrous debt bubble bust.\n\nHe recounted how he promised to introduce a forensic audit of the budgets if elected, as part of a broader reform initiative for transparency and accountability in public finance.\n\n\u201cThis remains very important for ensuring value for money and to support public revenue growth by restoring investor confidence in the economy,\u201d he emphasises.\n\nHe concluded that to realise a positive long-term public revenue outlook, the economy must be successfully diversified through value-added exports.",

          "text": "By Adekunle Jimoh, Ilorin\n\nThe Department of State Security Service (DSS) has tendered not less than 40 items as exhibits at Ilorin High Court against suspected rapists and killers of a 300-level student of the University of Ilorin\n\n(UNILORIN) Olajide Blessing Omowumi.\n\nAt the resumed hearing of the case, an operative of the DSS Igwe Imo tendered a wooden toy gun as one of the\n\nitems allegedly used by the suspects to commit the crimes.\n\nThe suspects: Abdulazeez Ismail, Ajala Moses Oluwatimileyin (aka Jacklord); Oyeyemi Timileyin Omogbolahan; Abdulkarim Shuaib (aka Easy); Kareem Oshioyemi Rasheed (Rashworld); Abdullateef Abdulrahman, Daud Bashir Adebayo (aka Bashman) and Akande Taiye Oladoja were brought to court for alleged rape, murder and armed robbery.\n\nThe first three suspects are standing trial for alleged rape and murder of the 24-year-old student in their Tanke, Ilorin residence early last month.\n\nOther items tendered as exhibits included one blue Samsung phone with IMEI 352031/496383/6, one black Lenovo phone, one golden Nokia phone with model number TA-1053, one motherboard, one blue itel phone, one black HP 15 laptop with model number 15-r002se, one black hp pro book 45ogi with serial number 2CE3481LIP, and two other laptops, as well as two hard drive (500gb).\n\nThe security service also presented three witnesses, including a girlfriend of the eighth accused, Zainab Olaiya.\n\nThe witness told the court that Akande Taiye called her with a phone number suspected to be that of the late Blessing Olajide.\n\nShe was tracked and invited by the DSS and this later led to the arrest of the accused person through her.\n\nAnother witness, a policeman, Adewale Adesola, while being led in evidence, described the sixth accused person as a neighbour he had known for the past 15 years.\n\nHe said the accused person gave him the stolen phone for safe keep.\n\nHowever, the police officer said he kept the phone with him between June 10th and 12th, 2021 but was yet to institute an investigation on the item when he was invited by the DSS.\n\nHe told the court that he queried the accused about the source of the phone which he suspected to be a stolen item.\n\nThe presiding judge, Justice Ibrahim Yusuf also came down hard on counsel to the seventh accused Sikiru Solagberu for reportedly disrespecting the court.\n\nJustice Yusuf had last Wednesday ordered the arrest of Mr. Solagberu by security agents for allegedly exhibiting conduct unbecoming of a lawyer after court proceedings by making uncomplimentary remarks in some television stations and social media platforms.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe judge equally expressed displeasure over the lawyer\u2019s decision to communicate his withdrawal from the case through a letter delivered by his secretary to the court.\n\nHe, however, accepted Solagberu\u2019s apology through his counsel, Kehinde Eleja (SAN) and discharged him accordingly.\n\nHe adjourned the case till Tuesday, June 13, 2021, for the continuation of the hearing.",

          "title": "Keeping Nigeria together and media\u2019s dilemma",
          "text": "By Fredrick Nwabufo\n\nSir: Nigeria\u2019s constitution delineates the place of the media in the country. Section 22, chapter 2 of the canon says: \u2018\u2019The press, radio, television and other agencies of the mass media shall at all times be free to uphold the fundamental objectives contained in this chapter and uphold the responsibility and accountability of the government to the people.\u2019\u2019\n\nAlso, section 24 says: \u2018\u2019It shall be the duty of every citizen to \u2013 (a) abide by this constitution, respect its ideals and its institutions, the national flag, the national anthem, the national pledge, and legitimate authorities; (b) help to enhance the power, prestige and good name of Nigeria, defend Nigeria\u2026\u2019\u2019\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt is clear here that as media practitioners and citizens our duty is to the country and its people \u2013 \u2018\u2019holding the government to account and enhancing the power, prestige and good name of Nigeria\u2019\u2019.\n\nService to Nigeria is not a favour or obeisance to the government. Government will come and go, but Nigeria remains. Service to Nigeria is a duty to its people. Love for country is not lust for government, and loyalty to country is not servitude to government. Are we really doing our bounden duty as citizens and as seekers and keepers of the truth?\n\nI shudder when I hear the statements of some political leaders and self-canonised activists \u2013 utterances belched from the bowels of prejudice and malice. But I am distressed when I find these blighted comments, which are capable of inciting violence, on the front pages or top corners of news publications. Everyone deserves to be heard, but can we modulate the outcome and concomitants of a potentially combustible statement? Is not judicious to control it from the source?\n\nI recall the statements of Sunday Igboho which set off attacks on the Fulani in Igangan, Oyo state. These statements were given prominence in the media and Igboho was reported as an \u2018\u2019activist and youth leader\u2019\u2019 by a section of the media, ignoring his antecedents, and the precedent of his actions.\n\nI understand the argument that the comments would have rippled on social media, regardless of whether it was published by the popular media. But the media as an agency of truth adds legitimacy to whatever is said. By reporting \u2018\u2019hate speech\u2019\u2019, the media cannot insulate itself from the collateral impact of bigotry.\n\nIn all, we cannot have a peaceful and secure country if we are remiss in our responsibility as gatekeepers. That Nigeria is still a going venture is largely because of the commitment of the media to the country\u2019s unity.\n\nWe need to bond our voices as professionals for a united and progressive country. The military force cannot defeat insecurity without the \u2018\u2019national force\u2019\u2019 \u2013 which comprises the civil population. As Barack Obama said: \u201cWe cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we have set. We have got to have civilian national security force that is just as powerful, just as strong.\u2019\u2019 Nigeria\u2019s unity is under threat as well its peace. It is the responsibility of every citizen to defend it.\n\nAt this tempestuous moment, citizens need to rise up and pull our nose-diving country from a plunge to certain death. With great power, comes great responsibility.",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nAfenifere, pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, has raised the alarm that Nigeria is at the brink of an avoidable catastrophe that requires urgent actions.\n\nIt called for immediate passing of state policing Act to save Nigeria from imminent apostrophe, insisting that governors would become true chief security officers only when they have a security outfit that takes orders from them.\n\nThe group made the calls in a communique after an emergency executive meeting at the residence of its leader, Pa Ayo Adebanjo.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of the body, Jare Ajayi, in a statement in Ibadan yesterday, stated that the most potent recipe to prevent the catastrophe is restructuring that would return the country to true federalism.\n\nAt the meeting, Afenifere reviewed recent developments in the country and concluded that \u201cthe signs are ominous, requiring steps to prevent the country from apocalypse.\u201d\n\nIt indicated that the meeting endorsed the recent resolutions of the governors of southern Nigeria with regards to placing a total ban on open grazing and having state police.\n\n\u201cAfenifere is in full support of the governors to have laws banning open grazing latest by September 1, this year. We notice that some states already have this law enacted. We urge the remaining states to enact the law expeditiously. Beyond the enactment, however, we call for immediate enforcement of the law so as to put an end to various vices that the act of open grazing is engendering.\u201d\n\nIt frowned at the disapproval being expressed by some northern elements to the position of southern governors, prompting it to ask the questions: \u201cOf what intrinsic benefits has open grazing been in the recent past going by various studies that have been done?\n\n\u201cIt is on record, for instance, that open grazing is one of the major causes of desertification that is occurring in the northern part of the country. It is also on record that cows reared in a ranch are far more productive, healthier and are less tasking for the rearer compared to the ones being driven from one place to another in search of food and water. And certainly, those in ranches constitute less risk to neighbouring communities compared to the ones migrating from one place to another.\u201d\n\nAfenifere maintained that the seeming intractable security challenges were due largely to the restraint put in the way of state governors.\n\n\u201cThe governors are described as chief security officers of their respective states, yet they have no security agency that can be deployed to where crimes are being committed with arms; a security agency that can arrest, investigate and prosecute. Those of them who came up with some security apparatus like Amotekun are disempowered because they could not bear arms. And when they arrest suspected criminals, such suspects must be handed over to the police.\n\n\u201cAs experiences have shown, once this is done, hardly do such cases go beyond the police.

If we allow the opposition to have their way, it means that before the election in 2023, we have conceded defeat.\n\n\u201cFor party interest, we are mobilised to ensure that the clauses of electronic voting and transmission of results are defeated \u2013 at least, for now.\n\n\u201cThe draft bill will be tabled on Tuesday and the debate clause-by-clause will commence on Wednesday up to Thursday; thereafter, we proceed on Sallah break.\u201d\n\nBut those opposed to the removal of the clauses are also preparing a counter move.\n\nA source from the opposition political parties told THISDAY that there would be no voice votes when a serious decision on the clauses is to be taken.\n\n\u201cWe have provisions in the Senate rules for voice votes as well as dividing the Senate for the purpose of taking crucial debates.\n\n\u201cUnder the circumstances, we shall call for division because it is in our rules, or we take electronic voting; they are all in our rules. But the voice votes may not be allowed to prevail in issues like this,\u201d the senator said.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Consultative Front (NcFront) has called on stakeholders across party lines, civil society groups, labour unions, youths and women groups to unite against the thickening plot and conspiracy against the amendment bill.\n\nIn a statement by the spokesman of the National Consultative Forum, Dr. Tanko Yunusa, the group said the plot against the electoral reforms draft was by a few politicians in power, who wanted to circumvent and supplant the popular will and yearnings of Nigerians for an improved electoral system.\n\nHe stated that the group has commenced a nationwide mobilisation of concerned leaders and stakeholders, including former and intending presidential candidates, party and political leaders, labour and civil society activists, among others, to meet and demand acceptable amendments to the Electoral Act, with the aim of improving Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nNCfront said it was reaching out and rallying stakeholders, eminent Nigerians, including religious leaders, leaders of youths, women and vulnerable persons\u2019 groups behind stopping the national emergency threatening the future of Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nThe group urged all concerned Nigerians and political stakeholders, irrespective of divide and affinity, to come together to demand a formidable, inclusive, improved and sustainable electoral law that can build the trust and confidence of Nigerians in the electoral system on future elections, starting from the 2023 election cycle.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Freedom of expression is not absolute and that is made abundantly clear in the constitution itself.\n\n\u201cIf you go to section 45 of your constitution, it tells you how the government is allowed to limit that freedom for the sake of health and security and this is written in black and white.\n\n\u201cWhilst I will not allow gagging of the press, I worry when at every time when the national assembly tries to promulgate a law with the best of intention, everybody descends on the national assembly.

          "title": "How Charlotte Bwana leads partnerships at Audiomack",
          "text": "In this week\u2019s edition of Centre Stage, I bring you my conversation with Charlotte Bwana\u2013 a Kenyan native who moved to Nigeria to lead Audiomack\u2019s expansion into Africa. Charlotte can be best described as a gentle soul with a fierce personality and a genuine love for Africa\u2019s music and entertainment industry.\n\nI\u2019m bringing Charlotte to Centre Stage because she has made valuable contributions to Africa\u2019s highly-acclaimed music industry. At Audiomack Africa, Charlotte leads business development and media partnerships and is responsible for connecting creators, listeners, and brands to each other.\n\nLast month, Charlotte announced her membership in the Recording Academy Member Class of 2021.\n\nLet\u2019s dive in.\n\n\u201cBusiness development is not sales.\u201d\n\nIn your own words, what exactly is business development?\n\nBusiness development is not sales.\n\nIn my role, business development means identifying and developing growth opportunities that will benefit Audiomack internally and forge mutually beneficial partnerships with external parties. I come up with ideas we can implement as a business and also figure out how these ideas can benefit Audiomack and the other parties involved.\n\nWhy does business development matter in Africa\u2019s music industry?\n\nRemember that business development is about building value-adding relationships, and the entertainment industry is very people-oriented.\n\nAudiomack is in the media industry, but we are also in the entertainment industry. This means we deal with three groups of people: creators (music artists), listeners (fans), and partners (brands). Therefore to grow as a business, we must build relationships with these groups of people.\n\nBusiness development matters because it is the only way to find growth opportunities and successfully market Audiomack\u2019s creators to our listeners and prospective partner brands.\n\nWhat three professional qualities does every business development leader need on the job?\n\nCommunication skills for sure! Why? Because you are talking to different people every single day. You have to speak with your team\u2013 the team that helps you get the job done \u2014 to ensure everyone is aligned. You have to relate with external parties, such as your partners and creators. You have to develop persuasive and conversational speaking skills so you can close deals and effectively communicate timelines and deadlines.\n\nYou need business intelligence skills. Do you have insights into the market you are in? Have you figured out how to access your target audience? Have you done thorough research about your competitors? The market changes constantly; what exists today may not be around tomorrow. So it\u2019s essential to always stay plugged into your market.\n\nThe last quality is project management. Business development leaders must be exceptional project managers. You have to learn how to delegate and make sure every project has a start and end date. It\u2019s also crucial to evaluate the performance of every finished project: What was the outcome? What was the return on investment (ROI)? What did we do right? What lessons can we learn from the hiccups we experienced while we ran that project?\n\nWhat effective business development tactics can you share with us?\n\nI only have one tactic to share \u2013 I hope that\u2019s okay.\n\nBefore you walk into a room to meet with a person or an organization, take interest. Take an interest in that person, do your research and look interested in whatever that business is doing in their playing field. Before approaching a prospective brand or creator, I research their values, mission, vision, and goals. Then, I walk into every meeting prepared to listen and to be heard.\n\nSo, that\u2019s the hack?\n\nThat\u2019s the hack. Be interested.\n\nWearing two hats at the same time.\n\nYou also handle media partnerships at Audiomack. How are you able to balance both roles?\n\nCoffee! A lot of coffee. I am an expert delegator. You have a team for a reason \u2013 you cannot do it all. Once you do your part, find another team member who can handle a different moving part.\n\nI have also learned the art of saying \u201cno\u201d when I have many deliverables on my table. Honestly, there isn\u2019t a big difference between both roles. Still, I also know how to differentiate between how I function as a business development lead and a media partnership manager.\n\nWhat goes into developing a successful media partnership?\n\nI\u2019ll share two things:\n\nKnow your partner\u2019s target audience and ensure that their goals align with your business objectives. When there is alignment between both parties, a successful partnership will form quickly.\n\nEstablish what you need from that partnership. Clearly communicate growth opportunities, benefits, what you need from your partner and what you are bringing to the table.\n\nHow do you grow in your role? What do you listen to, watch or read?\n\nI listen to a lot of music, specifically different music genres coming out of Africa.\n\nEvery morning, I read business articles from local and global publications. For example, I read CNN Business, Bloomberg Businessweek, and Business Insider. In addition, I try to dedicate at least an hour and a half to discover events taking place in global business hubs.\n\nWhat do you enjoy the most about your role?\n\nMeeting new people. It\u2019s always fun and exciting to meet people from different walks of life and work in exciting industries. I also get to travel a lot more and see other parts of the world through colourful lenses.\n\nI enjoy coming up with culture-shifting ideas at Audiomack. So when we made the MTN partnership happen, I was really excited that a Telco was coming onboard to make streaming music more accessible and affordable.\n\nI love that I can tell African stories from an African perspective. At Audiomack, we give creators the freedom to toot their horns through the music they create and share on our platform. We make music about our food, clothes, communities, and daily lives.\n\n\u201cAmapiano and brunch?\u201d\n\nTell us some of your favourite social media accounts.\n\nI barely spend time on social media because I get a little lost in my work. But I love Instagram because I enjoy consuming aesthetically pleasing pictures.\n\nTwitter is also my jam. You can tweet something, and someone in America or Antigua will see and find it reliable. Sometimes you find comfort in strangers online or share wild stories with your followers, and it\u2019s totally chilled. Twitter has made the world a global village, and I enjoy using it a lot.\n\nWould you instead go to a day brunch in Ghana or a Grammy listening party in L.A?\n\nPlease, my passport is ready, and Rihanna is waiting for me! I love Ghana, but Rihanna is waiting for me.\n\nWhat does being a part of the Recording Academy 2021 class mean to you?\n\nWow. This is the first time someone has asked me what the invitation means to me.\n\nFirst of all, it reflects how much work I have put into Africa\u2019s entertainment industry. Second, it\u2019s a reflection of my dedication to showcasing Africa\u2019s diverse music scene.\n\nIt also means that I get the opportunity to be a thought leader in my community and celebrate African music on a larger platform. The Grammys is the helm of music; being a member of the Recording Academy is a win for music on the continent.\n\nWhat excites you about the future of music and dance in Africa?\n\nThe entire world is on the dance floor right now, listening to African music.\n\nWhat excites me is that a generation of young people is growing up with African music as the soundtrack of their childhood.\n\nFriends, there is a lot of work to be done, but we are doing so much better.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Telecom operators are trapped in Africa\u2019s internet shutdowns: Can they fight back?",
          "text": "Eswatini ended its internet shutdown last Thursday, going by a statement from the local MTN subsidiary. Access to all social media and online platforms had been restricted in the country from June 29.\n\n\u201cAfter carefully assessing the directive, and in line with its licence conditions and the Group\u2019s digital human rights due diligence framework, MTN Eswatini implemented the directive,\u201d MTN Group said, confirming that it received an order from the Communications Commission to suspend access to internet services.\n\nThe internet ban came as the small southern African kingdom grappled with violent protests demanding the abolishment of a monarchy that has lasted more than three decades. The ban wasn\u2019t unprecedented in Africa and is typical of how the continent\u2019s authoritarians react in the face of calls for regime change.\n\nOver the past few years, several African countries have imposed some form of internet blockade or total blackout, despite the substantial economic losses they cause. But the costs go beyond just financial, given that internet shutdowns in the region are mostly imposed during protests and elections. During such blackouts, there\u2019s a high tendency that several lives will be lost, people substantially injured, and ballot boxes stolen.\n\nComplicity in compliance?\n\nThe main protagonists of internet bans in Africa are African heads of government. However, telecoms companies have also come under increased scrutiny over blackouts because they implement the orders.\n\nBeing Africa\u2019s largest mobile network provider operating in more than a third of countries on the continent, MTN has had a hand in many internet restrictions and equally faced legal battles that they have attracted.\n\nAlong with other operators, the company was taken to court in Sudan two years ago over its decision to comply with the transitional military government\u2019s orders to shut down the internet. They were accused of contributing to the ensuing human rights violations. In the most recent ban in Eswatini, MTN was one of several respondents in a court application seeking to reinstate internet services in the country.\n\nThuli Makama of the Institute for Democracy and Leadership (Ideal), the NGO that filed the lawsuit with various youth organisations in Eswatini, argued that by following the government\u2019s instructions to restrict internet access, the MTN Group was \u201ccomplicit\u201d in the political crisis sweeping across the kingdom.\n\nMakama\u2019s belief is that all parties \u2013 including telecoms companies \u2013 that take part in internet shutdowns are, directly or not, contributors to human rights violations. If governments are the protagonists, then telecom firms are supporting characters.\n\nCan the industry push back?\n\nNetwork operators in Africa have been severally called on to challenge internet restriction orders instead of simply implementing government directives as they come.\n\nA research paper from the University of Pretoria identifies the private sector, particularly internet service providers, as \u201cimportant actors\u201d in curbing the common ploy by African governments.\n\nOne of the many ways telecom companies have been advised to push back against such orders is to challenge their legality in courts. But starting such a fight against African leaders, most of whom have authoritarian tendencies, may be a \u201cwaste of time\u201d and \u201cpolitical suicide\u201d for the businesses, argues Michael Ohens, an independent digital policy expert.\n\n\u201cIdeally, they should be able to challenge the directives from African governments. Anyone can challenge anything, including government orders,\u201d he told TechCabal in a phone interview.\n\n\u201cBut the structure of every democratic constitution and the powers it confers on the executive presupposes a disposition towards the rule of law and protection of the unity of the nation, however subjective that may be.\u201d\n\nSuch provisions can be considered \u201cconstitutional loopholes or blindsides\u201d that a government can exploit, he explained. This means that the president can issue a directive to ban the internet if it is perceived as a threat to national security, whether it is true or not.\n\nOn the same grounds, the government can withdraw the licence of any telecoms operator that fails to comply with the directive. Moreover, no other reason can be good enough to overturn national security concerns in court.\n\n\u201cCourts are subject to laws and not necessarily justice hence it might be difficult to challenge a directive like this in court and win,\u201d Ohens said. \u201cSo challenging internet ban directives would be a waste of time and political suicide for telecoms businesses. The operators know this and won\u2019t try it, especially in an African nation. It\u2019s not a sound business decision.\u201d\n\nIf telecom companies can\u2019t challenge governments, who can?\n\nLegal and political organisations have not been effective at preventing internet bans in Africa nor held the main protagonists responsible to account so far.\n\nOn a few occasions, courts have played an important role in providing redress \u2013 as in the case of Zimbabwe, Sudan, and Togo. In these instances, civil society organisations like AccessNow were the main parties challenging the governments legally.\n\nAccording to Ohens, civil rights activists are better placed to push against internet bans on the grounds of human rights violations compared to network operators. This is because the latter does not have a \u201cbusiness argument\u201d against internet bans nor do the shutdowns pose a significant threat to their businesses.\n\nWhile internet shutdowns inconvenience users and are costly for small businesses that heavily rely on digital channels in their operations, they do not significantly affect telecoms firms that help impose them. Although there\u2019s a financial loss from potential data subscriptions if people could access the internet, the bulk of revenue generated by network operators comes from telephony/call services.\n\nIn Nigeria for instance, there were around 188 million mobile or SIM connections as of January. Less than two-thirds (104 million) of the regular mobile service users were internet users, per data from DataReportal.\n\n\u201cDuring internet blocks, people tend to revert to regular calls and other alternatives to data services, which means the telcos still make money,\u201d Ohens said. \u201cSo they don\u2019t actually have a business argument or concern and it is clear that the internet ban doesn\u2019t necessarily pose a notable threat to revenues. And even if it affects them in some way, nothing can be good enough to overturn national security concerns legally.\u201d\n\nMTN\u2019s statement citing \u201clicense conditions\u201d shows that telecoms companies \u2013 helpless and trapped in a battle between the state and its people \u2013 can do little against government directives ordering internet shutdown.\n\nHowever, what network operators can do is be transparent and ready to share information during incidents of internet blackouts, Ohens notes.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until MTN Eswatini was taken to court that the South African Group released a statement to confirm the government\u2019s directive to block internet access. That doesn\u2019t help you,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing open and transparent from the outset helps with credibility when faced with accusations of complicity.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "JULY 11, 2021\n\nThis newsletter is a weekly in-depth analysis of tech and innovation in Africa that will serve as a post-pandemic guide. Subscribe here to get it directly in your inbox every Sunday at 3 pm WAT. Hello, Let\u2019s talk about failure. In particular, fintech startup failures in Africa.\n\nThe subject of failures in Africa is often avoided maybe because it raises a sense of shame and disappointment. Failing at an endeavor after much effort can mean members of a founding team starting from scratch. Nobody likes that feeling (directly or otherwise from family or peers) that one\u2019s life has been a catastrophe or a waste of time at least.\n\nAs a recent report shows, more than one hundred fintech startups have failed in Africa in the last half decade. So does that mean a lot of African entrepreneurs have wasted productive years only to end up building nothing? On the contrary, we gain a lot by constructively documenting fintech failures in Africa. PARTNER MESSAGE\n\nThe Flutterwave Mobile app, the app that turns any smartphone into a mobile POS is now redefining commerce. The Flutterwave Mobile App makes it super convenient for anyone to take their business with them anywhere, anytime. Learn how you can take your business anywhere, anytime here. Now, let\u2019s dive into the story. Fail forward The number of fintech startups in Africa has increased by nearly 90% between 2017 and 2021. That is according to Disrupt Africa\u2019s \u2018Finnovating for Africa\u2019 report on the state of fintech in Africa. Inspired by early movers like Andela and Paystack between 2014 and 2016, a generation of software developers, MBA types, former consultants and barely-twenty-year-olds who quit University has jumped into fintech-preneurship. And so the number of fintech startups in Africa has increased from 301 in 2017 to 491 in 2019 and 576 in 2021 (so far). You will find at least one fintech startup in 25 out of Africa\u2019s 54 countries. South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya (in that order) are the origin countries of 67.9% of fintechs on the continent, which is less than the 74.4% share they had in 2017, per Disrupt Africa. Olanrewaju Odunowo/TC Insights The emergence of two fintech unicorns, Flutterwave and Chipper, this year paint the clearest picture yet of fintech\u2019s maturity and attraction in Africa. OPay, Paga and TeamApt are talking up their billion-dollar potentials too. But this fuzzy-rosy narrative should always be moderated by sober reflection. Because as many African fintechs rise, many also fall. One in five failures Out of the 301 fintech startups recorded in 2017, 72 had shut down by 2019. Out of the 491 startups recorded in 2019, 109 have closed as of today. What does that mean? It appears that at least 20% of the total fintech startups in Africa in a given year will close in two years. We need a longer list of startups over a longer period to make definitive predictions but keep this in mind for now. 59.6% of fintech startup closures between 2019 and 2021 happened in South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria. 40.3% of those startups were in either payments, remittances, lending or financing. According to the report\u2019s authors, the fintech startup shutdown rate (so far) can be blamed on \u201cunsustainable levels of competition in some sectors and geographies.\u201d Many startups crop up to pursue similar ideas and products. Some achieve traction, while others fall along the way. Of course that\u2019s not the whole story. Competition is a good thing. Startups that faded due to competition were not very effective in satisfying customer demand. In reality, sometimes fintech startups \u2013 like other businesses or organizations \u2013 fail because the founders make foundational mistakes. Like Abdulhamid Hassan (pictured at the top of this newsletter).\n\nWhen he founded OyaPay \u2013 a service for offline businesses to accept payment with or without a smartphone \u2013 in 2018, the startup was hailed a fintech startup to watch. But Hassan took seed money from an uncle who would not tolerate being diluted in a subsequent funding round. The result? Frustration and shutdown. But even founders who are able to raise money several times may not know what to do with the money. As reported by Quartz last week, we now know that the Angolan, Nigerian and Ghanaian founders behind KuBitX \u2013 a crypto exchange that packed up this year \u2013 were high on motivation but rather low on technical knowledge and administrative capacity. The end result? $1 million in VC money gone. Failures as seeds We are not deep-diving into these failures here. The point really is that it is necessary to see these public accounts, from the founders but also through investigative sources. One of KuBitX\u2019s founders admits to making \u201cearly-stage terrible mistakes.\u201d It could serve him well next time he joins or forms a startup. Hassan spent some time at Paystack as a product manager after OyaPay\u2019s demise, but has gone on to found Mono, a Y Combinator-backed fintech startup driving an open banking ecosystem in Nigeria. Where OyaPay lasted barely 365 days, Mono is being talked about as another Paystack. It\u2019ll be good to seek out those 181 startups that have failed in the past four years. Some of those founders and former employees have probably left fintech altogether for other causes. Maybe they\u2019ve left the uncertainty in Africa for more security in the US and Europe. But surely some have gone on to seed success in today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s African fintech unicorns. How do we get them to add nutrients from their failure stories to the ecosystem\u2019s startup soil? FROM THE CABAL Big bank brain drain Guaranty Trust Bank, one of Nigeria\u2019s biggest, has had issues. At the beginning of this year, many customers complained about not being able to complete transactions on the bank\u2019s USSD and mobile app channels. It recurred too often to be random or a temporary blip. So Daniel Adeyemi went a-digging. What he documents \u2013 overworked staff, mass exits, delayed promotions \u2013 is well worth your five minutes. Why did Peter Njonjo start Twiga in Kenya? In this exclusive interview, Edwin Madu sits with the Kenyan founder and has all you need to know We heard the bank accounts of Multichoice, the South African pay tv company, had been blocked in Nigeria.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

Step outside the ecstatic rush of those bomb ideas and plans running through your mind, and ask yourself, genuinely, \u201cwhat value am I looking to offer with this product?\u201d\n\nIn other words, why should anyone even care about your offering? I\u2019d even take it a notch higher and say if you weren\u2019t you, how will your product make a difference in your life? Faster delivery, better aesthetics to an already existing offering, fresher food?\n\nWhatever you\u2019re selling, recognising the value you\u2019re offering is so important because if your product/service doesn\u2019t seem worth a high degree of effort and earnestness to you, then you won\u2019t present it in a valuable light to the public eye.\n\n2. Make it easy for people to find you (Search Engine Optimisation)\n\nMost social media platforms have a bio space when opening your business page where you have a limited word character count to talk about your offerings. You can do this by using keywords. This can\u2019t be overstressed.\n\nInstead of merely writing \u201cfood and clothes services\u201d, Use specific terms that accurately capture the uniqueness of your brand. Doing this is key to your business popping up among the first results Google displays when people search for the service you offer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Identify the people who need you\n\nNow that you\u2019ve identified the value you\u2019re offering, the next thing to do is find your people, the ones who will be willing to pay for the value you\u2019re offering.\n\nIf, as a business owner, you sell clothes and your primary target audience are pregnant women, you are probably best suited looking for them on Facebook, where there are several Moms\u2019 Pages for mothers and intending mothers.\n\nDon\u2019t just sit there. With your business name, go into these groups, answer questions, build relevance, ask intending mothers what they wish they had in comfortable clothing, interact with them, know their needs. Be genuinely interested in building relationships. Many times, the primary factor in online sales via social media is relationships; sales follow.\n\nThen introduce your product, let them know why your offering fits their needs, and remember we talked about how word-of-mouth boosts sales last week? One satisfied customer will spread the word, and that might just be the spark that sets off your forest fire.\n\nThis quote by Barbara Findlay perfectly captures the point:\n\n\u201cNo matter what goal you\u2019re reaching for, don\u2019t make sales your primary aim online. Selling repels people rather than attracts them to your business, especially on social media sites.\u201d\n\nWhat an irony! If you\u2019re looking to stay in the game for the long haul, then relationships will go a long way in deepening your reach in the long run. You can engage in and contribute to conversations happening in your field using a tool like Social Mentions.\n\n4. Ensure your content is engaging\n\nNow you\u2019ve ascertained value, you\u2019re building beneficial relationships, and your user base is steadily increasing, but it doesn\u2019t end there. You have to maintain relevance, and an excellent way to do this is to post visually engaging and relevant content.\n\nYou can go about this by posting snippets of informative content using tools like Canva or opening a blog on platforms like Medium. In the grand scheme of things, please ensure that all content stresses the importance and uniqueness of your offerings.\n\n5. Leverage online sites\n\nSeveral transactional and classified eCommerce platforms have an option for merchants to sign-up and post their products/services with their brand name.\n\nThis is one way to leverage already established online platforms to reach your unique customer base. Whether you\u2019re starting with the famous Jumia.ng or Scrader.com, you can make your offerings known to the public, easily reach more customers, and measure online growth.\n\nAnother thing to note is that given the somewhat crowded nature of these platforms, much strategic marketing is still needed.\n\nIf these all feel a tad overwhelming, then it\u2019s understandable. Interconnectedness and business growth are having a field day in this day and age. Your brand has a share in the pie too, but only in strategically applying the right tools can you fully tap into the cream of this crop.\n\nThat\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t miss the upcoming SME Clinic 2021, where you\u2019d get first hand proven strategies from seasoned experts to grow your business online.\n\nJoin us at SME Clinic 2021 to learn more about how to market and grow your business online.\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Early Bird Offer!

          "text": "Nigerian healthtech startup, CribMD has announced its acquisition of Charisland Pharmaceuticals Group to ensure fast and efficient one-hour drug deliveries to its patients across Nigeria.\n\nThe acquisition comes on the heels of CribMD\u2019s $2.6 million seed round in May 2021, which the startup says was oversubscribed. According to CribMD\u2019s CEO, Ifeanyi Ossai, users would not need to wait two days for the delivery of their medications. Now, it can be sent to their homes, offices, or hotels in as little as one hour.\n\nCharisland Pharmaceuticals Group was founded nine years ago and has a presence in major Nigerian cities. With the Group\u2019s decision to exit the Nigerian market and expand into Canada, CribMD\u2019s acquisition of the pharmaceutical chain, as opposed to building a solution in-house, will see it leverage the company\u2019s vast network of pharmacies to deliver drugs faster to their subscribers.\n\nAs part of the sale, the startup would be assimilating Charisland Pharmaceuticals Group\u2019s staff and hiring more to build out its operations.\n\nBefore the acquisition, CribMD dispensed drugs from pharmacies that they own. However, with the acquisition of Charisland, the startup is set to bank on the group\u2019s wide network of pharmacies to serve subscribers.\n\nSpeaking on the choice of Charisland Pharmaceuticals Group, Ossai reveals that the group\u2019s commitment to excellence was a decisive factor. \u201cThey are a well-respected brand in the country and have served the communities where they operate with excellence, and we are glad to pick up the next part of the race,\u201d he says.\n\nFounded in June 2020 by Ossai, Ngiri Michael, and Lorna Mae Johnson, CribMD allows patients \u2014 with a subscription plan ranging between $7 and $50 monthly \u2014 to request doctors for house calls or consultation via telemedicine.\n\nWith a presence in every Nigerian state, CribMD also offers insurance services for individuals and corporations.\n\nFollowing its $2.6 million seed raise earlier in the year, Ossai confirms to Techpoint Africa that this is the first in a series of acquisitions that the company plans to make.\n\n\u201cFast expansion and acquisitions are part of what we\u2019re using our funding to do in order to drive value for subscribers and stakeholders,\u201d Ossai explains. The World Health Organization\u2019s recommended doctor to patient ratio is 1:600, and Nigeria is a long way off at 1:2,753. With the government struggling to make up this deficit, healthtech startups have sprung up to solve the problem, and CribMD is one such solution.\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nCBN\u2019s new regulations for Mobile Money services in Nigeria\n\nFlutterwave misses out on tax relief\n\nNigeria\u2019s young population and tech\n\nCBN releases new regulations for Mobile Money services in Nigeria\n\nOn Friday, July 9, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s banking regulator, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), released the new Framework and Guidelines on Mobile Money Services in Nigeria(PDF) as part of its financial inclusion strategy for the unbanked.\n\nWhat\u2019s the gist? The last time CBN updated these regulations was in 2015, and while they do not differ significantly from the old ones, there are some new introductions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClosely resembling regulations for Payment Service Banks (PSBs), Mobile Money Operators (MMOs) are not allowed to grant any form of loans, advances and guarantees (directly or indirectly) or accept foreign currency deposits\n\nThey can\u2019t deal in the foreign exchange market \u2014 except to sell foreign currencies realised from inbound cross-border personal remittances to authorised dealers \u2014 accept any closed scheme electronic value (e.g. airtime) as a form of deposit or payment, or establish any subsidiary.\n\nWhat\u2019s the bigger picture? CBN\u2019s goal is seemingly to enhance financial inclusion. However, like we pointed out when we discussed Why Payment Service Banks could face an uphill battle in the Nigerian market, despite new services like agent banking, the introduction of BVN 2.0, and mobile money operations, there\u2019ve been minimal changes.\n\nAs of July 04, 2021, there are 48,762,163 BVN users in Nigeria. In comparison, in August 2020, there were 43.2 million users. For a country seeking an 80% financial inclusion rate by 2020, these are not good numbers, especially when examined in the light of its over 200 million population\n\nWill these new regulations bring the winds of change? During the week, I\u2019ll try to make sense of this puzzle.\n\nFlutterwave misses out on tax relief\n\nThe Nigeria Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) has released its Report on Pioneer Status Incentive Applications Q1 2021 (PDF) under the Industrial Development (Income Tax Relief) Act.\n\nThe pioneer status is an incentive that gives tax holidays to qualifying industries and products for three years, extendable for one or two additional years. It can be full or partial.\n\nNigeria\u2019s second unicorn, Flutterwave, was one of the ten companies denied the incentive. Others include Flour Mills of Nigeria (FMN), Envoy Hotels, Fountain Manufacturing Company Limited, Al-Hamsad Rice Mill Limited, Benchmark Constructions Limited, and Super Packaging Limited, Royal Foam Products Nigeria Limited, ENGIE Fenix Nigeria Limited, Technology Solutions Limited, and Echostone Development Nigeria Limited.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer The International Centre for Investigative Reporting, Emeka Offor, Director of Strategic Communication Office of the NIPC, said that some of the firms whose applications were denied could have avoided the situation if they had followed the directives of the Industrial Development (Income Tax Relief) Act.\n\nSpeaking on Flutterwave, Offor said, \u201dIn the case of Flutterwave, for instance, they applied within the third year of operations. Therefore, it is time-bound, according to the Industrial Development Act. Some other firms who had their applications for tax reliefs declined had a similar concern.\u201d\n\nEssentially, Flutterwave\u2019s application was denied because it failed to apply in time. This brings all sorts of questions to my mind. How many Nigerian startups know about government incentives like this one? And if they know, do they apply? Which incentives apply to them?\n\nYou already know the drill. Watch out for a story later this week by yours truly.\n\nWorld Population Day\n\nDid you know that July 11th was World Population Day? Don\u2019t be shy. You probably didn\u2019t. You can shock me and send evidence that you knew. Believe me. I want to see this.\n\nWhy does this concern you though? Just hear me out. Currently, Nigeria\u2019s population is estimated to be a whopping 211 million or more. According to the United Nations, from 2017 to 2050, it is expected that half of the world\u2019s population growth will be concentrated in just nine countries, and Nigeria is one of them. Big numbers indeed.\n\nBut there\u2019s more: According to the UN\u2019s population projections for 2020, about 62% were below age 25. By contrast, less than 5% are aged 60 years and above. Essentially, the median age in Nigeria is about 18, although this is expected to increase to 21.4 in 2050\n\nStill wondering why you should care? Nigeria\u2019s young population has been cited as a major attraction for digital activities. Is this an opportunity or a problem? If it is either, can we trust these figures?\n\nEmmanuel Paul will be doing a deep dive on this. Come back later today to read this story.\n\nWhat you missed on Techpoint Africa last week\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nDo white founders in Africa have an easier time getting capital?

There are no other federating states that have done what we are doing in policing.\n\n\u201cIt is no surprise that with the capsizing of the national police, the nation\u2019s security has also collapsed,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nEkweremadu said that restructuring the police was no longer a matter of choice but a matter of urgency NAN reported.\n\n\u201cIn an instance where we have a decentralised police, we will have a federal police system and 774 police systems in all the 774 local governments in the 36 states and in Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe implication, therefore, is that if the federal police fail, we have additional layers in 36 states; but right now, they are absent.\n\n\u201cNow that the federal policing have collapsed because they do not have the resources, the funding and the manpower, there is nothing to hold on to, Ekweremadu stressed.\n\nIn his address of welcome, Mr Bartholomew Aguegbodo, Chairman of the NBA branch said there was no better time to hold the Law Week than now in the light of Nigeria\u2019s current political climate.\n\n\u201cSometime in 2004 or 2005 the then President Olusegun Obasanjo, set up a committee with the task of setting a national vision targeted at year 2020 with all the dreams and hopes.\n\n\u201cThe year 2020 has come and gone and the dreams are far from being realised.\n\n\u201cThe founding fathers of this country had policies which would have birthed the Nigeria of our dreams if we had followed them to the letter,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAguegbodo said bad leadership and tribalism had, unfortunately, derailed the objectives of the nation\u2019s founding fathers and set the nation backward",

          "text": "Freedom to hold opinions and express them freely is one of the fundamental tenets of democracy especially as it is practised in the western world the model of which Nigeria adopted when military dictatorship was forced to step aside. Even under that rule, the country had a very vibrant media, the handmaid of that right to freedom which was used by pro-democracy activists to successfully fight for the restoration of civil rule.\n\nCuriously, the same civil rule that benefited from that struggle, which free speech made possible, is now working towards stifling the process that gave it life. It is from this perspective that stakeholders in the media are not just alarmed but worried, and justifiably so, that a legal process has been set in motion to muzzle that freedom that is clearly guaranteed in the country\u2019s supreme law \u2013 the constitution.\n\nPresently before the National Assembly is a bill that if allowed to pass in its present draft, would take away permanently from Nigerians the fundamental right of freedom of expression. Even worse, the bill intends to deny the average man in the street the right to be informed, to know the truth.\n\nFrom the title of that bill, an Act to amend the Nigerian Press Council Act Cap N128, laws of the Federation of Nigeria 1992 to remove bottle necks affecting its performance and make the council in tune with the current realities in regulating press and for related matters, this piece of legislation is obnoxious and must not be allowed to pass.\n\nIt is pertinent at this point, in the opinion of this newspaper, to highlight some of its provisions just to expose the dread this bill has in store not just for the media industry but all who are desirous of exercising their rights to freedom of speech and the right to hold opinions.\n\nBy the provisions of the bill, Section 2 establishes a board for the Council which shall serve on an advisory capacity, on a part-time basis; seat once in a quarter and shall consist of one representative of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ); one representative of the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) and one representative of Newspaper Proprietors Association of Nigeria (NPAN) who shall be person experienced in Journalism\n\nOther members of this council as stipulated in the bill are two representatives of the general public; one representative of Broadcasting Organization of Nigeria (BON); one representative of the Federal Ministry of Information and an Executive Secretary of the Council.\n\nAlso bill makes provision for the office of a chairman who shall be appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Minister; Members of the board (for NUJ, NGE, NPAN & BON) shall as well be appointed by the President on the recommendation of the minister \u201cafter an election by or on the nomination of the unions, association or other body concern\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSection 3 brings out the duties of the council which include: The Council shall be charged with the duty to: Regulate the print media and related media houses; Ensure truthful, genuine and quality services by print media houses and media practitioners; With the approval of the Minister in charge of information, establish and disseminate a national Press Code and standards to guide the conduct of print Media, related media houses and media practitioners; approve penalties and fines against violations of the Press Code by print media houses and media Practitioners, including revocation of license. Other functions of the council are: receive, process, and consider applications for the establishment, ownership and operation of print media and other related media houses; with the approval of the Minister, grant print media and other related License any application considered worthy of such; monitor activities of the press, media and other related houses to ensure compliance with the national Press Code for professionals and ethical conduct, including the NUJ, among others.\n\nThe bill goes on to warn that no person shall engage, operate or use any apparatus or premises for print or related media anywhere in Nigeria except under and in accordance with the provision of this Act. And where an offence under this section has been committed by an individual, or a body corporate, such person(s) or body corporate shall be deemed to be guilty of an offence and liable to be prosecuted against and be punished accordingly. Where any person or body corporate has been convicted of this offence: such person or body corporate shall be liable to a fine of five million Naira only or three years imprisonment to the person or the promoter (in case of body corporate or both, and; an additional fine of N20, 000 only for each day during which the offence continues.\n\nFurthermore, Section 9 which relates to a Code of Conduct said that: the Council shall establish a National Press and Ethical Code of media conduct for media houses and media practitioners which shall come to effect and be disseminated after approval by the Minister.

It is out to crush the media in a democracy. That is not acceptable. Again, Section 17 of the principal Act is amended by substituting subsections 3 and 4 which said that where the medium of information or the journalist so sanctioned in accordance with subsection (1) of this section does not comply with the Council\u2019s rules, the medium or journalist is guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction: in the case of a body corporate, to a fine of N1 million only; and in the case of a journalist to a fine of N250, 000 only, and the Council shall order the suspension of the journalist from practice for a period not exceeding six months or more.\n\nThe bill goes onto say: where there is persistent refusal to comply with the directives of the Council, the medium or journalist so sanctioned in accordance with Section (1) of this section, commits an offence, and he is liable on conviction: in the case of a body corporate to a fine of N2 million Naira only. In the case of a journalist to a fine of N250, 000 only and in an extreme case, the council shall order the striking out of the name of the journalist from the register.\n\nThe bill is not yet done in its determination to stifle the media. Section 21 of the Principal Act is amended in subsection 5 by increasing the fines attached to violations of the provision of subsection (1) of the same section to read as follows: where anybody has been convicted of an offence under this section of the Act in a High Court: he shall be liable of a fine of N250, 000 only or imprisonment for a term of two years or both and to an additional fine of N5, 000 each day during which the offence continues.\n\nSimilarly, Section 28 addresses the financial provisions of the council.

And to an additional fine of N20, 000 for every day in default.\n\nFrom the foregoing, it is clear that this bill, to all intents and purposes, is out to control the media through a licensing process which is inimical to all that journalism stands for. That is to say, should by any stroke of misfortune this bill sails through, soon, the jailhouses will be overflowing with prisoners of conscience, journalists who would rather go to jail than abandon their roles as the watchdog of the society.

          "text": "Freedom to hold opinions and express them freely is one of the fundamental tenets of democracy especially as it is practised in the western world the model of which Nigeria adopted when military dictatorship was forced to step aside. Even under that rule, the country had a very vibrant media, the handmaid of that right to freedom which was used by pro-democracy activists to successfully fight for the restoration of civil rule.\n\nCuriously, the same civil rule that benefited from that struggle, which free speech made possible, is now working towards stifling the process that gave it life. It is from this perspective that stakeholders in the media are not just alarmed but worried, and justifiably so, that a legal process has been set in motion to muzzle that freedom that is clearly guaranteed in the country\u2019s supreme law \u2013 the constitution.\n\nPresently before the National Assembly is a bill that if allowed to pass in its present draft, would take away permanently from Nigerians the fundamental right of freedom of expression. Even worse, the bill intends to deny the average man in the street the right to be informed, to know the truth.\n\nFrom the title of that bill, an Act to amend the Nigerian Press Council Act Cap N128, laws of the Federation of Nigeria 1992 to remove bottle necks affecting its performance and make the council in tune with the current realities in regulating press and for related matters, this piece of legislation is obnoxious and must not be allowed to pass.\n\nIt is pertinent at this point, in the opinion of this newspaper, to highlight some of its provisions just to expose the dread this bill has in store not just for the media industry but all who are desirous of exercising their rights to freedom of speech and the right to hold opinions.\n\nBy the provisions of the bill, Section 2 establishes a board for the Council which shall serve on an advisory capacity, on a part-time basis; seat once in a quarter and shall consist of one representative of the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ); one representative of the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) and one representative of Newspaper Proprietors Association of Nigeria (NPAN) who shall be person experienced in Journalism\n\nOther members of this council as stipulated in the bill are two representatives of the general public; one representative of Broadcasting Organization of Nigeria (BON); one representative of the Federal Ministry of Information and an Executive Secretary of the Council.\n\nAlso bill makes provision for the office of a chairman who shall be appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Minister; Members of the board (for NUJ, NGE, NPAN & BON) shall as well be appointed by the President on the recommendation of the minister \u201cafter an election by or on the nomination of the unions, association or other body concern\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSection 3 brings out the duties of the council which include: The Council shall be charged with the duty to: Regulate the print media and related media houses; Ensure truthful, genuine and quality services by print media houses and media practitioners; With the approval of the Minister in charge of information, establish and disseminate a national Press Code and standards to guide the conduct of print Media, related media houses and media practitioners; approve penalties and fines against violations of the Press Code by print media houses and media Practitioners, including revocation of license. Other functions of the council are: receive, process, and consider applications for the establishment, ownership and operation of print media and other related media houses; with the approval of the Minister, grant print media and other related License any application considered worthy of such; monitor activities of the press, media and other related houses to ensure compliance with the national Press Code for professionals and ethical conduct, including the NUJ, among others.\n\nThe bill goes on to warn that no person shall engage, operate or use any apparatus or premises for print or related media anywhere in Nigeria except under and in accordance with the provision of this Act. And where an offence under this section has been committed by an individual, or a body corporate, such person(s) or body corporate shall be deemed to be guilty of an offence and liable to be prosecuted against and be punished accordingly. Where any person or body corporate has been convicted of this offence: such person or body corporate shall be liable to a fine of five million Naira only or three years imprisonment to the person or the promoter (in case of body corporate or both, and; an additional fine of N20, 000 only for each day during which the offence continues.\n\nFurthermore, Section 9 which relates to a Code of Conduct said that: the Council shall establish a National Press and Ethical Code of media conduct for media houses and media practitioners which shall come to effect and be disseminated after approval by the Minister. By the provisions of this code of conduct, the Council shall cause to be established in the Nigerian Press Council Journal, the Code of Professional and Ethical Code of Conduct as approved under Section (1) of this section which shall be binding on every media Houses, Journalists and media practitioners in Nigeria.\n\nWe are taking the pains to point out all this sections and clauses to emphasize the point that a lot is wrong with this bill.

          "title": "School, Parents Sell Properties To Raise Ransom For Abducted Islamiyya Pupils",
          "text": "Both parents and the proprietors of the Salihu Tanko Islamiyya School, Tegina, Niger State, are making efforts to raise the ransom demanded by the bandits who abducted pupils from the school about six weeks ago.\n\nThe school owners, it was learnt, have sold a plot of land within the school premises to raise funds for the ransom, just as some parents say they are selling off valuable assets to pay the bandits to free their children.\n\nThe pupils have been in the bandits\u2019 captivity for about six weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, the abductors of pupils of have again reduced their ransom demand from N50 million to N30 million. They had initially demand N200 million to release the 136 pupils in their custody. From that figure they reduced it to N150 million and later N110 million.\n\nLEADERSHIP gathered yesterday that the bandits contacted the school and the parents at the weekend during which they brought down the ransom to N30 million, citing the poor health conditions of the children as the reason.\n\nAccording to a source, the bandits claimed in their recent calls that they were frustrated by the condition of the children and decided to reduce the ransom to N30 million to easily reach accord with the school authorities and the parents since the government was averse to the payment of ransom.\n\nConsequently, it was learnt that the parents had started selling their properties to raise the ransom, with the school authorities selling a plot of land within the school premises to raise some money for the purpose.\n\nA parent who preferred anonymity confirmed to LEADERSHIP that he sold a detachment of his house for about N1.5 million to raise his contribution to the ransom because two of his children are with the bandits.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe head teacher of the school, Alhassan Garba Abubakar, told LEADERSHIP that the school authorities sold a plot of land adjacent the school meant for further expansion to contribute to the ransom.\n\nHe said since the school is a privately owned one, it was not an easy decision to sell the land but that \u201cthe school owners are as desperate for the release of the pupils just as the parents.\u201d\n\nA government official who preferred anonymity, however, told LEADERSHIP that the bandits were desperate to get money from the parents and the school because government refused to pay ransom.\n\n\u201cIf they are saying the condition of the children is poor, who subjected them to it? The same men. What we gathered from those who escaped is that a particular boy was maltreated constantly because he is our governor\u2019s namesake; they are annoyed because the government is not ready to pay ransom,\u201d he added.\n\nBandits Take Over Kainji Lake National Park\n\nMeanwhile, gunmen suspected to be bandits have taken over a part of Kainji Lake National Park in New Bussa, Borgu local government area of Niger State.\n\nThe park guards have deserted the affected part for personal safety.\n\nLEADERSHIP investigation revealed that the bandits had infiltrated the area from Benin republic and had on some occasions abducted the park guards, forcing them to abandon their duty posts.\n\nOne of the park guards who preferred anonymity said, \u201cIt started in October last year, and in March this year the bandits invaded the park, killing one of our men, injuring seven park guards and burning our patrol vehicles.\n\n\u201cWe thought it was a one off attack but it continued, so we were advised to abandon our constant patrol of the part of the park until strategies are put in place to secure the area, because the authorities cannot be paying ransom every time to the bandits,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother park guard stated that \u201calmost every day, the bandits use the park as a cover to operate in the neighbouring communities and retreat into the interior.\u201d\n\nLEADERSHIP gathered that, last Friday, four people, including a Correctional Centre Officer and a suspect, were abducted around Kofanti area near the park on their way from a court proceeding from New Bussa to Agwara.\n\nCollaborating the report of the park guard, a resident of New Bussa, Malam Muhammad Kallamu, said for the past one month, more than 50 people had been abducted along the area, especially in Kofanti area on the road to Agwara.\n\nThe resident said when the bandits abduct people they demand from N1million to N5million on each head, making life difficult for the villagers.\n\nIt was learnt that the bandits usually operate on motorcycles in a convoy of 30 to 50, whereas the guards are sometimes five to seven men on shift duty.\n\n\u201cThey gained entrance into the park as peaceful people when they initially entered the country through Benin Border. It baffles us that a national asset like a park that serves as tourism destination will be allowed to be taken over by bandits who are foreigners.\n\n\u201cThe park is one of the largest in Nigeria. We are surprised the bandits want to take over, we cannot travel to the nearby villages they have taken over the park and that part of the road,\u201d another resident, Yusuf Mohammed, said.\n\nWhen contacted, the conservator of the park, Jimoh Oladosu, confirmed there had been attacks in the area, but said he would not speak further because he had no such permission.\n\nGunmen Kill 9 In Fresh Attack In Southern Kaduna\n\nSome gunmen suspected to be herdsmen militia have invaded Makarau Jankasa Community in Zango Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State, killing nine people.\n\nScores of natives were reported to have fled their homes to other neighbouring communities as a result of the heavy shooting.\n\nThe fresh attack is coming barely 72 hours after a similar attack on Warkan Community of the same local government where nine people were killed, many sustained injuries, while 12 houses were burnt down.\n\nA resident, Donald Bityong who confirmed the incident to LEADERSHIP yesterday, said the suspected armed Fulani men invaded the community on Sunday at about 5pm.\n\nHe said security operatives arrived at the village after the criminals had already perpetrated their gruesome deed and disappeared into the bush.\n\nHe called on the government and the security agencies to redouble their efforts in securing lives and properties.\n\n\u201cThese attacks are too much for us to bear, no one is safe any longer in our community. Nobody can go to his farm now,\u201d Bityong said.\n\nWhen contacted, the state police public relations officer, Mohammed Jalige, did not respond to calls for comments on the development as of the time of this report.\n\nAbductors Of Kaduna Emir Demand N200m Ransom\n\nMeanwhile, those who kidnapped the Emir of Kajuru, Alhaji Alhassan Adamu and other family members have demanded a ransom of N200 million for their release.\n\nThe emir and about 14 members of his family members, including grandchildren were taken away by force from the emir\u2019s residence at Kajuru in Kajuru local government area of Kaduna State on Sunday morning.\n\nHowever, only the emir was released yesterday by the kidnappers, who held back the 14 others and are demanding ransom for their release.\n\nA competent source from the palace, who disclosed the ransom demand to journalists, said \u201cso far, they are demanding N200 million as ransom for their release.\u201d\n\nThe source also said discussions and negotiation are ongoing with the bandits.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kaduna State police command through the police public relation officer (PPRO), ASP Mohammed Jalige, said a joint patrol of the Police Mobile Force (PMF), conventional police and the Nigerian Army attached to Kajuru LGA are currently engaged in search and rescue mission around the forest for a possible rescue of the victims while IGP\u2019s Tactical units had been contacted for technical support.\n\nHe called on members of the public to always avail the police with useful information to enable them prevent and respond quickly to crime and criminality in their locality.",

          "text": "By Abankula\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa has warned South Africans who have been rioting, looting and destroying properties to protest the jailing of his predecessor, Jacob Zuma to desist or risk the full wrath of the law.\n\nIn a special broadcast from his office at Tuynhuys, Cape Town, Ramaphosa revealed that 10 people have died in the riots, while four SAP members have been injured.\n\n\u201cAt this hour, there are several families in our country that are in mourning.\n\n\u201cI speak of the families of Nkosikhona Chiza, Ndumiso Shezi, Khaya Mkhize, Zethembe Ndwandwe, Lindani Bhengu and Lindokuhle Gumede in Gauteng.\n\n\u201cI speak of the families of Bhekani Ndlovu, Themba Mthembu, Aphiwe Gama and Cebo Dlamini in KwaZulu-Natal\u201d.\n\nHe also gave generous mention of the policemen who have been injured.\n\n\u201cWe extend our best wishes for a speedy recovery to the four SAPS members injured during this violence: Constable Sangweni, who was shot and injured in Alexandra; his two colleagues, Sergeant Maraheni and Lieutenant Colonel Nefolovhodwe, who were hit with bricks; and Constable Seloane, who was shot and injured in Daveyton\u201d, he said.\n\nIn the broadcast, Ramaphosa did not for once mention Zuma.\n\nBut his address was targeted at Zuma\u2019s aggrieved supporters who felt Zuma was too big for jail.\n\nRamaphosa appealed to their sense of reasoning, about the inviolability of the constitution, whether one is rich or the poor.\n\nHe rebuked those who have hugged violence to oppose the sanction against Zuma.\n\n\u201cWhat we are witnessing now are opportunistic acts of criminality, with groups of people instigating chaos merely as a cover for looting and theft.\n\n\u201cThere is no grievance, nor any political cause, that can justify the violence and destruction that we have seen in parts of KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur Constitution guarantees the right of every person to protest, to organise, to engage in free expression and free association.\n\n\u201cIt gives every person an equal right to protection before the law, and confers on every person a responsibility to respect and uphold the rights of others.\n\n\u201cOur Constitution is the foundation of the rule of law in our country.\n\n\u201cIt is this rule of law that guards against the abuse of power, that protects the poor and the vulnerable, that enables our society to function and our economy to develop\u201d.\n\nRamaphosa however warned that his government was prepared to protect every person in the country.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear: we will take action to protect every person in this country against the threat of violence, intimidation, theft and looting.\n\n\u201cWe will not hesitate to arrest and prosecute those who perpetrate these actions and will ensure that they face the full might of our law\u201d, he said.\n\nRead the full text:\n\nMy Fellow South Africans,\n\nI address you this evening with a heavy heart.\n\nOver the past few days and nights, there have been acts of public violence of a kind rarely seen in the history of our democracy.\n\nProperty has been vandalised and destroyed.\n\nShops have been looted.\n\nLaw-abiding citizens have been threatened and intimidated.\n\nWorkers are scared that they may not be able to return to work.\n\nPeople have died.\n\nAt this hour, there are several families in our country that are in mourning.\n\nI speak of the families of Nkosikhona Chiza, Ndumiso Shezi, Khaya Mkhize, Zethembe Ndwandwe, Lindani Bhengu and Lindokuhle Gumede in Gauteng.\n\nI speak of the families of Bhekani Ndlovu, Themba Mthembu, Aphiwe Gama and Cebo Dlamini in KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nEven as we know the high cost of this violence to property, to livelihoods and to businesses, the loss of human life is the greatest cost of all.\n\nAs a nation our thoughts and prayers are with these families.\n\nMany South Africans are at this hour counting the cost to their livelihoods and property, to their shops and businesses, to their safety and security.\n\nMany more South Africans are feeling anxious and afraid.\n\nParts of the country are reeling from several days and nights of public violence, destruction of property and looting of the sort rarely seen before in the history of our democracy.\n\nIt started with the burning of trucks at Mooi River in KwaZulu-Natal this past Saturday and was followed by blockades of roads in the northern parts of the province and the looting of shops in Ethekwini and Pietermaritzburg.\n\nFor the past two days, Gauteng has experienced the blocking of roads, looting, damage to property and burning of trucks.\n\nThanks to the work of our law enforcement agencies 166 suspects have been arrested in KwaZulu-Natal and 323 suspects had been arrested in Gauteng in relation to these incidents.\n\nNevertheless, violence is continuing in many areas.\n\nSome have characterised these actions as a form of political protest.\n\nThis violence may indeed have its roots in the pronouncements and activities of individuals with a political purpose, and in expressions of frustration and anger.\n\nAt the beginning of this unrest, there may have been some people who sought to agitate for violence and disorder along ethnic lines. We know that the majority of our people have out of principle refused to be mobilised along these lines.\n\nHowever, what we are witnessing now are opportunistic acts of criminality, with groups of people instigating chaos merely as a cover for looting and theft.\n\nThere is no grievance, nor any political cause, that can justify the violence and destruction that we have seen in parts of KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng.\n\nOur Constitution guarantees the right of every person to protest, to organise, to engage in free expression and free association.\n\nIt gives every person an equal right to protection before the law, and confers on every person a responsibility to respect and uphold the rights of others.\n\nOur Constitution is the foundation of the rule of law in our country.\n\nIt is this rule of law that guards against the abuse of power, that protects the poor and the vulnerable, that enables our society to function and our economy to develop.\n\nThe victims of the violence that is unfolding now \u2013 the workers, the truck drivers, the business owners, the parents and families of those who have lost their lives \u2013 have done nothing wrong.\n\nAlthough these may be opportunistic acts of looting driven by hardship and poverty, the poor and marginalised bear the ultimate brunt of the destruction.\n\nShops have been looted and infrastructure destroyed.\n\nThis means that our sick cannot get medication from pharmacies, food does not reach supermarket shelves, and health workers cannot go to work.\n\nOur vaccination programme has been severely disrupted just as it is gaining momentum. This will have lasting effects on our ability to consolidate some of the progress we were already witnessing in our economic recovery.\n\nThese disruptions will cost lives by cutting off the supply chains that sustain our food, health and production systems.\n\nThe path of violence, of looting and anarchy, leads only to more violence and devastation.\n\nIt leads to more poverty, more unemployment, and more loss of innocent life.\n\nThis is not who we are as a people.\n\nTime and time again, we have chosen a different path, a path of peace and democracy.\n\nWe have chosen to pursue dialogue and protest rather than violence and chaos.\n\nEach of us, no matter our position or our circumstances, has an interest in maintaining and upholding the rule of law.\n\nIt is therefore a matter of vital importance that we restore calm and stability to all parts of the country without delay.\n\nIt is vital that we prevent any further loss of life or injury.\n\nIt is vital that we protect property and safeguard social and economic infrastructure.\n\nWe are therefore mobilising all available resources and capabilities to restore order.\n\nAs the Commander-in-Chief of the South African Defence Force, I have today authorised the deployment of Defence Force personnel in support of the operations of the South African Police Service.\n\nThe National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure \u2013 known as NatJOINTS \u2013 has intensified deployments in all the affected areas in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng.\n\nThe South African Police Service is putting measures in place to call up operational members from leave and rest-days to increase the presence of law enforcement personnel on the ground.\n\nThe NatJOINTS is receiving support from the Intelligence Coordinating Committee, comprising of SAPS Crime Intelligence, Defence Intelligence and State Security.\n\nIn addition to greater visibility and an intelligence-driven presence in potential hotspots, we will be prioritising the prosecution of suspects alleged to be involved in this violence.\n\nThe National Security Council, which I chair as Commander-in-Chief, will be meeting twice a day to coordinate all measures necessary to restore stability.\n\nLet me be clear: we will take action to protect every person in this country against the threat of violence, intimidation, theft and looting.\n\nWe will not hesitate to arrest and prosecute those who perpetrate these actions and will ensure that they face the full might of our law.\n\nWe will restore calm and order so that we can get on with the task of rebuilding this country and creating a better life for its people.\n\nThe passage of time has not erased from our memories the dark days when sinister elements stoked the flames of violence in our communities to try and turn us against each other. We live with these memories still.\n\nBut we also remember that as we were preparing for democratic change \u2013 we came together as a society to end the violence that was rampant in many communities.\n\nAs we confront this challenge, we should remember how \u2013 at another time in our history, as we were preparing for democratic change \u2013 we came together as a society to end the violence that was rampant in many communities.\n\nWe came together \u2013 as religious leaders, traditional leaders, trade unions, businesses, community organisations, political parties, NGOs and others \u2013 to bring peace to our nation.\n\nNow we need to come together again, for each of us to play our part in restoring calm to those areas that have been affected by violence; for each of us to stand up for the rule of law and for the peaceful resolution of conflict.\n\nThis afternoon, Ministers and senior officials in the economic and the security clusters met with Business Unity South Africa to take stock of the situation and to develop coordinated actions.\n\nWe have agreed to work together to ensure the safety of drivers, cashiers, patients and customers.\n\nWe have agreed to share information and resources to ensure that we restore key supply chains.\n\nWe are making arrangements for government leaders and public representatives as part of their responsibilities to meet with leaders in various communities to promote stability.\n\nAs part of our ongoing engagement with key sectors of society, I will be meeting with leaders of political parties to discuss the current situation.\n\nWe are called upon \u2013 wherever we may be \u2013 to remain calm, to exercise restraint, and to resist any attempts to incite violence, create panic or fuel divisions.\n\nWhether we are leaders of political parties, taxi associations, business organisations or unions, we need to do everything in our means to calm the situation.\n\nWe should refrain from posting and circulating inflammatory messages on social media, and from spreading rumours or false reports that may create further panic.\n\nNo-one should take the law into their own hands.\n\nRather, we should join those individuals and communities who are working with the police to prevent looting, and those members of the public who have provided tip-offs and information about instances of criminality.\n\nI wish to thank all operational members and commanders of the SAPS and other agencies for their response to acts of violence and provocation, which has helped to avert bloodshed and limit the loss of lives.\n\nWe extend our best wishes for a speedy recovery to the four SAPS members injured during this violence: Constable Sangweni, who was shot and injured in Alexandra; his two colleagues, Sergeant Maraheni and Lieutenant Colonel Nefolovhodwe, who were hit with bricks; and Constable Seloane, who was shot and injured in Daveyton.\n\nFellow South Africans,\n\nThis violence and destruction takes place in the midst of a devastating pandemic.\n\nThere is a danger that these events will lead to an even greater surge in infections, putting many more lives at risk and placing a greater burden on our health facilities and personnel.\n\nThere is a danger that our vaccination programme will be disrupted in some areas just as we need to significantly expand its reach.\n\nWe cannot allow this to happen.\n\nWe will not allow this to happen.\n\nThis moment has thrown into stark relief what we already knew: that the level of unemployment, poverty and inequality in our society is unsustainable.\n\nWe cannot expect a lasting and durable peace if we do not create jobs and build a more just and equitable society in which all South Africans can participate freely and equally.\n\nWe must therefore commit ourselves not only to peace, but to greater economic opportunity for all.\n\nWe are emerging now from a long period of uncertainty and stagnation.\n\nWe have witnessed the effects of corruption and the erosion of the state, the terrible consequences of the abuse of power and neglect of duty.\n\nWe have begun a process of healing, reconstruction and renewal.\n\nWe have set our country on a path of progress and recovery.\n\nWe cannot allow a few people among us to threaten this collective effort.\n\nWe will protect our constitutional democracy, so that we can consolidate our gains.\n\nWe will reject violence and chaos, so that can move forward.\n\nLet me repeat: we are building up, not shutting down.\n\nWe will not be deterred, as South Africans, from the task ahead of us.\n\nWe are faced, as we have been faced many times before, with a moment of great challenge and great promise.\n\nLet us choose the path of peace and renewal.\n\nLet us stand firm and emerge stronger.\n\nTogether, we will defeat those who seek to destabilise our country, who seek to reverse the gains we have made.\n\nWe will stand as one people, united against violence, unanimous in our commitment to peace and to the rule of law.\n\nI thank you.",

He enjoined the Council bosses to do same.\n\nHe also urged them to look inward and make their services count in the lives of the people in the best progressive ideals that the party is known for.\n\nWhile congratulating them on their new attainments, Oyetola disclosed that their appointment was based on merit in view of their track record of capacity, performance and abiding loyalty to the progressive ideals of the ruling party.\n\nHe also appealed to party members who did not make the final list, to put the past behind them and look forward to a brighter future in their quest to serve the people and the party, adding \u201cwe have taken note of your hard work, and I assure you, your own opportunities will come.\n\n\u201cI heartily congratulate you all for making it thus far as this is a clear testament to your inherent leadership potential, track record of capacity, performance and abiding loyalty to the progressive ideals of our Party.\n\n\u201cConsidering that your emergence followed a thoroughly-intense process, you should regard this invaluable opportunity as sufficiently humbling and a lifetime opportunity to not only serve our people but to also leave an indelible footprint in the sand of time.\n\n\u201cWith such defining values as humility, integrity, purposefulness, honesty, transparency, accountability and incorruptibility, you should hit the ground running and ensure that you deliver urgently, the dividends of democracy to our teeming citizens.\n\n\u201cAs you all know, the local government institution is the closest to our people. Therefore, your leadership will only be as meaningful and successful to the extent to which you run an administration that is not only truly inclusive, but also one fully committed to meeting the basic needs of our people.\n\n\u201cTo do this, it requires that you lead a united front, working closely with the bureaucracy to run an administration that listens to the deepest yearnings of the people and actively seeking constructive feedbacks that will aid the governance process.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that since our assumption of office, we have run an Administration that is transparent, inclusive, purposeful and absolutely pro-people. This is because ours is an Administration driven by the philosophy that governance is only meaningful to the extent that it serves the needs of our people,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Mr. Adebayo Adeleke, lauded Governor Oyetola for appointing men and women of impeccable character to take up the mantle of leadership in all the Local Government Areas of the State.\n\nHe tasked them on dedication, loyalty and service, saying it is a thing of joy that 69 capable persons had been appointed as chairmen to head the helms of affairs at various Councils across the State.\n\nAdeleke added: \u201cToday is special because Mr. Governor was able to bring out 69 out of millions of people of the State to serve. The assignment is that you need to do proper reconciliation in your respective Local Government Areas. You will be assessed based on your ability to resolve contending matters, you must not raise imbroglio.\n\n\u201cYou must mobilise Osun citizens for the ongoing registration exercise for Permanent Voters\u2019 Card. Don\u2019t disappoint Mr Governor. Welfare and security of your people must be your priority. Don\u2019t use it to enrich yourselves.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, the Acting Chairman, Osun Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Prince Gboyega Famodun, urged the newly-sworn-in chairmen to take charge of their councils by being dedicated and committed to good governance.\n\nHe urged them to champion loyalty, dedication, commitment and selfless service to humanity, saying anything short of that will amount to collosal loss.\n\nIn his vote of thanks, one of the newly-sworn-in chairmen, Hon. Samuel Abiodun Idowu, hailed the Governor for counting them worthy to serve their people just as he promised their commitment to deliver.\n\nHe said \u201cI want to appreciate Mr. Governor for counting us worthy for this appointment and I promise that we will work as a team and deliver to your satisfaction.\u201d",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s President Cyril Ramaphosa is set to address the nation Monday as violence and looting rages in parts of the country, acting minister in the presidency Khumbudzo Ntshavheni has confirmed.\n\nUnrest began last week after Zuma handed himself in to begin a 15-month sentence. Several people have been killed and dozens arrested.\n\nZuma was convicted of contempt of court after failing to attend an inquiry into corruption during his presidency.\n\nThe 79-year-old, who denies corruption, is hoping to get his sentence rescinded or reduced at the Constitutional Court hearing. However, legal experts say his chances of success are slim.\n\nThe address later on Monday comes a day after Ramaphosa announced the country would remain on adjusted lockdown level 4.\n\nThe president is on record calling for calm and warning criminal elements that they will face the full might of law as lawlessness is brought to an end and economic activity is allowed to continue.\n\n\u201cThe majority of South Africans do not and should not tolerate violence, the destruction of property and the endangering of livelihoods. People are urged to report criminals by sharing videos of criminal activity with the police.\n\n\u201cPeople are also asked to pay attention to what they post on social media and to be aware that the sharing of fake news or content that incites violence and looting is a crime.\n\n\u201cIt is also a crime to possess, receive and use stolen goods, or to interfere with the police in their execution of their duties,\u201d the presidency said.",

          "text": "The apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has slammed Kogi state governor Yahaya Bello over his recent comment on rotational presidency, saying the governor was still in school when the agreement was reached.\n\nMr Bello on Friday described talks by southern states governors (who had in a resolution said that Nigeria\u2019s president in 2023 should come from the south) of rotational presidency as unconstitutional.\n\nHe argued further that Nigerians should be allowed to make their choices for the best candidate to emerge for the top post.\n\nOhanaeze, however, noted that there was actually an agreement for rotational presidency in Nigeria between the North and the South.\n\n\u201cGovernor Bello was still a student, studying accountancy at the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria when an agreement was reached between the North and the South with respect to Rotational Presidency,\u201d National Publicity Secretary of the group, Alex Ogbonnia said in the statement.\n\nHe added further that, \u201cThe meeting was held at the National University Commission (NUC) Conference Centre, Abuja, in 1998. Dr Chuba Okadigbo spoke on behalf of the South while Alh Abubakar Rimi spoke for the North.\n\n\u201cThe likes of Dr Alex Ekwueme, Chief Solomon Lar, Dr Okwesilieze Nwodo were at the meeting. The Nigerian statesmen examined the merits and demerits of zoning and rotation of power between the composite zones in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAt the end, it was resolved that the presidency be conceded to the South, and that it would rotate between the South and the North in the interest of equity, unity and corporate existence of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe foregoing was the basis for the emergence of presidential candidates of the mainstream political parties from the Southwest in 1999.\n\n\u201cSince then, the patriotic and peace-loving Nigerians have adhered to the rotation principle, such that at the end of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s second tenure, President Musa Yar\u2019Adua was elected; Goodluck Jonathan and then President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cThe above expose informs the resolution by the Southern governors that the South should produce the next president of Nigeria after President Buhari.\u201d\n\nAccording to the group, the governor has demonstrated a remarkable obsession with ambition shortly after providence paved way for him to be sworn in as the governor of Kogi State in 2015 at the age of 40.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that Bello has a date with destiny going by a smooth political ascendancy that life has presented to him. However, I have my fears that he is embarking on a political adventure that lacks both conscience and principle.\n\n\u201cThe immortal words of Uthman Dan Fodio that \u2018conscience is an open wound and only the truth can heal it\u2019 should serve as a moral compass to Nigerian leaders,\u201d he said.\n\nOhanaeze Ndigbo, led by George Obiozor, therefore advised the governor that \u201cit will serve his interest better if he supports the resolution by his southern colleagues; since age is still in his favour\u201d.\n\nThe group also said that \u201cBello is beckoned to the ethical functional relationship between the morality of an agreement and the legality of the constitution.\n\n\u201cFor purpose of clarity, morality is the universal foundation of Laws. On the other hand, law should be seen to stand in defence of morality,\u201d the statement added.\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
