          "text": "The Government of Switzerland in collaboration with a non-governmental organization, Global Peace Development, have donated three classroom blocks and a solar-powered borehole to the Lafia Local Government Education Authority primary school in Ungwan Galadima 2 community of Nasarawa state.\n\nThis is in a bid to ensure that pupils of the school have access to quality education and portable water for their daily usage.\n\nSpeaking on Friday in Lafia during the handing-over ceremony of the classroom blocks and borehole to the community, Executive Director of GPD, Ebruke Esike, said that the project tagged \u2018Support Education Infrastructure for Improved Child Learning and Development in Nasarawa State\u2019, was a way to tackle illiteracy in the state.\n\nEsike, who was represented by the State Coordinator of GPD, Joy Tsaku, further explained that the gesture was a deliberate effort to provide improved learning environment that would ensure quality education for primary school pupils in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe witnessed a supposed learning facility lacking basic amenities as majority of the pupils sit on bare floor while learning took place because of inadequate classrooms and limited desks. About 113 pupils were using one classroom which could lead to child underdevelopment.\n\n\u201cSo we constructed three blocks of classroom, a solar powered borehole and five toilets with septic tank which is equipped with hygiene facility. We also provided 45 desks for the pupils and three chairs and tables for the teachers\u201d.\n\nThe Executive Director expressed gratitude to the Embassy of Switzerland in Nigeria for partnering with his organization to address the plight of the community by contributing funds for the project.\n\n\u201cWe sought the assistance of the Embassy of Switzerland in Nigeria to provide basic amenities required for a conducive learning and teaching environment lacking in the school. The project gulped the sum of N10,898,850, out of which N9,232,850 was donated by the Embassy so we are grateful for their support\u201d, he added.\n\nRepresentative of the Lafia Local Government Education Authority, Abdullahi Ibrahim, thanked Global Peace Development for the initiative to give back to the society, saying that he would ensure that the facilities are maintained in order to encourage other organizations to bring more social amenities to the community.\n\n\u201cI am very happy with this development. GPD has done well for us by building these classrooms, borehole and toilets. I want to also thank the Embassy of Switzerland for supporting them to achieve this feat. We would ensure that the facilities are maintained so that the community can continue to experience rapid growth\u201d, he said.\n\nOur Correspondent reports that the district head of Ungwan Galadima 2 community in Lafia and well-wishers from neighboring communities graced the occasion.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\nAbout 82 Civil Society Organisations(CSOs) under the aegis of \u201cCivil Society Coalition for Economic Development (CED) have hailed President Muhammadu Buhari over plans to end the subsidy regime in Nigeria.\n\nThe coalition gave the commendation in a seven-point communique issued at the end of a conference of the Coalition in Abuja on Friday.\n\nIn the communique, which was signed by the convener, Yusuf Dan Maitama and the Secretary, Badaru Ayewoh, the coalition said it was a right step in the right direction.\n\nThe coalition noted that the subsidy regime was unsustainable, adding that the best way to tackle the problem was to remove subsidies.\n\nAccording to the communique, the conference, titled: \u201cFuel Subsidy Removal in Nigeria\u201d, was deliberately chosen in view of the realities of the times.\n\nHe said that if the money is paid as a cost of fuel subsidy was channelled into the provision of infrastructure and other social sectors of the economy, there be growth and development.\n\nThey further recommended that the fuel subsidy regime be stopped from January 2022.\n\nThey said the subsidy regime was a major challenge forcing the federal government into external borrowing.\n\n\u201cThe resource persons who are world-class researchers in the oil and gas industry extrapolated issues bordering on Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry and identified Nigeria\u2019s major economic challenges as that of the active fuel subsidy regime.\n\n\u201cIn the group discussions, participants were unanimous that Nigeria was the only country in the world that sustained fuel subsidy regime for the past 20 years.\n\n\u201cThe fuel subsidy regime was a capitalist and elitist policy that services only the top-heavy, hence, successive governments found it difficult to implement their economic policies.\n\n\u201cIt was pointed out that the Federal government spends N250 billion on fuel subsidy every month.\n\n\u201cThe development, discussants averred was largely responsible for national debts as revenue coming into the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF) account are used to settle the fuel subsidy.\u201d\n\nThey pleaded with the organised labour not to embark on strike on account of ending subsidies.\n\nThey urged the federal government to forward a budget for N5000 grants to be disbursed to citizens to cushion the effect of fuel subsidy removal in 2022.\n\nThe Federal Government of Nigeria should end the fuel subsidy regime effect from 1st January 2022 in order the save the sum of N250 billion monthly as the economy of Nigeria has become very fragile given the financial burden orchestrated by the subsidy regime.\n\n\u201cThat Nigeria is a monolithic economy as such, revenue earnings must be jealously guarded and which should be channelled into road construction, power, education, health and development of its youth.\n\n\u201cThe organised labour should be considerate and not embark on strike action in the circumstance that the Federal government has ended fuel subsidy regime, given the reversal of huge resources back into the federal government coffers.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government and all stakeholders in the oil and gas industry should strictly enforce the provisions of Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which came into effect after it was signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cThe federal government, private and public sectors should embark on sensitisation of Nigerians on the need for immediate removal of fuel subsidy in order to save the nation from further financial haemorrhage.\n\n\u201cThe federal government of Nigeria should forward the budgetary provision of N5000 grant to citizens to cushion the effect of fuel subsidy removal to the two arms of the National Assembly for legislative debate before the passage of 2022 budget.\n\n\u201cThe Civil Society Coalition commends the Group Managing Director of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Limited for his commitment to the stability of oil and gas industry in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Chimaobi Nwaiwu, Nnewi\n\nForemost industrialist, Chief Dr Ajulu Uzodike, yesterday said that Ndigbo can still do better and live above their obvious marginalization in Nigeria if they refrain from actions that also worsen their marginalization by the Federal government of Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking with Vanguard in an interview in his house in Otolo Nnewi, Anambra State, Chief Uzodike also said that Igbo do not depend on government for their sustenance, survival and upkeep, adding that government is more or less a hindrance than a help to Ndigbo and the Igbo\u2019s should bear that in mind and live above their feeling of obvious marginalization to better their situation in Nigeria.\n\nChief Uzodike who also pointed out some cases where Igbo\u2019s have in spite of their obvious marginalization by the Federal government of Nigeria, shot themselves on the legs, appealed to those who are behind the insecurity in South East and those still enforcing the Indigenous People of Biafra IPOB\u2019s suspended Monday weekly sit-at-home to halt their action because it is against Ndigbo and amounts to another shooting themselves on the legs.\n\nHe said that while it is clear that the Federal government of Nigeria has continued the obvious marginalization of Ndigbo in Nigeria, the Igbo\u2019s should be blamed for some actions that have worsened their marginalization because of the selfishness of the present and past leaders whose only target is the largesse from Federal government.\n\nWhile totally accepting that the cause the IPOB is agitating for is right and cannot be faulted, he said that the pro-Biafra group should review their current style of civil disobedience because rather than hurting the Federal government who is their target, it is rather hurting the Igbo\u2019s and worsening their obvious marginalization in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWhat Ndigbo should be doing now in Nigeria is to capitalize on what is happening in the North to better their situation, the current Nigerian situation would have been a fantastic opportunity for the Igbo race to move forward, the North has been unified all along but they are in disorder now, it would have been a nice opportunity if we are unified to get many things to our advantage and move a lot of the marginalization out of us but instead we are shooting ourselves on the legs.\n\nAlthough the cause IPOB is fighting for is right but the action they are taking will worsen the situation Ndigbo already found themselves in Nigeria. This IPOB style of civil disobedience where South East is constantly locked down and people made to sit-at-home will worsen the situation of Ndigbo who are already marginalized.\n\n\u201cWe should however realize that in not just enough to tell the IPOB that their approach is wrong, leaders have to work out something that will work, it is lack of thinking and vision by Igbo leaders that the youths are doing what they are doing because of no good direction from elders.\n\n\u201cInstead of saying that we will secede from Nigeria, it is rather the other people that should be demanding for secession from us, what we should do is to define marginalization in concrete terms and seek redress from the Federal government.\n\n\u201cWhat IPOB and every person in South-East should be singing as a song is for us to be given our fair share from the federal government if they are federal appointment, infrastructure, allocation of admission in the Universities, military facilities, anything at all we demand our fair share otherwise we will not cooperate with Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe should equally set a system to prevent further marginalization which will include protection of any Igbo person anywhere found in Nigeria and in the world, not to tell people who by dent of hard work have made some form of success out of their life to sit-at-home on Mondays and any other day. Anybody who is attacking that Igbos means of livelihood, ostensibly is fighting the rest of the people and it is very wrong.\n\n\u201cSo whether it is IPOB or any other group that is ordering people to sit-at-home on Mondays, the most important workday, they should rethink because it is not in the interest of Ndigbo, we know to be hardworking and do not depend on government for our sustenance, survival and upkeep, in fact, the government is more of a hindrance to Igbo\u2019s than help.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".\n\n\u2013 As Hospitals in Zaria cry for inadequate space, doctors\n\nBy Ibrahim Hassan-Wuyo\n\nHospitals in Zaria, Kaduna State have appealed to the relevant authorities to provide them with more staff so as to cater for the increasing health care needs of community members.\n\nThis is coming as the Kaduna Contributory Health Management Authority (KADCHMA) announced that 521,096 persons in the state have enrolled in the health insurance scheme.\n\nSpeaking to a team of experts that comprised of Health workers and journalists from the State Media Working Group of Save the Children International led by Dr Joseph Natsa in Zaria at the weekend, on a visit to Major Ibrahim Abdullahi memorial hospital Sabon Gari Zaria (MIBA hospital Zaria), on arrival at the hospital the group met with the hospital matron, Hadiza Abubakar. who made an appraisal of their activities, problems and prospects as regards the Universal Health Coverage.\n\nShe said after the consultation, a patient goes to the pharmacy and get the free drugs available. But if the free drugs are not available, they write for the patient to buy.\n\nShe said they get a very big turn out of clients because the hospital is strategically located.\n\nShe, however, complained of a lack of enough space in the hospital.\n\nShe said the hospital has not had enough bed space as they have only 27 beds for both adults and paediatrics.\n\nAccording to her, when the hospital is full, they have to refer to Gambo Sawaba General Hospital in Zaria, because it won\u2019t be fair to ask patients to go home. She said they also refer emergency cases, to the big hospitals.\n\nDr Natsa explained the basics about the Health Care Provision Fund, maintaining that since the team was not on a fault-finding mission but to fill the knowledge gap, it was part of its mandate to educate her and other members of the public on the importance of going to the hospital.\n\nHe took time to explain to her in the Hausa language, at the end of which she expressed with delight that she now knew about the Basic Health Care Provision Fund, and other related information.\n\nAmong the issues that were explained to her included among others: Basic Health Care Provision Fund which is all about money earmarked by the Federal Government, the consolidated revenue, which is subsequently disbursed to states, the remaining money that remained at the Federal level, one per cent is shared to the states, Kaduna inclusive, for the citizens to benefit from the fund\n\nHe also explained to her about NHIS and KADCHAM., etc.\n\nHe told her that the Kaduna State Government has on its own, take one per cent of its consolidated fund, which is geared to the provision of health care for the vulnerable, poor population.\n\nThe Matron later took the team to the section where outpatients were awaiting medical attention.\n\nSome patients, two males and two females were interviewed by the Journalists in the team,a summary of the entire interview was that the 4 patients interviewed lacked knowledge of the innovations, provision and methods of accessing these windows in both the Federal and state supra ministerial health concerns.\n\nDr Anthony Hycienth, the Medical Director of the hospital, said the hospital lacked enough space, while the building project to provide enough space in the hospital is stalled, the project stopped in May 2021.\n\nAccording to him, the hospital has only 4 doctors.\n\nThe team from Save the Children, therefore, recommended to the government, to create space and infrastructure in the hospital due to the strategic location of the secondary health facility (SHF).\n\nAlso, the need to sensitize the health workers at the SHF on the Kaduna state contributory health scheme (KSCHS)/BHCPF.\n\n\u201cThe SHF although they\u2019ve been accredited as a primary service provider, they are yet to get enrollees for both KSCHS/BHCPF, however they have lived for NHIS.\n\nEarlier, Abubakar Saidu, KADCHMA\u2019s Formal Sector Team Lead, who spoke at a two-day Biannual Review Meeting of Media Working Group, organised by Save the Children International, in Zaria, said 383,513 persons had been enrolled under the formal sector; 4,523 under the informal sector, while 79,239 vulnerable population accessed free healthcare services under the scheme.\n\nAccording to him, 8,292 were captured under the Tertiary Students Health Insurance Programme and 45,529 under the Basic Health Care Provision Fund (BHCPF).\n\nHe said all the enrollees are accessing the Basic Minimum Package of Health Services as defined by the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS).\n\n\u201d The state\u2019s contributory health insurance scheme is designed to provide access to quality, affordable and equitable healthcare services to all residents of the state without financial barriers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) towards improving the poor health indices in the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cKADCHMA began the provision of healthcare services to the enrollees since June 2020, to reduce out of pocket spending on healthcare to the barest minimum.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis, in the long run, will reduce poverty arising from catastrophic and impoverishing health spending.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnrollees under the formal public sector make three per cent premium contribution deducted from their salaries,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that for the informal and organised private sector, the premium contribution for individuals was N10,650 while a household with a maximum of six members paid N57,990 per annum.\n\nHe said for the 45,529 enrollees under the BHCPF, every state provides 25 per cent counterpart fund of the total requirements for coverage of the defined population-based on enrolled beneficiaries in the state.\n\n\u201cThe NHIS will then provide the complementary 75 per cent from the BHCPF to the state based on the defined benefit package.\n\n\u201cAlso, about 80 per cent of the 79,239 vulnerable population and 45,529 enrolled under the BHCPF, were selected from the Social Register of the poor and vulnerable households in the state.\n\n\u201cWhile the state government expends N10,650 on each of the 79,239 poor population, amounting to N843.89 million annually.\n\n\u201cAnd N575.9 million was expended on 45,529 poor and vulnerable persons under the BHCPF at N12,650 per person,\u201d he said.\n\nJoseph Jockshan, BHCPF Focal Person, Kaduna State Primary Health Care Development Board, said the BHCPF was established under Section 11 of the National Health Act, 2014.\n\nHe said that N152.9 million was disbursed to 254 Primary Healthcare Centres across the state under the healthcare provision fund in the first and second quarter of 2021, adding that each of the benefiting facilities received N601,500.\n\nThe State Media Working Group of Save the Children International, planned to take its advocacy to the government and other critical stakeholders in the health sector, to draw attention to the improvement of Primary Health Care facilities, SHF and others in the state.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Pastor Paul no worry even God asked us not to sit in the seat of the scornful.\u201d\n\n@Islimfit \u201c The people at #TheExperience2021 switched from Jesu to esu.

Who ordered the shootings?\n\n@WinieIguwa \u201c Pastor Paul said the Behavior was unscriptural. Pastor, the way this government has treated us is unbiblical and unscriptural too.\n\nWe shall pray for our leaders but Omo, people are tired.\u201d\n\n@Barnie \u201c They are booing Sanwolu as his aide represents him at the #TheExperience2021. The booing even got louder when he is quoting a scripture! Fantastic, the people are not happy with Lagos state leadership and the handwriting is clear!\u201d\n\n@CitizenOla \u201cI love the attitude of Nigerians against Sanwo-Olu and his representative in the ongoing #TheExperience2021. It\u2019s why the murderer won\u2019t show up at the event in person.We must keep bullying these vagabonds in power until sense is restored to our leadership roles.\u201d\n\n@Tochukwu \u201c It would have been worse, if the governor came himself.Sorry Pastor Paul,but the people are tired.\u201d\n\nVIDEO;\n\n\u2014",

          "text": "Less than three weeks after the former Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice in Ogun State, Akingbolahan Adeniran, left the cabinet of Governor Dapo Abiodun, another appointee has resigned.\n\nDAILY POST reports that a former Speaker of the Ogun State House of Assembly from 1999 to 2003, Hon. Muyiwa Oladipo, resigned his position as a Consultant to Gov Abiodun on Thursday.\n\nIn a letter dated December 2, 2021, and addressed to Abiodun through the Secretary to the State Government, Oladipo said his resignation was with immediate effect.\n\nWhile thanking the Governor for the opportunity given to him to serve Ogun State once again, the former Commissioner said, \u201cmay we not STUMBLE.\u201d\n\nThe letter titled, \u201cResignation as Consultant to the Governor\u201d, read: \u201cI refer to your letter Ref no SSG/ADM. 162 vol 1/50 and dated 4th February 2020 wherein I was appointed Consultant to the Governor.\n\n\u201cI hereby tender my RESIGNATION as Consultant with immediate effect.\n\n\u201cI further thank you for the opportunity given me to continue in the service of Ogun State which I started way back in 1999 as the Speaker of the State House of Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe good Lord will continually guide us aright, may we not STUMBLE.\u201d\n\nLike the former Attorney General, Oladipo, who is also a legal practitioner, did not state the reason for his resignation.\n\nHowever, our correspondent reliably gathered that the erstwhile Speaker had retraced his step back to the former Governor Ibikunle Amosun camp of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the State.\n\nAfter serving as the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs from 2011 to 2015 and as the Commissioner for Culture and Tourism from 2015 to 2019 under the Amosun administration, Oladipo left for the Abiodun group in the heat of the controversies that characterised the 2019 governorship election in Ogun.\n\nThe two-time Commissioner was made a Consultant by Abiodun almost two years into his government.\n\nBefore turning in his resignation letter, Oladipo had recently met with leaders of the Amosun group in Sagamu Local Government, declaring his loyalty to the Ogun Central Senator.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with newsmen, Oladipo said he had the right to resign and move on with his life.\n\nHis words: \u201cAt a point in life, you get to a stage when you will decide to move on with your life. So, I decided to do that. Don\u2019t forget that I was once a Speaker, later I became a two-term Commissioner and also he (Abiodun) appointed me as a Consultant. I consulted for him for about two years and I believe it is time for me to move on. I needed to move on with my life. I must move on with my life. It\u2019s a personal decision. Don\u2019t I have the right to do that?\n\n\u201cAs for the \u2018may we not STUMBLE\u2019 in that letter, when you walk and look straight, you will not stumble; when you walk and look down, you may stumble. Along the line, maybe anybody can read different meaning to it. The truth is that you may see people around you that will advise you positively or negatively. Whichever advise they give you may allow you stumble or the other way around. So, many people can read different meaning to it. I am a philosopher, a barrister and an historian as well.\u201d\n\nOn whether he left because he did not get a juicy appointment in Abiodun\u2019s government, the politician retorted: \u201cIn the executive, what position could be higher than a Commissioner after Governor and Deputy Governor? I was a Commissioner for eight years, so I needed not to be a Commissioner. It is the governor\u2019s absolute right to appoint SSG and Chief of Staff. So, why should I leave? If I was after any of those posts at all, I would not have taken the (Consultant) appointment in the first instance. You know, at a time like this, many people will be coming up with different things. But I am not perturbed.

          "title": "Sanwo-Olu: White Paper more than walk in the park",
          "text": "Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has been in the news all week long. He is currently front and centre of a discourse that traverses the length and breadth of the country; the #EndSARS protest of October 2020. On that day, a little over a year ago, the country experienced one of its largest protests in history as youths and other aggrieved Nigerians rose in unison against the now-disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) unit of the force in particular and police brutality in general.\n\nBefore the widespread protest, SARS operatives had become renowned for high handedness, massive human rights abuses and extrajudicial killings. Thus, majority of Nigerians nodded in agreement with the protest when it started on a peaceful note.\n\nSadly, it was to end on a bloody note on the evening of October 20, 2020, when military men marched on the Lekki toll gate to enforce a curfew ordered by the Lagos State government following the breakdown of law and order in some parts of the state after it appeared the peaceful protest had been hijacked by hoodlums and other undesirable elements.\n\nFrom that point, reports of alleged shooting and killing of some of the protesters by the soldiers stoked tensions, leading to a night of unparalled violence visited on public assets.\n\nSanwoolu had earlier visited the same Lekki toll gate to express solidarity with the protest.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAmidst the controversy generated by the allegation of a massacre at Lekki toll gate, the governor displayed his willingness to allow for constructive criticism and debate when he instituted a judicial panel of inquiry to, among other things, unravel what transpired on the night of October 20, 2020 in Lagos.\n\nThe panel under the leadership of retired Justice Doris Okuwobi, after more than a year of sitting, last week submitted its report to the governor. Sanwoolu commended the panel and immediately set up a four-man committee to produce the White Paper of the report for the state to act on.\n\nThis committee chaired by Moyosore Onigbanjo, the state\u2019s Commissioner for Justice, got a 14-day deadline to conclude its assignment.\n\nBut if Sanwoolu expected a solemn wait for the White Paper by all and sundry, he was soon disappointed as it turned out that the panel\u2019s report had been leaked and soon those supporting the claims of a massacre and those in opposition were up in arms against each other.\n\nThe report had through its declarations and recommendations, according to the leaked report, confirmed that a massacre did occur at Lekki last year and the pro-massacre group was feeling justified and vindicated. They spared no one in the vitriolic attacks and name calling that ensued afterwards.\n\nOf course, Sanwoolu, the man who instituted the panel, was the most vilified. Not to be outdone, the anti-massacre group was reacting with almost the same venom too. They had gone through the leaked report and were convinced the discrepancies and contradictions therein were enough to prove that the panel did a shoddy job.\n\nAnd as the wait for the White Paper continued, there were fears that the fierce exchanges could ignite a fresh fire in Lagos. But in the midst of it all, the governor kept his calm and when it was even insinuated that he had no plans to come up with a White Paper, he emerged to once again promise to allow for justice and reconciliation as far as the matter being discussed is concerned.\n\nSoon, November 29, 2021, the end of the 14 days deadline came and Onigbanjo submitted the document on behalf of his committee. The governor had kept to his word.\n\nBut the government would reject some key recommendations of the panel\u2019s report, especially the one that bordered on shootings at Lekki Tollgate by security agents.\n\nRather than end the discourse, a fresh round of controversy erupted. Again, Sanwoolu was at the centre of the crossfire. While some legal practitioners and Civil Society Organisations, faulted the state government\u2019s White Paper, saying it was insensitive, others threw their weight behind the same document and praised the government for seeking genuine justice and reconciliation in its approach to the matter.\n\nEbun-Olu Adegboruwa, (SAN), a member of the Lagos EndSARS Panel, said it was full of inaccuracies, cover-ups and inconsistencies. \u201cFor the records, the Panel relied upon the evidence of witnesses, documents tendered before it and the goodwill of the people of Nigeria, throughout its assignment. It is painful for me and the Panel that the government is creating the wrong impression of financial impropriety as a tool of distraction when the Panel had a Secretariat that managed all its funds, through the Ministry of Justice. At the appropriate time, we will respond to all the inaccuracies, the cover-ups and the inconsistencies contained in the White Papers released by the government,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking, former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Chief Bode George said: \u201cGovernor Sanwo-Olu\u2019s White Paper on the report of the EndSARS Panel is outlandish, defeatist, insensitive, lacking the basic tenet of accountability and decency which ought to have guided such sensitive issue as the Lekki tragedy. His response is without justice or fairness. It is at best plastic and gestural, devoid of genuine human concern and sincere leadership. The Lagos state government stands indicted for the unfortunate incident.\n\nBut Onigbanjo insisted that there were many contradictions in the report of the judicial panel saying the white paper addressed such issues. Also throwing his weight behind the White Paper, counsel to Lagos State Government, Abiodun Owonikoko praised the White paper saying it mitigated the weakness of the original report. Owonikoko said: \u201cThe White Paper cannot but be controversial even with the obvious pain taken by the government to provide context to it. It is, however, noteworthy that only one recommendation out of the 32 in the JPI report was rejected outrightly. It is unprecedented in many respects; starting from public acceptance of the independence and non-interference in the work of the panel.\n\nSimilarly, the Federal Government threw its weight behind the white paper, promising to take further actions. The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, (SAN), said: \u201cIt all depends on the perspective you look at it and the prevailing laws that are in contexts. When you talk about laws that are exclusively applicable to the federation and context of the actual situation, it is not out of place to arrive at a conclusion. What you make out of it is a function of the applicable laws. What I am saying is not a general statement but about the factual situation of applicability and enforceability.\u201d\n\nUndeterred by the harsh criticisms hauled at him by those who disagreed with the White Paper, the governor called for peace and announced his desire to have the people of Lagos walk with him for peace. He called on some of his harshest critics, naming them one by one in a state address and pleaded with them to join him in the walk meant to headline his call for peace.\n\nBut his olive branch was not only rejected by some of these celebrities. He was mocked by them as they vowed to ensure that he \u2018walks alone\u2019 in his quest for peace.\n\nAgain Sanwoolu was called names and dragged by those who will not agree with his handling of the panel\u2019s report. Musician Folarin Falana (Falz) and comedian Debo Adebayo (Mr. Marcaroni) among others rejected the invitation to a peace walk for \u201cthe healing of Lagos.\u201d\n\nMr. Marcaroni said genuine peacemaking should begin by first implementing the recommendations of the panel. Falz, on his part, described the \u2018walk of peace\u2019 as a joke and a very disrespectful one at that.\n\nBut Sanwoolu\u2019s supporters and other Lagosians, rose to his defence and groups after groups pledged to join him in his walk for peace. Segun Awosanya popularly known as Segalink said Sanwo-Olu has shown leadership with his mature response to the current controversy. He opted to join the walk for peace.\n\nStudents across the state also vowed to support the governor\u2019s peace initiative by partaking in the walk. Youths across the state, under the auspice of the National Youth Council of Nigeria, (NYCN) will also be participating in the walk. Several other organizations and groups have signed in to be part of the walk and it is now looking as if Sanwoolu will have the last laugh after all.\n\nWhile his government\u2019s handling of the October 20, 2020 protest and its aftermath continue to generate mixed reactions, one thing his friends and foes appear to be in agreement over is that Sanwo-Olu has exhibited immense maturity, calmness and gentlemanliness in the midst of all the storms he waded through since that fateful day a year ago.\n\nHowever, it is left to be seen how much peace his planned walk will fetch the state as the debate over the matter remains heated up till now.",

          "text": "By Yusuf Alli, Managing Editor, Northern Operation, Frank Ikpefan and Tony Akowe, Abuja\n\nDon\u2019t allow governors desecrate Nigerian constitution, former ACF scribe tells President\n\nCSO\u2019s: Why Buhari must assent to bill\n\nNASS may not increase INEC budget for primaries\n\nFollowing the dust being raised over the new Electoral Act now awaiting the assent of President Muhammadu Buhari, the Presidency said yesterday that the No.1 citizen was still consulting widely on whether or not to give his nod to the amended law.\n\nAso Rock Villa said there was nothing to worry about concerning the President\u2019s assent.\n\nSome civil societies joined in making a case for Buhari to waste no further time in signing the bill into law while a former Secretary General of the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Mr. Anthony Sani, said the President should ignore the opposition of state governors to the bill and do the needful immediately.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe President has up till December 19th to append or decline his signature to the bill.\n\nHis Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu,exclusively responding to an enquiry from The Nation clarified that the President has not declined assent to the electoral law.\n\n\u201cThere is no truth in the story that President Muhammadu Buhari has declined signature on the bill,\u201d Shehu said.\n\nContinuing, he said:\u201d He has not taken a decision yet. The President is widely consulting.\n\n\u201cI believe there is nothing to worry about. There is still time. I believe he still has up to December 19th or thereabouts.\u201d\n\nFormer ACF scribe: Governors should not be allowed to desecrate constitution\n\nFormer Secretary General of the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Anthony Sani,added his voice to the controversy sparked by the bill.\n\nHe asked President Muhammadu Buhari to stop the state governors from alleged desecration of the constitution.\n\nSani in a statement in Abuja said President Buhari should not bow to pressure from the governors not to sign the electoral bill.\n\nThe governors are especially against the recommendation of direct primary as the mode of picking candidates by the parties for elective offices.\n\nThe ex-ACF secretary described pressure from the governors on the President not to sign the bill as self- serving and not in the interest of democracy and the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cWhen people emphasize the notion that the state governors can upturn what the National Assembly has duly passed, they ignore the impression being conveyed that such a course of action cuts across the grain of our constitution which places responsibility for law making on the legislators,\u201d Sani said.\n\nHe added:\u201dOur governors should not be allowed to desecrate our constitution by acting as the de facto National Assembly.\n\n\u201cSo far, the argument by the governors against direct primary is rather very weak and self- serving while that in favour of direct primary that makes it possible for all political party members to participate in the choice of their party candidates for elections, thereby eviscerating the roles of money bags (plutocracy), corrupt practices of buying delegates (kleptocracy) and imposition of candidates leading to improvement of internal democracy, is much stronger and more democratic.\n\n\u201cIndirect primary confers undue advantage on incumbent governors who can manipulate delegates that include super delegates. Hence, the prevalent incidence of parallel congresses in many states. Direct primary would stop all that through involvement of all party members.\n\n\u201cAs regards the costs of direct primary bandied about to scare Mr President from assenting the Electoral Amendment Bill, one wonders the wisdom. This is because direct primary is often at the level of polling units or at ward level where INEC staff are expected to witness.\n\n\u201cAny other level-be it State Assembly, House of Representatives, Senate or Governor constituencies are matters of collation. So, where is the humongous cost of direct primary coming from?\n\n\u201cWe therefore appeal to Mr. President not to pander to the demand of the governors that is spurred not by desire to improve our practices of democracy but by a crass sense of narcissism. The President should assent the Bill for the larger interest of multiparty democracy and, thus, for national interest.\u201d\n\nCivil societies to Buhari: Sign Electoral Bill into law\n\nSeveral Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) have asked President Muhammadu Buhari to sign the contentious Electoral Act Amendment Bill before him into law.\n\nThe bill, according to the CSOs, contains specific provisions aimed at enhancing the quality and credibility of elections and address certain lacunas in the existing electoral legal framework.\n\nThe civil societies include: Yiaga Africa, International Press Centre (IPC), Centre for Citizens with Disability (CCD), Albino Foundation, CLEEN Foundation, Institute for Media and Society (IMS), Nigerian Women Trust Fund (NWTF) and Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ).\n\nThey were of the opinion that the bill would not only encourage increased citizens\u2019 participation in the electoral process, but will also enhance the capacity of the democratic institutions to improve the transparency and legitimacy of electoral outcomes.\n\nBesides, they said the timely assent to the bill would facilitate early preparations and efficient election administration of the 2023 general election, which is just 443 days away.\n\nBut they said that in the event of the President declining to sign the bill, the National Assembly should invoke its power by passing it into law as stipulated by the Constitution.\n\nThe CSOs said: \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari must continue to pursue and honour his commitment to bequeath to Nigerians an electoral system that guarantees the conduct of credible, inclusive and peaceful elections.\n\n\u201cFurther amendments to the Electoral Bill 2021 by the National Assembly should be undertaken in the next electoral cycle based on real and perceived lacuna identified in the implementation of the current Bill.\u201d\n\nExecutive Director of Centre for Citizens and Disability, David Anyaele, said it was wrong for President Buhari to delay in assenting to a bill designed to encourage increased citizens\u2019 participation in the electoral process just to please a small group of people that do not mean well for the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe lawmakers were democratically elected to represent their people and they have prepared the bill in line with the yearnings and aspirations of their people. They must stand and defend the wish of the people who elected them into offices by vetoing the President should he return the bill to the house without assent.\u201d\n\nExecutive Director of Yiaga Africa, Samson Itodo, said the civil societies were in support of the President\u2019s decision to invite comments from relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies of government on the Bill, saying input from Chairman of INEC, Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Minister of the Interior, Minister of Finance and the Inspector General of the Police are probably the most crucial.\n\nThe National Assembly had transmitted the Bill to the President on November 19, following its passage.\n\nThe President has until December 19 to either sign or decline assent.\n\nThe Nation had earlier reported how senators and House of Representatives members had come under pressure from governors to review the Electoral Act and retain the indirect primary.\n\nIt was also learnt that the Presidency might seek a review of the Act, if the pressure persisted.\n\nNASS may not increase INEC\u2019s 2022 budget\n\nThe Nation also gathered that the National Assembly may not increase the 2022 budget of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to monitor direct primary.\n\nIt was learnt that some senators and members of the House of Representatives agreed yesterday that there was no basis for additional funds for INEC for indirect and direct primaries.\n\nA Senator, who attended a caucus meeting, said: \u201cAt our session, we looked at the provisions of the new Electoral Act again. There is no provision mandating INEC to conduct either Direct Primary.\n\n\u201cIt is the business of each party to conduct its primary. INEC\u2019s responsibility is to monitor compliance with the Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t understand where this issue of additional N500billion came from. This is why the House of Representatives has invited the Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that we believe INEC can monitor either direct or indirect primary with its 2022 budget. We resolved that there is no basis for increasing INEC\u2019s budget.\u201d",

          "title": "2023: S\u2019West APC govs begin consultations",
          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nAhead of the 2023 presidential poll, governors on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and some other leaders in the Nigeria\u2019s South West have begun critical consultations for the zone to produce President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s successor. Impeccable sources mentioned five of the six governors in the zone that have authorised their close aides to move round the Yorubaland and Nigeria to ensure that the 2023 presidency comes to the South West.\n\nThe five governors are Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, Gboyega Oyetola, Osun State, Rotimi Akeredolu, Ondo State and Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nGovernor Seyi Makinde might not have been part of the meeting since he belongs to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nAlready, National Leader of APC and former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as well as the Chairman of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) and Ekiti State governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, are strongly believed to be eyeing the number one political office in 2023.\n\nThough the trio have not come out to make definite statements that they want to run for president, their supporters have, however, made clarion calls to them at different times to openly declare their ambition to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. Some have even gone ahead to print and paste posters for the three of them.\n\nA meeting was held in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital earlier in the week to perfect strategies to actualise two major items \u2013 that the president must come from the South West in 2023, and to know the acceptable person that the Yoruba would present for the office. The meeting was held under the aegis of Next Level Consolidation Forum, being chaired by a frontline politician, Chief Oladipo Oladosu.\n\nThere were representatives of the governors of the six South-West states as well as other dignitaries at the meeting. Attendees include Mr. Adekunle Olayinka, an engineer and Special Adviser to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State on Development Agenda for Western Nigeria (DAWN); Victor Kolade, Special Adviser to the Ekiti State governor on Social Investment Programmes (SIP); and Adesina Popoola, Senior Special Assistant to Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State. Chief Oladipo Oladosu stood for Osun at the meeting, while Ondo and Oyo were also represented.\n\nThe forum concluded that with the level of academic, economic, social and political prowess that Yorubaland has produced, it would not be fair for the race to present only one person for the job. They added that more people that have interest for the 2023 presidency in the zone should come out and join the presidential race.\n\nOladosu contended that Nigeria would cease to exist if the presidential power failed to rotate to the South-West, saying: \u201cIt is not a threat. It is going to happen.\u201d\n\nBut the SSA to Governor Dapo Abiodun, Adesina Popoola, said: \u201cWe are here because of Yoruba presidential agenda. All of us are here for a purpose and for good precedence in 2023. What we are clamouring to do is that we don\u2019t want this to go to the North, or South East. We want it to go to South-West.\n\n\u201cThe present president is from the North. All of us want this to come to the South and for Yoruba as a whole. We are not talking about the East now. We are talking about South West. If we bring it home, the Yoruba agenda, we can say this is the person we have all agreed on to be the next president in 2023. The agenda is just a small thing. We need somebody that can change Nigeria. We need a good leader at the presidency in 2023, to turn around the country positively. We are here for one agenda, which is we want Yoruba to be president of Nigeria in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe have not mentioned anybody now. But we know some people will knock on the door and we will know the person. We will open the door for him when the time comes. We are here to support Yoruba. We need the cooperation of all the Yoruba. We knew what happened to Chief Obafemi Awolowo and Chief MKO Abiola when they wanted to become president of this country. Now, we want all Yoruba to speak with one voice. Then, it will be difficult for enemies to divide us.\u201d\n\nSpecial Adviser to the Ekiti State Governor on Social Investment Programmes (SIP), Victor Kolade, said also lent his voice to the discourse. According to him, \u201cWe are here today for the future of everybody, and our children, and the future of everything that concerns us. In the last eight years, APC has been in the saddle and we are looking for a better leadership and we hope, we know and we pray that APC from South West will provide that better leadership.\n\n\u201cOur aims and objectives are to make sure, first of all, that every other part of Nigeria concedes the presidency to the South West. That is what we have to work upon, and we are doing that already. I pray that we will be able to accomplish that.\n\n\u201cIf we do that, that is 50 per cent success. Then, the next thing we have to do is, how do we go about it? We are all party men; we know how the party machineries work. We know that your vote, your decision is in the ward level, even they are in the units. So, we have to work. If you have a friend in the North and you have political associates in any part of Nigeria, we have to work together to make sure that a favourable candidate emerges from the South West during the national convention.\n\n\u201cIf we are interested in a particular candidate among those people that showed interest in the South West, we have to work towards it, so that we just don\u2019t assume. At the end of the day, the Northerners preferred to anoint a candidate for us. It has happened once. It has happened several times in the past. If we have anything against that, if we don\u2019t want that, we had to work. But thank God, we are back at the blocs again, and we are hoping for a South Western presidency.\u201d\n\nSpecial Adviser to Lagos State Governor on Development Agenda for Western Nigeria (DAWN), which is South West Affairs, Adekunle Olayinka, also observed: \u201cOf course, it is part of my portfolio to make sure that the South West is rock solid, not only in infrastructural development and socio-economic, and all the stuff, but in politics also. That is why we try to ensure that it is not negotiable, as far as we are concerned, that presidency comes to the South West. We have been doing a lot of programmes in that respect.\n\n\u201cWe have gone all over the South-West. We have met the likes of Chief Bisi Akande, our governors, and other leaders. We have sold the idea to them that it is not negotiable, that in their meetings and conversations with other governors throughout the country, that the presidency for South West Nigeria is non-negotiable. I think everyone understands now.\n\n\u201cSo, we are here in Ibadan to have a meeting, whereby our structures will be formalised. Apart form the national structure that has been working all over Nigeria, we want to ensure that our structures are formalised from the ward level to the local government, to the zone, so that we can all put our thoughts together, and put all our resources together to ensuring that we produce a president that will come from the South West.\n\n\u201cWhy? We have the capability. We have the technical know-how. We have economic power. We have the intellectual know-how. So, we believe that no other region, especially now, is better than us producing the presidency.\n\nWe are going to work and ensure that all our youth are energised and they are energised already. They are waiting for our leaders to come out and proclaim that they are running. All we are doing now is consultation and all the stuff, encouraging more of our leaders to even come out. The better the soup, the better the taste becomes.\n\n\u201cI want to foresee in the next couple of weeks that other leaders that have not even proclaimed that they want to contest would come out. Then, we can now say this is the best among them. I don\u2019t think we are going to have any problem in selecting one of our leaders to become our president, and it has to come from South West.\u201d\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "text": "From Ogbonnaya Ndukwe, Aba and Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nIuminary, Chief Mike Ahamba, has advised those seeking political solution to the case of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, to look the way of the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami (SAN).\n\nThis is as Igbo Lawyers Association (ILA) has vowed to fight for and defend the fundamental rights of Kanu, who is currently facing trial over alleged sedition.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nAhamba said it was only the office of the Attorney General, after due diligence, that can approach a court to stop further prosecution in a matter.\n\nThe Senior Advocate of Nigeria said the denial of the detained IPOB leader from changing his clothes and exercising his rights while in the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS) were against the law.\n\nAn emergency court sitting on Wednesday had, among others things, ordered that Kanu be given maximum comfort possible in the detention facility, and also be allowed a change of clothing and free practice of his Jewish faith, including access to his Jewish religious materials.\n\nThe court further ordered that the DSS obey all previous orders granted in the matter, including allowing Kanu any visitor of his choice and that the IPOB leader be permitted, at his option, to mingle freely with other inmates or any other persons at the detention facility.\n\nReacting to the development, Ahamba noted that the AGF as well as the judge handling the case had all agreed on some fundamental issues.\n\nHe said that it was a fundamental right of any detainee in custody to be allowed to exercise certain rights that will not infringe on the final determination of the case for which he was being held, and called on Kanu\u2019s custodians to accord him same in line with the directives of the trial judge.\n\nHe, however, advised Igbo leaders seeking his release, to prepare well for a possible discussion with the Federal Government on what they will offer in return. \u201cThey have to be prepared to assure the government that there would be peace and the things that made for destruction of lives and properties in the South-East would not reoccur when he gets released.\n\n\u201cWe have suffered so much in this area due to the issues at stake. The question will be whether those asking for his immediate release will be prepared to urge him to drop the demands that are causing the problems in the South-East?\n\n\u201cThe President has no power to stop an ongoing matter in the court. Only the Attorney General of the Federation can approach a court to apply for \u201cnon prosecui\u201d, on being sure that such matter will not cause problem in future.\n\n\u201cWe must tell ourselves the truth on what is happening and ask ourselves what we will gain from them,\u201d he stated. He then urged Ndigbo to be wary of actions they take in order that such acts do not come back to haunt and destroy them in future.\n\nChairman of ILA, Chief Chuks Muoma (SAN) told Saturday Sun that Kanu had not committed any offence and should not be treated as a common criminal. He stressed that even the worst of suspected criminals are presumed innocent until proven otherwise. Mouma maintained that political solution remains the best option in solving the Kanu issue.\n\nBut the Igbo National Movement (INM) said the AGF\u2019s comment was not worth losing sleep over, just as it noted that Kanu\u2019s delayed trial would only strengthen the agitation for the Independent State of Biafra. National President of INM, Olisa Okolo said: \u201cThe AGF has put himself and the Federation in a tight corner. As we can see, they are unable to proceed with the trial due to the many delays which are inherent in the Nigerian legal system but with each delay, the calls for a political solution will grow stronger.\n\n\u201cWhat the AGF has succeeded in doing is to give Kanu a larger stage to keep the discussion going on his Biafran agitation and the general plight of Ndigbo. Each day the trial continues, the calls for self-determination grow stronger, and Ndigbo become ever more united. \u201cThe AGF is sadly out of his depth in political maneuvers and goes from one blunder to another. It is unlikely his advice will hold sway on a political solution. In due course, he must respect the will of the people.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Igbo National Congress (INC) has urged the Federal Government to, as a matter of urgency, grant amnesty to Kanu and make peace with the people of South-East. President of the group, Chilos Godsent, stated that the continued trial of Kanu, contrary to the views of the Attorney General, could only endanger the peace in the country.\n\nInsisting on political solution as the best option to solve the festering problem in the South-East, he demanded the unconditional release of Kanu, Yoruba Nation activist, Sunday Igboho and other political prisoners.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "text": "By Vincent Kalu\n\nPresident of Arewa Consultative Youth Movement and Convener Association of Northern Youth Groups, Mallam Kabiru Yusuf, has warned of the dangers of politicising the recent wellhead blowout and spillage incident involving the OML 29 Well 1 platform, Nembe, Bayelsa State, which is operated by Nigeria\u2019s largest indigenous oil firm, Aiteo Exploration and Production Company Limited (AEEPCO), a Joint Ventures project with the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nAccording to Yusuf, when on November 5, AEEPCO reported a major oil leak from its well, which was spewing oil into the immediate water bodies and contiguous communities and fumes in the air, Aiteo activated technical containment measures and quickly invited highly competent foreign based technical experts with experience of managing emergencies of this nature to help arrest the situation. The firm, he said, \u201chas since mobilised to ground zero and has fully deployed measures to contain the leak including an effective fast-track spill recovery programme.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\n\u201cIn addition to this, has been high level, community targeted measures that has been providing provide relief and health related support to those immediately affected.\u201d Yusuf noted that for some incomprehensible reasons, several forces have equally deployed their armaments to smear and damage not only the image of Aiteo, but also its quite considerable efforts. \u201cFrom peddling specious information that the spill has led to losses in excess off two million barrels, some have alleged that over 500,000 barrels were spilled, while some have suggested stupendous loss of some 200,000 barrels daily.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that the Director General/Chief Executive Officer, National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), Idris Musa, who spoke last week on a national TV show, said, \u201cit is absolutely wrong and preposterous for people to make false speculations over the oil spillage in Nembe communities of Bayelsa State.\u201d\n\nAccording to Yusuf, this attack is \u201ca disgracefully organised conspiracy to put down Aiteo. Despite efforts by Aiteo to professionally contain the spill in Nembe, some see this incident as an opportunity to attack the company. Some interests are even, curiously, putting out old spill videos to create a negative false impression of the extent incident. \u201cIt certainly cannot be overstressed that what is playing out appears like well-choreographed intrigue at work to undermine Aiteo and besmirch ongoing efforts to contain the leak and mitigate the impact on communities around the location of the well.\u201d\n\nHe accused the Bayelsa State governor Douye Diri of demonstrating a disturbing disposition towards this issue.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "Charles Mba, CEO, CDV Group at 50: Impacting people\u2019s lives",
          "text": "Chief Charles Ndubuisi Mba, (CEO) of CDV Group, is the brain behind CDV Properties & Development Ltd, a frontline real estate firm with properties spread across Nigeria. The construction magnate behind 34V Engineering Limited, Chief Mba hails from Orba in Udenu Local Government Area of Enugu State. An alumnus of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, where he studied Microbiology, he is a fellow of several professional bodies including Chartered Institute of Public Resources Management & Politics, Ghana (CIPRMP) and a member of Real Estate Developers Association of Nigeria (REDAN). Dr Mba is a notable philanthropist whose humanitarian acts and deeds have brought considerable succour to many. He has also won many awards and honours.\n\nIn this interview, Dr Mba, one of the biggest players in the real estate sector in Nigeria who marks his 50th birthday today, shares the heart-warming and exciting story of his life\u2019s journey, his philanthropic endeavours, why youths should stay away from drugs and what his greatest achievements in life are as he joins the club of quinquagenarians.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nYou have a deep passion for philanthropist, always putting smiles on people\u2019s faces and giving back to the society. What would you say actually motivated you to start doing that?\n\nYou see, where I grew up from, when we were growing up, I saw all those things that confronted people. I saw poverty. I saw intelligent people that couldn\u2019t go to school because their parents could not afford it. I saw smart kids that dropped out and today they are riding okada and Keke Marwa (commercial motorcycles and tricycles), not because they are not smart but because there is nobody to take care of them. I saw people that were held back in hospitals because they couldn\u2019t pay hospital bills. I saw all those things, so nobody needs to tell me that I need to go back and give to those kind of people those basic things that they need. It is always a nice feeling to give back to the society.\n\nWe started providing scholarships to qualified students to study professional courses in the university. We have a board whose duty is to conduct the interviews, verify the students and make sure the student is really worthy of the programme and is also willing and ready to go to school. Then we would give the person a scholarship and the company will be paying. At a time we had one terrible experience. That was about five years ago, when one of the beneficiaries got admission to study Medicine at the University of Nigeria, Enugu Campus. This guy\u2019s result was excellent. The guy enrolled for Medicine, we trained him first year, second year and third year. We didn\u2019t know the guy failed the second MB and dropped out of school. We were still paying and sending money to him. Eventually, one day, one of the classmates called me. I did not know how she got my number. She told me that this boy was no longer in school and that she noticed that the boy had been collecting money from me. I quickly called my coordinators and they went to his school and they verified. It was true; this guy was out of school for almost two years and we had been running bills on him for those two years, waiting for him to graduate and become a full-blown medical doctor. So that was how we stopped that payment.\n\nBut that notwithstanding, it did not make us change our attitude to others but now we have put a stiffer means of checking that kind of people. When we are training anyone anywhere, we put proper checks and balances to be sure that he or she is truly going to school and is still doing well in the school. So it gives me joy to see people go to school and come out because that is the first investment and first capital every human being needs. That is someone\u2019s first start-up capital. Once one has education, that knowledge makes the person versatile and he will excel once he is focused and committed.\n\nYou have just clocked 50 today. How does it feel to have attained the golden age?\n\nIt is great to be 50. Fifty, as they say, is the golden age. It is half time. Even in the Bible, 50 is golden. Attaining 50 means a lot of experience and a time that someone could say that he has reached enough and reasonable maturity in life. I feel great at 50. But at heart, I feel as if I am still 40 years. To me, I don\u2019t feel I am 50. My birth certificate is 50 years. When I reason, I reason more than 50 years old but when I act, you see me act like 40. God has granted me good health at 50; I don\u2019t have any kind of underlining ailment. I have no issues. So, I feel great to be 50.\n\nAt 50, would you say you are a fulfilled person?\n\nI feel fulfilled as a person. I am so grateful to God, first of all, for keeping me alive till 50. I have lost some friends; even at the age of 40, they died. I have lost close friends who didn\u2019t get to be 50. But for me, the most precious thing God has done to me is keeping me alive and healthy to attain 50 years, and I know He will continue keeping me to make 100 years. But at 50, I feel so fulfilled too. I have achieved a lot. I have done so well in my area of discipline, and even in other areas. God has been so kind to me and things have been working so perfectly well at 50.\n\nYou said you have recorded some achievements. Could you tell us some of these achievements?\n\nThe greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. So, achievements generally could not necessarily be achievements in terms of material things. There is a way I look at achievement; how many people have you impacted in life? How have you changed situations around you? These are where and areas I call achievements. We have been able to give scholarships to different people, especially indigent people. We have been able to train people who are graduates today, fending for themselves. Some are employed in our establishment, working for us and earning a living. These are civil engineers that went through reputable universities. We have been able to take care of people; the sick and the needy. We have also been able to provide amenities for our community. We have been able to do roads. As we speak, we are building a church. These are what I call achievements, not personal but helping people and the community. But in terms of growth, we have also done well. We have grown our company, CDV Property and Development Limited too. We have grown the company from scratch to where it is today. And by the grace of God, it is one of the outstanding building and real estate companies in Lagos. We have delivered a lot in the industry.\n\nWhat would be your advice to young people?\n\nMy advice for young people is to stay away from drugs. Drugs are ruining our kids of these days. Our younger generation should stay off drugs so that they would be normal and act like normal human beings. What I see on the streets now is horrible and if not properly checked, it might ruin the nation in general not only the immediate society. A lot of young kids are going into hard drugs.\n\nDo you think the drugs menace could have been triggered by frustration due to the state of the country\u2019s economy?\n\nIf the country is frustrating you, would you further frustrate yourself by going into drugs? It doesn\u2019t make sense for you to further frustrate yourself. You should try and find a way to come out of the frustration by yourself by being self-reliant and being focused on what you can do to bring a change. There is no job that doesn\u2019t give returns. Take for instance, you see a welder with nothing, but before you know it, he buys a car, buys land and builds a house because he is committed to his job and he is focused and he knows the job is steady, just like bricklayers and carpenters. Tilers come all the way from Cotonou; they come here and before they go they would buy cars and build houses for themselves in the country they come from, all that from what they make in Nigeria. But when you are on drugs, you can\u2019t do all these kind of technical works. So, I appeal to the youths of today to stay off drugs and be committed to whatever they are doing. Be focused and you would get whatever you wish.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "text": "FG refuses to restrict inbound travellers over Omicron, approves vaccine booster jabs\n\nPCR test now to be done 48hrs before departure\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Deji Elumoye, Onyebuchi Ezigbo and Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\nWith the global surge in COVID-19 and its new Omicron variant, President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday emphasised the urgent need for world leaders to work together and reinforce partnerships to limit the catastrophic consequences of the pandemic.\n\nSpeaking in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, during Nigeria\u2019s Day at Dubai Expo 2020, the President declared that the theme of the global event, \u201cConnecting Minds, Creating the Future\u201d, had placed a moral burden on all relevant stakeholders, across national boundaries, to urgently work together for a better and brighter future, by stemming COVID-19.\n\nOn the same day, amid the raging Omicron COVID-19 variant in Southern Africa and some other parts of the world, the federal government unveiled a revised COVID-19 protocol, without restricting inbound travellers from any country.\n\nBuhari, while addressing the global audience at Dubai Expo 2020, said: \u201cThe concerted efforts by world leaders, working together, enabled us to limit the catastrophic consequences of this pandemic.\n\n\u201cSuch level of continuing understanding and pragmatic partnership are needed and must be reinforced to ensure that our world is a better place that addresses humanity\u2019s common challenges to guarantee sustainable development and progress for the global community.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari told the distinguished audience that Nigeria, like other countries in the world, was impacted negatively by the COVID-19 pandemic, compounding national efforts in addressing insecurity, fighting corruption and diversifying the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nThe Nigerian leader noted that the present administration in Nigeria had registered significant progress within a short period of time \u201cand is still making headways\u201d in key sectors of the economy.\n\nHe said: \u201cTherefore, the Nigerian delegation is participating in this Expo with great prospects for positive outcomes, while assuring the world of our determination and readiness to partner with relevant investors in our bid to tackle a number of challenges to make Nigeria a better country.\n\n\u201cNigeria is participating in this epoch-making event in order to explore opportunities that are capable of unlocking the huge potentials that abound in our country, as it makes conscious efforts to be a strategic partner of choice for the global community.\n\n\u201cIt is my pleasure, therefore, to invite all participating countries, organisations and other private sector operators to take full advantage of opportunities being provided by the EXPO 2020, by linking up with the Nigerian team, to collaborate with us in diverse areas of interests for our mutual benefits.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari thanked Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), for inviting him to the Expo and especially to attend Nigeria\u2019s Day event, which offers a great opportunity to show-case the potential of Africa\u2019s largest economy.\n\nHe described Dubai Expo 2020 as the single most important global event of its kind to take place in the Middle East, Africa and the South East Asian regions in recent years.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to be a part of this dynamic evolution of pragmatic partnerships that are both creative and innovative for the progress of the country,\u201d the President said.\n\nFG Refuses to Restrict Inbound Travellers over Omicron\n\nNotwithstanding the raging Omicron COVID-19 variant in Southern Africa and some other parts of the world, the federal government yesterday unveiled a revised COVID-19 protocol, without restricting inbound travellers from any country.\n\nOmicron, identified as a \u201cvariant of concern\u201d, was recently detected by South African scientists.\n\nThe National Incident Manager of the presidential task force on COVID-19, Mukhtar Muhammad, had last Monday announced that the government would release a new travel protocol to prevent the Omicron COVID-19 variant from entering Nigeria.\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) later announced on Wednesday that three cases of Omicron had been detected in the country.\n\nIn the new Nigerian travel protocol dated December 1 and signed by Boss Mustapha, Chairman, Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19, all in-bound passengers arriving in Nigeria are expected to provide evidence of COVID-19 PCR test to be done within 48 hours before departure and post-arrival day two COVID-19 PCR test.\n\nAlso, all unvaccinated and partially vaccinated individuals are to observe self-isolation for seven days.\n\nIn addition, there will be day seven post-arrival exit PCR test for unvaccinated and partially vaccinated individuals.\n\nAll out-bound passengers are also required to provide either a valid evidence of full vaccination against COVID-19 or negative PCR test result within 48 hours from the time of boarding.\n\nMustapha, who is also the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, said the revised protocol \u201cis aimed at further reducing the risk of importation and exportation of COVID-19, especially the variants of concern.\u201d\n\nThe SGF added: \u201cThe review of the protocol is based on science, national experience, and global developments. The PSC assures Nigerians, that it shall continue to monitor global and specific country situations with a view to taking necessary measures to safeguard the health of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe PSC calls on all Nigerians to ensure that they have taken their full dose of COVID-19 vaccinations and to continue to observe compliance to public health social measures.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organisation said Omicron had been detected in at least 23 countries, including the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Denmark, Belgium, Botswana, Israel, Australia and Hong Kong.\n\nSeveral countries, including the UK, US and Germany have imposed travel restrictions on travellers from Southern Africa.\n\nLast Sunday, the Indonesian government said it would ban travellers from eight African countries, including Nigeria.\n\nFG Approves Booster Dose\n\nThe federal government has formally endorsed the administration of booster dose of the COVID19 vaccine for Nigerians.\n\nA statement by the Head, Public Relations Unit of the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA), Mohammad Ohitoto, said: \u201cThe Presidential Steering Committee, in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Health and the National Primary Health Care Development Agency has approved the administration of booster doses for persons that have completed two doses of AstraZeneca, Moderna, Pfizer Bio-N-Tech or 1 dose of Johnson and Johnson.\u201d\n\nHe said that there must be time interval of six months or more after receiving the second dose of AstraZeneca, Moderna or Pfizer Bio-N-Tech.\n\nHe also said that the time interval of two months or more after receiving the Johnson and Johnson vaccine should be observed before taking the booster dose.\n\n\u201cConsequent upon the above, eligible Nigerians are advised to visit the nearest health facility or mass vaccination site for their booster doses as from the 10th of December, 2021 across all states of the federation,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the DG, NPHCDA, Faisal Shuaib, a COVID-19 booster dose gives greater protection against the virus and urged all Nigerians to take advantage of the opportunity offered by the federal government.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

It is a city described as the Jewel of the Middle East where the best of Nigeria\u2019s fashion and entertainment have come out in full force to celebrate our great country on this day that marks Nigeria\u2019s Day at the Dubai Expo 2020.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to support this initiative and celebrate all our young people around Nigeria and the world. We are here to celebrate the birth of Nigerian culture as we unleash the power of youth for a new positive image for Nigeria. That\u2019s why we call on all young people to be law-abiding in whatever country they find themselves, to seek the power of their creativity and hard work to make the world a better place.\n\n\u201cThey must eschew violence, drugs, cultism, fraud and other criminality and use their God-given talent to build a new world order. At the same time, as a listening government, we will do all we can to ensure equity and justice for all Nigerians against all forms of brutality.\u201d\n\nHe added that his administration would continue to support youths through education, sports and sciences \u201cas we create the enabling environment for tech-driven investment-led telecommunications-enabled creative economy and prepare our nation for the emerging new world.\n\nThe President also underscored the potentials of the creative sector to unlock Nigeria\u2019s economy and increase employment opportunities for young people.\n\n\u201cThe projections are promising, as the sector is expected to be worth over USD10 billion by the end of 2021, making a significant contribution to the nation\u2019s GDP.\n\n\u201cThis is further underlined by a recent report on Nigeria\u2019s creative industry, which showed that the industry is positioned as the second largest employer and has the potential to produce 2.7 million new jobs by 2025.\u201d\n\nHe added that the achievement of the sector was one that filled him with pride as it demonstrates the grit determination and natural talent that exists in the Nigerian polity, and that it had the potential to become the hub for exporting Nigeria\u2019s culture.\n\nBuhari also praised Afro-fusion artistes, Burna Boy and Wizkid who won Grammy awards last year.\n\n\u201cWe salute all award-winning musicians bringing glory to Nigeria at the Grammys and other global events and urge them to continue to thrive\u2026We are at the cusp of a revolution in entertainment production, creative talent and services. And my desire is to build a brighter future for coming generations.\n\n\u201cThe ARISE Fashion Week is a great testament showing the world how we as Nigerians are working hard and constantly innovating to improve the lives of our youth and our people, while opening up our economy and encouraging foreign investment to ensure economic growth and progress for all citizens.\u201d\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele was also at the event and he reiterated the Bankers Committee\u2019s commitment to renovate the National Theatre in Lagos.\n\nHe further stressed that so far, about USD5 billion had been disbursed to support the creative industry initiatives in fashion, film, music and television.\n\nThe occasion saw the launch of ARISEPlay, the streaming platform from the THISDAY/ARISE Media Group dedicated to showing the best of African entertainment to the world.

          "text": "Our Correspondent\n\nA commanding officer and a senior officer in one of the battalions of operation Hadin Kai were killed when fighters of the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) attacked Rann, a town in Kala Balge LGA of Borno State on Thursday night.\n\nAbout 24 hours after the attack in Rann, Boko Haram also attacked Malam Fatori in Abadam Local Government Area, Borno State.\n\nNigerian troops killed 20 ISWAP fighters in battle at Rann. They were said to have engaged the terrorists who came in their numbers, and that the gunfight lasted many hours.\n\nThe two senior officers, whose names are yet to be released, were allegedly killed alongside five soldiers.\n\nA military intelligence source said the terrorists stormed Rann on several gun trucks.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThe terrorists could not subdue the gallant troops, during the crossfire. At the last count this morning, we recovered 24 of their dead bodies killed in the gun battle, while the rest fled with injuries.\n\n\u201cWe also recovered huge sophisticated weapons apart from their gun trucks that were completely destroyed by airstrikes.\u201d\n\nThe incident comes three weeks after ISWAP fighters killed Dzarma Zirkusu, a Brigadier General and commander of the army brigade in Chibok.\n\nZirkusu was on his way to Askira to provide support for the troops when he was ambushed and killed. The general was killed alongside three soldiers.\n\nMalam Fatori Also Attacked\n\nMeanwhile, Boko Haram also attacked Malam Fatori, Abadam Local Goverment Area, Borno State yesterday. This is coming less than 24 hours after the attack in Rann.\n\nAs at press time, the military was still battling to push the terrorists out of the town.\n\nMalam Fatori is one of the two LGAs without human activities, where Governor Babagana Zulum had insisted on returning displaced persons by December 31.\n\nThere were 500 mobile police personnel deployed to clear the town in preparation for the return of 1,000 refugees from Niger republic.\n\nThis is besides the army base stationed in the deserted town and other security agents, including the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps and Department of State Services and the civilian JTF that were posted there to help in securing the town for the safe return of the refugees.\n\nThe mobile police crack team has since abandoned the town and returned to Maiduguri, while the military personnel are still there.\n\nArmy spokesman, Onyema Nwachukwu was not immediately available to comment on the terror attacks in Rann and Malam Fatori.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "How MTN Wrongly Interpreted Nigerian Communications Act To Block Peoples Gazette Website As Directed By Buhari Regime",
          "text": "A telecommunications company in Nigeria, MTN, misinterpreted Section 146 of the Nigerian Communications Act 2003 in its explanations as to why it blocked its subscribers from accessing Peoples Gazette\u2019s website, based on written directives from President Muhammadu Buhari's government.\n\nThe company in response to a letter addressed to it by Effiong Inibehe, human rights lawyer and counsel for the online newspaper, claimed that Peoples Gazette ran foul of Section 146 of the Nigeria Communications Act, 2003 and the applicable terms and conditions of MTN\u2019s operating licenses.\n\nWhat MTN Nigeria Communications Plc relied on to block its subscribers from accessing the Peoples Gazette website is in Section 146 of the Act.\n\nMeanwhile, Section 146 \u2013 (1) says, \"A licensee shall use his best endeavour to prevent the network facilities that he owns or provides or the network service, applications service or content application service that he provides from being used in or in relation to the commission of any offence under any law in operation in Nigeria.\n\nSection 146 (2) says, \"A licensee shall upon written request by the commission or any other authority assist the Commission or any other authority as far as reasonably necessary in preventing the commission or attempted commission of an offence under any written law in operation in Nigeria or otherwise in enforcing the laws of Nigeria, including the protection of the public revenue and preservation of the national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what Section 146 they cited said. But no one has found Peoples Gazette guilty of committing any crime in Nigeria,\u201d a source told SaharaReporters.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the Peoples Gazette by MTN's lawyers, it was stated that the directive to block access to the site was pursuant to a directive from the Nigerian Communications Commission in January 2021.\n\nIt reads, \u201cWe acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 20 October 2021 requesting MTN Nigeria Communications Plc (MTNN) to lift the restrictions barring the website of People Gazette www.peoplesgazette.com from gaining access on the MTN Network.\n\n\u201cPlease be advised that the network access restriction for https://peoplesgazette.com is pursuant to the directives of the Nigerian Communications Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) dated 26 January 2021,\u201d the company\u2019s legal advisers said in a letter to The Gazette\u2019s lawyers this week.\n\n\u201cAs a responsible corporate organization, MTN complied with the said directive in line with both the provisions of section 146 of the Nigeria Communications Act, 2003 and the applicable terms and conditions of MTNN\u2019s operating licenses.\n\n\u201cWhile MTNN empathizes with the owners and management of the Peoples Gazette, it would be unable to unilaterally reverse or lift the restriction except by the directives of the Commission.\n\n\u201cMTNN, therefore, advise that the management of the Peoples Gazette should engage with the Commission for a resolution of this issue and issuance of the directives to reverse the restriction.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters recalls that in January, the Buhari-led Government shut down the platform of Peoples Gazette, denying its readers access to the website.\n\nThe platform said in a release that a vast majority of its web readers were denied access to its contents owing to a disruption influenced by the government.\n\nThe platform, launched in 2020, has been critical of the government\u2019s actions and policies, including its coverage of the #EndSARS protest, staged in October 2020 and the aftermath of the protest.\n\nIn a statement issued by its Managing Editor, Samuel Ogundipe, the media organisation alleged that the disruption was based on a directive from the Nigerian government to MTN, Glo Mobile and other telecom firms.\n\nOgundipe suspected the restriction may have been caused by a couple of reports the newspaper published.\n\nMTN and Glo have the two biggest mobile data subscriber bases with 78,754,855 and 52,573,907 connected lines respectively as at the end of the second quarter of 2020, figures released by the Nigerian Communications Commission showed.\n\nAirtel has 52,462,347 subscribers and 9mobile, in the fourth position, has 12,111,674 subscribers.\n\n\u201cWe have strong grounds to believe that it [the restriction] was deliberately based on the preliminary conclusion of webmasters,\u201d Ogundipe said.\n\nThe clampdown on Peoples Gazette\u2019s operations may not be unconnected to certain critical reports done by the platform recently exposing the corruption and power play in Aso Rock, Nigeria's seat of power.\n\n\u201cNigerian telecom firms have a history of acquiescing to repressive orders from state actors without recourse to the Nigerian Constitution, which is why we would not yield any resources to fight back against this through available civil authorities,\u201d Ogundipe said.\n\nExpectedly, Ogundipe said the restriction will stifle the newspaper of its readership and will \u201cleave our newspaper haemorrhaging crucial revenues from web traffic\u201d if it lingers.\n\nMeanwhile, the recent happening with a letter from the MTN management shows that the directive to block The Gazette\u2019s website which came on January 26 indicates prompt compliance with the NCC; without recourse to a fair hearing to the newspaper.\n\nThis is also in line with the conclusion of experts at the Swedish-based Qurium Foundation, whose forensic analysis had confirmed in February that The Gazette\u2019s website was blocked by Nigerian telecom operators.\n\nOgundipe stated, \u201cThis confirmation of NCC\u2019s arbitrary directive to telecom firms only marks the latest of several attempts that top elements of the Buhari regime have made to shut down our organisation for simply committing no other offence but journalism.\n\n\u201cWe have continued to keep records as different government agencies and enforcers implement devious plots, including military surveillance and smear campaigns, to rid the country of our public-interest journalism and perpetuate their corrupt and oppressive agenda.\u201d\n\nHe added that the NCC\u2019s framework as an industry regulator prohibits it from depriving Nigerians of their fundamental rights to access information, especially when done without any backing of any court of law.\n\n\u201cThe NCC under President Muhammadu Buhari conducted its blocking of Peoples Gazette\u2019s website entirely in secret and in the manner consistent with cyber-hackers.\n\n\u201cThe government has just provided further validation to our journalism of exposing corruption, abuse of power and disregard of constitutional order,\u201d Ogundipe said.\n\nHowever, the Managing Editor commended MTN\u2019s decision to own up after several months of enquiries from both The Gazette and other media outlets and rights groups across the world; as he also encouraged the remaining three mobile network operators to come clean.\n\n\u201cWe expect Airtel, 9mobile and Glo Mobile to follow MTN and admit their role in the restrictions. But that won\u2019t stop our lawyers from exploring all legal options of redress in this matter.\u201d\n\nRights groups including Gatefield, Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders have condemned the restrictions and demanded a reversal, as well as opposition leader Atiku Abubakar, who termed it as a stark throwback to the dark days of military fascism in Nigeria.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s biggest telco, MTN Nigeria, has announced that starting from Wednesday, 1 December 2021, retail investors can purchase up to 575 million shares held in MTN Nigeria at \u20a6169 per share\u2014lower than its share price on the stock market. This public offer is in line with MTN Group\u2019s commitment to reduce its shareholding in MTN Nigeria from 78.8% to 65% over time. MTN listed its Nigerian business two years ago at \u20a690 per share, becoming the second-largest stock by market capitalisation; its share price has since grown by about 100%.\n\nNotably, this public offer is primarily digital as the shares can be purchased online. Bolaji Balogun, CEO of Chapel Hill Denham, an investment banking firm leading the public offering, explained this to TechCabal.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of it being digital is that a lot more people can participate. The customer experience is a lot better; you can complete your purchase within 3-5 minutes. It also reduces the amount of paper that\u2019s going to be used in printing share certificates,\u201d Balogun said. \u201cIn all, we recognise that there are Nigerians who don\u2019t have access to a smartphone or the internet, so they can go into any money deposit bank or a nearby MTN shop/agent to make more inquiries.\u201d\n\nThe offer, which is open until Tuesday, 14 December 2021, will provide many Nigerian retail investors with an opportunity to own shares in MTN Nigeria.\n\nThe minimum amount of shares that can be bought is 20 units. To encourage people to buy more, the MTN offer includes one bonus share for every 20 purchased, subject to a maximum of 250 free shares per investor\u2014an incentive open to retail investors who hold shares for at least 12 months after allotment.\n\nBalogun added that he believes the digital sales of these shares will increase financial literacy on stocks but also expressed concern that retail investors should be wary of buying from just anyone or platform.\n\n\u201cThere are five investment bank/issuing houses mandated to sell: Chapel Hill Denham (the led), Rand Merchant bank, Renaissance Capital, Vertiva, and Stanbic IBTC. In addition to this, all the (about 200) stock broking firms in Nigeria can sell,\u201d he said. \u201cThe primary authorised digital platform to buy from is PrimaryOffer, as seen on MTN\u2019s site.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these, Fintech platform, Chaka, on Wednesday announced that it\u2019s partnering with Renaissance Capital to give its customers access to this public offering.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the mobile money agents and MTN shops only provide information on how people can purchase from the aforementioned authorised parties.\n\nIn response to this public offering announcement, MTN Nigeria\u2019s share price fell 10% on Wednesday to a five-week low, a logical response as investors rushed to buy the lower-priced MTN public offering shares.\n\n\u201cIn my 30 years of issuing shares, I\u2019ve never seen this number of applications in the first few hours,\u201d Balogun said. \u201cPeople typically wait until the last few days to start buying. It shows that there\u2019s a huge benefit in doing this digitally.\u201d\n\nMTN disclosed that if the 575 million ordinary shares are oversubscribed before the closing date, another 15%, which translates to 86 million more shares, would be offered to the public.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Herconomy raised $600,000 in a day. Here's how they did it",
          "text": "Herconomy, a startup empowering women through financial services, capacity building, jobs, and networking, has announced the close of a $600,000 pre-seed round to expand the product offerings on their platform.\n\nThe pre-seed round was led by members of the Herconomy\u2019s community, venture capitalist firm Oui Capital and a host of angel investors including Zephans & Co CEO Nkiru Ayemere; Ehi Onwudiwe, Director of Business Transformation at Ernst & Young; Head of Reserve at Diageo, Ope Makinwa; Ama Akpata, co-founder of Jand2Gidi and a host of others. According to the founder and CEO, Ife Durosinmi-Etti, when the round started, the startup got commitments worth $5.7 million from 509 community members within 24 hours but decided to only accept what it needed to scale\u2014$600,000.\n\nBuilding a tribe\n\nIn June 2018, Ife Durosinmi-Etti published Accessing Grants for Startups, a book that showcases local and international opportunities like grants, fellowships and other opportunities available to entrepreneurs in Africa. The book was a culmination of all the opportunities Durosinmi-Etti had been sharing on her personal Instagram profile for months.\n\nFounder, Ife Durosinmi-Etti\n\nMonths after publication, in December, Durosinmi-Etti decided to create an instagram page for the troves of people who had begun following her to get access to the opportunities on her page. She named the page, AGS Tribe, building a community where women get access to several opportunities globally. In Nigeria, women dominate the unpaid job sector, twice the figure of men. There are also more male wage earners\u2014 about 65.67%\u2014than female wage earners\u201434.33%.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to create a place where women could get access to opportunities, grants and fellowships,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cWhen people saw how much value we had to offer, they started following us and discussions around these opportunities grew. It was at that point we knew that it was more than just an opportunity board, it was a community.\u201d\n\nBy 2019, the AGS Tribe had grown to amass thousands in following. Handling the page and community became a full-time job for Durosinmi-Etti, and she decided to launch a paid community platform where people could access these opportunities seamlessly. The initial plan was to create a web platform to this effect, but that proved impossible when the platform crashed on the launch date on the 6th December 2019. That same evening, the Tribe moved to Telegram group offering people access at \u20a65,000 ($12) a month or \u20a650,000 ($120) a year.\n\nA year after launch, AGS Tribe had grown to a community of over 1,500 paying members who could access the community\u2019s opportunities as well as weekly capacity building workshops focusing on a variety of subjects from investments and finance, to SGBV and health issues.\n\nScaling, however, became a barrier as the team behind AGS began to find it difficult to coordinate the number of conversations the Telegram community had. \u201cIt was a bit hectic,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti admitted. \u201cWe had such a large number of people in one group. Logging off for hours could mean you\u2019d return to see thousands of messages in the community. And because opportunities are shared between conversations, people would sometimes have to read through every single message to find what they want. It was imperative to find a solution.\u201d\n\nHerconomy\n\nOne of the global issues exacerbated by COVID was the wage gap. Millions of people lost their jobs due to the lockdown, but women were hit harder with 5.5 million of them affected, almost 1 million more than men. In addition, many more women faced increased responsibilities at home as the lockdown mandated work/school-from-home situations everywhere.\n\nRealising this, AGS Tribe expanded their outlook to other opportunities by launching an app.\n\nHerconomy\u2019s product offerings\n\nThe launch of the app also came with the realisation that not all women would be able to afford the membership fees and they wanted to reach even more women. \u201cThe mobile app also included a free membership option,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti added. The app has a three-tier membership structure: a freemium subscription which gives members access to their community and opportunity board for free; Silver membership which gives you access to their weekly capacity building workshops called the Lightbox; and a Gold subscription which offers access to the community\u2019s affinity network where members can get discounts from over 60 brands including Raddison Blu Lagos, Qatar Airways and Adidas. The mobile app came with additional benefits for their Gold members (people who pay $120 yearly). They also introduced a job board and eventually became Amazon\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria for their EU region.\n\nMoving forward\n\nPresently, Herconomy has a community base of over 15,000 people with 20% of them as paying members. The startup plans to introduce financial services to its community members which it believes will be of great benefit to them. Over the years, it has run several saving challenges overseeing at least 500 women who have saved over $100,000 in total. With its new funding, Herconomy plans to introduce a savings feature where members can earn high interests.\n\nWhile most of Herconomy\u2019s funding has come from bootstrapping, the startup has gotten funding from various individuals and corporates who contributed grants and gifts in kind for its community members. Till date, Herconomy claims to have disbursed about \u20a630,000,000 ($71,600) in grants to forty-two women and men as part of its annual grants programme.\n\n\u201cI pitched the idea of Herconomy to several investors but we didn\u2019t get any yeses at first,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti said. The game-changer for them was getting selected for the Startup Bootcamp Accelerator program. During the program, they fine-tuned their business model, got advisors on the program. \u201cI quickly figured that many female-led startups do not get funding easily, so I decided to create a table for herself,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti commented. In August, she made a post via Instagram stories, asking if anyone was interested in investing in Herconomy. Within a day, as Durosinmi-Etti explains, she got \u201chundreds of responses\u201d from community members who were interested in investing.\n\n\u201cIn the end, we had 509 people who pledged $5.7 million, but we only needed $600,000. We also noticed not everyone could afford our $20,000 minimums, so we decided to create a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for the people who couldn\u2019t. They did this because it was extremely important for their community members to be part of this raise. So we went on GetEquity, created a private deal room and invited specific people that had indicated to invest,\u201d the founder shared. While the round did include investments from venture capital firms like Oui Capital, most of it came from Herconomy\u2019s own community of users who were interested in building the brand, 70% of whom were women.\n\n\u201cIt all worked out for the best,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti said. \u201cWe were able to ensure that women could easily invest. I\u2019m excited about creating the mindset of investing in women which is what we preach at Herconomy.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on their investment, Olu Oyinsan, Managing Partner of Oui Capital said, \u201cOur thesis is that community is very key to the future of consumer fintech in Africa. The company has a very strong community element, and also focuses on creating financial products and prosperity for women- who have historically been underserved with financial services. We like the company very much and are happy to be on this journey with the team.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "By creating more secure saving and trading options as well as frictionless cross-border payment and instant local remittance, crypto continues to solve the persistent inefficiencies in Africa\u2019s conventional financial systems.\n\nBut as good as this may sound, navigating through most of the available crypto products still feels like Chinese arithmetic to many Africans. And this experience is shutting out a large number of Africans from the crypto economy, thereby hindering even wider adoption.\n\nIn a bid to solve this problem, a handful of startups are entering the market. One of them, Payourse, a Lagos-based blockchain startup that builds user-friendly products and tools to accelerate the adoption of crypto in Africa, has secured a $600,000 pre-seed investment to scale its products, hire more talent and expand into new markets.\n\nJoining this round is Michael Ugwu, one of the biggest NFT collectors in Africa, Flori Ventures, Olumide Soyombo\u2019s Voltron Capital, and Allegory Capital. Other angel investors like CELO Co-founders Marek Olszewski and Rene Reinsberg, Kola Aina of Ventures Platform, Angel Touch Holdings, and Oluwatobi Anisere, also participated.\n\nFounded in September 2019 by Bashir Aminu (CEO) and John Anisere (CTO), Payourse is solving the problem of accessibility and adoption of the Web3 economy by providing the core infrastructure and tools that help African businesses build user-friendly crypto and Web3 products.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIt all started as a pet project\n\nWhile working at Busha, a crypto exchange that recently raised $4.2 million seed funding, as its first product designer, Aminu got the idea to build a simple platform that collects wallet addresses and then generates shareable links. So he shared the idea with Anisere, who was a colleague and a front-end engineer then at Busha. Anisere bought into the idea and after a few concepts deliberation, they launched into action. In September 2019, Coinprofile was launched, as a pet project.\n\nBut because of its seamless experience, Coinprofile began to gain traction among crypto users. The more people got on the product the more the duo realised how powerful and important their product can get. So they continued to find product-market fit and collect customer feedback to improve Coinprofile.\n\n\u201cIn May 2020, after acquiring a handful of users and considering the feedback and requests we\u2019ve pulled, we added a remittance functionality that allows users to make payment with their wallets,\u201d Aminu told TechCabal.\n\nNow, a little over two years, Coinprofile has morphed into an easy, fast and cheap crypto-fiat payment gateway that allows users anywhere in the world to directly send crypto and receive fiat value in any chosen African bank account within minutes, starting with Nigerian bank accounts.\n\nThe Big Pivot\n\nAccording to the CEO, in the process of building several web3 tools and APIs around the Coinprofile product, it became evident that they have not only built a great financial product, they have also sort of built infrastructures powerful and flexible enough for other businesses to incorporate, build and thrive on.\n\nThe Payourse team\n\n\u201cBecause of their ease of use, we realised that we could open up our technologies to other businesses to build sustainable and user-friendly web3 products on,\u201d Aminu said. \u201cThis, we believe, will lead to the launching of more products the ecosystem needs to mature and encourage mass crypto adoption across the continent.\u201d\n\nAs a result of this, the company last month announced that it\u2019d be consolidating all its present and future products under a parent company, Payourse. The parent company has three core functionalities that power its infrastructure: wallets, remittances and liquidity.\n\nThe company said it has also started building use cases to display its ambition to power the next hundreds of crypto-enable businesses. For instance, it has built Simpa, which is an easy and fast no-code platform available for anybody to quickly launch a fully customisable crypto exchange within minutes.\n\nJust like building web apps on the Bubble platform without writing a single line of code, Payourse wants to make sure people can build no-code crypto products and has already started with Simpa\u2014with more to come.\n\nWhen you say remittance, what about CBN?\n\nIt\u2019s been over 10 months since the Central Bank of Nigeria ordered all financial institutions to stop facilitating crypto transactions. Thanks to startups like Helicarrier, Binance, Paxful and others that started using the peer-to-peer (P2P) model to minimize the effect of the crackdown on the market.\n\nIt was difficult to trade crypto in the early days of the sanction, but as these companies continued to improvise and improve their P2P offerings, things began to ease up. But how has Payourse, particularly, dealt with the elephant in the room?\n\nWhile P2P is a good necessary alternative, it can be slow and insecure. Most of the exchange platforms don\u2019t want to serve as escrow; for them, it\u2019s like picking up another business entirely. So they only provide a P2P marketplace and leave everyone to their fate.\n\nPayourse didn\u2019t follow this P2P route, instead, they employ the service of liquidity partners. This means they\u2019ve partnered with some entities that provide liquidity (Fiat currencies like the Naira) whenever somebody performs a transaction. Once you send your crypto, their partners get the signal and fulfill your transaction, within minutes.\n\nTraction and growth\n\nAccording to the company, there are currently over 5,000 users on Coinprofile who process millions of dollars on the platform. Payourse also said that in 2021, its payment gateway has grown 15,000% across all metrics, maintaining a 150% month-on-month growth rate.\n\nMeanwhile, the new no-code tool Simpa which is on schedule to launch in the coming weeks is currently collecting data for early users to access the beta version.\n\nUnlike other companies that charge fees on every transaction, Coinprofile doesn\u2019t charge users on a transaction. So if it\u2019s free to use, how then does the company make money?\n\n\u201cWe make money from the little exchange margin we make from our liquidity partners on every transaction. This way, everybody wins,\u201d said Aminu.\n\nSpeaking on the new investment, Aminu said the team is proud of the quality of their investors. \u201cThis new funding will help us improve our existing use-cases and then build more as we extend into new markets and accelerate crypto adoption on the continent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI worked closely with Bashir as a visiting Partner at Flori Ventures. I\u2019ve spent 4 batches at YC and rarely do I see a company with this kind of knockout performance and a founder who is willing to put in the hard work to continue to nurture it.\u201d Holly Liu, Visiting Partner at Flori Ventures, said. \u201cBashir is capable of meeting the demands of a crazy growth startup and also ramp up fundraising.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking on their investment in Payourse, Olumide Soyombo, Managing Partner at Voltron Capital, said: \u201cWe are excited to back the Payourse mission as we believe this team is a super technical team with subject matter expertise. The team is solving an important problem by providing the key infrastructure for Africans and African businesses to adopt crypto.\u201d\n\nPayourse believes the future of finance in Africa will be defined by crypto and has set its goal to help more African businesses and individuals get on board, by positioning itself as the go-to platform for anything crypto on the continent. And it has already earmarked Ghana and Kenya as the next markets to push that ambition.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiving with disabilities means several things to different people. Faustina Urassa, Programme Officer at the Kilimanjaro Association of Spinal Cord Injury (KASI), Tanzania, sees it as an opportunity to help others who have lost their ability to walk.\n\nUrassa trains people who have suffered from spinal cord injury how to use wheelchairs. Using a wheelchair herself, she says, \u201cif you have the appropriate wheelchair that meets your needs and suits you, you\u2019ll forget about your disability.\u201d\n\nFor young South African, Gift Moloke, living with disabilities means a difficult schooling process. Moloke, who has down syndrome, was rejected by several schools his mother applied to.\n\nAccording to the United Nations (UN), 80 million people live with disabilities in Africa. However, the World Health Organisation (WHO) puts the number of people living with disabilities at 300 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the numbers might be inaccurate, the story of Urassa and young Moloke are not the only ones on the continent. While it is already difficult to live with these disabilities, society makes it even more difficult.\n\nThe UN also affirms that most Africans living with disabilities are excluded from school and work opportunities.\n\nIn 1992, the UN proclaimed December 3 as the International Day of Persons with Disabilities in a bid to \u201cpromote an understanding of disability issues and mobilize support for the dignity, rights, and well-being of persons living with disabilities.\u201d\n\nFrom people living with learning disabilities to stuttering and being deaf, we have explored what living is like for people with disabilities and the role of technology in making life easier.\n\nNotably, Techpoint Africa has, at different times, covered tech tools that can ease life and work for people living with specific forms of disabilities like stuttering, deafness, Dyslexia, and Dyscalculia, among other learning disabilities.\n\nIn celebration of the International Day of the Disabled, we are looking at four tech innovations that could help people living with disabilities globally.\n\nTactile watches for the visually impaired\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEone Switch with additional rings Source: Oracle Time\n\nHyungsoo Kim, CEO, Eone timepieces, created the Eone when he realised that all watches and clocks rely heavily on vision.\n\n\u201cCould there be a way to cater for the blind?\u201d he thought to himself. Kim and his team went to work and came up with the Eone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Eone allows users to check the time simply by touching and looking at it. Think of it as a regular watch, but it has balls instead of an hour and minute hand. One on the surface indicates the minute, and another on the side that shows the hour.\n\nEone stands for Everyone. Kim believes that products and services should be inclusive, and while his invention works well for the blind, people with vision can use it.\n\nRecalling when a group of visually impaired persons was testing the Eone, Kim was asked if the watch was made specifically for the blind.\n\n\u201cI said yes and expected a positive response, but they said, \u2018that\u2019s not what we want; what we want is what everyone else also likes.\u2019\u201d\n\nReturning the sense of touch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsthetic arm\n\nWhile prosthetic limbs are nothing like the natural, they can give amputees something close.\n\nDr Luke Osborne, a researcher at John Hopkins University, Baltimore, US, wants to get prosthetic limbs even close to being natural with his invention, E-dermis.\n\nThe invention could return the sense of touch to prosthetic users. The tech works with a phenomenon known as phantom limb syndrome.\n\nAccording to Osborne, it is a \u201csensation where you\u2019ve lost a limb or part of a limb, but you can still feel it. The region of the brain that represents the limb is still there and still working to some extent.\u201d\n\nOsborne wants to tap into this sensation and help people who have lost a limb feel things they\u2019ve not been able to for a while.\n\nEliminating stigma with fashionable prosthetics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBionic arm Source: CNET\n\nWhile Osborne is looking to return the sense of touch to prosthetic limbs, a group of video game enthusiasts is working on making it life-like.\n\nA video game company and a company that develops bionic arms \u2014 DEUS Ex Universe and Open Bionics \u2014 came together to create prosthetics that are more than just medical devices.\n\nOpen Bionics Co-founder, Joel Gibbard says, \u201cwhat we are trying to do is change the prosthetics industry so we can offer affordable, functional, and beautiful prosthetic devices to amputees.\u201d\n\nLooking like something out of a video game, Andre Vu, Executive Brand Director of DEUS Ex Universe, says they wanted the device to be something people wore fashionably.\n\nOpen Bionics has made a semi-functional prototype of these fashionable bionic arms and hopes to perfect the useability.\n\nTranslating sign language into speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUni demo. Source: the Daily Mail\n\nUni, a device created by MotionSavvy, converts sign language into text or speech, making it possible for deaf people to communicate effectively.\n\nIn a demo by Alexandr Opalka, MotionSavvy CTO, the device read his hand and converted it into speech.\n\nUsing sensors with dual cameras, it detects the movement of joints in the hands and fingers and interprets them into speech.\n\nWhile assistive technology is great, most of them are pretty expensive and inaccessible to many people with disabilities.\n\nAccording to the UN, 200 million people globally need assistive tech for low vision and over 400 million require products that assist hearing.\n\nWhile the high price tag of these devices contributes to their inaccessibility, they are often not included in welfare schemes, making them even more expensive in high-income countries.\n\nMore attention needs to be paid to assistive tech but, more importantly, persons with disabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun Website He's a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, different reports on Africa\u2019s digital economy have shown a steep gender divide. Be it access to the Internet, financial services, or startup funding opportunities.\n\nHowever, recent efforts from notable entrepreneurs are putting new blocks in place to try bridging that gap. In 2021, two amazing women in Nigeria\u2019s ecosystem partnered to launch FirstCheck Africa, a fund whose focus will be \u201cwriting first checks for audacious female founders, with bold ideas, at the \u201cridiculously early\u201d stages\u201d.\n\nOther platforms have also formed new ways to meaningfully engage women and bring more of them into the conversation in Internet adoption, financial inclusion, entrepreneurship, and angel investment.\n\nHowever, these initiatives have not been without their challenges. Access to opportunities has been a significant issue for most people. Herconomy founder, Ifedayo Durosinmi-Etti, found this even more true for women and began building solutions to address them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDurosinmi-Etti had stints with companies like Arcadia group in the UK, and Heineken (Nigerian Breweries), where she began to work on sustainability projects.\n\nIn 2016, she launched Parliamo Bambini and Philos and Zoe, startups easing the baby and child industry through locally manufactured furniture and clothing for children.\n\nIn 2016, Durosinmi-Etti was one of the selected entrepreneurs by the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). She and her co-founder, Olamide Olatunbosun, quit their jobs to focus on expanding their business. Their passion for women gelled nicely with an entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nFor Durosinmi-Etti, 2018 was a game-changer, as she used lessons from previous years to launch her, Accessing Grants for Startups: A guide for African entrepreneurs. The book\u2019 launch helped establish a community, and what followed was probably unforeseen by anyone in the founder\u2019s circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIfedayo Durosinmi-Etti, CEO, Herconomy\n\nFast forward three years to 2021, and Herconomy has raised $600k pre-seed led by VC firm Oui capital. Excitingly, 90% of its raise came from its community, some of whom were notable Angel investors, including:\n\nNkiru Ayemere \u2013 CEO, Zephans and Co, Ehi Onwudiwe \u2013 Director, Business Transformation, Ernst and Young, Olanrewaju Smith \u2013 CEO, World Bay Technologies, Ope Makinwa \u2013 Head of Reserve, Diageo, Ama Akpata \u2013 Co-founder, Jand2gidi.\n\nThrough its freemium membership model, the company offers weekly capacity-building workshops and brand discounts on Qatar Airways, Adidas, and Raddison Blu Lagos. It has a job board and became Amazon\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria for their EU region.\n\nThe startup also plans to introduce a savings feature where members can earn high interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut how did this happen?\n\nA long journey to a community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Durosinmi Etti launched her book to help people access startup grants in 2018, she couldn\u2019t have guessed that it would sell up to 10,000 copies or one day spur a growing community empowering women across Africa with core financial services.\n\n\u201cA lot of people kept on asking me, \u2018oh, my gosh, like, oh, the book was so good\u201d but how do they get more information about grants opportunities, and you know, scholarships, and all that, that going forward. So I started posting opportunities on my Instagram page,\u201d she says.\n\nAfter some days of doing this, Durosinmi-Etti grew fed up with the look of her page, so she decided to create a separate page for people to get grant and scholarship information. They also made sessions and workshops for people who wanted more information from the book.\n\nThe page began to gain traction, so she hired an assistant to lessen her burden and focus on her then business, Parliamo Bambini.\n\n\u201cThe business started growing so fast, and friends advised me to hire more people. But I was like, how am I going to afford more people? Are you people playing? I felt like the page was pulling me away from my business at the time, which I quit my 9 \u2013 5 job for, not knowing that this was actually what God was calling me to do,\u201d she recounts.\n\nDurosinmi-Etti, however, admits that though she was resisting at the time, the success of the business, whose goal was to empower women, was undeniable as it began to amass members by the thousands. In December 2019, a friend advised her to move to Telegram and create a community of paying members.\n\nThe proceeds were to hire more talent for the team, keep the community vibrant, and create more structured ways of helping people get these opportunities like capacity-building workshops.\n\n\u201cSo we paid somebody to create, like a web platform for us. And we\u2019re supposed to launch it on my birthday in 2019, and I was in San Francisco at the time. And we launched, we announced and did some paparazzi (fanfare) around it. But on the day of the launch, the web platform crashed.\u201d\n\nPutting her disappointment aside, Durosinmi-Etti moved those supposed to sign up on the platform to Telegram. By March 2020, the platform reportedly grew from zero to 500 subscribers who paid \u20a65,000 ($12) a month or \u20a650,000 ($121).\n\nScaling and growing to financial services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been in a WhatsApp group of 150 keyboard warriors, imagine how it feels to be offline for a few hours and meet thousands of messages when you get back. For a group of 500 paying subscribers, this was an even bigger issue that threatened to hurt the startup.\n\n\u201cI knew if I didn\u2019t build an app, our company would have died, and everyone would have left the group. So in March 2020, I decided to commission someone to build the app. It was supposed to be ready by June, but technical issues and COVID caused a delay. Coincidentally, Apple approved the app two days before my birthday in December 2019,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti states.\n\nThe Telegram experience may have been challenging, but Durosinmi-Etti believes it helped the startup\u2019s customer discovery process.\n\n\u201cSome people wanted to talk about stuff like sex, and others wanted to talk about entrepreneurship, career, others wanted to get jobs. So we just knew that we couldn\u2019t put everybody in the same box.\u201d\n\nSo Herconomy ( then AGS tribe) created a community-based platform where people could chat. It also added a new feature where people could get discounts on different brands like airline tickets, hotels, and others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHerconomy partners with Qatar Airways to give members of its community discounts on flight tickets\n\nDurosinmi-Etti reveals that these discount offers pushed membership adoption through the roof. The startup boasts of different members globally in the UK, Australia, UAE, Canada, and Egypt.\n\nWhen they started posting jobs on the platform, they struck a partnership with Amazon became the tech giant\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOne of the main reasons why people liked the platform was our focus on empowering women. We have something called the AGS enterprise challenge, where we give women small grants of \u20a6500k, \u20a61 million, and \u20a61.5 million. We also offer small grants through other channels and other organisations that partner with them,\u201d she reveals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAGS Enterprise Challenge 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAGS Enterprise Challenge 2020\n\nThe app featured a freemium model that lets members access the job board and community for free. The silver membership provides access to its weekly capacity building workshops (Lightbox), and the Gold membership, which cost $120, positions subscribers for offers such as airline or hotel discounts.\n\nTo date, Herconomy claims to have disbursed about \u20a630 million ($73,000) worth of grants to 42 women and men.\n\nIn response to Durosinmi-Etti\u2019s difficulties saving, the AGS tribe began to host a savings challenge in partnership with another organisation she didn\u2019t name. Impressively, they were able to get 500 women who cumulatively saved $100,000.\n\n\u201cAnd that was how I realised that a lot of women needed this service. So, we decided that we\u2019re going to add the savings feature to our platform so more women could save.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the name AGS tribe no longer made sense for what the startup was building, and it needed a new brand to position it as a financial services company looking to empower more African women.\n\nThen came the name, Herconomy.\n\nRaising funds in record time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRahmat Lasisi, CTO, Herconomy, and Ifedayo Durosinmi-Etti, CEO, Herconomy\n\nWith the platform\u2019s growth, Durosinmi-Etti realised that it had to build a structure around the startup, and she needed funding to do that. Unfortunately, none of the investors she reached to understood what she was doing or how a community would make sense.\n\nIn August 2021, while participating in the Startup Bootcamp accelerator in Senegal, she sent out a message on her Insta stories asking people to indicate if they wanted to invest in Herconomy, and 130 people showed interest.\n\nSidenote; The startup placed a $20,000 cap on this investment.\n\nA month later, after getting a commitment of $150k from three friends, she sent an email to those who indicated interest. To her surprise, she got a pledge of $5.7 million in 24 hours, all from people ready to pay by the set deadline of October 15. The list increased from 130 people to 509.\n\n\u201cI was confused as I did not believe this was possible. So I reached out to Zach (Zachariah George, Managing Partner, Launch Africa), our portfolio manager from the accelerator, and other people who were well versed in investments. We organised a workshop explaining what making such an investment could mean,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWe just gave different scenarios and told them that this is not blood money, and their money could easily go bust. After explaining everything, they said they understood, so the fundraising began.\u201d\n\nHowever, the $20,000 cap prevented several members of the community from investing. Leveraging the platform, Getequity, the startup decided to create a special purpose vehicle for people who wanted to invest smaller amounts ranging from $30 to $10k.\n\nThe company plans to focus on testing and improving its savings product and invest heavily in marketing.\n\nChallenges and the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Lagos Techie on Unsplash\n\nThe following paragraphs might, perhaps, be familiar, but one of Herconomy\u2019s most significant challenges so far has been getting the right tech talent.\n\n\u201cFinding a woman in technology to be our Chief Technology Officer was a huge, huge challenge. There were a lot of things we didn\u2019t take into consideration while building our app because we didn\u2019t have a CTO,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti says.\n\nShe also argues that when it outsourced its app development in 2020, several ideas could have been better understood by an in house team. Thankfully, during the Startup Bootcamp accelerator, one of the mentors, Oshone Ikazoboh, recommended Herconomy\u2019s CTO, Rahmat Lasisi.\n\nDespite the challenges with the outsourced app, Durosinmi-Etti is grateful that the community could grow to over 15,000 members.\n\nThe startup is currently looking at acquiring a licence with the next raise. Still, it remains focused on building its financial services product which it\u2019s gearing towards empowering more women.\n\nConsidering all the previous records about the struggles of female founders, Durosinmi-Etti recounts that the nature of her fundraising was humbling, and it could serve as encouragement for more women out there.\n\n\u201cFor me, I think this whole process is just about understanding where you\u2019re trying to build an understanding that no matter what it is, no matter how hard you fall, you know, you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she maintains.\n\n\u201cBut if you don\u2019t try, you never know. I never thought I would be able to run a team like this. I\u2019ve been paying salaries of 10 people for over a year just with our own, like revenues and everything, but there were months when I wasn\u2019t sure how to pay the next month salary.\n\n\u201cSo to be honest, it has been a testimony and I just feel like women just need to take chances on themselves and just continue pushing and pushing,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti concludes.\n\nAre you a woman building awesome stuff with technology?

It all started in 2018 When Ife Durosinmi-Etti, Herconomy Founder, published her book, Accessing Grants for Startups. The book contained information on how to get opportunities such as scholarships, grants, and fellowships.\n\nAccording to Durosinmi-Etti, people loved the book, but they wanted more. She instinctively began to post more tips on her personal Instagram page. Still, She realised she needed a dedicated platform and created AGS Tribe, which then morphed into a community where women could access life-changing opportunities.\n\nWhen Durosinmi-Etti\u2019s community was able to save $100,000 during a savings challenge, the idea for a fintech startup was formed.\n\nWatch out for the details on how this community raised $600,000 in 24 hours by Emmanuel Paul later today.\n\nWorld AIDS Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday was World AIDS Day; a day set aside not only to create awareness about the disease but to serve as a reminder that the disease hasn\u2019t gone extinct.\n\nAccording to Intelligence by Techpoint, in 2020, an estimated 37.6 million people were infected with HIV globally and 27.4 million people living with HIV receiving treatment.\n\nHowever, the number of AIDS-related deaths globally has declined by 65.5% since 2004.\n\nInterestingly, this year\u2019s theme for World AIDS Day is End Inequalities.

Other investors, including Fiat Ventures, Trade X, and Verraki Partners, participated in the round.\n\nWhat does Octamile do? Founded by Gbenro Dara, a former Jumia employee, the startup wants to grow the insurance ecosystem in Africa by providing traditional insurance companies and non-insurance businesses with access to data.\n\nIt wants to reduce the friction in the insurance experience with three solutions \u2014 digital claims, improved risk assessment, and embedded insurance APIs.\n\nThese solutions help insurance providers reduce the administrative cost of claims, increase the profitability of their portfolio and help non-insurance businesses add insurance as a feature to their products.\n\nWhy insurance?

          "text": "Some oil majors are excluding Nigeria from their capital expenditure budgets for 2022, others are divesting out of onshore assets and local producers struggling to restart fields shut in last year during lockdowns, lack capacity to ramp up production, developments that question the country\u2019s ability to meet its production targets next year.\n\nOil cartel, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and its allies led by Russia agreed on Thursday to stick with its current plan to adjust crude output by an additional 400,000 barrels a day in January and raised Nigeria\u2019s output from about 1.5 million barrels per day to 1.683mbpd beginning from January 2022.\n\nNormally, rising oil prices and higher volumes should boost the economy and strengthen the local currency but Nigeria\u2019s reality is nuanced. Production has fallen by over 700,000 bpd this year, as IOCs prioritize investments in other climes.\n\nFor instance, five Western majors such as British Petroleum, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Shell, and Total Energies are set to raise their capital spending by at least $12 billion next year, as higher oil and natural gas prices allow investment to return to more sustainable levels.\n\nThese companies are comfortably ignoring Nigeria and moving forward with higher spending in upstream oil and gas in Libya\u2019s Mabruk field, Payara and Yellowtail developments offshore Guyana, the recently sanctioned Equinor-operated Bacalhau scheme offshore Brazil, the US Permian Basin and multiple refining and chemical expansions in the US, UK and Singapore.\n\nRead Also: Oil firms ignore Nigeria, pump fresh dollars into Libya\n\nData gleaned from Wood Mackenzie\u2019s latest report showed over the last decade the IOCs\u2019 average capital expenditure per barrel of oil equivalent has fallen seven times more in Nigeria compared to that of the rest of their portfolio.\n\nWood Mackenzie\u2019s data also showed in 2020 the average CAPEX per barrel of oil equivalent across the global portfolios was 51 percent of 2010 levels, whereas the equivalent metric for the Nigeria assets was 7.4percent.\n\n\u201cThe significant drop in investment by these IOCs in Nigeria goes beyond capital discipline alone,\u201d Simon Anderson, director performance improvement sub- Saharan Africa at Wood Mackenzie said in a note. \u201cSome Nigeria assets may be under-invested, resulting in potential upside opportunities\u201d.\n\nDivestments by oil majors amid limited local capacity present another challenge.\n\n\u201cDespite the profitability of their Nigeria assets, the IOCs are under increased pressure to accelerate their energy transition and divest non-core assets,\u201d Wood & Mackenzie said.\n\nSome analysts say the recent quest by oil majors may have exposed the financial and technical capabilities of Nigeria\u2019s domestic operators, who pump between 1,000 and 100,000 barrels each day.\n\n\u201cMany indigenous operators are sitting on significant resources, with opportunities to grow production with access to capital investment,\u201d Wood & Mackenzie added.\n\nFor Timipre Sylva, Nigeria\u2019s minister of State for Petroleum Resources, the country\u2019s oil production struggles can only be attributed to technical problems from re-tapping reservoirs that had been shuttered to comply with the stringent OPEC+ cuts of the past 17 months.\n\nKey Nigerian grade Forcados had been disrupted for almost a month until Shell lifted force majeure on loadings on September 10. Industry sources said the suspension of exports was due to an oil spill near the Forcados terminal.\n\nOther Nigerian crudes such as Bonny Light, Escravos, and Qua Iboe have also faced production issues in recent months due to operational and technical reasons.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s oil production is currently struggling at levels never seen before, but the regulators are ignoring the problem and disguising under OPEC\u2019s quota,\u201d Charles Akinbobola, energy analyst at Lagos-based Sofidam Capital, says.\n\nAlso, a new wave of security threats in Nigeria has emerged that could further dent Nigeria\u2019s production.\n\n\u201cLately there have been groups in communities in the Niger Delta, who while seeking for cash and attention, have been vandalizing oil pipelines,\u201d a Nigeria-based official at a Western oil company said. \u201cDisruption to operations of oil companies in the Niger Delta is rising by the day due to the activities of these vandals.\u201d\n\nA week ago, a militant group in the Niger Delta region code-named Bayan-Men blew up an oil facility producing around 5,000 bpd of condensates operated by the Nigerian Agip Oil Company, (NAOC) in Ogba-Egbema-Andoni local government area, Rivers State.\n\nThe angry militants, who destroyed oil well, OB5, (Obiavu-5) in the area, accused the oil firm of failing to deal directly with the host communities insisting that they were fighting for justice for their people.",

          "text": "BUA Group, Nigeria\u2019s leading foods, infrastructure, mining and manufacturing conglomerate is at the verge of completing the processes to list the shares of its Food businesses \u2013Flour & Pasta, Sugar, Edible Oils, and Rice \u2013on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX).\n\nThe planned listing of BUA Food businesses awaiting regulatory approvals will further provide for a more robust capital market as the company joins FMCG sector of the NGX.\n\n\u201cEarlier in the year, just as I promised the management of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) when we were seeking to list a few of our businesses, we have commenced the process of bringing our Food businesses to the stock exchange.\n\n\u201cI can confidently announce that this process if almost completed and will provide for a more robust capital market upon listing,\u201d Abdul Samad Rabiu, Chairman of BUA Group said recently at NGX Capital Markets Conference.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThere is a school of thought that argues rightly or wrongly that the Nigeria capital market system is not deep enough both in terms of the value and breathe of it offerings. Whatever the case may be, we must acknowledge the current efforts of the NGX to deepen the system and keeping market participants abreast of new offerings, but they need to do more,\u201d Rabiu further said.\n\n\u201cAs a private sector operator, BUA Group has been actively involved in the capital market in one form or the other over the past three years with some of the largest successful Mergers & Acquisition (M&A), debt and equity transactions in Nigeria even during the pandemic. We believed in the capacity of the Nigerian capital market to handle those transactions regardless of the economic headwinds. For us at BUA, we have seen increased value \u2013intrinsic and otherwise to our businesses,\u201d he said.\n\nRead also: Accessibility to food is human right\n\nRabiu noted that when BUA Group listed its Cement business (BUA Cement), they were looking at getting a valuation of about N1trillion to N1.2trillion, but they ended up getting a valuation of over that. Currently, BUA Cement is the fourth largest capitalized company on the NGX with total market capitalization of about N2.5trillion.\n\n\u201cBUA\u2019s expression of interest to list its food business on the NGX is impressive, as it shows the strong philosophy of Abdulsamad Rabiu in institutionalizing the family empire and more importantly democratizing the investment opportunity offered by the family\u2019s portfolio companies,\u201d said Lizzie Kings-Wali, Chief Executive Officer of Blackstone Capital Limited.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cThe reverse merge of BUA Cement and Cement Company of Northern Nigeria (CCNN) has proven to be positive for both the core shareholders and minorities and I believe listing of food business should also help to consolidate BUA Group\u2019s strategic objectives of incubating companies and grooming them into large cap entities offering investment opportunities for both local and foreign investors. Interestingly, listing on the NGX also helps to enhance governance. It increase access to capital, and of course lowers the cost of capital to the entity\u201d.\n\n\u201cWith BUA Foods expected to join the FMCG sector of the NGX, it creates new opportunities for investors with appetite for investing in non-financials. Likewise, Ethical and Sharia-complaint investors would be excited at seeing another large-cap Food-based company being listed on the NGX, as it broadens the Basket if investable assets for these class of investors,\u201d Kings-Wali further noted.\n\nShe noted that while the consumer goods sector index has not performed so well this year, losing some 5percent year-to-date (YtD), \u201cthe listing of new large-caps creates new opportunity for the sector. Interestingly, the actualisation of this expression of interest by BUA may also spur interest of other FMCG companies to join the train and list their shares on the NGX, as investors seek new listings to deepen the Nigeria capital market, especially as this helps to break the ice on the sparse primary market activity in the past 2 years.\u201d\n\nBUA IRS Flour has established a state-of-the-art plant in Port Harcourt, Nigeria to cater for the growing needs of its population. The market is expected to grow annually by 6.7percent (Compound annual growth rate CAGR 2020-2025).\n\nFlour is one of the staple foods contributing to the development of Nigeria. Currently, the shares of wheat flour for bread, semolina, pasta and others, are estimated at 60 percent, 20 percent,10 percent, and 10 percent, respectively. The base raw material for bread flour, confectionery flour and noodle flour, semolina, and pasta production is wheat, and 99 percent of the 5.67 million metric tons is imported.\n\nAll the sugar and allied investments of BUA Group are set up to take advantage of the entire sugar production value chain. These include investments in sugar estates as well as refining capabilities.\n\nThe Group currently has 2 ultra-modern and automated mega sugar refineries (BUA Sugar Refinery, Lagos and Eastern Sugar Refinery, Port Harcourt) that utilize state-of-art equipment to refine high quality products for consumption and industrial uses. The Sugar refineries have a total combined installed refining capacity of 1,500,000 metric tonnes. BUA is the only sugar refiner to have refining capabilities outside Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nBUA Group had in response to Nigeria\u2019s backward integration policy in the Sugar Industry, invested in large scale estates within the country to deepen local sugar production through the acquisition of the Lafiagi Sugar Company Ltd (LASUCO) in Kwara state in 2008 and also the establishment of the Bassa Sugar Company in Kogi State.\n\nBUA Group has also acquired about 70,000ha of land in both locations for the purpose of setting up large-scale sugar plantations. Upon fully coming on stream, these initiatives will add significantly to the development of Nigeria\u2019s local sugar industry. In 2001, BUA Group acquired Nigeria Oil Mills Limited which was established in 1951.\n\nWith two main facilities (Nigeria Oil Mills, Kano & BUA Oil Mills, Lagos), the company produces oil from groundnut and cotton seeds and also produces animal feeds and soap. BUA Oil Mills, established in 2008, produces high quality products including palm olein, stearin, Distilled Fatty Acid (DFA) amongst others.\n\nBUA Group currently operates a mill in Kano as well as a rice plantation in Kano, Nigeria. The Group also operates a robust out-growers Scheme targeting about 100,000 rice farmers in Kano and Jigawa States, Nigeria. Rice is a staple food buoyed by strong domestic demand. The mill is the largest in Nigeria at 200,000 tonnes per annum and is currently being upgraded to 1million metric tonnes per annum. BUA Rice Plantation is estimated to cover a land mass of about 10,000hectares.",

          "text": "From LG\n\nAlthough the smart home revolution is still in its early stages, we have witnessed how the Internet of Things (IoT) and interconnected smart devices may improve our lives. With the advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine/deep learning, offering individual consumers unique experiences personalized to their tastes and preferences is now more possible than ever before.\n\nAI is making its way into TVs, Washing Machines, Refrigerators and Audio devices like speakers. A product that stays with you for the majority of the day and learn your behaviour has far more potential than one that is only used infrequently.\n\nLG Electronics has been able to position itself as a pioneer in AI-integrated electronics and continues to produce the best-in-market ThinQ line that exceeds consumer expectations as customers across the world demand more efficient and productive smart technology.\n\nAccording to Mr. Hari Elluru, Head, Corporate Marketing LG Electronics West Africa, LG\u2019s 21st-century products are using AI to directly connect with its consumers and make their lives more convenient.\n\nWhat makes the smart technology less daunting today is because now everyone has a smart phone. And through that smartphone, consumers can control all aspects of their connected devices from the bed, sofa or even while doing other chores. The fact that the LG ThinQ app has been downloaded over a million times is proof that there is an audience that\u2019s hungry for the conveniences offered by smart products. But what conveniences are we talking about here?\n\n\u201cLG\u2019s intuitive webOS smart TV platform provides faster, more convenient access to apps as well as simpler content discovery with finely-tuned personalized recommendations. Think of webOS as your concierge who knows your taste and style and can point you in the right direction when it comes to entertainment. LG Magic Remote not only controls your TV but your other LG-connected devices too, and one can complete their smart adaptive viewing experience with voice-responsive LG smart audio devices like LG Soundbar AI ThinQ which supply immersive sound that changes settings according to content\u201d, he explained.\n\nHe stated that \u201cLG\u2019s energy-efficient air conditioner works with the LG purifier to achieve the perfect indoor temperature and deliver fresh, germ-free air to users. And over in the utility room, the LG washer and dryer combo are hard at work improving their performance and efficiency by identifying the type of fabrics being washed and adjusting their programming to deliver perfectly cleaned and dried clothes for the whole family.\n\nMr. Elluru stated that in the kitchen, LG\u2019s intelligent LG refrigerators such as the iconic InstaView Door-in-Door lets users know when food is running low, sends you expiry alerts for your perishable food items and can even self-diagnose any performance issues so you don\u2019t have to.\n\n\u201cLG\u2019s ThinQ integration lets you activate Express Freeze and monitor temperatures with your smartphone, so there\u2019s no need to repeatedly check on the fridge to see if things are ready. It also enables you to eliminate frequent trips to the grocery store with the largest capacity French Door refrigerator, to stock up and store all your favourite foods,\u201d he added.\n\nCommenting on other AI-powered products of LG, he continued by saying LG OLED and NanoCell TVs with ThinQ deliver next-level AI and elevated viewing experiences right to the living room.\n\n\u201cYou can create a cinematic experience and enjoy amazing gaming time right in your home with LG AI-enabled TVs. With just a simple voice request, LG AI TVs make suggestions suited to your preference such as movies, programs or music.\n\nSmart home of the future will also take home security to a whole new level. Cameras will be able to distinguish intruders from occupants by studying movements, habits and biometrics, alerting the homeowner and the police of any suspicious activity, an indispensable feature for those who are often on the road for work.\n\nAccording to the LG ThinQ 2021 Smart Home Report, the largest group of smart homeowners say saving energy is the greatest benefit of owning a smart home. Smart devices can be set to run when electricity rates are the cheapest and solar panels can charge home batteries which can power the home once the sun goes down. With a grid-connected solar system, smart homeowners can reduce their electricity bills even more by sending excess power to the grid.\n\nThe advantages of AI technologies like LG ThinQ will undoubtedly enable humans to live better and smarter lives. Humans can only enjoy a more mobile, comfortable, and connected lifestyle as internet access and technology adoption improves.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "Determined to engender a coordinated socio-economic and physical development in Edo State, the governor, Godwin Obaseki, has said that the new 30-year development plan will guide infrastructure delivery in the state to enhance the quality of life of residents.\n\nTitled: \u201cEdo State Development and Physical Plan\u201d, reviewed recently by stakeholders in the built and allied industries, in Benin City, the state capital, the plan was conceived to put an end to the haphazard physical development in parts of the state and restore order in the built industry while better harnessing the gains of growing socio-economic activities.\n\nExperts described the plan as timely amid a booming real estate sector driven largely by foreign remittances from the huge Edo Diaspora community, and the growing spend by residents on account of the series of Obaseki-led economic reforms that have broadened space for businesses in line with his development vision encapsulated in the Making Edo Great Again (MEGA) Manifesto.\n\nSpeaking at a recent workshop during the overview of the Edo State Development and Physical Plan, put together by the ministry of physical planning /urban development and the state ministry of budget and economic planning, Obaseki explained that the newly launched 30-year development plan is a comprehensive and all-encompassing document to drive sustainable socio-economic growth and development in the state over the next three decades.\n\nWelcoming guests to the overview workshop, held in Government House, the governor \u201csaid the 30-year development plan is a very comprehensive and all-encompassing plan, which not only looks at our socio-economic development plans over the next 30 years but also deals with the physical development plans.\n\n\u201cIt is a very unique process in planning where we bring all stakeholders that make up for development to work on the plan. What I also didn\u2019t emphasize during the inauguration was the fact that this exercise of creating a plan for our state and our future is not an exercise to produce a document.\n\n\u201cIt is a process which we had commenced to change the way we organise ourselves and do things in Edo. It is a process whereby all stakeholders are brought together and tools deployed to activate and animate the planning exercise.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThat process starts now and that is why we are here. It also involves consultants, academia, estate managers amongst others, as well as all those who are involved in the process of transforming economic and social planning in the state.\u201d\n\nOn his expectations from the experts working on the implementation of the plan, Obaseki said: \u201cWhat I expect this afternoon is that you, the experts, will help us look at an overview of what we are trying to do. Where do we want to be in the next 30 years within the context of Nigeria? We may not able to determine where Nigeria will be but we want to have a bit more certainty about where Nigeria will be, we want to have a bit more certainty about where Edo will be\u201d.\n\nObaseki further projected a strong economic outlook for the state, on an irreversible nexus between physical planning and economic growth.\n\nAccording to the project manager, Edo 2050, Dr. Francis Ntamu, the three main process phases in the development plan include; stakeholders consultations, communications and focus on risk management.\n\nIsoken Omo, the commissioner for Physical Planning and urban development, in her notes on the exercise, said \u201cthe existing Benin City master plan which was prepared about three decades ago is no longer relevant in view of the changing socio-economic and geopolitical realities of the city in particular and Edo State in general.\n\n\u201cThis has consequences on the infrastructure, quality of the environment and it has therefore become necessary to prepare new development plans which will guide future development decisions.\n\n\u201cThe advantages to be derived when a new master plan and state regional development plan are prepared and put in place for use in the state are numerous, such as; secure and orderly arrangement of the environment to enhance its aesthetics and functionalities by making it a more conducive place for working, living, movement, recreation and carrying out of all commercial activities.\n\n\u201cPrevent haphazard developments and unplanned growth (chaotic sprawls); secure the health, safety and comfort of people and communities as well as ensure sustainable development; create spatial structure (distribution and hierarchy) of urban settlements which are centres of population, employments, public utilities and social infrastructure amongst others.\u201d\n\nOmo added \u201cthe intention of our engagements with all stakeholders is to make the designing process participatory and produce a living document that resonates with the populace to encourage buy-in, which will help in the implementation of the plan in the over thirty years period.\u201d\n\nRecall that Edo State, particularly Benin City, the capital, has always been referenced severally as one of the best planned cities in Nigeria, thanks to the visionary leadership of former political leaders of the state, such as the late Dr. Samuel Osaigbovo Ogbemudia, whose impactful leadership touched on virtually all aspects of the state, including a robust physical plan for the built industry in the state.\n\nHowever, historians say that Dr. Ogbemudia also built on the age-old legacy of Edo people and their kings, who are celebrated for their ingenious skills, arts and culture.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis legacy of a coordinated society is under threat from the illegal activities of some developers, land grabbers and some government officials who collude with them to compromise standards.\n\nAccording to physical planning experts; Ayo Olajuyigbe and Olukayode Rotowa, \u201cPhysical planning attempts to achieve an optimal spatial coordination of different human activities for the enhancement of quality of life.\u201d\n\nThey added that physical planning involves the reconciliation of land uses, provision of the right site for the right use, control of development, provision of facilities, services and public goods, preservation, protection and conservation of resources, preservation of heritage among others.",

Her apartment had been burgled by an Ivorian in September 2019 and she had reported the incident to the police but DPO informed her that the suspect was his nephew. He reportedly offered her a settlement worth roughly N100,000 to drop the case, an amount lesser than the N300,000 worth of stolen effects.\n\nBabalola was subsequently arrested when she refused the settlement, charged to court for human trafficking and sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nA journalist, David Hundeyin, had shared the story of Babalola on Twitter in March 2021 and the NIDCOM had said it was working to prove the innocence of Babalola.\n\nAbike Dabiri-Erewa had confirmed that the lady was charged and incarcerated for a crime she didn\u2019t commit.\n\nHowever, many Nigerians were shocked on November 14 when Hundeyin, who had been following the case, gave serial updates that Babalola\u2019s contracted an infection in the Ivorian prison.\n\nSome were gutted that eight months after NIDCOM promised to ensure justice was served on the matter and secure the lady\u2019s freedom, Babalola still remained behind bars in the Francophone West African nation.\n\nIn defence, Dabiri-Erewa, blamed Babalola, saying she reported her plight late to the Nigerian Commission in Ivory Coast after she had spent two years in jail.\n\n\u201cShe did not inform the mission about the trial. She had spent two years in jail, then her father cried out for help. Perhaps, when she had issues with the burglar and policeman that was changing the case and reported to the Mission, maybe it would have been a different story,\u201d the former member of the House of Representatives said, a comment that many described as unsavoury.",

We are therefore happy to contribute by this renovation, and by the arrangement to maintain it for the next two years,\u201d Mr. Ahmed added.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Ismaila Abubakar, lauded Dangote group for believing in the vision of the Minister vis-a-vis examplifying a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) that works.\n\nHe restated the commitment of the Ministry to ensure that the new facility was put to productive use and properly maintained.\n\nIn his submission, the Special Adviser to the President on Sports, a former Nigerian International, Daniel Amokachi, showered encomiums on the minister for his foresight in thinking out of the box to fix the dilapidated pitch.\n\nHe charged the Dangote group to consider extending the period of maintenance beyond two years, stating that after expending $1 million to renovate the facility, long-term maintenance was paramount.\n\nWhilst receiving the formal handover documents from the Executive Director, Projects, Aron Nigeria Ltd, Soji Adeniji \u2013 the contractor handling the project, the minister lauded the contractor and the Dangote group for completing the project in record time, despite constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cBy the words of the experts here and those that have toured the facility, we have the latest grass here \u2013 Paspalum grass, one of the best, when we talk about football pitches across the world. Something exactly similar to what we have in Qatar, that will be used for the World Cup next year.\n\n\u201cWe thank Alhaji Aliko Dangote for opening his doors to us, and accepting to adopt the Moshood Abiola Stadium when we came up with our \u2018Adopt-a-Pitch\u2019 proposal. We salute his commitment that culminated in the completion of the project today, inclusive of maintenance for at least two years,\u201d Dare said.\n\nThe renovated pitch, aside from the new digital score-boards, has a nursery being cultivated to produce fresh grass to replace withered ones when necessary, and sprinklers to keep the grass lush green all year round.\n\nOnly a few months ago, the President of the World Soccer Governing Body, FIFA, Gianni Infantino, while on a visit to the stadium, commended the quality of the new pitch and promised to facilitate the hosting of international matches on it.\n\nThe coach of the Super Falcons of Nigeria, Randy Waldrum, also visited the stadium last week and requested the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to move all the home games of the team to the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "\u2018\u2026Court ruling shows FG\u2019s resolve to crush banditry\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2026It indicates govt remains with global standards\u2019\n\n\u2026Mere declaration meaningless unless\u2026 \u2013 Gumi\n\n\u2018\u2026Re-naming bandits terrorists a political stunt\u2019\n\n\u2026It\u2019s better late than never \u2013 Northern youth\n\nA Federal High Court in Abuja under trial Justice Taiwo Taiwo has ruled that the activities of bandits, as well as other similar groups, in any part of the country amounted to acts of terrorism and subsequently declared them terrorists. BENJAMIN SAMSON in this report examines the implications of the declaration on the war against banditry.\n\nThe order declaring bandits terrorists was sequel to an application filed on behalf of the federal government by the Director of Public Prosecution, Federal Ministry of Justice, Mohammed Abubakar, regarding the activities of Yan Bindiga, Yan Ta\u2019adda and other groups of bandits in the country.\n\nIn the ex parte application, the federal government had prayed the court to outlaw the Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups, as well as other terrorist groups across the country.\n\nThe request, according to the federal government in a supporting affidavit, was to checkmate the activities of the groups, which the government said were responsible for killings, abductions, rapes, kidnappings, and other criminal acts in the North-east, North-central, and other parts of the country.\n\nThe federal government blamed the groups for \u201cbanditry, incessant kidnappings for ransom, kidnapping for marriage, mass abductions of school children and other citizens, cattle rustling, enslavement, imprisonment, severe deprivation of physical liberty, torture, rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, and other forms of sexual violence, attacks and killings in communities and commuters, and wanton destruction of lives and proper property.\u201d\n\nIt went on to say that the Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups, as well as other similar groups, were responsible for the deaths of soldiers, police officers, and other security agents across the country.\n\n\u201cCommercial, educational, and farming activities in the North-west and North-central have been disrupted as a result of the groups\u2019 activities,\u201d the federal government noted.\n\n\u201cThe activities of the Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups, as well as other similar groups, constitute acts of terrorism that can lead to a breakdown of public order and safety, as well as a threat to Nigeria\u2019s national security and corporate existence,\u201d the government in the supporting affidavit.\n\nThe DPP said President Muhammadu Buhari gave the approval for his action, which objective is the proscription of Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups and other terrorist groups.\n\nThe verdict\n\nSpecifically, the court declared the activities of the \u201cYan Bindiga Group\u201d and the \u201cYan Ta\u2019adda Group,\u201d as well as other similar groups, in any part of the country, particularly in the North-west and North-central geopolitical zones, to be \u201cacts of terrorism and illegality.\u201d\n\nThe judge ruled that \u201csimilar groups, either in groups or as individuals by whatever names they are called, in any part of Nigeria, particularly in the North-west and North-central geopolitical zones\u201d are terrorists and banned.\u201d\n\nJustice Taiwo said in the light of the nefarious activities of bandits and their effects on the people and the nation\u2019s economy, he was convinced that such orders were required.\n\nHe extended the proscription order to all other groups in the country, regardless of their names, whose activities and goals are similar to those of the Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta\u2019adda groups.\n\nAccording to the ruling, terror activities \u201cinclude, but not limited to banditry, kidnappings for ransom, kidnapping for marriage, mass abductions of school children and other citizens, cattle rustling, enslavement, imprisonment, severe deprivation of physical liberty, torture, rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, other forms of sexual violence, attacks and killings in communities and commuters and wanton destruction of lives and properties in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe judge held further that the federal government must publish the prosecution order in the official Gazette and two national dailies in the country.\n\nFG\u2019s reaction\n\nSimilarly, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami, has said the declaration of bandit groups as terrorist organisations by a Federal High Court shows that the Nigerian government was determined to crush banditry in the country.\n\nReacting to the development through his spokesperson, Umar Gwandu, Malami, he said the court ruling proved that the federal government was taking the necessary steps to end banditry.\n\nThe minister, who said the development followed an application filed by his office, said the declaration of bandit groups as terrorist organisations \u201cshows that the federal government was acting in accordance with the rule of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe development is a pointer to the commitment of the federal government to adhere to the international standards in respecting the rules of engagement in the fight against terrorism, separatists\u2019 organisations, insurgency and banditry in the country.\n\n\u201cBy this declaration, the Federal Government of Nigeria has taken bold steps to deal ruthlessly with all terrorist groups and their sponsors in efforts to bring a lasting solution to the myriad of insecurity challenges in the country,\u201d the AGF said.\n\nNorthern youth\u2019s take\n\nAlso, the Northern Youths Council of Nigeria in its reaction to the declaration in a statement jointly signed by its president, Comrade Isah Abubakar, and the director-general, media and publicity, Samuel Kure, noted that though it almost took the federal government \u2018forever\u2019 to act on the calls made by various interest groups in the country, including the Northern Youth Council, to declare bandits as terrorists, it was better late than never.\n\n\u201cWe will welcome full military operation in the North-west and North-central parts of the country as in the North-east against Boko Haram and ISWAP elements which have drastically reduced their activities. The Council hereby urges our Armed Forces and other sister security agencies, to arrest and prosecute anybody seen giving the terrorists moral support be it materially, morally or otherwise no matter how highly or lowly placed. The Northern Youths will stand with you in your quest to stamp out terrorism in the North and Nigeria at large,\u201d the youth said in the statement.\n\nCriticisms\n\nHowever, an Islamic cleric, Ahmad Gumi, has dismissed the declaration of bandits as terrorists as mere political expediency, saying \u201cit will come to no effect.\u201d\n\nGumi said the declaration will have no effect as a similar pronouncement by the federal government on the South-east secessionist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nThe Islamic cleric noted that although the declaration of IPOB as a terrorist organisation was also backed by a court order, the international community did not accord it recognition.\n\nGumi in a statement by his media aide, Tukur Mamu, said declaring the herdsmen bandits as terrorists is a decision taken for political expediency.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has succumbed to media blackmail by a section of the country. The decision by the government will not have any practical value because even before the declaration, they are being fought and treated as terrorists. So, it is just a nomenclature which I believe will not change the dynamics on the ground.\n\n\u201cIf you can remember, IPOB was also declared a terrorist organisation. The declaration was even backed by the order of the court. But as you can see even the international community did not recognise FG\u2019s declaration of IPOB.\n\n\u201cSo, it has failed to be effective or to achieve the desired results. They have not been banned from travelling to other countries while their citizenship remains intact, it has not been denounced. So, what type of declaration is that?\n\n\u201cI sincerely hope that Nigerians will not take the herdsmen as terrorists, but should regard the criminality of the few among them against innocent people as acts of terrorism just as we see IPOB and their attacks on security agencies and other northern citizens as acts of terrorism,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nHe argued that very few herdsmen were bandits.\n\n\u201cI hope this declaration will not give the license to people to be profiling herdsmen in general as terrorists and taking laws into their hands against them. It will cause more mayhem.\n\n\u201cThe declaration will not change anything; it will not change the dynamics. Already the military is engaging them. It didn\u2019t stop them from kidnappings and killings. The declaration will not end their aggression against the society.\n\n\u201cThe Fulani banditry is a socio-economic problem. We have seen it, we interacted widely with them. We told the federal government the way out. It can only be won through engagement, dialogue, and justice.\n\n\u201cThat is why today there is relative peace in the Niger Delta because the government has accepted the painful reality of rehabilitating and empowering them. There has to be equitable distribution of wealth in Nigeria and justice for everyone.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to accept it, before the issue of banditry that now affects all of us; the Fulani have suffered so much. They have lost their legitimate means of livelihood; I mean their cows through cattle rustling and extortion by security agencies.\n\n\u201cThat has to be addressed as a means of genuine reconciliation and integration. They should have (a) sense of belonging.\u201d\n\nAlso, in a chat with Blueprint Weekend, a security analyst, Odafe Christopher, said the declaration could make the bandits declare allegiance to local and international terrorist groups, thereby scaling the nature of their attacks.\n\nHe said, \u201cTerrorist is a generic term for those, who react with high velocity violence during criminal action. The court is in order. They are not agitating for anything, rather than to kill, destroy and rob people. Bandits come in 50\u2019s and their attack is always devastating.\n\n\u201cThey leave traces of blood, tears and sorrow. They kill, rape, maim and can totally exterminate entire community. They are presently contributing to food scarcity, as farmers are taxed before they can either plant or harvest their farm produce. This is causing serious food scarcity.\n\n\u201cThe approach is likely to be the same and format in use with attacks on Boko Haram. My fear is the pronouncements could make them upgrade and declare allegiance with existing Islamic notorious groups like Islamic State in West Africa (ISWAP).\u201d\n\nBeyond the declaration\n\nLikewise, speaking with this reporter, a lawyer and lecturer at Baze University Abuja, Mustapha Iliya, said it is unrealistic to expect that banditry will be ended simply because bandits have been re-labelled.\n\nIliya said, \u201cThe public debate about the aptness of re-naming bandits, and calling them terrorists, has ended in favour of those who favoured a re-naming. But the re-classification does not mean that banditry is about to become a thing of the past.\n\n\u201cIt is a new beginning for the old bandits as they struggle to understand their new category. It may well be that re-classifying bandits was based on a misperception. Banditry is not terrorism just because it looks like terrorism.\n\n\u201cUnder pressure from sections of the public, including federal lawmakers, the federal government needed to demonstrate greater seriousness in the fight against banditry. What is the difference between bandits and Boko Haram terrorists, for instance? Bandits are focused on sustenance, but terrorists seek political, religious or ideological results. The two are not the same thing, although they are similar because they terrorise the people.\n\n\u201cWill bandits become terrorists because they have been categorised as terrorists? Will they add political, religious or ideological objectives to their sustenance goals? It is noteworthy that the federal government is still fighting a war against terrorism that has gone on for more than a decade. This looks like the beginning of another war against terrorism.\u201d\n\nHe said further, \u201cObviously, the country has not won the anti-terrorism war. The war continues because terrorist groups in the country are still active. Indeed, the insurgency has been compounded by the involvement of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP). The insurgents are no longer only Boko Haram members.\n\n\u201cThe implication of the re-classification is that the war against terrorism will now include bandits. It will amount to the government fighting on two fronts. Fighting terrorists and fighting bandits who have been declared terrorists at the same time will further complicate the war against terrorism.\n\n\u201cRe-naming bandits as terrorists is a political stunt. It is yet another move by the federal government to make the public believe that it is serious about tackling the country\u2019s security crisis.\n\n\u201cIt is easy to change labels, and tag bandits as terrorists. But that does not change banditry, and it does not change terrorism. Perhaps, the government can afford to play word games, which is what this re-classification suggests, but the victims of bandits and terrorists know and feel the hell of insecurity. They need more than word games.\u201d\n\nMilitary action\n\nBlueprint Weekend gathered that following the declaration, the military is set to deploy Super Tucano aircraft and other sophisticated equipment in the North-west and North-central regions of the country against the bandits.\n\nThe military had been reluctant to deploy the aircraft outside the North-east because of the conditions attached to the sale of the aircraft by the United States, which was anchored on human rights.\n\nA source in the military also told a sister newspaper that the coast had become clear to deploy the Super Tucano aircraft against bandits in the North-west and North-central, following the court order declaring them as terrorists.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are waiting for instructions from the government for the next line of action. This was one of the things the Service Chiefs discussed with the President on Thursday morning. So, we await further instructions.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, a security expert, Christopher Oji, told this reporter that the court pronouncement will give the military impetus to deploy all their arsenal against the bandits.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe pronouncement gives definite combat approvals to security forces and a clear direction for international intelligence and security community in support against them. The pronunciation will make both positive and negative impacts.\n\n\u201cRemember the military had told the National Assembly it could not deploy the newly acquired Super Tucano jets and other military hardware to the North-west against bandits due to the agreement signed with the United States Government regarding human rights.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you the truth. I once asked a top officer in the Armed Forces why they had not deployed the Tucano in the fight against the bandits and he said that their hands are tied due to the human rights regulations regarding the aircraft.\n\n\u201cHe told us that the equipment is meant for the war against terrorists and insurgents and since these are bandits, they cannot be deployed.\n\n\u201cHe actually told me that once the bandits have been designated as terrorists, they would be wiped out. Don\u2019t forget that the bandits today are not different from Boko Haram, looking at their activities and the gravity of attacks by them.\u201d",

The relative said Sylvester was assaulted by some cult groups, who he mentioned their names before his death.\n\nThe relative revealed that the 12-year-old passed away on Tuesday after a series of tests and X-rays indicated that he sustained internal injuries from a severe beating.\n\nHowever, Dowen College in a press release that also went viral on social media expressed surprise at the allegation.\n\nThe school said his injuries were sustained while playing football.\n\n\u201cOn the 21st day of November 2021, one of the Hostel Parents reported to the management that the young boy was injured while playing football.

The doctor examined him and prescribed Ibuprofen for the pain, while the nurse massaged his leg, after which he felt a bit better,\u201d the statement signed by the school principal, Adebisi Layiwola read in part.\n\nThe statement claims that in accordance with the school\u2019s policy, \u201cthe resident doctor called the deceased\u2019s mother reporting the incident and requesting that she should come for him so that he could get further medical attention\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe mother, however, said she was not in Lagos while she spoke and prayed with him on the phone and promised to send the guardian to pick him up immediately for further medical attention.\n\n\u201cWhen the guardian failed to show up, the next day on the 23rd of November 2021, the doctor called the mother again and this time, she assured that his guardian would pick him from school.\u201d\n\nAccording to the school, \u201cthe guardian later showed up and took the deceased for X-ray, the result of which it said revealed that no part of the boy\u2019s body was broken or injured\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe resident doctor also called the mother later in the week to check up on his progress but she informed the doctor that he was sleeping at the time. The Principal also spoke with the mother on the phone to enquire about his progress and she reported that he was having a massage and gave the phone to him to speak with the principal,\u201d the statement added.\n\nMrs Layiwola said, \u201cit was therefore with a rude shock that it received the news of the student\u2019s death and the accompanying allegations.\u201d\n\nSylvester\u2019s Father\n\nIn an interview with TheCable, Sylvester\u2019s father explained that his 12-year-old son who was named after him and fondly called Junior, passed away while nursing multiple internal injuries alleged to have been sustained after he was bullied by his fellow students.\n\n\u201cMy son suffered. His birthday is next tomorrow (Dec 4). I\u2019ll celebrate it. I\u2019ll have a cake baked. I\u2019ll cut it on his behalf. The boys they mentioned were also reported to the school last term when they bullied Junior and collected all his foodstuffs; clothes. I have two daughters, one of whom earlier graduated. I had to remove the second after this incident. They asked this boy to describe the sister\u2019s privates and this got to us,\u201d the father said in an interview with TheCable on Friday.",
          "summary": "The Lagos State Government has ordered the indefinite closure of Dowen College, located in the Lekki area of the state.\nThis is pending the outcome of an investigation into the death of Sylvester Oromoni Jnr, a student of the school.\nThe Commissioner also called for calm, saying no effort will be spared in getting to the root of the incident.\nHowever, Dowen College in a press release that also went viral on social media expressed surprise at the allegation.\n\u201cThe resident doctor also called the mother later in the week to check up on his progress but she informed the doctor that he was sleeping at the time.",

The PSC assures Nigerians, that it shall continue to monitor global and specific country situations with a view to taking necessary measures to safeguard the health of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe PSC calls on all Nigerians to ensure that they have taken their full dose of COVID-19 vaccinations and to continue to observe compliance to public health social measures.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organisation said Omicron had been detected in at least 23 countries, including the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Denmark, Belgium, Botswana, Israel, Australia and Hong Kong.\n\nSeveral countries, including the UK, US and Germany have imposed travel restrictions on travellers from Southern Africa.\n\nLast Sunday, the Indonesian government said it would ban travellers from eight African countries, including Nigeria.\n\nThe federal government also formally endorsed the administration of booster dose of the COVID19 vaccine for Nigerians.\n\nA statement by the Head, Public Relations Unit of the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA), Mohammad Ohitoto, said: \u201cThe Presidential Steering Committee, in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Health and the National Primary Health Care Development Agency has approved the administration of booster doses for persons that have completed two doses of AstraZeneca, Moderna, Pfizer Bio-N-Tech or 1 dose of Johnson and Johnson.\u201d\n\nHe said that there must be time interval of six months or more after receiving the second dose of AstraZeneca, Moderna or Pfizer Bio-N-Tech.\n\nHe also said that the time interval of two months or more after receiving the Johnson and Johnson vaccine should be observed before taking the booster dose.\n\n\u201cConsequent upon the above, eligible Nigerians are advised to visit the nearest health facility or mass vaccination site for their booster doses as from the 10th of December, 2021 across all states of the federation,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the DG, NPHCDA, Faisal Shuaib, a COVID-19 booster dose gives greater protection against the virus and urged all Nigerians to take advantage of the opportunity offered by the federal government.\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Deji Elumoye, Onyebuchi Ezigbo and Olawale Ajimotokan in Abuja",

          "title": "Trump Faces Flurry of Investigations Beyond January 6 Probe",
          "text": "As Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers try to block the White House from releasing records to the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection, the former president faces a flurry of other investigations that could come to a head in the coming weeks and the new year.\n\nThat includes two major state criminal investigations \u2014 one in New York and one in Georgia \u2014 and lawsuits concerning sexual assault allegations, a fight over an inheritance and questions of whether he should be held personally liable for inciting the insurrection.\n\nTrump has long dismissed the investigations as nothing more than a politically motivated \u201cwitch hunt\u201d that began with the probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. But while Trump has spent most of his life dodging legal consequences, he is no longer shielded by the protections against indictment enjoyed by sitting presidents. And any charges \u2014 which would be the first against a former president in the nation\u2019s history \u2014 could affect both his businesses and his future political prospects as he mulls running for a second term.\n\nHere\u2019s the latest on where the cases stand:\n\nNEW YORK\n\nNew York prosecutors are investigating the former president\u2019s business dealings and recently convened a new grand jury to hear evidence after the previous panel\u2019s term ran out.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office is weighing whether to seek more indictments in the case, which resulted in tax fraud charges in July against Trump\u2019s company, the Trump Organization, and its longtime chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg. They are accused of cheating tax authorities through lucrative, untaxed fringe benefits.\n\nWeisselberg is due back in court in July 2022.\n\nTrump himself remains under investigation after District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., who is leaving office at the end of the year, spent years fighting to access the former president\u2019s tax records. Prosecutors have also been considering whether to seek charges against the company\u2019s chief operating officer, Matthew Calamari Sr.\n\nInvestigators working for Vance and New York Attorney General Letitia James have spent more than two years looking at whether the Trump Organization misled banks or tax officials about the value of the company\u2019s assets, inflating them to gain favorable loan terms or minimizing them to reap tax savings.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear that our investigation is active and ongoing,\u201d Vance said Tuesday.\n\nJames\u2019 office is involved in Vance\u2019s criminal probe and is conducting its own civil investigation.\n\nSeparately, Trump is facing scrutiny over properties he owns in the New York City suburbs. Westchester County District Attorney Mimi E. Rocah subpoenaed records from the town of Ossining as it investigates whether Trump\u2019s company misled officials to cut taxes for a golf course there, two people familiar with the probe told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nGEORGIA\n\nIn Atlanta, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis opened an investigation in January into possible attempts to interfere with the administration of the state\u2019s 2020 election, which Trump narrowly lost.\n\nIn letters sent in February to top elected officials in the state \u2014 including Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger \u2014 Willis instructed them to preserve all records related to the election, particularly those that may contain evidence of attempts to influence election officials.\n\nThe investigation includes a Jan. 2 phone call between Trump and Raffensperger in which Trump repeatedly and falsely asserts that the Republican secretary of state could change the certified results of the presidential election. A recording of the call was obtained the next day by multiple news organizations, including The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cI just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBecause we won the state.\u201d\n\nWillis has been relatively tight-lipped about the investigation, but her office has confirmed it is ongoing.\n\n\u201cAll available evidence is being analyzed, whether gathered by this office, another investigative body or made public by the witnesses themselves. A decision on whether criminal charges are appropriate against any individual will be made when that process is complete,\u201d spokesperson Jeff DiSantis said in an email.\n\nAmong the sources sure to be examined by Willis\u2019 team is a book written by Raffensperger and published Nov. 2. It includes a transcript of the Jan. 2 call with Trump annotated with the secretary of state\u2019s observations, including his belief that the president was threatening him at multiple points.\n\nWillis earlier this year said she was also interested in the circumstances surrounding the sudden resignation on Jan. 4 of Bjay Pak, the U.S. attorney in Atlanta. Pak told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had originally planned to stay in the position until Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, but resigned weeks earlier because of pressure from Trump.\n\nWASHINGTON\n\nThe attorney general for the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said early this year that district prosecutors were investigating Trump\u2019s role in the Jan. 6 insurrection and considering whether to charge him under a local law that criminalizes statements that motivate people to act violently.\n\nThere has been no indication, however, that that is likely. If Trump were to be charged, it would be a low-level misdemeanor, with a maximum sentence of six months in jail.\n\nLAWSUITS\n\nIn addition to the criminal probes underway, Trump also faces a number of civil suits, from scorned business investors, to his estranged niece, to Democratic lawmakers and Capitol Police officers who blame him for inciting the violence on Jan. 6.\n\nThat includes a lawsuit brought by the House Homeland Security chair, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, under a Reconstruction-era law called the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which prohibits violence or intimidation meant to prevent members of Congress or other federal officials from carrying out their constitutional duties.\n\nIn October, Trump was questioned behind closed doors under oath in a deposition for a lawsuit brought by protesters who say his security team assaulted them outside Trump Tower in the early days of his presidential campaign in 2015.\n\nTrump is also facing a defamation case brought by columnist E. Jean Carroll, who says Trump raped her in the mid-1990s in an upscale Manhattan department store. Trump has said that Carroll is \u201ctotally lying\u201d and that she is \u201cnot my type.\u201d U.S. Justice Department lawyers argued earlier this year that Trump cannot be held personally liable for \u201ccrude and disrespectful\u201d remarks he made about a woman who accused him of rape because he made the comments while he was president. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is set to hear oral arguments in the case Friday.\n\nTrump had faced a similar defamation lawsuit from Summer Zervos, a former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant who had accused Trump of kissing and groping her against her will in 2007, but she unexpectedly dropped the suit last month.\n\nSeparately, Trump\u2019s estranged niece, Mary Trump, has sued him and other family members, accusing them of defrauding her of millions of dollars of inheritance money. Trump has filed his own suit against Mary Trump and The New York Times over a 2018 story about his family\u2019s finances that was based partly on confidential documents she provided to the paper. He accuses her of breaching a settlement agreement that barred her from disclosing the documents.\n\nLawyers for Mary Trump filed paperwork Thursday seeking to dismiss her uncle\u2019s lawsuit against her.",

          "title": "Parents Captured after Son Charged in Oxford School Shooting",
          "text": "The parents of a teen accused of killing four students in a shooting at a Michigan high school were caught early Saturday, several hours after a prosecutor filed involuntary manslaughter charges against them, officials said.\n\nJames and Jennifer Crumbley were captured in a commercial building in Detroit that housed artwork, Detroit Police Chief James E. White told a news conference. White said the couple \u201cwere aided in getting into the building,\u201d and that a person who helped them may also face charges.\n\nA Detroit business owner spotted a car tied to the Crumbleys in his parking lot late Friday, Oakland County Undersheriff Michael McCabe said in a statement. A woman seen near the vehicle ran away when the business owner called 911, McCabe said. The couple was later located and arrested by Detroit police.\n\nA prosecutor filed involuntary manslaughter charges against the Crumbleys on Friday, accusing them of failing to intervene on the day of the tragedy despite being confronted with a drawing and chilling message \u2014 \u201cblood everywhere\u201d \u2014 that was found at the boy\u2019s desk.\n\nThe Crumbleys committed \u201cegregious\u201d acts, from buying a gun on Black Friday and making it available to Ethan Crumbley to resisting his removal from school when they were summoned a few hours before the shooting, Oakland County prosecutor Karen McDonald said.\n\nAuthorities had been looking for the couple since Friday afternoon. Late Friday, U.S. Marshals announced a reward of up to $10,000 each for information leading to their arrests.\n\nThe Crumbley\u2019s attorney, Shannon Smith, said the pair had left town earlier in the week \u201cfor their own safety.\u201d Smith told The Associated Press they would be returning to Oxford to be arraigned.\n\nHowever, White said the Crumbleys \u201cappeared to be hiding\u201d in the building where they were found. He added that the parents appeared to be \u201cdistressed\u201d when they were captured.\n\n\u201cHead down\u2026 just very upset,\u201d he said.\n\nThe couple was expected to be booked into the Oakland County Jail, McCabe said.\n\nEarlier, the prosecutor offered the most precise account so far of the events that led to the shooting at Oxford High School, roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Detroit.\n\nEthan Crumbley, 15, emerged from a bathroom with a gun, shooting students in the hallway, investigators said. He\u2019s charged as an adult with murder, terrorism and other crimes.\n\nUnder Michigan law, the involuntary manslaughter charge filed against the parents can be pursued if authorities believe someone contributed to a situation where there was a high chance of harm or death.\n\nParents in the U.S. are rarely charged in school shootings involving their children, even as most minors get guns from a parent or relative\u2019s house, according to experts.\n\nSchool officials became concerned about the younger Crumbley on Monday, a day before the shooting, when a teacher saw him searching for ammunition on his phone, McDonald said.\n\nJennifer Crumbley was contacted and subsequently told her son in a text message: \u201cLol. I\u2019m not mad at you. You have to learn not to get caught,\u201d according to the prosecutor.\n\nOn Tuesday, a teacher found a note on Ethan\u2019s desk and took a photo. It was a drawing of a gun pointing at the words, \u201cThe thoughts won\u2019t stop. Help me,\u201d McDonald said.\n\nThere also was a drawing of a bullet, she said, with words above it: \u201cBlood everywhere.\u201d\n\nBetween the gun and the bullet was a person who appeared to have been shot twice and is bleeding. He also wrote, \u201cMy life is useless\u201d and \u201cThe world is dead,\u201d according to the prosecutor.\n\nThe school quickly had a meeting with Ethan and his parents, who were told to get him into counseling within 48 hours, McDonald said.\n\nThe Crumbleys failed to ask their son about the gun or check his backpack and \u201cresisted the idea of their son leaving the school at that time,\u201d McDonald said.\n\nInstead, the teen returned to class and the shooting subsequently occurred.\n\n\u201cThe notion that a parent could read those words and also know that their son had access to a deadly weapon that they gave him is unconscionable \u2014 it\u2019s criminal,\u201d the prosecutor said.\n\nJennifer Crumbley texted her son after the shooting, saying, \u201cEthan, don\u2019t do it,\u201d McDonald said.\n\nJames Crumbley called 911 to say that a gun was missing from their home and that Ethan might be the shooter. The gun had been kept in an unlocked drawer in the parents\u2019 bedroom, McDonald said.\n\nEthan accompanied his father for the gun purchase on Nov. 26 and posted photos of the firearm on social media, saying, \u201cJust got my new beauty today,\u201d McDonald said.\n\nOver the long Thanksgiving weekend, Jennifer Crumbley wrote on social media that it is a \u201cmom and son day testing out his new Christmas present,\u201d the prosecutor said.\n\nAsked at a news conference if the father could be charged for purchasing the gun for the son, McDonald said that would be the decision of federal authorities.\n\nIn a video message to the community Thursday, the head of Oxford Community Schools said the high school looks like a \u201cwar zone\u201d and won\u2019t be ready for weeks. Superintendent Tim Throne repeatedly complimented students and staff for how they responded to the violence.\n\nHe also acknowledged the meeting of Crumbley, the parents and school officials. Throne offered no details but summed it up by saying, \u201cNo discipline was warranted.\u201d\n\nMcDonald was asked about the decision to keep Crumbley in school.\n\n\u201cOf course, he shouldn\u2019t have gone back to that classroom. \u2026 I believe that is a universal position.
