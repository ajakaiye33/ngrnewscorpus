          "title": "NANS president on his own, June 12 protest holds \u2014South-West students",
          "text": "The National Association of Nigerian Students, Zone D (South-West), has dissociated itself from a statement by the National President, Sunday Asefon, which announced the suspension of a protest the Association planned for June 12.\n\nThe NANS President had announced the suspension of the protest in a statement titled, \u2018NANS Suspends June 12 Protest Over Concerns About Safety Of Protesters And Fear Of Possible Hijack By Politicians \u2013 Comrade Sunday Asefon.\u2019\n\nHe said, \u201cHaving considered the current security realities and the danger to the lives of our members in case of possible hijack of the planned protest, I in consultation with all the structures of NANS, therefore, announce the suspension of our proposed protest for June 12.\u201d\n\nHowever, NANS Zone D, in a statement titled, \u2018June 12 Protest; Sunday Asefon On His Own As Students\u2019 Structure Are Prepared To Storm The Streets,\u2019 said Asefon didn\u2019t speak on behalf of the Association.\n\nThe statement was signed by the Coordinator, NANS Zone D, Kowe Odunayo Amos; and Secretary-General, NANS Zone D, Giwa Yisa Temitope.\n\nIt read, \u201cIt is most pathetic to read the statement issued by the President of NANS, Sunday Asefon calling for the cancellation of the June 12 protest which had been planned for and which has had preparations at top-gear for the execution of such. In fact, it must be put in proper perspective that the statement was issued in his personal capacity as the President of NANS and not on behalf of the association, hence, it does not reflect the position of Nigerian students because no consultation was made before such statement was issued. And, it is to this end he was careful enough to have made use of the first-person singular throughout the cause of writing the statement.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that just yesterday, while Sunday Asefon was busy mouthing the government\u2019s position, students and staffs of Kaduna Polytechnic were being kidnapped.\n\n\u201cAs we all know, June 12 is an annual ritual in the country to remember the day the peoples\u2019 right to freely elect their leader was buried. In fact, the day is not about MKO Abiola or any personality as such, but, about the Nigerian people as a whole. And, it is important to state categorically that the essence of tomorrow\u2019s agitation is to show our dissatisfaction as an association against the rising insecurity in the country, the increased inflation rate, peoples\u2019 inability to access health care amongst others and to also call on the government of the day to do more in securing the people of the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, if some persons somewhere are going around with the tag #BuhariMustGo, that does not mean that they have the capacity to send him out of the Presidential Villa which he presently occupies. Buhari can only be sent packing through an impeachment process on the floor of the National Assembly. So, rather than suspend an agitation because of the activity of some hoodwinked persons, we are duty-bound as an association to come out and clearly state what our position as an association is on the protest that had been called. And, if at all the NANS President has the interests of Nigerian students at heart, he should have used the occasion of his meeting with the IGP to demand the adequate provision of security personnel to protect students during the cause of the protest which is actually the duty of the Police. As an association, we are not preaching Buhari must go, we believe in one Nigeria but, the current challenges confronting us, security-wise is not encouraging.\n\n\u201cAs a Zone, we totally dissociate ourselves from the statement of the NANS President and call on SU bodies throughout the South West campuses to maintain the mobilisation which is on the ground. June 12 day of action is sacrosanct and we shall never for any reason succumb to blackmail of any sort. Our agitation is strictly a call for the Federal Government to abide by the social contract willingly entered into with the Nigerian people.\u201d",

This is why I say they are being hypocritical. Like I said, I don\u2019t like commenting on issues that have to do with relations with Nigeria and other countries but clearly speaking, they are being less than honest.\u201d\n\nMohammed said the Federal Government had constantly reached out to Twitter to bring down divisive comments like those of separatist leader, Nnamdi Kanu, who was fond of calling Nigeria a zoo.\n\nThe minister, however, said the social media platform never responded.\n\nHe asked Nigerians not to be deceived by foreign missions condemning the suspension of Twitter.\n\nMohammed added, \u201cWe have seen so many foreign missions come up to condemn the action of Nigeria. Nigerians, please, make a distinction between countries that are trying to protect their economic and commercial interests from those countries that genuinely love you and talking about freedom of speech and don\u2019t forget for one minute that it is because there is a country called Nigeria that there is freedom of speech.\u201d\n\nThe minister maintained that the Federal Government did not suspend Twitter because it deleted a tweet by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), which many found repugnant.\n\nOn the issue of Nigerians losing money to the Twitter suspension, Mohammed downplayed the complaints, saying that the Nigerian government was not generating any money in tax from the social media platform.\n\nHe said Nigerians must note that it is only when there is peace that business can take place.",

          "text": "The number one bestselling author and former aide to ex-president Goodluck Jonathan, Pastor Reno Omokri, said that President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s statement that crude oil sold for $100 from 1999 to 2014 when past administrations of former Presidents Goodluck Jonathan, Olusegun Obasanjo and Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua held sway is inaccurate.\n\n\n\nPastor Omokri, in a statement citing World Bank records, argued that the average crude oil sold withing the time cited by the president is not $100 but $61.7 per barrel.\n\n\n\nRecall that president Buhari, during an interview with Arise Television, said that \u201cI would like you to check how much we are earning from 1999 to 2014. From 1999 to 2014, our production (if you check you will find out that) every production was 2.1 million barrel per day. At the cost of 100 American dollar per barrel. So, from 1999 to 2014, we were earning 2.1 million times 100 dollar per day.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe president had said that past administrations failed to provide infrastructure for the country despite selling crude oil at $100 per barrel.\n\n\n\nBut Omokri, in the statement on Friday, claimed that the summations of the president was inacurrate.\n\n\n\nAccording to him:\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari, in a bid to defend his administration, has again spread misinformation regarding the records of crude oil prices under past administrations.\n\nCLAIM: Crude oil sold for $100 from 1999 to 2014: In an interview with Arise Television aired in the early hours of Thursday, Buhari said Nigeria\u2019s Brent crude oil sold for $100 between 1999 and 2014.\n\nIt should be noted that former Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo, late Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and Goodluck Jonathan, who are members of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ruled between the said period.\n\n\n\nBuhari had said that: \u201cI would like you to check how much we are earning from 1999 to 2014. From 1999 to 2014, our production (if you check you will find out that) every production was 2.1 million barrel per day. At the cost of 100 American dollar per barrel. So, from 1999 to 2014, we were earning 2.1 million times 100 dollar per day.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLook at the state of infrastructure. Look at our road. Look at rail. Look at power. And tell me which country develops without infrastructure,\u201d he said, blaming the PDP led government for the woes of the country,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nMeanwhile, checks have revealed that this was not the first time the President reeled out such figures. On October 1, 2016, the Nation\u2019s Independence Day, President Buhari, said that oil prices were \u201can average of 100 USD per barrel over the last decade.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe did in 2018 while campaigning for a second term in office, which he eventually got.\n\n\u201cI have challenged everybody in Nigeria to check in Europe, America and Asia that Nigeria was producing 2.1 million barrels per day at the cost of $100 per barrel. So, Nigeria was earning 2.1 million barrels, times $100, times 16 years,\u201d he said during a rally.\n\nHe also restated the same while receiving a delegation of the Buhari Support Organisation (BSO) at the Presidential Villa in the same year. \u201cWhen we came, it collapsed to $37-38 and it was oscillating between $40 and $54 sometimes\u201d, Buhari said.\n\n\n\nFact checks, including those by independent bodies, using relevant data, reveal the following verification:\n\nVERIFICATION\n\nData from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) culled from Statista, one of the world\u2019s leading providers of market and consumer data, showed the prices of bent crude between 1999 to 2014.\n\n\n\nIn 1999, the average annual price of crude oil was about $17.4 per barrel. It was $27.6 in 2000, $23.1 in 2001, $24.3 in 2002, $28.1 in 2003 and in 2004, it was $36.5. Oil sold for $50.5 per barrel in 2005, $61 in 2006, $69 in 2007, $94.1 in 2008, $60.8 in 2009 and in 2010, oil price was $77.3.\n\n\n\nThe average annual price of oil had reached a record high of $107 per barrel in 2011. It further increased to $109 in 2012 and dropped off to $105.8 and $96.2 in 2013 and 2014 respectively.\n\n\n\nFurther analysis showed that between the period under review, it sold for as less as $20 and as much as $109 per barrel.\n\nFor instance, by POLITICS NIGERIA\u2019s calculation, the oil price averaged between 1999 and 2014 is $61.7 per barrel.\n\n\n\nI also understand that Buhari\u2019s spokespersons, Garba Shehu and Femi Adesina, who were reached for clarifications on the president\u2019s figures did not respond to the enquiry sent via texts.\n\nVERDICT: Since records and POLITICS NIGERIA\u2019s analysis showed that crude oil sold for an average of $61.7 per barrel between 1999 to 2014, the President\u2019s claim of $100 per barrel is inacurrate.\u201d",

Despite the many challenges we are facing, I want Nigerians to rest assured that we will secure this country.\n\n\u2018\u2018We will secure our infrastructure, our highways, our communities and our forests. We will secure the lives of our people,\u2019\u2019 it further quoted him as saying.\n\nThe president told members of the Nigeria Police Force that government would strive to improve their welfare and capacity, but added that the citizens equally had expectations from them.\n\n\u2018\u2018First, let me commend the Inspector-General of Police and the entire Force for the recent efforts to restore peace to troubled parts of the country.\n\n\u2018\u2018I have charged the Inspector-General to leave no stone unturned in rebuilding the morale of his officers and men, especially in the aftermath of the mindless violence associated with the EndSARS protests as well as the recent spate of attacks on Police Stations in some parts of the country.\u201d\n\nWhile commending the governor for providing the security equipment and assets, the president noted that it would go a long way in boosting the morale of the Police and further enhance the capacity to fight crime and combat criminality.\n\n\u2018\u2018This is even more touching in the light of the unwarranted violence that ensued in the wake of the ENDSARS protests last October during which the security architecture in Lagos State was severely damaged,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe president added that it was commendable that Lagos State, the Centre of Excellence, had shown a truly resilient spirit in the face of the massive destruction it suffered last October.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2018You did not allow yourselves to be deterred by the severe setback; instead, you have bounced back and already boldly rebuilding the confidence of residents and investors in the State.\n\n\u2018\u2018I acknowledge the initiative taken to kick-start the rebuilding process, through the establishment of the Lagos State Rebuild Trust Fund, and through this very laudable effort by the Lagos State Security Trust Fund.\n\n\u201cI enjoin other State Governments to emulate your bold, proactive and resourceful initiative.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe president also reiterated that government was taking its constitutional oath to secure the lives and properties of the Nigerian people very seriously.\n\nHe said his administration is conscious of the fact that lasting security is a necessary foundation for business, investment and true prosperity.\n\nBuhari declared that no federal government, since 1999, had been as committed as his administration toward reforming and repositioning the Nigeria Police Force and national policing architecture.\n\n\u2018\u2018In 2019, I signed into law the Act establishing the Nigeria Police Trust Fund, the first in the history of the Force, to provide guaranteed funding to support Police welfare, logistics and equipment.\n\n\u2018\u2018In 2020, I assented to the Bill amending the Nigeria Police Act, which was originally enacted in 1943.\n\n\u2018\u2018This new Act, a vast improvement over the old one, among other things, spells out the modalities for the implementation of a National Community Policing Scheme in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018This new scheme will build confidence within our local communities and make them active stakeholders in the safety and security of their environs.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are currently recruiting 10,000 Police officers to reinforce our personnel capacity across the country.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has said his administration would reinstate cattle routes and grazing areas across the country to ensure that herders have free access for their animals.\n\nHe also directed the military and police to deal ruthlessly with insurgents and other criminals across the country.\n\nBuhari, who expressed confidence that the order would yield positive results within weeks, recalled that he had in the past visited Chad, Niger and Cameroon as part of efforts to promote good neighbourliness and security at the nation\u2019s borders.\n\nWarning that the country might experience food shortage, Buhari said there was the need to decisively tackle insurgents who are keeping farmers away from their farms.\n\nThe president also defended the administration\u2019s appointments, insisting that there were made based on merit.\n\nThe president, who expressed the hope that Nigerians would be fair to him while assessing his administration, also urged them to question previous regimes on what they did with the nation\u2019s humongous earnings.\n\nHe spoke, yesterday, during an interview with Arise TV.\n\nIn apparent response to the ban on open cattle grazing by the 17 Southern governors, he said when the governors gave the directive that open grazing would be banned, he referred them to the gazette that makes provisions for cattle routes and open grazing areas.\n\n\u201cWhat I told the governors was to ask them to go and dig up the gazette. There are certain routes and grazing areas so that when cattle rearers were moving from the north to the west, they were allowed to go through there. But if you allow your cattle to stray into any farmer\u2019s farm, you are arrested and the farmer is invited to submit his claims. Those who encroach on these cattle routes and grazing areas would be dispossessed. The problem is trying to understand the culture of the cattle rearers. The Governor of Benue said I am not disciplining the cattle rearers because I am one of them and I told him that the Nigerian cattle rearer doesn\u2019t carry anything more than a stick or a machete. But I can tell you that we are trying to resuscitate these cattle routes and grazing areas.\u201d\n\n\u2022Anti-graft war\n\nBuhari said fighting corruption in a democratic setting is a difficult task to accomplish.\n\nHe, however, stressed that his administration had succeeded in easing out corrupt public officials without making noise about it.\n\nBuhari recalled that much was achieved in the fight against corruption when he was military Head of State in the early 80s \u201cwhen a lot of people were sent to prisons before I was also booted out.\u201d\n\nThe president frowned at the way and manner local government system was being managed, saying the local government administration was almost non-existent in the country.\n\nHe cited situation where state governors continued to starve the local governments of funds saying \u201cin a situation where N300 million is allocated to local government and they are given N100 million is not fair\u201d.\n\n\u2022IPOB like a dot in a circle \u2014 we\u2019ll defeat them\n\nHe described the Indigenous People Of Biafra (IPOB) as a dot in a circle, saying the group is isolated in its call for secession.\n\nBuhari said he has been assured by the elderly people and the youths from the South-South that they have no intention of seceding.\n\nHe said IPOB will not have access to anywhere even if they eventually secede from the country.\n\nThe president then reiterated his statement that IPOB members will treated in the language that they understand.\n\n\u201cI was encouraged by what I heard, nobody told me. Two statements from the south south: one by the elderly people, they said this time around there would be no (secession). And again the youth made the same statement; such encouragement.\n\n\u201cSo that IPOB is just like a dot in a circle. Even if they want to exit, they\u2019ll have no access to anywhere. And the way they are spread all over the country, having businesses and properties. I don\u2019t think IPOB knows what they are talking about.\n\n\u201cIn any case, we say we\u2019ll talk to them in the language that they understand. We\u2019ll organise the police and the military to pursue them.\u201d\n\nIPOB has been agitating for the secession of the South-East.\n\n\u2022Bandits in N/East\n\nOn activities of Bandits and kidnappers particularly in the North West and North Central zones, President Buhari said he had given the police and armed forces instructions to be ruthless with bandits and vandals terrorising innocent citizens across the country.\n\nHe said he had told the security agencies to treat bandits and other criminals in the \u201cthe language they understand\u201d.\n\n\u201cProblem in the north-west; you have people over there stealing each other\u2019s cattle and burning each other\u2019s villages.\n\n\u201cLike I said, we are going to treat them in the language they understand.\n\n\u201cWe have given the police and the military the power to be ruthless. You watch it in a few weeks\u2019 time there will be difference.\n\n\u201cBecause we told them if we keep people away from their farm, we are going to starve. And the government can\u2019t control the public.\n\n\u201cIf you allow hunger, the government is going to be in trouble and we don\u2019t want to be in trouble.\n\n\u201cWe are already in enough trouble. So we warn them sooner than later you\u2019ll see the difference,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBuhari dismissed the assertion that majority of Boko Haram members were foreigners.\n\n\u2022State police\n\nOn call for the creation of state police, Buhari revealed that two governors from the South-West governors visited him with complaints about encroachment by herdsmen on farmlands in their states but he urged them not to be idle but that they should work hard to protect their states because that is why they were elected.\n\n\u201cTwo governors from the South West came to be complaining about herdsmen encroaching on their farms and I told them that they campaigned to be elected, so they should go back and secure themselves. They cannot go round and win elections and think that someone will do their jobs for them, so I sent them back.\u201d\n\nOn the calls by Southern governors for devolution of powers, the president said if the three tiers of government were working as they should, there would not have been such social problems. He said the local governments which are under the control of state governors are dead, which he says is bad for the country.\n\n\u201cThe local governments are virtually dead and it is not good for this country because if your local government is supposed to receive N300 million, they will sign that they have received N300 million but they will be given only N100 million. So our local governments are dead.\u201d\n\n\u2022Anti graft war\n\nWhen asked about the success of the fight against corruption which was one of his campaign promises, the President said that fighting corruption in a democracy is more difficult than fighting corruption under military rule. However, he said that despite that, if anyone he receives intelligence about anyone in his administration, the person will be held accountable and eased out.\n\n\u201cCorruption fight is very difficult under this system and even under the military system and luckily I have experienced both sides. When I arrested people, I put them in Kirikiri and said that they were guilty until proven innocent. I set up investigation panels based on geo political zones for political leaders and civil servants. Then people didn\u2019t get positions until they declare their assets but what happened? Eventually, I myself was arrested and detained. I will not change but the system is making it difficult as a court case can take 10 years to resolve. But I assure that despite the problem we are having with the system, whenever we have intelligence about anyone, we would hold him accountable and ease him out. We don\u2019t give it to much publicity. We don\u2019t tolerate corruption,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Zoning\n\nOn zoning the presidency, Buhari said nobody has the power to decide for the All Progressives Congress (APC). He said only members of APC has the power to decide the party\u2019s fate while reiterating that the acting leadership of the party is working to reposition the party.\n\n\u201cThe hope of this administration is to see APC last beyond it. Therefore we should allow the party to decide. You cannot sit here in Lagos, for instance and decide on the fate of APC on zoning. The restructuring of the party has begun from the bottom to the top with the membership card registration. Every member of the party must be involved. We will soon conduct our convention. No single member of the party will be allowed to go against the wish of the party. The political party has to know how many mewmbers it has state by state. This the right step to go about. This administration under APC has achieved a lot. Go look at what was on ground before we came in and now. My succession plan depends on the party. The party will sit and make decision by the constituency they want and so on. So, those who want to be president should better join APC,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Merit\n\nThe president also reacted to criticisms of nepotism and appointing more northerners in strategic positions. He faced backlash after the recent appointment of the Chief of Army Staff, Yahaya Faruk, who was picked over many of his seniors who had spent more years in service and were forced into early retirement as a result.\n\nHe denied the allegations, saying that his appointments are based on merit, not ethnic balancing or federal character and that he cannot jettison seniority and merit for balance and federal character. \u201cPeople who have been there for 18 years or even for 10 years, they trained in Zaria or in Abeokuta, they come through the ranks. And because they served under all the circumstances, the crises and everything and they gradually rise to that status and you think you just pick somebody just to balance up? These positions have to be earned,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022DFI\n\nWhen asked about his administration\u2019s plans to make Nigeria more attractive for foreign investments, the President said that youths would have to behave well if they want better jobs. He also alleged that the EndSARS protests were attempts by Nigerian youths to remove him from office and attributed the loss of foreign investment to the protests.\n\n\u201cThis question was answered when there were the EndSARS protests. You remember the young people who wanted to match here and remove me. I have ordered the members of the executive council to go to each state to speak to the governors, the traditional leaders, the business people to tell the youths that if they want jobs, they would have to behave themselves and make sure Nigeria is secured. This is so that people can come in to invest because people know Nigeria is secured. We are a rich country, and God had endowed us,\u201d he said.",
          "summary": "President Muhammadu Buhari has said his administration would reinstate cattle routes and grazing areas across the country to ensure that herders have free access for their animals.\nIn apparent response to the ban on open cattle grazing by the 17 Southern governors, he said when the governors gave the directive that open grazing would be banned, he referred them to the gazette that makes provisions for cattle routes and open grazing areas.\nThere are certain routes and grazing areas so that when cattle rearers were moving from the north to the west, they were allowed to go through there.\nThose who encroach on these cattle routes and grazing areas would be dispossessed.\nHe said the local governments which are under the control of state governors are dead, which he says is bad for the country.",

          "text": "Mixed reactions have trailed the president\u2019s pronouncements.\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) accused President Muhammadu Buhari of attempting to claim projects executed by previous administration headed by the opposition party .\n\nThe PDP noted that President Buhari bulged an opportunity to address salient issues confronting the country, by allegedly being evasive during the Arise interview.\n\n\u201cWe want to inform President Buhari, since he is not always aware, that successive governments elected on the platform of the PDP built on these development plans leading to the expansion of major trunk roads across our country, railways and other legacy projects which, probably, his handlers are making him to believe are his.\u201d\n\nFormer secretary general of the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers Union (NUPENG), Chief Frank Kokori, said the idea of grazing routes has been rejected by the south because it was a pre-independence arrangement, which has been overtaken by population explosion and its attendant developments.\n\n\u201cThere has been a population explosion which has rendered that arrangement useless in the south because most of those routes in the south have been overtaken by developments,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that the President\u2019s insistence would not have any effect as the ball was in the court of the governors and their state Houses of Assembly members.\n\nFor the National Chairman, Social Democratic Party (SDP), Supo Shonibare, the president can support whatever he likes but he has no powers to regulate grazing.\n\nHe noted that the best the president could do in the circumstance is to challenge the position of the southern governors in court.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary, Middle Belt Forum, Dogo Isuwa, said the president\u2019s statement should not be taken seriously because apart from the southern governors, Benue governor and some governors in the north have all banned open grazing.\n\nMeanwhile, the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) said the president was hypocritical and bias in mindset in respect to the South East.\n\nAccording to the pro-Biafra group, the president believed that with his kinsmen occupying the military and police positions of service chiefs including all the most senior military/police high rank offices/positions, he will easily crush Biafra.\n\nIt said Buhari was merely jittery of the impending collapse of Nigeria, alleging that the Hausa would soon start their revolution of self-identities.\n\nReacting, Ohanaeze Ndigbo said Buhari has a choice between dialogue and waging an avoidable war against Ndigbo.\n\nA statement by National Publicity Secretary, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Alex Ogbonnia said Ohanaeze president-general andother eminent Nigerians including former president Olusegun Obasanjo, Chief Edwin Clarke, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, Gen. T. Y. Danjuma, and Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, Senators Ike Ekweremadu and Enyinna Abaribe had urged the president to embrace the norms of democracy.\n\nOhanaeze recalled that Obiozor had at a world press conference in Enugu on June 4, reiterated the Igbo position that Ndigbo will not support break-up of Nigeria but Ndigbo will not be victims of Nigerian unity.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari has a choice between dialogue on one hand and an avoidable war against the Igbo on the other. Again, history shows that our thoughts are very infinitesimal to the immutable law of the universe.\u201d\n\nLeading Igbo groups, the Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) and Association of South East town Unions (ASETU) claimed Buhari had not repented in his avowed threat of annihilating the Igbo.\n\nADF advised him to play the role of a nationalist and a patriot instead of looking for excuses to play up his Fulani supremacist agenda.\n\nOn its part, ASETU said the statements from Buhari were troubling and not presidential.\n\nIts National President, Emeka Diwe and National Secretary, Gideon Adikwuru, who addressed newsmen in Enugu, said if the injustices against Ndigbo in Nigeria were erased today, the agitations will end the next day.\n\nIn his reaction, leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, expressed anger over Buhari\u2019s description of the South East as dot in a circle.\n\nKanu assured him that same dot in a circle will soon join the rest of the progressive countries as Committee of nations.\n\nReacting in a statement through the group\u2019s media and publicity secretary, Emma Powerful, Kanu: \u201cThe earth is also a dot within the galaxy.

          "text": "\u2022In ARISE NEWS exclusive interview, president orders security agencies to be ruthless\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nHe stated that the removal of service chiefs and the appointment of officers, who have been at the theatre of operation and command the respect of fellow soldiers will ease the insecurity in the country.\n\nHe described the security situation in the North-east and North-west as overwhelming.\n\nHowever, he said the government was on top of the situation, adding that bandits are now being treated as criminals and are currently suffering heavy casualties but are unwilling to admit it for fear of losing their recruitment constituency.\n\nHe said: \u201cTry and appreciate what the federal government has done. One, we have removed all the service chiefs and the Inspector-General of Police; made new ones. We allowed them to go round and see the problem. They have been part of it all the time but now they are in charge and we made sure that their priority is to make sure they bring normalcy. They have to accept the responsibility of their offices and perform. We are working very hard on this but we cannot give it much publicity so that we can take the criminals unawares.\n\n\u201cThe problem in the North-east and the South-south we understand them, but the North-west, same people, same culture, killing each other, stealing each other\u2019s cattle, burning their villages.\n\n\u201cAs I said, we are going to treat them in the language they understand. We have given the military and the police power to be ruthless and you watch it, in a few weeks\u2019 time there will be a difference- because we told them, \u2018if we keep people away from their farm, we are going to starve and the government cannot control the public.\u2019\n\n\u201cIf you allow hunger to permeate the whole society, the government will be in trouble and we don\u2019t want to be in trouble. We are already in enough trouble. I can assure you that sooner than later you will see the difference.\u201d\n\nThe president reiterated his commitment to go after the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Eastern Security Network (ESN) by treating them in the language they understand.\n\nHe added: \u201cI said it, and we will do it. My statement about speaking the language (they understand) is very simple. It is meant for all criminals in Nigeria. What it means for the IPOB is that I will go after them through the military and police and rid them of their criminal tendencies. I have no regrets whatsoever\u2026..\u201d\n\nOn allegation that his appointments of service chiefs were lopsided as they did not reflect federal character, Buhari said he could not be forced to appoint unqualified people.\n\nHe added: \u201cYou\u2019re saying someone who has gone through military and police training all his life should not be appointed to lead the military or police department he works with just because we must balance appointments? What are you saying? The system didn\u2019t restrict anyone from joining the military or the police, and if you decided not to join, we will not force you, but you too will not force us to bring someone who is not qualified in training and experience when it comes to leadership of these institutions just because we want to balance some appointments\u2026\u201d\n\nOn the appointment of Chief of Army Staff, Maj. Gen. Farouk Yahaya, Buhari stated that he could not just pick anybody because of seniority, adding that he appointed someone who has been in the military, worked and fought with the soldiers, and is well known to them.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen you look at NNPC, military, the people who have been there for 18 years or 10 years, trained in Zaria, or Abeokuta. They came through the ranks and because they served under all the circumstances and they gradually rise to that status. Those positions have to be earned. There are people who have been there for 10 to 15 years. When you join, you go through the programme and you rise through the system.\u201d\n\nThe president also downplayed the concerns over which region will produce his successor, saying his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), has the final say on whether his successor will emerge from the South or the North.\n\nAccording to him, the APC\u2019s recently concluded membership registration is designed to rid the party of godfathers and give members across board a say in the party.\n\n\u201cWe should allow the party to decide. I have just told you that we have started from the bottom-up and I gave the acting chairman the end of June to submit a report on the convention we are going to conduct and then arrange the general election, all elections till 2023. We have started this from the bottom up so that members of the party will feel they are involved in decision making. Nobody is just going to sit in Lagos and tell them what to do. This is what we are arranging.\n\n\u201cSuccession plan depends on the party. We are going to leave that to the party. The party will sit and make a decision by the constituencies that they won and so on. So, those who want to be president, they better join APC,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari added that the controversial railway to the Niger Republic will be of immense economic benefits to Nigeria.\n\nWhen completed, he said, Nigeria would benefit from the import and export trades of Niger Republic, which currently go through Benin Republic.\n\n\u201cHow many rail routes do you have? You have to cultivate our neighbours. If you don\u2019t, you will be in trouble. If you could recall, when I came on board, I had to go to Chad, Niger, and Cameroon, which was what happened with Boko Haram. If we were not on good terms with the three countries, Boko Haram would have done worst things to us than this. About Niger, our border with Niger is about 1,400 kilometres. On Niger, I have to tell you this: the Europeans in 1885 sat down with ruler and pencil and drew lines and I say I have first cousins in Niger Republic. There are Kanuris, there are Hausas, there are Fulanis in Niger Republic, just as there are Yorubas in Republic of Benin. You can\u2019t absolutely cut them off.\n\n\u201cBut the rail, look at the plan, if you watch the plan and why we are constructing the railway. Niger has discovered oil as you know and we don\u2019t want them to go through Benin Republic. We want them to come through Nigeria. We hope that they will send through Maradi all their exports, through Nigeria rather than through Benin Republic.\n\n\u201cWith the roads and the railways working, those from Maiduguri to Port Harcourt, those from Kano to Lagos and so on, definitely, if you make the infrastructure, road, rail, work, I can assure you that Nigerians will keep themselves very busy and they will leave you alone.\n\n\u201cBut when the roads are not working, the roads are virtually crippled, people will have so much time to harass you,\u201d he stated.\n\nOn how he will spend his time after his presidency in 2023, Buhari said he would retire to his farm.\n\n\u201cI have never avoided my farm. I still have got a number of cattle. When I leave, I will still, go to my farm daily. I will try and keep myself busy. Between now and then, I will keep on convincing Nigerians that I mean very well. I will make sure that the few identifiable problems that we have, security, economy, fight against corruption, we will continue to work on it, and as I said, visibly, we have made progress in the North-east, we have made progress in the South-south but I am overwhelmed almost in the North-west and they are going to get it very soon,\u201d he added.\n\nAsked what will be his legacy, he said: \u201cI will like Nigerians to discuss it, I hope they will be fair to me. I wouldn\u2019t like to say it myself. I will like Nigerians to try and spend time when we came, both the security and the economy, where we were for the eight years I may be around and try to look at it, I hope Nigerians will be fair to me. This is all I need.\u201d\n\nDirects AGF to Recover Land for Herdsmen\n\nOn efforts by his administration to resolve the crisis of open grazing, which is the main driver of farmer-herder conflict, Buhari said he had asked the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, to recover designated routes created during the First Republic for cattle movements.\n\nAccording to him, the land will be recovered from persons who have converted cattle grazing routes to personal use.\n\nHe said the grazing routes were designated in the First Republic when \u201cNigerians use to obey laws\u201d but those routes had been converted.\n\nWhen asked if he agreed with the AGF\u2019s position that the 17 Southern governors lacked powers to ban open grazing, Buhari said: \u201cYou want me to contradict my attorney-general?\n\n\u201cWhat I did was ask him to go and dig the gazette of the First Republic when people were obeying laws. There were cattle routes and grazing areas. Cattle routes were for when they (herdsmen) are moving up country, north to south or east to west, they had to go through there.\n\n\u201cIf you allow your cattle to stray into any farm, you are arrested. The farmer is invited to submit his claims. The khadi or the judge will say pay this amount and if you can\u2019t the cattle is sold. And if there is any benefit, you are given and people were behaving themselves and in the grazing areas, they built dams, put windmills in some places there were even veterinary departments so that the herders are limited. Their route is known, their grazing area is known.\n\n\u201cBut I am telling you, this rushing to the centre (sic) so I asked for the gazette to make sure that those who encroached on these cattle routes and grazing areas will be dispossessed in law and try to bring some order back into the cattle grazing.\u201d\n\nHe also condemned the reactions of Benue State Governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, who had accused him of failing to take actions against herdsmen because they are his Fulani kinsmen.\n\nAccording to him, although he is a Fulani, Ortom is being unfair to him.\n\nHe said he had told Ortom that the herdsmen perpetrating the attacks were not Nigerians.\n\nBuhari added that the Tivs, which form the majority in Benue, and the Fulanis had been engaged in cultural conflicts for a long time.\n\n\u201cThe problem is trying to understand the culture of the cattle rearers. There is a cultural difference between the Tivs and the Fulanis. So, the governor of Benue said I am not disciplining the cattle rearers because I am one of them.\n\n\u201cI cannot say I am not one of them, but he is being very unfair to me and I told him that the Nigerian cattle rearer was not carrying anything more than a stick sometimes with a machete to cut some trees and feed his cattle but those sophisticated ones move with AK-47.\n\n\u201cSo, from other areas, people rush to Nigeria you know and Fulanis from Mauritania and Central Africa look the same. So, they feel they are the Nigerian ones and I assure you that we are trying to resuscitate these cattle routes, grazing areas and make them accountable.\u201d\n\nBuhari urged the state governors to also find a lasting solution to the problem.\n\nOn when his administration will restore the operations of Twitter in Nigeria, the president deflected, saying he would keep that to himself.\n\nAsked if it was time for state police in the face of daunting security challenges facing the country, the president said in the past the traditional institutions were effective in tackling security.\n\nHe added that recently, two South-west governors visited him to complain about herdsmen encroaching on farmers\u2019 land in their regions.\n\nHe said he told the governors that \u201cyou know these people more than I do, and you are democratically elected to protect your people. Don\u2019t sit idly expecting me to do everything, take action.\u201d\n\nFighting Corruption in Democratic Setting Difficult, Says Buhari\n\nBuhari also said that fighting corruption in a democratic setting was a difficult task to accomplish.\n\nAccording to him, the war against corruption has not been easy for him since he became a democratically elected president.\n\nHe, however, added that his administration has succeeded in easing out corrupt public officials without making noise about it.\n\nBuhari stated that much was achieved in the fight against corruption when he was military head of state in the early 80s, adding that \u201ca lot of people were sent to prisons before I was also booted out.\u201d\n\nResponding to the clamour for devolution of powers, the president lamented that the local government system has been killed, adding that if the federal, state and local governments are operated as stipulated in the constitution, the country won\u2019t be in a crisis now.\n\nHe said: \u201cBut the problem is the local government has been virtually killed and this is not good for this country because those who became the local government chairmen have been compromised. If your local government is entitled to receive N300 million and later you are only given N100 million and the chairman will keep quiet\u2026..is that how we will continue?\u201d\n\nMore Personnel, Salary Increase for Police\n\nMeanwhile, the president yesterday disclosed that he has directed National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission (NSIWC) to carry out an upward review of salaries of policemen.\n\nThe president also stated that 10,000 new personnel are being recruited into the force, declaring that no administration since 1999 was as committed as his administration in reforming and repositioning the Nigeria Police Force and national policing architecture.\n\nBuhari spoke yesterday in Lagos at the official launch of newly procured security equipment, including hundreds of patrol vans for the state security agencies by the Lagos State Government at the Parade Ground, Police College, Ikeja, Lagos.\n\n\u2018\u2018In 2019, I signed into law the Act establishing the Nigeria Police Trust Fund, the first in the history of the Force, to provide guaranteed funding to support Police welfare, logistics and equipment.\n\n\u2018\u2018In September 2020, I assented to the Bill amending the Nigeria Police Act, which was originally enacted in 1943.\n\n\u2018\u2018This new Act, a vast improvement over the old one, among other things spells out the modalities for the implementation of a National Community Policing Scheme in Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018This new scheme will build confidence within our local communities and make them active stakeholders in the safety and security of their environs.\n\n\u2018\u2018We are currently recruiting 10,000 new Police officers to reinforce our personnel capacity across the country. In addition to this, I have directed the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission to carry out an upward review of Police salaries and benefits,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe reiterated his directive to security operatives to shoot-on-sight anyone found to be wielding AK-47 and other assault weapons.\n\nThe President also vowed that his administration will act firmly and decisively \u2018\u2018against any and all persons fomenting or carrying out attacks on our Police Force and other security personnel.\u2019\u2019\n\nBuhari warned that \u2018\u2018a nation that turns its Police personnel and infrastructure into targets of violence and destruction is a nation on the path of self-destruction.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2018As Commander-in-chief, my primary responsibility remains the security of the country and the safety of all citizens. Despite the many challenges we are facing, I want Nigerians to rest assured that we will secure this country.\n\n\u2018\u2018We will secure our infrastructure, our highways, our communities, and our forests, and we will secure the lives of our people,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President told members of the Nigeria Police that as the government strives to improve their welfare and capacity, the citizens equally had expectations from them.\n\n\u2018\u2018First let me commend the Inspector-General of Police and the entire Force for the recent efforts to restore peace to troubled parts of the country.\n\n\u2018\u2018I have charged the Inspector-General to leave no stone unturned in rebuilding the morale of his officers and men, especially in the aftermath of the mindless violence associated with the EndSARS protests, as well as the recent spate of attacks on Police Stations in some parts of the country,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Has a Choice Between War, Dialogue, Says Ohanaeze\n\nMeanwhile, the pan Yoruba sociopolitical group, Afenifere and the apex Igbo sociopolitical organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, in reacting to President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s statements during the interview, faulted his position on some of the issues he addressed.\n\nAfenifere described Buhari as a person who has sheer contempt for Nigerians and is an unrepentant tribalist.\n\nHowever, Ohanaeze Ndigbo urged him to embrace dialogue, because he has a choice between dialogue and war in the handling of the crisis in the South-east.\n\nThe Ohanaeze Ndigbo asked Buhari to use dialogue instead of confrontations in tackling the challenge.\n\nThe organisation lamented that Nigeria has come to a critical juncture \u201cwith the present level of violence in Nigeria, armed robbery, banditry, kidnappings, unknown gunmen, herdsmen menace, Boko Haram, mass poverty, unemployment, the downward spiral of Nigerian currency and other untoward signals.\u201d\n\nOhanaeze, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Chief Chiedozie Alex Ogbonnia said both history and literature had shown that the decision taken by a leader at a critical juncture had a lasting effect on society.\n\nIt added: \u201cPresident Buhari has a choice between dialogue on one hand and an avoidable war against the Igbo on the other. Again, history shows that our thoughts are very infinitesimal to the immutable law of the universe.\u201d\n\nThe statement said Ohanaeze Ndigbo had followed with deep concern the security sequence targeted at the Igbo; namely: \u201cThe deliberate posting of Northern military and police officers at the various strategic locations in the South-east, the special National Security Council meeting, where major decisions were taken for the South-east and the South-south to the utter exclusion of security personnel from the South-east of Nigeria; the ominous launching of the Operation Restore Peace in the South-east and South-south, the Shoot-on- sight order by the Inspector General of Police targeted at the Igbo youths, and the shocking tweet where Mr. President stated that \u2018those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the agitation by IPOB became heightened due to the exclusion of the Igbo in Buhari\u2019s government, adding that the president has not in any way hidden his disdain for those that failed to vote for him en-masse in 2015 and 2019 general elections.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo has cautioned that the unprecedented lopsidedness of the Nigerian government in favour of the Fulani, to the exclusion of other ethnic groups, especially in the security architecture, will rather exacerbate the internal security challenges in the country. History shows that leaders who espoused ethnocentric ideology, especially in Africa, had often created more problems than they intended to solve,\u201d Ohanaeze said.\n\nIt described the agitation by Igbo youth over marginalisation as justified.\n\nIt, however, added that in spite of the orchestrated alienation of the Igbo, it remains committed to a diplomatic approach towards a restructured Nigeria that guarantees equity, fairness and rule of law.\n\nAlso, the Secretary General of Afenifere, Chief Sola Ebiseni, said yesterday while reacting to Buhari\u2019s interview on ARISE News Channel, that \u201cfirst, his arranged interview on Arise Television is not a substitute for the clamour of Nigerians that the president, as the father of the federation, should speak to Nigerians in these critical times. \u201cSecondly, his engagement was full of lies, inconsistencies, contradictions and utter disrespect for the ethnic nationalities, including their elected governors. He is pathetically unschooled in the constitution which he often claims to guide him in spite of its manifest flaws.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s claim that his appointment in the armed forces is based on merit and seniority and not to satisfy geopolitical zones, is a violation of the letters and intendment of the provisions of Sections 217-220 dealing with the armed forces of the federation and appointments thereto.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, Section 217 (3) provides that the composition of the officer corps and other ranks of the armed forces of the federation shall reflect the federal character of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn Section 219, all the powers given the president, including the appointment of service chiefs, is subject to the Act of the National Assembly ensuring the reflection of the federal character. Even his latest appointment of the chief of army staff, is flawed particularly on seniority.\n\n\u201cThe constitution never contemplates nor approve of the situation under Buhari where 90 per cent of the commanding heights of the armed forces and security architecture will be from only Northern Nigeria and only the two zones of North-east and North-west\u201d.\n\nAfenifere accused Buhari of taking delight in ridiculing the Ndigbo, which he used IPOB to represent.\n\n\u201cThus, to him, the Igbo and their territory is just a dot in a circle of the map of Nigeria, which even if they secede, could exit to nowhere since the elders and youths of the South-south had assured him of not being part of the secessionist agenda. He couldn\u2019t have been reacting to the IPOB but the Igbo who he said had businesses everywhere. His utterances were very un-presidential and in the mode of common expressions with some unidentifiable northern organisations.\u201d\n\nAfenifere stated that Buhari owned up to the statements of his media aide, Garba Shehu, that the ban on open grazing by the governors was illegal.\n\nIt said the president contradicted himself when he admitted that he asked two of the South-west governors to exercise \u201ca non-existent powers\u201d to deal with terrorists herdsmen who he acknowledged bear arms, even as foreigners against Nigerian citizens.\u201d\n\nAfenifere regretted that the president \u201chas no solution rather than the braggadocio of re-opening grazing routes in states by repossessing such lands for his beloved herdsmen.\u201d\n\nIt added that the Yoruba people are solidly behind their governors, adding that not an inch of land in the territory will be carved out for any grazing reserves.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Pompeo Tackles FG, Says 1,500 Christians Killed in 2021",
          "text": "Ejiofor Alike\n\nThe immediate past United States Secretary of State, Mr. Mike Pompeo, has said that no fewer than 1,500 Christians have been killed in Nigeria since the beginning of 2021, while others are being held hostage.\n\nPompeo, who is also a former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, (CIA), in an article titled, \u2018The Persecution of Christians in Nigeria Demands Our Attention,\u2019 which was published by the American Centre for Law and Justice (ACLJ) on Wednesday, accused the federal government of not doing enough to protect religious freedom.\n\nHe said the Nigerian government had downplayed the attacks on Christians, by characterising them as conflicts between herders and farmers rather than as religiously motivated acts of terror.\n\n\u201cAt least 1,500 Christians have already been killed in Nigeria during 2021, and even more, have been kidnapped and are either being held hostage or trafficked. The attacks are brutal. Armed radical Islamic groups arrive in a village during the night, kill the men, rape and murder the women, and kidnap the children. The Nigerian government thus far has sought to downplay the attacks, characterising them as conflicts between herders and farmers rather than as religiously motivated acts of terror,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged the federal government to hold terrorists accountable for such characterisations.\n\nHe stated that since \u201cNigeria has the largest Christian population of any African country \u2013 over 80 million, nearly half of its people \u2013 it is essential that this persecution is snuffed out before it becomes even worse.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, every single day in Nigeria, Christians are not allowed their right to religious freedom, and are being murdered because of their faith in Jesus.\n\nHe said no society that denied its people the right to worship according to their beliefs, or that allowed that right to come under attack without consequence could claim to be truly good.\n\nPompeo said: \u201cWhere religious freedom is denied or ignored, you can be sure that tyranny and oppression are soon to follow. That is why a foreign policy that takes seriously the issue of ensuring religious freedom around the world is critical to serving America\u2019s interests. It is why the ongoing persecution and martyrdom of Christians in Nigeria demands our attention and action.\u201d\n\nHe said in 2018, 110 schoolgirls were kidnapped by Boko Haram, and when a deal was sealed to free most of the girls, only one was held back, Leah Sharibu.\n\n\u201cThis unbelievably brave and faithful girl refused to renounce her faith as a Christian; and for that reason, Boko Haram refused to release her and condemned her to slavery. Three years later, she is still being held as a slave by this cowardly terrorist cell in North-east Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nPompeo described Sharibu\u2019s story as tragic, infuriating, and emblematic of a troubling trend of Christian persecution in Nigeria.\n\nCiting Open Doors\u2019 Country Report, Pompeo said more Christians were murdered for their faith in Nigeria than in any other country in the world.\n\nAccording to him, the number of Christians murdered in Nigeria increased by 60 per cent in 2020.\n\nHe said he had personally met with Christian Nigerian leaders and heard their tragic stories of those who had been persecuted because of their faith.\n\nPompeo stated that during the Trump administration took the important first steps toward dealing with this serious issue in December 2020, when it added Nigeria to the State Department\u2019s \u201cCountries of Particular Concern\u201d (CPC) list.\n\nHe said the work done by the ACLJ was informative for the State Department when it began to evaluate whether or not to designate Nigeria as a CPC.\n\nHe said the team at the State Department recognised that the \u201cNigerian government was tolerating the systematic, ongoing, egregious violations of the religious freedom of its people, allowing them to suffer at the hands of radical Islamic terror.\u201d\n\nPompeo said the designation signaled to the Nigerian government that swift action on their part was needed to end the persecution, or there would be further consequences in the form of sanctions and increased diplomatic pressure.\n\nAccording to him, such a designation was part of the broader Trump administration\u2019s approach to take seriously violations of religious freedom around the world, which also included declaring the brutal policies of the Chinese Communist Party toward Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang as genocidal.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the tragedy in Nigeria persists,\u201d he added.\n\nPompeo said the ACLJ was actively engaged in the effort to raise awareness of and demand action regarding the ongoing atrocities committed against Christians in Nigeria.\n\nThe ACLJ, according to him, has filed its 18th written submission and made critical oral interventions at the UN Human Rights Council regarding the plight of Christians in Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m eager to engage in this work with them as we seek to put a stop to these ongoing tragedies. What is happening to Christians in Nigeria warrants serious action. America has always stood as a beacon for freedom, and we can only back up that responsibility if we take seriously our obligation to stand up for the rights of religious believers around the world. American civil society and the American government need to hold the Nigerian government accountable for its inaction in allowing terrorist organisations like Boko Haram to fester in their nation.\n\n\u201cIf the problem is allowed to persist, it will only spread and become worse throughout Africa and around the world. The killing must end.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "The Return to Igangan",
          "text": "DIALOGUE WITH NIGERIA by Akin Osuntokun\n\n\u201cI have been asked to speak to you all on the topic Nigerian Unity and Nation Building. Under normal circumstances that would have been considered an easy task to undertake. However, given that the circumstances in our times can no longer be considered normal in the light of the level of violence, criminality and divisiveness which is now our daily experience, the undertaking becomes a challenge and a dilemma. There was a time that some of our leaders especially in the military era would glibly tell us that Nigerian unity is non-negotiable. Most people in the present situation we find ourselves will consider such an affirmation not only hollow but clearly now as uninformed and ignorant. This situation would not have arisen five, ten or twenty years ago. So what went wrong and why?\u201d- Professor Anya. O. Anya\n\nWhatever becomes of the spiralling inter-ethnic (mutually assured destruction) cycle of violence in Nigeria, Igangan, Ibarapa in Oyo State, will be remembered as a turning point. Symbolically, Igangan has always been associated with critical phases of Yoruba history. Those familiar with this history will recall that at the institution of the Aare Ona Kakanfo in the sixteenth century, the first title holder of the unique institution was Kokoro Igangan. The warlord was said to hail from Iwoye but my gut feeling is that the coincidence of his name with the ancient town of Igangan was not accidental. The appointment was reserved for the best acclaimed warlord of the day and could be appointed from any part of the empire.\n\n\u2018It is a title akin to a field marshal, and is conferred upon the greatest soldier and tactician of the day. After installation, the Kakanfo leaves Oyo, the Alaafin\u2019s city for his own domain; it is forbidden that the Kakanfo and the Alaafin live together in the same town. In addition, the Kakanfo is required to wage war against any peoples and territories at the behest of the Alaafin, and is expected to win, or return a corpse\u2019. Like so many cultural innovations, the institution was a testimony to the sophistication of the Oyo Empire. And, ironically, when the empire was going to unravel, the Kakanfo (in the person of Afonja) proved to be its nemesis.\n\nIn a manner of speaking and given the rapid political retrogression of Nigeria back into its precolonial ethno national elements, the Yoruba appears to be reliving this history especially in the aspect of securing the realm against external aggression. It is what has given rise to warlordism encapsulated in the Sunday Igboho phenomenon. And we now talk more of charms than bullets as an instrument of prosecuting local wars.\n\nIn the contemporary experience of the savage humiliation to which the Yoruba have been subjected right in their regional homestead, there is not much that is exceptional about Igangan. What is exceptional was the long imagined retributory response mounted by a counter Yoruba militia spearheaded by Igboho. Hitherto pummelled and stupefied into inaction and self-pity and endlessly betrayed by a conniving (by omission or commission) Nigerian security forces, the response captured the imagination of the Yoruba community and ignited a spirit of militant nationalism. In the circumstance, the Igboho embodied rebellion was a direct consequence of this connivance (running the gamut of wilful neglect and covert complicity) of a compromised Nigerian security establishment.The Alaafin of Oyo recently lamented the futility of seeking the law and order intervention of the Nigerian police into crimes involving the fulani who appeared to enjoy a licence to impunity and would sooner be spared of any penalty regardless the severity of the crime at issue. It was a fraught situation that brought to the fore the legitimate imperative of recourse to self-help and self-defence.\n\nGeneral Theophilus Yakubu Danjuma had captured the moment a few years ago: \u201cThe armed forces are not neutral. They collude with the armed bandits that kill people, kill Nigerians. They facilitate their movement. They cover them\u2026If you are depending on the armed forces to stop the killings, you will die one by one,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe ethnic cleansing must stop in Taraba State. It must stop in all the states of Nigeria, otherwise Somalia will be a child\u2019s play. I ask everyone of you to be at alert and defend your country, defend your territory, defend your state. You have nowhere else to go,\u201d he further added.\n\nTaking the cue in Igangan, the compound and properties (including several luxury vehicles) of the suspected godfather of the Fulani kidnap-for-ransom-consortium, the Seriki Fulani were torched and burnt down. He was declared persona non grata and banished from the community along with his proteges and sundry field operatives. There was bound to be a reprisal attack and the surprise was that when it came, it caught both the Igboho guerilla army and the regular security forces pants down. More shocking was the disproportionate scale of the violence, in magnitude and sheer savagery, reminiscent of the Fulani militia campaign of terror and pacification in the Middle Belt region. Obadiah Mailafia sounded the early warning system.\n\nAbout a week ago, the Oyo State Amotekun Commander, Kunle Togun, similarly raised the alarm (that the worst is yet to come) that was more remarkable for its potential to obfuscate and misdirect. There was an inherent exculpation of domestic Nigerian component in his obsessive attribution of all that is going awry in the South-west to non-Nigerians. \u201cThe foreign Fulani herdsmen have invaded South-west. There is nowhere in the South-west that they are not. They are there. \u201cThey are the Okada riders. They are the ones using wheelbarrows to sell carrots and other things. I said they are foot soldiers. They said they have come in to take the inheritance given to them by Allah and that is Nigerian land, particularly South-west. So, they will still strike. I am not just screaming aloud. So, everybody has to be ready\u201d. The question then arises, is the Seriki Fulani of Igangan a foreigner? Are his accomplices including the notorious Wakili from Mali and Niger? To the contrary, many of those caught have identified and have been identified as Fulani with deep roots in Nigeria including, for that matter, the Yoruba society (especially Ilorin) dating back generations.\n\nAdding to the confusion is the enactment (of the precedent of Moses and the Israelites) who were given to renouncing their liberation at the encounter of any difficulties in their journey to freedom. And so, with the savage reprisal attack on Igangan has come the criticism and strictures blaming Igboho for initiating the rebellion to begin with. In the affectation of wisdom and sobriety and beyond the specific instance of Igangan, there have been remonstrations from those who identify with the status quo that coming to terms with cohabitation in hell can be a better option than the uncertain promise of heaven. As if anyone has cultivated belligerence and bellicosity as second nature and goes around looking for war as hobby. Short of the philosophy of turning the other cheek it is difficult to see what options are left for the oppressed confronted with the perennial menace of a murderous bully. In all of this, there is the psychological injury to the victims. They are liable to wonder if it is conceivable that a group of Yoruba marauders would have the audacity to besiege Azare or Daura the way the criminal Fulani militia are running rampant over Yorubaland.\n\nIn what is fast degenerating to an unbroken chain of violence and terror, it is near inevitable that in one form or another, a Yoruba response to this reprisal attack on Igangan is on the way especially if, typically, no one is called to account. The continuous radicalisation and escalation of the cycle of violence raises the question of how all this harvest of ill-wind will end. President Buhari has announced his preferred option in a revealing tweet and it is straight out from the civil war conquistador playbook.\n\n\u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of thedestruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War. Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in\n\nthe language they understand,\u201d. First, the fact that the social media tech giant, Twitter, deems it fit to delete this tweet and cite it as \u2018abusive behaviour\u2019 towards the Igbo, tells a familiar story of Buhari. It corroborates his well documented penchant for violent verbiage. You will recall such bloody minded threats as the \u2018dog and the baboon will soak in blood\u2019. \u2018I can die for the cause of Islam if necessary. We are ready to fight another civil war\u2019. For those at the pinnacle of the federal alliance power structure that prevailed in the war, resort to this \u2018might is right\u2019 precedent is always a irresistible temptation. The perennial utility of the threat to \u2018national unity\u2019 has come in handy as a blank cheque on which any pretext for scapegoating a convenient victim and target can be requested. Those who like Buhari are given to hacking back to the civil war and national unity in this proprietorial manner should be asked what are the lessons Nigeria should learn from this defining tragedy. That any evil is justified in the self-serving pursuit of the distorted notion of national unity as an end unto itself? Shouldn\u2019t we be told that prior to the declaration of Biafra secession, another group of Nigerians were openly contemplating Araba and the other verbalised the intention to follow suit if Biafra becomes a reality? I have always held the opinion that (on the template of equity and justice) if the Igbo should be blamed, it can only be for not being in a position to actualise its justified aspiration. At the end of the day what made the difference was not the moral imperative of sustaining a desirable and worthy national unity but that a protagonist was in a position to enforce its will and the other was not. If Nigeria is ever to transcend this balance of terror predicate, it would have to learn that the road to enduring national unity does not go through the barrel of the gun and the imposition of unrestrained regional hegemony.\n\nQUOTE\n\nIf Nigeria is ever to transcend this balance of terror predicate, it would have to learn that the road to enduring national unity does not go through the barrel of the gun and the imposition of unrestrained regional hegemony.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Seven months after taking up an initial 20% stake in BetKing, South African pay TV operator MultiChoice plans to increase its shareholding in the online gambling company to 49% in a $281.5 million deal.\n\nBetKing is the trading name of Blue Lake Ventures Limited, a pan-African sports betting and entertainment business with major operations in Nigeria. The value of MultiChoice\u2019s initial investment in BetKing was said to be worth more than $100 million.\n\nThe decision to double down on the gambling company, approved by the MultiChoice board on Thursday, is in line with the company\u2019s strategy to expand its entertainment ecosystem and develop meaningful drivers of future value, a statement from the South African entertainment giant reads.\n\n\u201cConsumers have a growing abundance of entertainment options available to them. It is therefore important for MultiChoice to maintain its relevance and grow its share of engagement time and consumer spend by expanding its entertainment platform with a more comprehensive offering and a greater number of products and services,\u201d the company said, explaining the rationale behind its increased investment in BetKing.\n\nAccording to MultiChoice, pursuing an adjacency such as sports betting creates a \u201cnatural extension\u201d to its video entertainment platform to further enhance its product offerings. In other words, sport betting augments the company\u2019s business given sports is a major revenue source.\n\nWidely known as one of the leading sports betting sites in Nigeria, BetKing was founded by CEO Byron Petzer and Adekunle Adeniji, who once served as Bet9ja\u2019s virtual product manager.\n\nBetKing\u2019s annual statement for the financial year ended December 2020 shows a growth in revenue to $77.9 million, from $54.7 million in the previous year. Meanwhile, net asset value stood at $100.2 million.\n\nIt is thus not hard to see the appeal in investing in the major sports betting company also considering that the market is growing significantly globally. Between 2020 and 2024, the industry is expected to grow by more than $134 billion, a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 10%, according to Technavio.\n\nSeveral sports betting companies currently operate in this part of the world too. In Nigeria, some popular names apart from BetKing include Bet9ja, Nairabet, Naijabet, Sporting Bet, Surebet24, etc.\n\nIn 2018, it was reported that an estimated 60 million Nigerians between the ages of 18 and 40 were involved in active sports betting. Also, almost \u20a62 billion was spent on sports betting daily in Nigeria, equivalent to nearly \u20a6730 billion in a year. Yet, Africa accounts for only 2% of global sports betting revenue. As the regional market begins to play catch up, it is poised for significant growth.",

          "text": "With decentralised digital currencies like bitcoin becoming increasingly popular, the world\u2019s central banks have \u2013 in the past two years at least \u2013 been working towards developing government-backed digital currencies.\n\nNigeria may pilot an official digital currency in 2021, going by the words of Rakiyat Mohammed, a Central Bank Director in charge of the Information Technology Department, who revealed on Thursday that the banking regulator will soon launch a digital currency.\n\nA Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) represents a country\u2019s official currency in digital form. As against printing money, the apex bank issues electronic coins and notes that are backed by the government, unlike existing cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria has made \u201ctremendous progress\u201d exploring the technology for digital currency for over two years now, Mohammed revealed at a press briefing after a meeting of the Bankers\u2019 Committee. \u201cBefore the end of the year, the Central Bank will be making a special announcement and possibly launching a pilot scheme in order to be able to provide this kind of currency to its populace.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes on the back of efforts by Nigerian authorities targeted at regulating the use of decentralised cryptocurrencies in the country. The apex bank in February directed all local banks to close accounts linked to crypto platforms.\n\nDespite the clampdown, Nigerians continue to use digital currencies as a store of value and remittance tool and in a change of tone, the CBN governor later clarified that crypto trading is not banned in the country.\n\nWhy would the CBN get into virtual currencies?\n\nAccording to the CBN director, about 80% of central banks in the world are currently exploring the possibility of issuing central bank digital currency and Nigeria could not be left behind.\n\nChina in April 2020 became the first major economy to pilot a digital currency and is working towards achieving a wide, domestic use of the digital yuan by the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nLast year, the Bahamas launched the world\u2019s first central bank digital currency. Other countries where national digital currency trials are ongoing include Indonesia, Norway, Japan, Sweden and South Korea and in Africa, Egypt, South Africa, Ghana, Morocco and Kenya are exploring the technology\u2019s feasibility.\n\nBeyond just following the global trend, there are lots of potential reasons for the planned rollout of an official digital currency in Nigeria later this year.\n\nThe CBN director particularly cited the need to make remittances travel easier from abroad to Nigeria as one motivation. \u201cWe all know how money has to travel for someone to send money from Nigeria to abroad and it is a huge money in Africa,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nWhen it eventually becomes operational, the digital currency will complement the existing forms of currency in the country and could help reduce the high cost of managing and transferring cash.\n\nDigital currency could also boost financial inclusion as those unbanked can get easier and safer access to money through their phone. A recent report by the Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFiNA) shows that Nigeria did not meet its financial inclusion targets for 2020 and at the current rate, they might not be achieved anytime soon.\n\n\u201cWe know that the recent report by EFiNA was that our target was to achieve 80% financial inclusion. We are about 60% and at the rate at which we are going, we are not going to meet this target,\u201d Mohammed said, adding that the Central Bank digital currency could \u201caccelerate\u201d the CBN\u2019s ability to meet this target.\n\nAfter the announcement, the apex bank will now explore technological options and engage various industry players, as well as move to the next stage of proof of concept to pilot the scheme, according to the CBN director.",
          "summary": "Nigeria may pilot an official digital currency in 2021, going by the words of Rakiyat Mohammed, a Central Bank Director in charge of the Information Technology Department, who revealed on Thursday that the banking regulator will soon launch a digital currency.\nA Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) represents a country\u2019s official currency in digital form.\nAccording to the CBN director, about 80% of central banks in the world are currently exploring the possibility of issuing central bank digital currency and Nigeria could not be left behind.\nLast year, the Bahamas launched the world\u2019s first central bank digital currency.\nWhen it eventually becomes operational, the digital currency will complement the existing forms of currency in the country and could help reduce the high cost of managing and transferring cash.",

          "title": "What is a VPN and how does it work in Nigeria?",
          "text": "Virtual Private Networks (VPN) are all the rage right now in Nigeria since the government banned Twitter. The rise in popularity of VPNs has brought up questions about how exactly they work.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about how VPNs work.\n\nOn the internet, different computers send and receive information between Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Think of it as sending items between two or more physical addresses. When we surf the internet with our IP address, different websites will know specific information about us such as our location, device type, browser and operating system.\n\nWhat does a VPN do?\n\nWith VPNs, our IP addresses change and online activities are hidden.\n\nBefore turning on my VPN, my device was in Lagos, Nigeria\n\nAfter turning on my VPN, my device is in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic\n\nThe images above show how my location changed from Nigeria to Dominican Republic after turning on my VPN.\n\nThink about it this way: The internet is like a highway that connects different cities across different countries. These highways are mostly public roads that many people use. If you drive on a public road anyone can follow you and track where you go, how long you spend at your destination, and when you return. They might even be able to spy inside your car and learn more about you.\n\nWith a VPN, you have your own private tunnel/road. A tunnel where no one can see what you\u2019re doing or where you\u2019re going.\n\nWhat can a VPN do for you?\n\nNo monitoring: As we mentioned earlier, your internet service provider (ISP) can see your internet traffic and probably log your browsing history. With a VPN, information about your activities online are scrambled in an encrypted tunnel so that external parties, your ISP included, can\u2019t read it.\n\nAccess any site: Every now and then, websites or services you want to use may be inaccessible from your location. VPN enables access to these sites or services from anywhere. If a website isn\u2019t available to devices located in Nigeria, VPNs can change your device location to a different country which has access to this website.\n\nProtection: Free public Wi-Fi might make you forget all your life\u2019s problems but it can also be the beginning of a new set of problems. Public Wi-Fi can easily be accessed by hackers on the same network, who can read your personal data. A VPN encrypts your entire internet connection to protect all your communications, even over unsecured networks.\n\nWhat is the difference between a VPN app, a VPN plugin, and a VPN browser?\n\nCurious about which you should use? VPN browsers or browser plugins only protect your web browser traffic. Note, however, that the rest of the network traffic from your device is still exposed to internet service providers and potential hackers. A VPN app encrypts and protects all network traffic from your device.\n\nIs it safe to use a VPN for online banking?\n\nYes\u2013 but ensure you are using a reputable VPN service. VPNs help protect your privacy while you perform online banking transactions. But remember, a VPN is a tunnel that encrypts your data. It cannot protect you from viruses or guarantee that you won\u2019t be hacked. Remember to create a strong password and adhere to online safety measures.\n\nWhat else should I know about VPNs?\n\nVPNs aren\u2019t without flaws. They have their fair share of practical drawbacks. Internet speed can be slower because VPNs have to reroute and encrypt your data while sending and receiving information between your device and a website.\n\nAlso, some sites and services look at VPN traffic as suspicious and won\u2019t let you connect. It becomes suspicious when a device is in different locations within a short time \u2014 in New York, Lagos and Tokyo within an hour. This could become a real problem, especially when it\u2019s your bank that blocks you.",

          "title": "Fostering Gender Inclusion in Technology with the Bolt Drive4WITech Initiative",
          "text": "The journey into tech for women in Africa is an ongoing discussion largely influenced by cultural norms and societal expectations concerning gender. Bolt, an inclusive mobility company, recognises this and as part of efforts to drive participation and inclusion for women in technology, launched the #Drive4WITech (Drive for Women in Tech) initiative to support young women in Africa. The initiative is an immersive internship programme for young women to challenge the status quo and kickstart a career in the tech space. The goal for Bolt is to equip the interns with preliminary knowledge and hands-on tools required to expand their career paths into areas in technology.\n\nFrom the vast number of applicants across Africa, nine interns were selected with three from Nigeria. Two of them \u2013 Onyekachukwu Orji and Oluwakorede Oseni spoke about their experience. The interns chosen are made up of undergraduate and post-graduates across different interests.\n\nQ: Among the many applications received, you were selected to intern with Bolt in the #Drive4WITech initiative. How did you feel when you were selected?\n\nOluwakorede: I was excited when I was notified that I had been selected. I saw this as an opportunity to work with a global and inclusive brand that is committed to solving the mobility challenge in Africa. It is an opportunity I have been waiting.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I felt elated to have been selected. I have always been curious about what it would feel like working at Bolt. I am happy and satisfied with the knowledge I have gained during my time as an intern.\n\nQ: What area did you specialise in during the programme?\n\nOluwakorede: I supported the marketing team at Bolt Nigeria. This provided me with a basic understanding of the necessary skills needed to supervise teams, programmes, and strategically plan for maximum impact.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I specialised in City Operations. I worked closely with Heads of Departments to build strategic solutions to issues as they arose, and it has helped me develop core competence in identifying and resolving issues.\n\nQ: Tell us about the experience and the new skills you learnt during the programme?\n\nOluwakorede: I had a great experience working at Bolt. In the marketing department, I discovered that marketing plays in promoting business goals and driving sales of products or services. Some of the skills I learnt include creative writing and how to structure the language of blogs and messages, using Emails and push notifications to pass across a clear message. I also learnt how to research and identify the organisation\u2019s target audience which helps in crafting content.\n\nOnyekachukwu: My experience was very exciting. I learnt the importance of teamwork, communication, staying up to date on issues that concern the company, professionalism, time management and discipline. The most important thing I have learnt is the ownership mentality. I must act like I own the business, that way, I would be at my best to ensure that everything runs smoothly and the business stays functional. To observe and think of ways to improve the business, it is paramount to communicate doubts and concerns where necessary. In addition, ask for clarity when in doubt and always being courageous enough to say when or where I lack knowledge. I have also developed analytical skills.\n\nQ: What impact has Drive4WITech had on you and how will it enhance your career?\n\nOluwakorede: The programme was very impactful. It exposed me to the importance of marketing and the role it plays in the business world. I am more confident, and I believe I more versatile and can provide useful insights. With all these learnings, I am positive of adding immense value in my future roles.\n\nOnyekachukwu: The skills I learnt will play an instrumental role in helping me to build a successful career. I am more equipped to confidently make significant contributions to my future work team.\n\nQ: How do you plan to use the knowledge gained to your advantage in the tech industry?\n\nOluwakorede: I aspire to own a tech company and to run the company successfully. I have learnt that it is important to manage the brand\u2019s image and proper representation of the brand. I want to use the knowledge gained to build my brand having realised that there is a misconception by tech enthusiasts about other fields. So, the knowledge will be very instrumental to my success in the industry.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I plan to pursue a career in data analytics. With the knowledge gained, I will be able to help businesses optimise their performances and make better consumer decisions, while leveraging on trends and insights for a better customer experience.\n\nQ: Did you have any challenges interning at Bolt?\n\nOluwakorede: A major challenge was writing and developing content because I initially had little knowledge about how to structure and develop detailed content with accurate language to pass across the right message. However, with the support of my team members who constantly provided guidance, I was able to overcome the challenge and I can boldly say that I am better off than I joined.\n\nOnyekachukwu: No, the company made my internship as accommodating as possible. Whenever I felt overwhelmed, I reached out to my team for support. This has also helped me develop strong organisational skills, where I am more focused on important things.\n\nQ: The Drive4WITech initiative positions Bolt as an inclusive and diverse organization. How immersing was it for you?\n\nOluwakorede: It was very immersing and educating beyond a regular internship. The programme provided an effective vehicle for me to learn and grow. It also helped me develop strong work ethics that enhance productivity while building expertise working with a diverse team.\n\nOnyekachukwu: It was very engaging. Every team did their best to take us through their task and how they work. The operations team taught us several new processes in data analytics. From what was taught, I now understand more about data, how it is stored, and how to use it better. I also learnt how data can be used to tell a story and find useful insights.\n\nQ: Did the programme meet your expectations?\n\nOluwakorede: My experience during the programme exceeded my expectations as I did not expect to learn a lot from marketing. It was fun and challenging because there is always a new technique to learn, a case to study, and strategies to research which is very interesting.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I came in with a curious mind and some expectation to learn and practice analytical skills. Even so, the internship curriculum covered more than I expected. It was highly satisfactory.\n\nQ: What is that one thing you will miss about interning at Bolt?\n\nOluwakorede: I will miss the friendly environment and meetings where I am encouraged to share ideas and ask questions, motivating me.\n\nOnyekachukwu: I will miss the work culture and healthy workspace that encourages growth, as well as my team; especially Onyinye, Bimbo and Miracle.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nVictoria here.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing\n\nIncrease in fintech app installations\n\nApple Health features for the elderly\n\nPlentywaka partners with GUO\n\nIncrease in fintech app installations in Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya\n\nThe global fintech industry recorded impressive growth in 2020. This is according to the State of Finance App Marketing 2021 report by US-based mobile marketing analytics company, AppsFlyer. The report reveals that beyond funding, fintech app installations grew by160% in the last quarter of 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nigeria alone, loan app installations grew by 43.3%; financial services grew by 34.6%, and investment apps by 20.3%.\n\nSimilarly, Kenya saw 100% growth, and South Africa 52% growth, in fintech app installations.\n\nWhy this growth? The economic effects of COVID-19 led to the rise in fintech app installations.\n\nBesides, in Nigeria, about 56% of the population is unbanked. Also, the unfavourable regulatory conditions could have prompted some of them to make use of loan apps while they explored other financial services.\n\nInterestingly, the fintech space recorded a significant boom in marketing investment. Over 150 Nigerian fintech startups reportedly generate annual revenues of over $5 million.\n\nTo read more on the state of fintech apps, click here.\n\nApple introduces new iPhone features for the elderly\n\nApple, at its World wide developer conference (WWDC) event, announced new features for iOS 15 on the iPhone. The event which started on Monday, June 7 will end today, Friday, June 11.\n\nThoughtfully, among the new features, Apple introduced two health-focused ones \u2014 Walking Steadiness and ability to share health data with family members \u2014 for the elderly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy these features? Older people are prone to falling, and it is the major cause of accidents, injury, and death for older people.\n\nHow does it work? The feature intends to track people as they move through their daily lives.\n\nNot to be confused with fall detection on the Apple Watch, which prompts users to call emergency services, Apple says Walking Steadiness is different, as it focuses on prediction rather than response.\n\nThat is, it is able to predict your risk of falling, using metrics like walking speed, step length, and the time both feet are in contact with the ground.\n\nWhile this may seem exciting, I doubt its ability to help everyone, as walking patterns differ. Moreover, it is only effective if users carry their phones around at all times; some don\u2019t.\n\nStill, it\u2019s good to know Apple does not just target only the young, but the elderly too.\n\nWalking Steadiness will be available for everyone who has an iPhone 6s and above.\n\nPlentywaka partners GUO to expand inter-state\n\nPlentyWaka bus. Source: PlentyWaka Twitter\n\nPlentywaka, a Nigerian bus-hailing tech company, has announced its partnership with interstate bus company, GUO Transport, to expand its reach.\n\nThis will lead to the opening of new routes on Plentywaka\u2019s inter-state offshoot, Travelwaka. About 200 routes are expected to be launched. Plentywaka will onboard 600 new buses from GUO, bringing total buses on the platform to 850.\n\nThis partnership is mutually beneficial because GUO doesn\u2019t have to build and maintain proprietary tech for commuters to find them online. Plentywaka, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t need to buy buses to expand inter-state.\n\nThe end goal of PlentyWaka is to give its users an easy way to compare their choices from a range of travel companies. So perhaps we can expect it to onboard more inter-state bus companies in the near future.\n\nSounds familiar? You might remember Oya.com.ng, the bus ticketing website that was acquired by Wakanow in 2015, barely 2 years into operation. They employed a similar inventory-less model.\n\nSidebar: It might interest you to know that GIGM, another major bus company, has a tech-enabled platform that allows investors to place their buses on its inter-state network.\n\nWhat I\u2019m watching this weekend\n\nImproving early child development with words.

          "title": "An insight into how Texas-based VC, Sputnik ATX, invests in African startups",
          "text": "In May 2021, CribMD, a Nigerian healthtech startup, closed a $2.6 million seed round led by US-based venture capital firm, Sputnik ATX.\n\nFounded by Dr Oksana Malysheva \u2014 a physicist with stints at McKinsey and Motorola \u2014 and Joe Merrill \u2014 a former US diplomat to Nigeria, South Korea, and Bosnia \u2014 Sputnik ATX runs an accelerator programme where founders receive $100,000, with the potential for more in follow-on funding.\n\nSince its inception, the firm has invested in over 30 startups across various industries.\n\nTechpoint Africa spoke to Joe Merrill, a partner at the firm, and he gave some insights into how they invest in startups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFun fact: Sputnik is a Russian word meaning partner. It is also the name of the first artificial satellite launched into space.\n\nTell us how Sputnik ATX came about\n\nMy business partner, Oksana Malysheva, and I founded ATX in 2017 after we had managed a fund together.\n\nWe were looking for ways to improve our returns and be more impactful. In our research, we discovered a massive gap with early-stage financing that would give entrepreneurs the tools needed to grow their businesses and then follow-on funding to scale and grow quickly.\n\nWe founded Sputnik ATX so that we could do that. We joke that we teach nerds how to sell, so if they have a minimum viable product (MVP) and a customer and are looking to try and figure out how to grow their startup, we teach them how to grow and build a big company.\n\nWhat does VC investment mean to Sputnik ATX?\n\nDr. Oksana Malysheva, Managing Partner, Sputnik ATX\n\nWe are early-stage investors, and to us, VC investment is the ability to help very brilliant, gritty, hardworking, humble people get access to capital at an early stage to accelerate their company\u2019s growth.\n\nWe also help them by giving them business skills, particularly in sales and marketing, so that they can refine their product and grow their business in a sustainable way that would help them to produce an amazing company.\n\nEvery VC has an eye or eyes in specific markets. Tell us what market(s) Sputnik ATX is interested in and why?\n\nWe\u2019re not necessarily interested in specific markets but in people who have a big impact. So, for example, we talk about this thing called consumer surplus \u2014 an economic term that refers to the difference between what you\u2019re willing to pay for something and what you pay for it.\n\nAnd when we see people who are generating lots of consumer surplus, it means they\u2019re generating lots of value in the market. And we want to help them to do just that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe name Sputnik comes from the first thing mankind launched into space \u2014 the Sputnik 1 satellite \u2014 and like Sputnik, we\u2019re looking for people who are doing big things.\n\nDoes that mean you invest more in founders than in startups?\n\nIt has to be both. There\u2019s this statement about whether you invest in the jockey or the horse, and we think that you invest in both because good jockeys and good horses work together.\n\nWe think that the best ideas are where you have a fantastic person with incredible technology that the world desperately needs.\n\nBy Sputnik ATX\u2019s standards, what shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nJoe Merrill, Partner, Sputnik ATX\n\nI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a wrong answer to that question. If you\u2019re a startup founder, you should be asking yourself if what you\u2019re doing is making the world a better place, and if it\u2019s making the world a better place, then the question is how much better.\n\nSome startups that make the world a better place may not generate many financial returns, and that\u2019s okay. There\u2019s nothing bad about that.\n\nBut as venture investors, we have a responsibility to get a return for our investors. So while those are worthy businesses, the economics don\u2019t work for venture capital.\n\nWe have to invest in companies that are making an impact where additional money and resources can go a long way in building the business and generating a return for the investors, the founders, and ultimately something really great for the customers using the service or product.\n\nWhat is your average ticket size?\n\nWe start small by giving them a $100,000 cheque, and we have an option to increase that to $500,000, but we would continue to invest in companies as they grow. We have invested millions in some of the companies in our portfolio.\n\nWe\u2019re just getting started. Right now, we\u2019re raising a $100 million follow-on fund, and we have raised over half of the money. We plan to continue to write cheques worth $5 million to $10 million for companies as they continue to grow.\n\nIs there any other African startup in your portfolio other than CribMD?\n\nCribMD is probably the second. The first was Vybe Software, and even though Vybe was based in the United States, like CribMD, most of their customers were in Africa. Vybe has an app called Leia that enables people to launch a website.\n\nIt is free, but for 99 cents a month, you can upgrade and get a much nicer package. It uses artificial intelligence to build completely unique, beautiful websites for anyone.\n\nThat company did really well in Nigeria. Lots of merchants were able to create little marketplaces where they could advertise their businesses online.\n\nHow does Sputnik ATX deal with bad investments?\n\nI hate saying bad investments because bad is kind of like this judgement where something is morally repugnant, and that\u2019s not the case. What happens is someone starts a company, and the company is generating insufficient financial returns to justify the investments, but that doesn\u2019t make them bad.\n\nIt just means that it didn\u2019t work out, and there are a couple of choices. Sometimes those companies can continue to operate because they\u2019re profitable; they\u2019re not just going to get very big.\n\nHowever, if they\u2019re losing money, and if they continue to lose money, you usually sit down with the founders, and you decide if it\u2019s a good time to shut the company down. If there\u2019s some value in the asset that another company would find valuable, you sell the asset to other companies because while you may not be able to do a lot with it, someone else might.\n\nI\u2019ll be frank, it\u2019s okay if a startup doesn\u2019t work; we expect that to happen. It\u2019s how you do it that matters. If you realise your company is not viable, you shut it down in an orderly way. What you do says a lot about the quality and the integrity of the founder.\n\nWhen founders shut things down properly, we love to invest in them because they acted with integrity.\n\nWhat industries are of most interest to Sputnik ATX?\n\nWe invest in anything that is not evil. We have a strict policy of not investing in evil. We have everything, including a company that makes nutritious doughnuts.\n\nEverybody likes doughnuts, but they\u2019re not good for your health. This was a bunch of American football players with such strict diets who worked tirelessly to figure out how to make nutritious yet delicious doughnuts.\n\nWe also have a company producing an engine that will replace the one in cars, and it\u2019s beautiful. This thing would single-handedly stop greenhouse gas emission, and Shell just announced that they are investing in that company.\n\nIt works, and in 20 years, we could all be using this product. So when we see companies with amazing technologies like these, we want to invest in them.\n\nWhat opportunities have Sputnik ATX regrettably passed on, and why?\n\nMy biggest regret is a company called FloatMe. It\u2019s in San Antonio, and we almost accepted them. We limit the number of companies that we can accept to between five and seven for each group. They were the company that just missed the cut.\n\nWe liked the founders, and we should have done it. The company has been very successful. I still love the founders. They\u2019re incredible, and I think the world of the company.\n\nIt\u2019s such an incredible service. It puts a little money into people\u2019s accounts when they are about to overdraft them. I wish we had invested, but it turns out they didn\u2019t need our money, and they\u2019ve done very well.\n\nThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m just happy to see smart people do awesome things that help other people even if we don\u2019t get to invest.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nThey can go to sputnikatx.com. They can also find me on Twitter @Austin_VC. I get and accept DMs from people.\n\nMy business partner is @Oksana_ATX. You can read all about her on our website. I also have a blog where I write about business, economics, and startups because I\u2019m an economist and an entrepreneur.\n\nI talk about Nigeria ever so often on my blog. I love Nigeria.\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

Terms and conditions apply.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nPossible Twitter negotiations with the Nigerian government\n\nAndroid 12 beta 2 launch and Apple iOS 15\u2019s features\n\nTwitter reaches out to the Nigerian government for negotiations\n\nNigeria\u2019s online space has been abuzz since the government announced the suspension of microblogging and social media platform, Twitter on Friday, June 4, 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, according to Channels Television, Minister for Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, says Twitter has reached out to the government to negotiate. He made the statement on Wednesday, June 9, 2021, while addressing the State House correspondents after the Federal Executive Council meeting.\n\nThe Minister added that the suspension has been effective, saying Twitter has made significant losses since the ban.\n\nNothing from Twitter: However, the social media platform has kept mum about negotiating with the Nigerian government.\n\nBut the company, via its Public Policy account on June 5, 2021, said that the platform would \u201cwork to restore access for all those in Nigeria who rely on Twitter to communicate and connect with the world.\u201d\n\nAsk Malami? When Mohammed was questioned about the section of the law that prosecutes Nigerians who continue to use Twitter, he referred journalists to the country\u2019s Attorney General, Abubakar Malami\u2019s comment.\n\nTwitter should pay tax too: The Minister discussed the Federal Government\u2019s move to ensure social media and over-the-top (OTT) platforms \u2014 WhatsApp, Facebook, Netflix, et al. \u2014 are registered in the country and pay tax for the billions they earn.\n\n\u201cQuiz 1: How many topics did we discuss in the first edition? Mention two.\u201d\n\nOn a non-Twitter related note, Apple has announced the new features coming to its new iOS 15.\n\nThe announcement was made during Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). The event, dedicated to software, is held annually to showcase new features coming to operating systems across Apple\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nThis year\u2019s edition kicked off Monday, June 7, and will end Friday, June 11, 2021.\n\nFaceTime, a feature known to be exclusive to iOS devices, will now work outside the ecosystem; it will include options to share screens like video conferencing platform, Zoom. The new operating system will continue Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency feature that started with the previous upgrade.\n\nAnother interesting feature coming to the new iOS is Live Text. The iPhone camera will now be able to recognise text within an image. So, texts \u2014 phone numbers, words, symbols \u2014 in an image can be copied and saved.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before: While this feature is new to iOS, it bears a close resemblance to Google Lens on Android devices, which can translate and save text from an image using the camera. However, whatever upgrades Apple has introduced to this feature will be ascertained when the operating system launches officially.\n\nThere\u2019s more on Apple\u2019s WWDC here.\n\n\u201cQuiz 2: If you noticed, Emmanuel and Oluwanifemi did something different with previous Thursday editions. What was the first topic in this trend?\u201d\n\nSpeaking of Android, Google has released the second beta version of its latest operating system, Android 12. Launched Wednesday, June 9, 2021, the second version will come with more of the features promised at the Google I/O event in May.\n\nPer TechCrunch, Google will bring more beta testers on board with the Android 12 beta 2 release. They will be testing out features like the new privacy dashboard, Quick Setting toggle, and Internet Panels that make switching between Internet providers easy.\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nHow to install the developer beta of iOS 15.

          "text": "Owing a dedicated business account opened in the name of the business and also ensuring that all business transactions go through that account; obtaining source documents for business transactions, and getting an automated SME-focused accounting tool are steps to transforming your financial record, notes a Lagos-based accountant.\n\nThe accountant encouraged businesses to issue invoices, collect expense receipts for purchases, and keep dedicated folders for different categories of transactions.\n\nAccounting tools will also reduce errors and easily tell how you are performing, says Jovita Madojemu, managing director, Pundit Bookkeeping Services.\n\nMany solutions targeting Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) usually revolve around funding. They either provide or help SMEs with seamless sources of finance. But not many solutions support this category of businesses with tracking the spending of the funds.\n\nThe lack of finance is a common challenge for SMEs, but skewed financial appropriations and budgeting could cause a bigger challenge if founders ignore the culture of consistent financial documentation and bookkeeping.\n\nBut Madojemu has been committed to this course\u2014balancing the books of SMEs\u2014for five years. She started Pundit Bookkeeping Services to look after the finances of small businesses because of her belief that every SMEs need to make financial decisions from an informed standpoint.\n\n\u201cThere are so many businesses here today and gone tomorrow because so many of them are flying blind. So, I was going to make it happen by ensuring that they have professionally prepared books of account on a monthly basis because I believe that 12 months is too long a time to realise that they have been spending money on the wrong things,\u201d she told BusinessDay.\n\nBookkeeping, as she explains, is about recording, tracking, following the money, and identifying what the money is doing for the business. It enables business owners to know how much money they are spending and how much they are receiving.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important,\u201d she notes.\n\nWith effective bookkeeping, SMEs get to see at a glance how their business decisions are translated to money, they are better guided in making an efficient budget in subsequent periods as it establishes a baseline.\n\nAdditionally, where there has been mismanagement of funds, bookkeeping will reveal it, and the business owner has an opportunity to change course; and also makes it easy to hand over a business\u2019 financial activities to the next generation.\n\n\u201cOr, you could sell it to a discerning investor who could probably need such records to make such a decision,\u201d she states.\n\nMadojemu calls herself an advocate for financial intelligence for the SME space. Through her company, her clients have been instilled with the prudence required in business in terms of handling money\u2014and the feedback has been encouraging.\n\nClients are happy that they can get their business performance update month-on-month for half the cost of keeping a full-time, in-house, qualified and experienced accountant. Some others now see her company as an accountability partner and it makes her \u201cfeel very fulfilled.\u201d\n\nBut the impact of COVID-19 forced some clients to break their contracts with the company, leading to a shortfall in clients for Pundit Bookkeeping Service.\n\nWhile she did not take any legal action in a bid to be empathetic, other clients just ceased communicating as the pandemic persisted.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 was a rude shock to many,\u201d she narrates the impact the virus had on her business. \u201cSome of those clients just disappeared. Some others were more courteous and called to explain the need to discontinue our services.\u201d\n\nConsequently, her company had to adjust. It became more prudent\u2014keeping expenses as low as it could. It let go of some of the staff members, as the running cost could only be sustained for a short time. With reduced clientele, it further increased communication frequency with clients who stayed on.\n\nAdditionally, the company also allowed them to pay in installments as a way for them to manage their uncertain cash flow and also kept exploring new ways to keep improving its competencies and also increase visibility.\n\nNigeria is increasingly becoming difficult to do business. Insecurity, poor power supply, corruption, rash and often poorly thought-out government policies, lack of adequate infrastructure, and access to funds constantly deprive entrepreneurs of sleep.\n\nSo, how can business thrive in such a clime?\n\n\u201cThe first thing is the mind-set of the business owner. The business owner needs to understand that the business is different from him or her. The business has a life of its own. It is important that you do not try to force the business to fund your lifestyle if it cannot.\n\n\u201cAlso, as a business owner, constantly lookout for better deals in terms of dealing with vendors. Consider installmental plan options for major expenses so that you are not stifled. Then, improve on your business competencies and transfer knowledge,\u201d she suggests.",

          "title": "June 12: Inconsistent regulation in Nigeria stifling $8bn telecom market",
          "text": "The telecommunication sector in Nigeria saw its biggest growth in the months of April, May, and June of 2020 jumping to 18.10 percent from 9.71 percent in the previous quarter. It was a cherry of hope on the Democracy Day celebration of that year that despite the COVID-19 pandemic and recession the country was in, there was a path to recovery should the sector continue on that growth trajectory.\n\nFast forward to 2021, the sector operators are no longer certain about what the outlook for the second quarter of 2021 would look like, having suffered a historic decline in the first quarter. The sector, a primary driver of Nigeria\u2019s economy, saw an era of double-digit growth reduced to single-digit. The first-quarter growth tanked to 7.69 percent from the previous quarter where it recorded 17.64 percent.\n\nThe damage to the sector was inflicted by a combination of poorly thought and executed policies and macroeconomic realities. Among them were the ban on SIM registration to accelerate the National Identification Number (NIN) registration exercise, recessive income per capita, and the growing number of people migrating to WhatsApp, Telegram, and other platforms that do not require SIM cards to stay connected.\n\nThe telecommunication market generates average revenue of $8 billion annually according to Teniola Olushola, former President of the Association of Telecommunication Companies in Nigeria (ATCON).\n\nIn the new National Broadband Plan 2020-2025, the country set ambitious goals to deliver data download speeds of about 25Mbps in urban areas and 10Mbpds in rural areas. The plan also targets covering at least 90 percent of the population and a penetration rate of 70 percent by the end of the plan\u2019s lifetime. In recent times, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy has clarified that the country is actually targeting the attainment of a 90 percent broadband rate in terms of population and a 70 percent rate in terms of the total landmass within the next two years (2023).\n\nRead Also: Network operators lose 12.4m internet subscriptions in 5 months\n\nThe latest figures released by the Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC) in June not only showed that the big four operators in the sector lost significantly in April, but the broadband penetration in the country has also now declined to 40.66 percent from 41.18 percent in March. At 40.66 percent, the sector has seen 4.36 percent erased from the 45.02 percent penetration it recorded in December 2020.\n\nA target of 90 percent would mean the country plans to add about 49 percent broadband penetration to the current 41 percent in 2 years. It is a very tall order considering that Nigeria needed about 3 years to add about 24 percent penetration growing from 21.69 percent in 2017 to 45.02 percent in December 2020. Interestingly, it only needed 4 months to wipe off 5 percentage points to take penetration down to 40.66 percent in April 2021. It also means the country is now 50 percent off its 90 percent broadband penetration target by 2023 as recently announced by the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Ali Isa Pantami.\n\nWhile the appointment of Isa Pantami ignited many expectations of the possible turnaround of the sector, the result so far has not lived up to those expectations.\n\nSome social projects have been executed by the minister\u2019s administration including the NCC\u2019S Emergency Communications Centre, Ado-Ekiti; the Digital Awareness Programme (DAP) for Secondary Schools, whose beneficiaries are Methodist Girls\u2019 High School, Yaba, Lagos State, and Bishop Okoye Girls\u2019 Secondary School, Ukpor, Anambra State; as well as the School Knowledge Centre (SKC) at Ijaloke Grammer School, Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State, executed by the USPF.\n\nThe Minister also flagged off the National Adopted Village for Smart Agriculture (NAVSA) initiative located at Jewel\u2019s Suit, Okoe Urejee, Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State, which was executed by the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA).\n\nIn terms of development in network infrastructure, not much has really changed except in January 2020 when the Minister attempted to get state Governors to agree to reduce Right of Way fees for broadband fibre. That effort only changed the mind of seven state Governors including Ekiti, Imo, Plateau, and Katsina. Kaduna and Anambra waived the fees while Kwara dropped the fees to N1.\n\nHowever, 29 states have stuck to their old charges. A few have managed to give concessions. For example, in 2020, MainOne said Ogun state gave them a charge waiver to deploy fibre cables across the state. As of April, the market share by the technology of fixed wired internet \u2013 comprising fibre cables \u2013 was at 0.10 percent a position it has been for many years.\n\n\u201cThe high rates of the ROW adversely impact our business,\u201d said Uche Nnakenyi, Divisional CEO, ipNX. \u201cFibre-To-The-Home infrastructure is highly capital intensive hence with the high rates of the ROW, the total cost of ownership of our infrastructure is increased, impeding the rate of expansion of the footprint of our infrastructure within and across cities and states. Additionally, this increases the cost of service delivery.\u201d\n\nPoor fibre infrastructure deployment is responsible for the cost of data in the country. Worldwide Mobile Mobile Data Pricing 2021 ranks Nigeria 43rd among countries with exorbitant data charges. The report which surveyed 230 countries on the affordability of data, put Nigeria behind Sudan (fifth globally); Algeria (16th); Somalia (22nd); Ghana (27th); Libya (30th); Tanzania 32nd; and Mauritius (33rd).\n\nBeyond right-of-way fees, operators are also lamenting the destruction of their equipment. In 2020, Airtel said over 1400 base stations had been vandalised because there was no adequate security for equipment. Criminal elements cut fibre cables meant for internet access, remove air conditioners, generators, and other equipment at these base stations.\n\nInsecurity in the various parts of the country also means that telcos\u2019 investments are now restricted to few locations where these companies feel \u201cSafest\u201d. An official at ATCON told BusinessDay that telecom investors would not go to regions where they would potentially be killed. Telcos are also known to be relocating their workers from these regions back to Lagos where they are safe. This deepens the challenge of connectivity already existing in these hotspots.\n\nAs of 2019, The NCC confirmed that Nigeria had about 200 communities that have never seen internet connectivity. The commission also said it has come up with a programme to connect these communities, however, it required collaboration between it and the telecom operators. While insecurity is likely to ensure the state of unconnectedness continues, the NCC had pledged to provide a subsidy of N65 billion counterpart funding. It is part of a larger plan to raise N265 billion which falls under the State Accelerated Broadband Initiative designed to address the infrastructural deficits in the telecommunications sector. The infrastructural companies would raise the balance of the N200 billion. Operators say they are yet to receive the NCC pledge.\n\nA few operators who would not speak on the record said it would be impossible to commence any deployment without the support of the government. It is perhaps why the Lagos State government has embarked on an ambitious plan of deploying about 3500km of fibre infrastructure around the state. The infrastructure is expected to bring connectivity to mainly public hospitals, schools, and government offices. So far only 1800km of fibre has been completed.\n\n\u201cWe are using it to develop a mesh city and the infrastructure that is required to power your businesses. Once we complete our fibre infrastructure we would have all our public schools connected and all of our public buildings and hospitals and the telcos would have an opportunity to reach the last mile. It would mean cheaper and faster technology,\u201d Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Governor of Lagos State said recently.\n\nWhile it is commendable, it is but a drop in the ocean of what the country requires to ensure adequate connectivity and give it a chance at 90 percent penetration. Researchers at FBN Quest said one way to achieve this is for state governments to allow open access infrastructure rollout.\n\n\u201cWe understand that Anambra state has waived right-of-way (RoW) fees for telecom operators. This is part of the state\u2019s efforts to drive broadband expansion. The absence of a unified RoW fee across states within the country continuously stalls the advancement of broadband fibre networks,\u201d the researchers said. According to the NCC, the fibre requirements of the country are around 120,000km. So far, less than 40,000km has been achieved, leaving a deficit of over 80,000km. Experts say addressing insecurity would be the best place to start, however, there needs to be consistency in the policy statements that give assurance of a direction to investors.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nIt\u2019s longer news that the corporate existence of Nigeria is threatened by the unabating attacks of insurrectionists, bandits, terrorists and the aberration of unknown gunmen. Due to the helplessness of the government to curb this ugly and incessant attacks on the precious lives and property of the citizens, Nigerians are taking recourse to their primordial ethnic cocoons which decimates the Nigerian state to the threshold of near collapse.\n\nThe security conundrum has put everyone in danger. The activities of these anti-state actors have imperiled farmers, traders, students, political leaders, travelers and ofcourse corps members who are entrusted with the patriotic mandate of rendering selfless service to the motherland.\n\nConcerned Nigerians are asking what the way out of the quagmire could be. It is this existential question that has birthed a precipitous bill seeking to scrap National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). Sponsored by Awayi Abiante from Rivers State, the bill has now reached the second reading at the Green Chamber. This bill has brought NYSC to the stead to be a whipping boy for our insecurity as lawmakers debate it relevance to the nation after 48 years of existence.\n\nHon. Awaji-Inombek Abiante in the explanatory memorandum of the proposal, listed various reasons why the NYSC should be scrapped.One of the reasons, according to Abiante, is due to incessant killing of innocent corps members in some parts of the country due to banditry, religious extremism and ethnic violence.\n\nHon Abiante also gave economic exploitation of Corpers by private agencies as another reason for his bill seeking the discontinuation of the scheme as they \u201care no longer recruiting able and qualified Nigerian youths, thus relying heavily on the availability of corps members who have not been well remunerated and get relieved with impunity at the end of their service year without any hope of being gainfully employed.\u201d\n\nApart from serving in their various places of primary assignment, corps members are often deployed for key assignments such as working as ad hoc electoral staff during elections which he also explains endangers the safety of corps members since elections in Nigeria are most times volatile.\n\nIt is worthy to note that since the inception of nysc itself in 1973 the program has been trailed by waves of protest . Just so you know that the scheme has always been a bone of contention right from the day it\u2019s decree was promulgated in 1973. In the words of the scheme\u2019s founder, Gen. Yakubu Gowon \u201cthe establishment of the scheme was followed by a protest throughout the length and breadth of the country\u201d\n\nThe administration of Gen. Gowon established the NYSC with the promulgation of Decree No 24 of May 22, 1973, the objective was to ensure that Nigeria remained an indivisible entity that would be focused on sustainable development and four decades later the scheme can do better but it\u2019s relevance to the socio economic fabrics of Nigeria can be attested to by well meaning and patriotic citizens of Nigeria though not devoid of challenges.\n\nIt was the same General Yakubu Gowon who launched the famous 3Rs which are reconstruction, rehabilitation, reconciliation in order to galvanize the wartorned Nigeria after the devastating civil war the giant of Africa was plunged into between 1967 to 1970 and he found young graduates as one of the veritable tools of nation building. Reconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation should be seen as an ongoing efforts of nation building just as government is a continuous process.\n\nThe NYSC posts Corps members to cities or villages and states far from home and states of origin, where they are expected to mix with people of other tribes, social and family backgrounds where they could learn the culture of the indigenes in the place they are posted. This of course fosters mutual understanding of the country\u2019s diverse cultures and national cohesion. What if there was no NYSC?\n\nNYSC should be seen as a work in progress. The government should strengthen the scheme to ensure it meets the current socio-economic reality of our country but scrapping it because of insecurity is like a farmer throwing away his hoe because he\u2019s unable to use it. The problem is not the hoe but the farmer\u2019s inability to use it.\n\nNigeria is one of the most terrorized countries in the world and no society can thrive in an atmosphere of severe insecurity like the one in Nigeria. Government must live up to it\u2019s primary responsibility of providing security of lives and property to citizens. This is the least citizens can ever ask of any government.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSinafi Omanga is a serving corps member with the Nigerian Observer.\n\nEmail: benomanga01@gmail.com\n\n...",

Some people have tested our will at different points, but we have also shown them that Ogun State will never be a haven for criminals or criminal tendencies.\n\n\u201cLet me use this opportunity to commend all men and officers of security agencies in Ogun State for their professionalism, commitment and dedication.\n\n\u201cHowever, there is a need for significant increase in enrolment of community policing and welfare of the men. Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, we all have justification for the apprehensive situation in our dear country. However, we all have our roles to play. We must continue to cooperate with our security agencies in fishing out those criminals\u201d.\n\nThe governor, who disclosed that two of the six armoured vehicles ordered had been delivered, also said water cannons and other anti riot equipment would be procured for the police.\n\nHe, however, read riot act to people fomenting security breaches in the state, declaring that his administration would not tolerate any efforts to truncate the peaceful environment of the state.\n\nHe further enjoined officers of all security agencies to utilize the provided materials for improved security, saying \u201cthis is how the public and private sectors will be further encouraged to support the security agencies\u201d.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the IGP Alkali Baba thanked the governor for the gesture, noting that no security outfit in the world can succeed without mobility and communication gadgets.\n\nThe IGP who dubbed Abiodun a \u201csecurity conscious governor\u201d, said the donation would a long way in ensuring security of lives and property in the state.\n\n\u201cSecurity is everybody\u2019s business; we appreciate you for making our jobs easier by giving us tools to work. No security outfit in the world can succeed without mobility and communication gadgets. The body armour will give personnel courage to confront crimes.\n\n\u201cThis will go a long way in ensuring security of lives and property in Ogun state and I want to assure that we will be ruthless on those posing serious security threat to the peaceful coexistence in the country,\u201d the IGP stated.",

It is a day that we will continue to remember as our Democracy Day. And what that should mean to each and every one of us is that it is a time to reflect and ask how well we\u2019ve run this democracy. How well have we kept to the tenets of real and true democracy?\n\n\u201dWhat are the challenges that are still facing us as people? Are we truly running a free and true democracy? The answers are left in each one of us.\n\n\u201cFor me as governor, I see June 12 as an opportunity for us to continue to re-echo our oath of office when we would ensure that it is the greatest good for the greatest number. Let us ensure that as a nation, we can reflect properly and bring about true fiscal democracy.\n\n\u201cCurrently as we speak, we are going through constitutional reform; let the reforms, the changes and amendments that would be coming out of the reform be true representation and reflections of what an ordinary citizen wants; what the real Nigerians on the street are agitating for. What they want us that are in the position of leadership to be doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cJune 12 is the day that we remember what the late MKO Abiola stood and fought for. It is a day to also remember as a day when our democracy was challenged but we have all been able to come together and realised that there is no alternative to democracy.\n\n\u201cThere is no alternative to democracy which guarantees freedom of expression, freedom of choice, freedom of movement of our people and people can indeed express themselves to determine who their true leaders should be at every point in time.\n\n\u201dI think that is what it stands for and I want to thank each and every one of us and God for sparing our lives to see another June 12 celebration.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2018\u2026Ban in nation\u2019s interest, not to stifle free speech\u2019 \u2026Govt has duty to protect the country\u2019s sovereignty \u2013 BMO \u2026It\u2019s lawful, legal, moral \u2013 Expert \u2026Proscription draconian, unacceptable \u2013 NASS minority caucus \u2026 Twitter founder \u2018funded\u2019 #EndSARS protests \u2013 FG\n\nFor almost a week now, the proscription of Twitter, one of the highly accessed social media platforms by the federal government, has continued to generate mixed reactions among Nigerians. In this report, BENJAMIN SAMSON and TOPE SUNDAY seek whose interest the ban will serve.\n\nThe federal government on Friday last week suspended indefinitely the operations of micro-blogging and social networking service, Twitter, in Nigeria. The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, announced the suspension in a statement issued in Abuja, citing the persistent use of the platform for activities that were capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nCountries that have banned Twitter\n\nAs of 2019, the governments of China, Iran, North Korea, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Turkmenistan amongst others had either temporarily or permanently blocked Twitter in their domains.\n\nOpposition\n\nHowever, stiff opposition from human rights groups, civil society organisations, opposition political parties, celebrities, a section of the international community and the media has greeted the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria. In a joint statement, Canada, the European Union, the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States of America said banning systems of expression was not the way forward.\n\nThe statement was titled, \u2018Joint Statement From The Diplomatic Missions of Canada, The European Union (Delegation To Nigeria), The Republic of Ireland, The United Kingdom And The United States of America.\u2019\n\nIt read in part, \u201cThe diplomatic missions of Canada, the European Union (Delegation to Nigeria), the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States of America convey our disappointment over the Government of Nigeria\u2019s announcement suspending #Twitter and proposing registration requirements for other social media.\n\n\u201cWe strongly support the fundamental human right of free expression and access to information as a pillar of democracy in Nigeria as around the world and these rights apply online as well as offline.\n\n\u201cBanning systems of expression is not the answer. These measures inhibit access to information and commerce at precisely the moment when Nigeria needs to foster inclusive dialogue and expression of opinions, as well as share vital information in this time of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe path to a more secure Nigeria lies in more, not less, communication to accompany the concerted efforts of Nigeria\u2019s citizens in fulsome dialogue toward unity, peace and prosperity. As Nigeria\u2019s partners, we stand ready to assist in achieving these goals.\u201d\n\nBMO differs\n\nHowever, the Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) has said Nigerian authorities have a duty to protect the country\u2019s sovereignty by moving against any entity that allows its platform to be used to promote hate speech and incite violence in the disguise of freedom of speech.\n\nAccording to BMO, the decision to temporarily suspend Twitter in the country is in line with the country\u2019s interest. In a statement jointly signed by its chairman, Niyi Akinsiju and secretary, Cassidy Madueke, the group expressed disappointment that Western diplomats from countries which were not known to tolerate activities that could breach their national interests issued a joint statement condemning the Nigerian government\u2019s action on Twitter.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cWe make bold to say that none of these countries would tolerate what Presidential spokesman Garba Shehu reeled out in a follow-up statement to the announcement made by Information Minister Lai Mohammed on the suspension of the micro-blogging site.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, the Presidency made it clear that major tech companies \u2018cannot be allowed to continue to facilitate the spread of religious, racist, xenophobic and false messages capable of inciting whole communities against each other, leading to loss of many lives. This could tear some countries apart.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe would want to know which part of the quoted statement does not resonate with those countries that condemned Nigeria\u2019s action because it amounts to double standard if the UK does not see anything wrong with even moving against protesters, not to talk about religious extremists, but find offensive, measures taken against an outlet that is facilitating or encouraging acts of criminality.\n\n\u201cWe recall how Twitter itself suspended the accounts of Americans who were accused of inciting other people in the aftermath of the electoral victory of the US President Joe Biden, but which supporters of the former President Donald Trump described as an abridgement of freedom of speech.\n\n\u201cUS national interest was also described as the reason; the platform deleted #FreeAlexSaab tweets even though it has to do with the detention of an individual in Cape Verde that the ECOWAS court had declared as illegal.\n\n\u201cSo, we endorse the decision by the foreign affairs ministry to summon the envoys of those countries with a view to showing them where and how they erred. Besides, it is only a suspension, not a ban and we are convinced that Twitter would be back as soon as it abides by the conditions set by the country.\u201d\n\nFG\u2019s reasons\n\nLikewise, Alhaji Mohammed insisted that the suspension of Twitter was done in the interest of the nation and not to stiflefreedom of speech, saying Nigerians could still use other platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Tik tok, etc, to express their opinions.\n\nHe noted that the owner of Twitter helped to fund the recent #EndSARS protest while allowing the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, to use the platform to call for the killing of policemen. He added that Twitter failed to take down Kanu\u2019s tweets despite repeated requests to do so.\n\n\u201cI want to repeat that Twitter has consistently made its platform available to those who are threatening Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence. That is the reason for suspending their operations in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt may interest you to know that most of the OTT and social media platforms operating in Nigeria do not have any office in Nigeria and do not pay taxes to the Nigerian government for the billions they earn here. That is not the best practice globally, and that is why we are insisting that for you to operate in Nigeria you must first be a Nigerian company and be licensed by the broadcasting commission.\n\n\u201cWe have already advertised the notice to the companies concerned to apply for registration of licence.\u201d\n\nHe also accused the founder of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, of funding the #EndSARS protest, citing the fact-check done by an online newspaper.\n\n\u201cSo, whether he donated money himself or helped to raise money, the Twitter owner is one of those who helped to fund the #EndSARS protest that was later hijacked leading to loss of lives and massive destruction of property.\n\n\u201cLike I said last Wednesday, you can see from the fact-check the role of Jack Dorsey is suspect. His interest in Nigeria is inimical to our growth. Our decision to suspend Twitter has been lauded by some; it has been decried by some. But we want to make it clear that what is important to us is the sovereignty of Nigeria.\n\nDefiance\n\nHowever, the joint minority caucuses of the Senate and the House of Representatives have called on Nigerians to ignore the ban and continue to use the social media platform. The National Assembly caucus, which described the ban as \u201cdraconian,\u201d decried that many Nigerians are losing their sources of livelihood to the action.\n\nThe minority leader of the Senate, Enyinnaya Abaribe, and his House of Representatives counterpart, Ndudi Elumelu, stated this in a statement issued on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the statement, the joint caucus met over the ban and \u201crestates its condemnation of the embargo as draconian and unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThe opposition lawmakers also dismissed threats by the government to arrest and prosecute Nigerians for using twitter, calling on Nigerians to \u201cgo ahead and use their Twitter (handles) as they would not be contravening any law in Nigeria or any international statute.\u201d\n\nThe lawmakers said they recognise the provisions of Articles 19 and 20 of the United Nations Charter on Fundamental Human Rights, which Nigeria is a signatory to, as well as provisions of Sections 39 and 36 (12) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), stating that \u201cby these provisions, no one will be violating any law for using twitter in Nigeria.\n\nThe statement partly read, \u201cAs lawmakers, the joint caucus is pained by the anguish Nigerians, especially the youths, who find the use of twitter as a means of livelihood and genuine social interaction, are passing through just because the APC-led federal government feels slighted that an individual\u2019s post was deleted by Twitter for ethical violation.\n\n\u201cThe joint caucus, therefore, calls on Nigerians to use various opportunities offered by technology and continue making use of twitter since such does not violate any law in our country.\u201d\n\nThe clergy\u2019s views\n\nIn his view, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, and the General Superintendent of the Deeper Christian Life Ministry, Pastor William Kumuyi, defied the federal government\u2019s order directing Nigerians to stop using Twitter.\n\nWhile Adeboye said his tweets were covered by Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Kumuyi said his tweets were targeted at a global audience.\n\nOn Monday, Adeboye justified his use of Twitter. In a tweet, he stated that his church was present across the world.\n\nHe wrote, \u201cThe Redeemed Christian Church of God is domiciled in more than 170 nations and territories. The tweets here are in accordance with Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\u201d\n\nKumuyi, while also tweeting, said, \u201cIn view of the Twitter ban in Nigeria, please note that the content shared on this handle is targeted at a global audience in more than five continents and over 100 nations and we share the content from any of these locations.\u201d\n\nLawyers\u2019 divergent opinions\n\nLawyers who spoke about the ban expressed divergent views on the action of the federal government. While some applauded the government, others said it was a step taken too far.\n\nA lawyer, Dr Daniel Bwala who backed the federal government\u2019s suspension of Twitter in Nigerian internet space said it is lawful, legal and moral. Speaking in an interview with Channels TV recently, Bwala also criticised Western countries that condemned the ban in unison as an attack on freedom of expression.\n\n\u201cWhat is the position of the law? And this is a fact that can be verified. In 2011, David Cameron threatened to shut down Twitter; Twitter had to comply. Israel threatened to shut down Twitter, Twitter had to comply. Turkey, France, Germany. In fact, in one of these African countries, they even had to shut down Twitter, and conducted elections before they came back to social media.\n\n\u201cI have cited the example of the holier-than-thou nations. When they were in their crisis moment, they called Twitter to order; but now it is convenient for them because they do not have a crisis. We in Nigeria are faced with an existential crisis and, therefore, the government cannot sit and watch Twitter, especially, not social media, whose founder has indicated a clear case of interest in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nHe advised the federal government to proceed further and lodge a complaint in the United States Congress to call Twitter to explain its interest in Nigeria. He said Nigerians who have suffered losses due to the suspension cannot secure a remedy against the government, but the micro-blogging platform, which they have agreement with.\n\nHowever, another lawyer, Isaac Anumdu, said there was no provision under the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) which empowers Nigeria to mandate an offshore company to either register in Nigeria or pay tax except when they bring in physical goods.\n\n\u201cRight now, Twitter is not within Nigeria\u2019s territorial jurisdiction. So, Nigeria cannot compel it to pay tax,\u201d he said. He noted that if Nigeria was well guided, it would have immediately rescinded the ban on Twitter and used diplomacy to get the company set up an office in the country on its own.\n\nForeign social media users back FG\n\nWhile some Nigerians are kicking against the ban, which many of them believe is an attempt to suppress them from criticising the government, some of the foreign social media users, particularly the Twitters users, viewed the development as an attempt by the Nigerian government to protect its sovereignty as a nation.\n\nA Twitter user, \u2018Chiquitina\u2019@Chiquit910196, who responded to a post by the Agence France-Presse (AFP), an international news agency headquartered in Paris, France, on the ban, said: \u201cGreat, Twitter got to taste their own medicine. Great #Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAnother user, Rob [email protected]\u00ad\u00ad jr, said: \u201cNigeria has an exotic form of governance where the state is sovereign, instead of tech companies.\n\n[email protected] said: \u201cThat is so amazing of Nigeria; lovely to see that a government is more powerful than Twitter and Facebook.\u201d\n\nRajma [email protected], said: \u201cGood work Nigeria, Tech giants should be belted to serve users, not rule over countries.\u2019\u2019\n\nFG on registration\n\nMeanwhile, the information minister on Wednesday said he has already directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to commence the process of licensing all over-the-top (OTT) and social media operations in the country. The NBC as part of implementing the directive has also asked all broadcast stations to suspend usage of their Twitter accounts with immediate effect.\n\nHe listed conditions that must be met even if there is a discussion with Twitter, including that it must now be registered in Nigeria as a business concern.\n\n\u201cIt may interest you to know that most of the OTT and social media platforms operating in Nigeria do not have any office in Nigeria and do not pay taxes to Nigerian government for the billions they earn here. That is not the best practice globally, and that is why we are insisting that for you to operate in Nigeria you must first be a Nigerian company and be licensed by the broadcasting commission,\u201d he said\n\nReconciliation\n\nHowever, it appears the two parties will soon be on the path of reconciliation as the minister added that the management Twitter has already reached out to the federal government for discussion over the suspension order slammed on it.\n\nHe said further that Twitter management was seeking \u201chigh-level discussion\u201d to resolve the issue that led to the suspension of its activities in Nigeria.",

          "text": "National Chairman of Zenith Labour Party, ZLP, Chief Dan Nwanyanwu, has declared that there is a very strong indication that the recent spate of violence in the South East is being sponsored by outside forces to demarket and deny the zone presidential ticket in 2023.\n\nSpeaking with journalists in Abuja Thursday on security challenges in Nigeria, Chief Nwanyanwu said the destruction of public properties, some of which were built by communal efforts is alien to the people of the South East.\n\nHe declared that the legitimate agitation for an equitable and fair society in Nigeria and the anger against marginalization against the Igbo people can never be resolved through violence.\n\n\u201cWe cannot cut our nose to spite our face. It is embarrassing, it is counterproductive, and it is primitive. Ndigbo are well beyond these characteristics.\n\n\u201cThere is also the dimension of possible sponsorship of \u201cunknown gunmen\u201d to carry out attacks in Igbo land in order to demarket the zone against the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cThe utterances of supposed prominent Nigerians in high places including misguided leaders of pseudo-organizations purporting to speak for the North have ceased every opportunity to exaggerate the direction of the attack in the Southeast and follow up such deliberate incitement to threaten death and genocide on Igbo people all over the country. This is being intensified as we approach 2023.\n\n\u201cSome of these so called leaders are uncomfortable with what has become a near national consensus, that equity, Justice and fair play demand that the presidential slot for 2023 should be reserved for the people of the Southeast geo-political zone of Nigeria as has been done since 1999 till present time, where rotation between the North and the South has become a convention of our National power rotation.\u201d\n\nHe cautioned against the reported attack of innocent citizens of the South East by security operatives.\n\n\u201cLet it be stressed that the genocide attitude of some of our security agencies who conducted themselves as though they were unleashed on the people of the southeast for annihilation is highly provocative, condemnable and atrocious.\n\n\u201cThere is no justification in any civilized society for policemen and soldiers to round up unarmed and innocent young men and women for slaughter. Many have been abducted from their residences, some woken up from their sleep, taken away and eliminated.\n\n\u201cThe perpetrators of this provocative act openly boast of what they have been directed to do in Igbo land and they openly speak in Hausa, creating an impression that rather than being security agents to maintain law and orders, they are an occupation army.\n\n\u201cIt is important to caution that there is a limit to which these genocidal conducts can be endured. It is therefore advised to rein these misguided security agents and if possible withdraw them and deploy them to the various war fronts in various parts in the North where their services are more needed and where they can prove their bravery in the execution of war. This advice should be considered urgently as the patience of the people is fast running out.\n\n\u201cIn the same token, I wish to re-emphases my admonition to some of our young men and women, who under the cover of agitation for self determination attack security personnel and desist from such act forthwith they are the ones who are attracting the invasion of our land area by blood thirsty men of the police and Army to our area. It is self destruction to set your people up for annihilation. It defies logic it is simply stupid and wicked.\u201d\n\nThe Zenith Labour Party National Chairman also appealed to President Mohammed Buhari not to lose sight of the fact that he is the father of the nation and urged him to use his powers to promote peace and unity in the country.\u201d",

Unfortunately, this was met with some resistance at the state level and led to a more than two months strike action that has cost the country a lot of pain.\n\n\u201cLuckily the National Assembly has nearly completed the constitutional review process, which I hope would address some of the burning issues agitating the minds of our people.\u2019\u2019\n\nJob creation\n\nThe President, at the meeting, also said his administration was working to address the direct and indirect causes of unemployment among the population.\n\nNigeria has one of the highest levels of unemployment in Africa.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, the unemployment rate stands at 33.3%.\n\nBuhari \u2018pained\u2019 about insecurity\n\nOn security, the President told the religious leaders that the government was already going after financiers of criminal elements, who also supply them with arms, but were constrained by the strike by Judiciary workers.\n\n\u201cFortunately, this strike has been called off and prosecution of some of these people would soon commence, while our security agencies expand their network in closing in on the others,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari assured that the administration remains committed to \u201cquickly pushing this dark side of our history behind us and we are currently making sure that funding would not hamper our efforts.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccording to the President, the last Federal Executive Council meeting approved some funds for the security agencies, which would be put to judicious use.\n\n\u201cAs I mentioned yesterday, in Lagos, we would not relent in our efforts at clearing these criminals from all parts of our land including the forests,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari said the government had the major part to play in providing security, adding: \u201cbut besides the imperative to abide by democratic processes is the important aspect of support of the citizenry to the security agencies by providing relevant and timely information.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cI must confess that I am more pained than anyone can imagine with the on-going security challenges because, like you noted during your meeting, they have increased the hunger, pain and anger in the land,\u2019\u2019 he noted.\n\nThe President thanked the religious leaders for their patriotism and commitment to ensuring peace and understanding.\n\n\u201cI have listened to you and I am particularly happy that your meeting clearly identified specific and major roles for both the Government and the people of Nigeria. This is what has been lacking for some time in the national discourse on addressing our current security challenges.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn their comments, NIREC, led by Sultan of Sokoto, His Eminence, Alhaji Muhammad Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, and President of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev Dr Samson Ayokunle, thanked the President for the onerous assignment of leading the country, advising government to fund the armed forces better to confront myriad of security challenges facing the country, block sources of illegal arms, publish names of those funding terrorism and try them.\n\nThey also canvassed the recruitment of more policemen, strengthening of the judiciary, tackle unemployment by creating jobs for youths particularly, and on separatist agitations in the country, NIREC said: \u201cIt is in our togetherness that we are stronger.\u201d",

The lives of millions of people in developing countries should never be dependent on the goodwill of rich nations and profit-hungry pharmaceutical corporations.\u201d\n\nAlex Harris, director of government relations at Wellcome, a London-based science and health charitable foundation, said: \u201cThe new US and UK commitments are a step in the right direction, but they don\u2019t go far enough, fast enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat the world needs is vaccines now, not later this year.

          "title": "Nigeria Plans to Launch Digital Currency Before December",
          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has unveiled plans to launch a digital currency before December.\n\nThe Director, Information Technology, CBN, Ms. Rakiya Mohammed, said Thursday during a virtual media briefing at the end of a Bankers Committee meeting that also held virtually that the digital currency would be accessible to all Nigerians.\n\nThe planned launch is coming about six months after the CBN barred deposit money banks and all other financial institutions from any virtual currency transaction.\n\nThe CBN, in a circular by its Director of Financial Policy and Regulation Department, Mr. Kevin Amugo, said deposit money banks and other financial institutions were being barred because payments and exchanges using cryptocurrency were untraceable and anonymous, making them susceptible to abuse by criminals, especially in money laundering and terrorism cases.\n\nBut Mohammed added that just like everybody has access to cash, everyone would also have access to the central bank\u2019s digital currency.\n\nShe said: \u201cLet me state categorically that cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin and the rest of them are not under the control of the central bank; they are purely private decisions that individuals make and are not part of this arrangement.\n\n\u201cWe have spent over two years studying this concept of central bank\u2019s digital currency and we have identified the risks. And it is one of the reasons why I said we are setting up a central governance structure that would involve all industry stakeholders to access all the risks as we continue on this journey.\n\n\u201cVery soon we would make an announcement on the date for the launch and by the end of the year, we should have the digital currency.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, about 80 per cent of central banks across the world are presently exploring the possibility of issuing the central bank\u2019s digital currency, saying that Nigeria cannot be left behind.\n\nShedding more light on the implication of the digital currency, Mohammed said: \u201cYou are aware that we have two forms of fiat money: The notes and the coins. So, the central bank\u2019s digital currency is the third form of fiat money. So, this digital money is going to complement the cash and note that we have.\n\n\u201cThe central bank digital currency will just be as good as you having cash in your pocket. So, if you are having the currency in your pocket, you are as good as having cash on your phone.\n\n\u201cNow, why did we need to go into this? There are different cases that the central bank is looking at. For instance, we have remittances, which is a huge market in Africa. We also know that in the last EFInA report, our target for this year was to achieve 80 per cent financial inclusion. We are about 60 per cent and at the rate we are going, it is unlikely we would meet this target. But the central bank digital currency would accelerate this target.\u201d\n\nShe said it would support the cashless policy as well as innovation, adding that the central bank has a \u201cvery clear roadmap on this and we are about to move to the next stage of a proof of consent after which we would start a pilot.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking at the media briefing, the Managing Director/CEO, Access Bank Plc, Herbert Wigwe, said the central bank planned to introduce what he termed local card scheme.\n\nAccording to him, the initiative would ensure that all card schemes are registered locally.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea is that if the card schemes are registered locally, payment would terminate locally and it would enhance the efficiency of the local payment system. It will also minimise the amount of money that banks and other institutions pay when you use foreign cards and help conserve foreign currency.\n\n\u201cSo, card schemes, local and international are advised to be registered locally. That way, the overall efficiency of the local payment system would be enhanced,\u201d he said.\n\nHis counterpart at Fidelity Bank Plc, Mrs. Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe, said the Bankers\u2019 Committee discussed how the central bank would ensure availability of forex during summer and the return of students to schools in September.\n\n\u201cThese are pressure points normally for forex and it has been observed that rates are going up. The CBN said all the banks must make sure there is forex availability always and anybody who wants to buy forex for BTA, PTA, medicals, students\u2019 fees, and others should be made to get them so that Nigerians would not resort to the parallel market,\u201d she stated.\n\nShe said the central bank assured bankers that BDCs would continue to have their weekly allocations, and the banks would have additional allocations.\n\n\u201cThe essence is to ensure that all the touchpoints where Nigeria needs legitimate forex are met. The whole idea is to ensure that the pressure on forex rates is reduced,\u201d she said.\n\nIn his contribution, Managing Director, Ecobank Nigeria Limited, Mr. Patrick Akinwuntan, said: \u201cAs the economy is being powered to grow post-COVID-19, SMEs continue to be of critical relevance. If you look at the growth recorded in our GDP, the non-oil sector, which is in the agric space, the SME space, contributed significantly to that growth.\n\n\u201cAnd as part of diversifying our economy and to create employment as well as for SMEs to be able to thrive post-COVID-19, there is a need to continue to assure the availability of forex to meet the needs of SMEs. All banks have been told to ensure that all demand for forex are met and the central bank reiterated its willingness to support the functioning of SMEs.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, the Managing Director, Sterling Bank Plc, Abubakar Suleiman, said: \u201cThe central bank has provided sufficient forex for us to meet the legitimate need of all Nigerian travellers and therefore the idea of going to any other market should not arise at all.\n\n\u201cSo, for all the businessmen out there, if you have a legitimate business and you need forex, all the banks have been positioned to provide you forex. For travellers, if you have the right documentation, there is no need for you to go to another market.\u201d",
