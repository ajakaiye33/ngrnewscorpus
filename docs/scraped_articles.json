          "text": "The family of a nine-year-old girl, Favour Anigbogu, has demanded justice after she was allegedly brutalised by her boss, Ginika Nebafe, who reportedly used a hot iron to inflict injuries on her head.\n\nPUNCH Metro gathered that the child left her parents\u2019 house in Anambra State for Port Harcourt, Rivers State, in April 2021, after Ginika promised to send her to school while she assisted with the house chores.\n\nGinika, while accusing the victim of stubbornness, allegedly used a hot iron to hit her in the head.\n\nOur correspondent learnt that without informing Favour\u2019s parents, the suspect drove the child to Nnewi, Anambra State, and left her in a clinic.\n\nThe girl\u2019s mother, Chindima Anigbogu, said when she called Ginika to ask about the welfare of her child, the suspect lied that Favour had an accident and was being treated.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe woman\u2019s brother came to me in April that she needed someone to take care of her kids. Because my husband had a challenge with his business, we did not have money. I have four kids, so I decided that my daughter should go and stay with her so things would be easier for us.\n\n\u201cI begged her that the most important thing I wanted for my daughter was for her to go to school and she said I should not worry. For the five months that my daughter stayed with her, she failed to enrol her in a school. But whenever I called to speak with my daughter, she would lie that she had gone to school.\n\n\u201cMy daughter said sometimes she would sleep in the passage without eating. But the one that pained me most was this recent one that she used a hot iron to beat my daughter in her head, pulling her hair and flesh off. My daughter said sometimes she used a knife to slice her body; my daughter\u2019s body is full of injuries.\n\n\u201cShe called me in August that she was bringing my daughter in December because she was too stubborn and I said no problem.\n\n\u201cTwo weeks after she called, I started having some strange feelings about my daughter and I called her. She said she wanted to call to tell me that my daughter was in a hospital.\n\n\u201cI asked her what happened and she said my daughter fell from the stairs and hit her head on something and when she was rushed to the hospital, they said they would have to operate on her.\n\n\u201cWhen I asked to speak with my daughter, she said I should not worry that she was alive, not knowing that she went to dump my daughter in Nnewi.\n\n\u201cIt was the lady treating her in Nnewi that called to notify us that my daughter was with her and that she would bring her to us. When she brought her, I could not recognise my daughter; the skin and the hair on her head were chopped off by the iron. My daughter\u2019s boss has not called us since then. When I called her, she did not take her phone.\u201d\n\nOur correspondent learnt that the matter was reported at the CPS Police Station, Akwa.\n\nMrs Anigbogu alleged that the police requested the sum of N5,000 to register the case, and another N20,000 to travel to Port Harcourt to arrest the suspect.\n\nWhile calling for the arrest of Ginika, she said her daughter deserved justice.\n\nThe suspect, however, denied torturing Favour with a hot iron, saying she was only involved in a domestic accident.\n\nGinika said, \u201cShe came into my house and messed it up and when I wanted to flog her, she ran into a store where we kept certain things, including pulpits and speakers. Maybe it was one of the speakers that fell on her head; I don\u2019t even know what happened and that was why I said it was an accident. It was my responsibility to take care of her, which I did.\u201d\n\nHer husband, who identified himself as Apostle Nebafe, said the family spent about N75,000 to treat the injuries.\n\n\u201cI took her to doctors at Nnewi and I gave her parents N30,000. One of my in-laws gave them N10,000 and the traditional prime minister also gave them N5,000,\u201d he added.\n\nThe state Police Public Relations Officer, Tochukwu Ikenga, said the CPS Police Station claimed not have details of the case.\n\nHe, however, urged the victim\u2019s mother to call him so the command could take up the matter.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Apart from that we are still exporting.\n\n\u201cSo, we need support and empowerment from government because we need to step up our production to meet the demands,\u201d he said.\n\nMaitasamu-Isah explained that the association chose Nasarawa state for the inauguration, because of the efforts made by the Gov. Abdullahi Sule-led administration in terms of security, as well as the state being the second largest producer of onions in the North Central zone, after Plateau state.\n\nIn another interview, Justice Sidi Bage I (Rtd), the Emir of Lafia, lauded the association for holding the event in the state and for also willing to educate farmers in the state on the right techniques in onion production.\n\nHe called on farmers to take the advantage of the knowledge that would be shared with them on onions production to increase their production.\n\n\u201cNasarawa state was specifically chosen as a new destination for the production of onions, because of security challenges bedevilling traditional places known for production of onions such as the North West and North East zones of the country.\n\n\u201cSo, with their coming here for this event and to share knowledge on onions, the gate is now open for us in Nasarawa state and we must take advantage of it because they are bringing in the techniques and training to farmers.\n\n\u201cThe advantages of this development are enormous. It will boost economic activities. It will also open us up to having more people coming in here to do business. The advantages are too enormous to mention,\u201d he said.\n\nExecutives of the Association from the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, Nasarawa, Niger, Kogi, Plateau and Benue states were inaugurated at the event.

          "text": "The Forex market in the US was once a popular place for FX investors to invest. However, the US government implemented various trade restrictions and regulations that severely limited foreign investment in the US stock exchange. In response, the Forex companies worldwide cut back on their activities in the US stock market in response to limited foreign market opportunities. These changes resulted in many US Forex companies being delisted from major exchanges. When a company is no longer listed on a US Stock Exchange, its shares typically cannot be traded or sold on US exchanges.\n\nInvestment in the Forex Market:\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThis meant that many US citizens lost their access to these companies\u2019 stocks and their profits. The de-listing resulted in an even tougher competition among Forex brokers and traders trying to make regular investments in the forex market in the US. You need to check out forex brokers and go towards the best one. Many US citizens turned to overseas investment banks and brokerages in order to continue putting money in the US stock market. There were even instances of US citizens making large deposits into overseas investment banks in order to take advantage of the cheap foreign currency exchange rates they received from the major international banks. As a result of these competitive trading practices, the quality of the US forex market became much lower as US investors lost confidence in the stability of the US stock market and FX investments.\n\nDiscount Trading Services:\n\nIn response to this negative trend in the US stock market, several US forex brokers and traders tried to regain some of their US clientele by offering discount trading services. These types of services usually involved high commissions and charges, but the incentive was supposed to be a good selection of forex brokers with high performance in providing top-quality trades and returns. Unfortunately for the forex brokers and traders, the economic recession and the lack of trust that was associated with the US stock market and FX investments led to a US exit from the forex brokers and trader networks that had been formed during the boom times of the late 1990s. As a result, this group of forex brokers and traders effectively disappeared from the US investment scene and no longer had access to the lucrative trading opportunities provided by the discount forex brokers and traders.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nUS Forex Investors:\n\nIn addition to this withdrawal of US investors from forex investment companies, the lack of availability of these brokerage services also impacted the amount of capital that was being funneled into the forex market. For example, because there was a lack of access to profitable trading opportunities, many forex investors lost confidence in forex trading and forex brokers. Many of these US investors had invested money in forex brokers and trading services which they had previously relied on for reliable and reasonable trading signals. When US investors no longer had access to the forex brokers and traders that they had previously relied upon, this negatively impacted their ability to retain some portion of their capital in these investments. Without the services of these forex brokers",

So, there must be some level of assurance that we would give to these people to come out and that requires the massive deployment of officers and men who would also ensure that the subversive elements do not take over the process.\n\n\u2018While we have other elements that would police the election, we don\u2019t even deploy them with arms. Those we are deploying to polling stations to ensure orderliness and checking of electoral malpractices, like vote-buying, campaigning in the place and so forth, this does not even require carrying of arms.\n\n\u2018But you also need to put officers on standby, on patrol that would check the would-be persons that can carry arms against the state.\n\n\u2018We are trying to educate and enlighten people that our presence is for the benefit of everybody, that our presence is for the benefit of ensuring that they come out and exercise their franchise of voting who they want.\n\n\u2018And that is the essence of the jingles we are doing, the essence of going to do community engagements, stakeholders, meetings, talking to their religious leaders and so forth.\n\n\u2018I think it has its advantage; it has its disadvantage, but we try to as much as possible ensure that it is for the advantage of everybody that the massive deployment should take place.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, the IGP has said that the police is yet to receive an extradition request from the United States Government for the embattled Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Abba Kyari.\n\nKyari was accused of receiving a bribe from internet celebrity and fraudster Ramoni Adekunle (aka \u201cHushpuppi\u201d), who is currently standing trial in the US for identity thief and other related cyber crimes.\n\nAccording to Baba, \u2018I have not seen any extradition request on Kyari from the FBI or any other agency,\u2019 adding that the police only looked at the allegations of fraud and other misdemeanours against the officer.\n\nHe disclosed that the police has concluded its investigations on Kyari and forwarded it to the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) for advice, adding that the Attorney General and Minister of Justice has forwarded his own advice on the case to the police.\n\nHe pledged the assurances of the police to act on the advice of the AGF \u2018to ask Kyari to account for what we have found out.\u2019\n\nBaba also assured that the Nigeria Police is doing its best to sustain peaceful coexistence across the country, adding that the police is reviewing its public safety strategies in order to address what he described as \u2018isolated cases of crime\u2019 in some parts of the country.\n\n\u2018The security situation in the country has been significantly stabilised, though we are still experiencing isolated cases of crime and threats to public safety, peace and security in some parts of the country.\n\n\u2018The Nigeria Police Force is however unrelenting in rejigging its public safety strategies to adequately contain prevailing and emerging crime trends across the country.\u2019\n\nThe federal police chief added that the strong collaboration between the Police, Armed Forces and other security agencies have led to the improved security situation in the country.\n\n\u2018Let me state categorically that the new spirit of collaboration between the Nigeria Police, the Nigeria Armed Forces, the Department of Services and other security and intelligence agencies in the country has indeed spurred a common front in reducing crime and criminality nationwide,\u2019 he said.\n\nOn the steps being taken by the police to prevent crime in all parts of the country, the IGP stated: \u2018We are expanding well-coordinated intelligence-led operations to confront bandits, kidnappers and armed secessionist groups by enhancing intelligence gathering efforts and utilising capacity. Enhancing intelligence sharing through strengthening inter-agency collaboration with the military and other security agencies is also an aspect that is being pursued.\n\n\u2018We are deepening community engagement to weaken recruitment drive by secessionist groups. We are also improving our public relations and regaining the trust of the citizens through improved community engagements and enhancing ethical policies in the fight against corruption.\u2019\n\nBaba further revealed that there is strong collaboration between the police and its foreign counterparts, in the bid to check crime across the country\u2019s borders.\n\nHe said the use of technology is also being explored to aid its fight against crime and criminality.\n\n\u2018The Nigeria Police National Command and Control Centre, Nigeria Police Crime and Incident Data Base and the Nigeria Police Crime Analysis Centre are technology-driven outfits that are used to detect and tackle criminals and are also available for the public to use for what we call \u2018Rescue me\u2019 and once you download the app and use it appropriately, wherever is your position, request or complain, it will directly hit our control room within minutes and we will respond to your request,\u2019 he stated.\n\nBaba announced that since his taking office, over 7,000 suspects have so far been arrested, with many arms recovered.\n\n\u2018We have made arrests of 7,036 notorious criminal suspects for offences of terrorism, kidnapping, armed robbery, murder, cultism, banditry and other violent crimes and recovery of sophisticated and locally fabricated firearms and large catchment of ammunitions. Prosecution of the suspects is ongoing.\n\n\u2018We have 1,845 armed robbery suspects arrested, 1,445 for crimes related to cultism, we have 1,183 murder suspects, for cybercrimes, we have also arrested 1,110 suspects. In terms of recovery of firearms, we have recovered 1,717 sophisticated firearms, 341 stolen vehicles have been recovered and in terms of live ammunition, we have 39,541 recovered. We have also rescued over 934 kidnap victims unhurt. Also, over 1665 suspects have been arrested in connection with the rape and other sexual and gender-based violence in the country to date,\u2019 he explained.\n\nThe IGP disclosed that over 20, 000 cases filed by the police against various suspects are presently receiving attention in different courts across the country.\n\nHe also disclosed that the Nigeria Police has been receiving support from corporate bodies to enhance the performance of the Force in its fight against crimes and criminality.\n\n\u2018We have received interventions from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, (NNPC) and the Police Trust Fund (PTF). The PTF gave us 200 operational vehicles; NNPC gave us 250 operational vehicles, eight Armoured Personnel Carriers, drones, marine boats and other equipment. CBN\u2018s intervention is also forthcoming. All the vehicles we have received are manufactured in Nigeria,\u2019 he said.\n\nCommenting on the disappearance of a journalist, Tordue Salem, Baba said the case has been taken over by the Force Headquarters under a unit that has more capacity to handle the matter.\n\nBaba also said the police have so far established the location where the missing journalist was last seen, the last person he met with and the last person he spoke to on phone before his disappearance, adding that the matter is being given the needed attention.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

The Mark Zuckerberg company will now be known as Meta, a nod to its future digital frontier Metaverse, a fusion of different digital worlds.\n\nSpeaking at a virtual event to showcase Facebook\u2019s technological plans for the future, Zuckerberg stated that he has been thinking a lot about the company\u2019s identity. \u201cOver time, I hope we\u2019re seen as a metaverse company.\u201d\n\nMetaverse became a buzzword following the pandemic as augmented, virtual and online realities fused to create experiences for users.\n\nZuckerberg is one of Silicon Valley top shots who believe that Metaverse will be the next major social platform and that several tech companies will build it over the next decade. Although at the moment, the technology is still a mirage. The company is said to have invested $10bn in its metaverse project in 2021.\n\nLast year, Facebook rolled out two of its metaverse projects in beta: Horizon World, which allows users to invite friends into their digital world, and Horizon Workrooms, which does the same in professional settings. Zuckerberg disclosed that the company plans to explore NFTs and crypto to help facilitate media that can be represented digitally and is working on gaming applications.\n\nDuring a presentation from his home, the Facebook founder shared his vision which includes a digital world in which users will feel they are with one another even though they may be apart. Users will be able to customize their avatars and digital spaces, decorating a digital office with pictures, videos and even books.\n\n\u201cWhen I send my parents a video with my kids, they\u2019re going to feel like they\u2019re right in the moment with us not peering through a little window,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the rebranding, Meta comes with a new logo designed like an infinity-shaped symbol. Other platforms of the company such as Instagram and WhatsApp will retain their names but will now come under the Meta brand.",

          "text": "A Federal High Court (FHC), Abuja, on Thursday, issued a warrant for the arrest of an Irish, Neil Murray, over his involvement in the alleged Process and Industrial Development Limited (P&ID) scandal.\n\nJustice Ahmed Mohammed gave the order following an ex-parte motion moved by the counsel to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Bala Sanga.\n\nSanga told the court that the ex-parte motion, marked: FHC/ABJ/CR/143/2020 dated August 20 and filed August 25, was brought pursuant to Sections 3, 35, 36 and 37 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA), 2015, and under the inherent power of the court.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that while the Federal Republic of Nigeria, through the EFCC, is the applicant, Murray is the respondent.\n\nNAN also reported that Murray, an employee of P&ID, is also a director of Lurgi Consult Ltd, an associate company of P&ID.\n\nThe lawyer said the respondent (Murray), who is at large, is named in counts one to eight of the criminal charge number: FHC/ABJ/CR/143/2020 before the court in which a Director in P&ID, James Nolan, is currently standing trial.\n\nSanga, therefore, prayed the court for an order of warrant for the arrest of Murray for him to be brought before the court and face trial on the aforementioned criminal charge.\n\nHe gave three grounds upon which the application was brought.\n\n\u201cThat this Honourable Court has the statutory powers under provisions of Section 3, 35, 36 and 37 of the Adminstration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015 to grant the prayers being sought.\n\n\u201cThat the respondent is named in count numbers 1-8 of the criminal Charge No: FHC/ABJ/CR/143/2020 and indicated to be at large.\n\n\u201cThat the proof of evidence in support of Charge No: FHC/ABJ/CR/143/2020 discloses prima facie evidence against the respondent among others,\u201d he said.\n\nThe EFCC lawyer also prayed the court to issue an arrest warrant against Nolan, following his absence in court.\n\nBut the judge declined to grant the request in view of the fact that there was no proof that hearing notice for the Thursday\u2019s proceeding was served on Nolan.\n\nJustice Mohammed, who granted the prayer for issuance of arrest warrant on Murray, adjourned the matter until January 25, 2022, for trial continuation.\n\nNolan, alongside two others, was also, on October 18 re-arraigned in an amended-32 count bordering on money laundering before Justice Donatus Okorowo of FHC.\n\nAlthough Nolan and two companies; Goidel Resources Limited, a Designated Non-Financial Institution (DNFI), and ICIL Limited, were re-arraigned, his co-accused person, Adam Quinn, was at large.\n\nAn alleged accomplice in the scandal, a Nigerian, Mrs Grace Taiga, who was a former director of Legal Services, Ministry of Petroleum Resources, is also standing trial before Justice Obiora Egwuatu of the same court.\n\nOn September 20, 2019, the EFCC had earlier arraigned Taiga in an FCT High Court in Apo, for complicity in the controversial contract Nigeria signed with the Irish firm, P&ID in 2008.\n\nJustice Inyang Ekwo of a Federal High Court, Abuja, had sentenced the company, incorporated in British Virgin Island to wind up in Nigeria and its property forfeited to the federal government.\n\nEkwo convicted two directors, Mohammed Kuchazi and Adamu Usman.\n\nKuchazi and Usman were arraigned on an 11-count charge, bordering on obtaining by false pretence; dealing in petroleum products without appropriate licence; money laundering and failure to register P&ID with the Special Control Unit against Money Laundering (SCUML) as required by law, amounting to economic sabotage against the Nigerian state.\n\nThey had pleaded guilty to the 11 counts of fraudulent involvement in the contract.\n\nThe court, in its ruling, convicted the suspects and ordered the firm to forfeit all its assets to the Nigerian Government.

          "text": "\u2022Okukor stolen from ancient Kingdom in 1897 by British colonial forces\n\n\u2022Lai Mohammed commends bravery of Nigerian students in UK varsity\n\nBy Dike Onwuamaeze with agency report\n\nThe Jesus College at Cambridge University, London, has handed over to Nigeria the Okukor, a sculpture that was looted by British troops in 1897, setting a precedent expected to put pressure on other institutions to return stolen artefacts.\n\nThe handing over documents were signed yesterday during a ceremony at the college to transfer ownership of the Okukor to the Nigerian delegation.\n\nLondon-based Daily Mail reported that the sculpture of a cockerel was one of hundreds of Benin Bronzes pillaged from the Kingdom of Benin, in Nigeria.\n\nThe college\u2019s Legacy of Slavery Working Party concluded in 2019 that the cockerel \u201cbelongs with the current Oba at the Court of Benin\u201d.\n\nShedding more light on the development in a brief telephone interview with THISDAY yesterday night, Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, said the campaign to return the stolen artefacts commenced in 2018. Mohammed said he had travelled to London to engage the Secretary of Arts and Culture over the Ife Bronze, which was stolen from the museum in Jos and was thereafter sold to an art collector in Belgium.\n\nAccording to the minister, \u201cThe art collector in Belgium now sent it to an auctioneer to value it for sale. But because we had reported the case to the International Organisation of Museum (IOM), Interpol, and all authorities, it was intercepted and the British government held it.\n\n\u201cSo, we asked them to return it to us. I had to travel to London to push for its return. The auctioneer then said we must pay for it and we refused. Then we also pursued the cockerel, which is the one that they are returning now.\n\n\u201cFor the cockerel, I must give credit to our young students at Cambridge University. They put up a very good fight asking for the return of the cockerel. It was these young Nigerian students that started the fight about three years ago and then we joined them, as well as several other Nigerians joined in the campaign to get it back.\u201d\n\nThe minister told THISDAY that the University of Aberdeen, United Kingdom, had also promised to return Nigeria\u2019s artefacts in its custody.\n\nHe said, \u201cBefore then, France and Mexico have returned some of our artefacts. I was in US in July and we reached an agreement that the US government would help us intercept and return to Nigeria artefacts that were stolen or smuggled out of Nigeria and hope that before the end of November, the agreement would be signed.\n\n\u201cThe National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM) is also going to the US in a few weeks. The Metropolitan Museum has said it is ready to return some arts to us. So, you can see that the momentum is building. We are also negotiating with the German government for the return of 1,130 looted artefacts.\u201d\n\nMohammed faulted the insinuation in some quarters that the delayed return of the stolen objects was the result of the country\u2019s inability to make a formal request. He pointed out that the late Ekpo Eyo, who was Director General of the NCMM, had at the IOM made a formal request, which was endorsed then.\n\n\u201cSo, what I have done now is that I have written a formal letter asking for the return of all the Ife and Benin Bronzes and all other artefacts that were stolen,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammed added, \u201cSome of these artefacts date back to 18th century. The return of artefacts is an idea whose time has come and no matter how you resist it, they must be returned.\n\n\u201cWe have also received a letter from Switzerland for dialogue to see how they can return our artefacts.\n\n\u201cWe thank Jesus College for being a trailblazer and we look forward to a similar return of our artefacts by other institutions that are in possession of them.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Mail noted that Okukor was among Africa\u2019s most culturally significant artefacts and the Nigerian government had for years been calling for their return.\n\n\u201cThis is the right thing to do out of respect for the unique heritage and history of this artefact,\u201d Master of Jesus College, Cambridge, Sonita Alleyne, was quoted to have said in a statement ahead of a ceremony to hand over the cockerel to a Nigerian delegation.\n\nThe college described the handover as, \u201cThe first institutional return of its kind.\u201d\n\nIt revealed that Germany had agreed to start returning Benin Bronzes held in its museums from next year, but the British Museum in London, which holds the largest and most significant collection of them, has made no such commitment.\n\nOba of Benin, Omo N\u2019Oba N\u2019Edo Uku Akpolokpolo, Ewuare II, said in a statement, \u201cWe truly hope that others will expedite the return of our artworks, which in many cases are of religious importance to us.\u201d\n\nAfter being looted, the cockerel was given to Jesus College in 1905 by the father of a student. The college announced in 2019 it would return it to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn recent years, a range of British institutions have been grappling with the cultural legacies of colonialism, particularly the issue of what to do about disputed heritage,\u201d the report stated.\n\nIt disclosed that the British Museum and other European museums, along with Nigerian authorities, were involved in a Benin Dialogue Group that aimed at facilitating the construction in Benin City of a new museum to house returned bronzes.\n\nThe British Museum had spoken about \u201copportunities for sharing and displaying\u201d items from its collection in Nigeria, but had never said it would transfer ownership.\n\nThe master of a Cambridge University college described the return of a looted bronze cockerel to representatives of Nigeria as a \u201cmomentous occasion.\u201d\n\nStudents had campaigned for the artefact to be returned, and the college\u2019s Legacy of Slavery Working Party concluded in 2019, that it \u201cbelongs with the current Oba at the Court of Benin\u201d.\n\nThe Oba of Benin is head of the historic Eweka dynasty of the Benin Empire based in Benin City in modern-day Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking further after the handover, Alleyne said, \u201cIt\u2019s massively significant. It\u2019s a momentous occasion.\u201d\n\nShe said it was the \u201cright thing to do\u201d to return the artefact, which is of \u201ccultural and spiritual significance to the people of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAlleyne added, \u201cIt\u2019s part of their ancestral heritage.\u201d\n\nShe said the Nigerian delegation would decide how and when to move the Okukor.\n\nAlleyne disclosed that museums in France, Germany and the Netherlands were also engaged in discussions about returning Benin bronzes.\n\n\u201cWe hope they do get to the same position as we do. We think it\u2019s a morally grounded position,\u201d she added.\n\nThe statue was removed from display at the college in 2016, and would be given to Nigeria\u2019s National Commission for Museums and Monuments at a ceremony attended by delegates from the commission and Benin.\n\nA Paris museum is displaying 26 looted colonial-era artefacts for one last time before France returns them home to Benin.\n\nThe wooden anthropomorphic statues, royal thrones and sacred altars were pilfered by the French army in the 19th century from Western Africa.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron had suggested that France needed to right the wrongs of the past while making a landmark speech in 2017 in which he said he could no longer accept \u201cthat a large part of many African countries\u2019 cultural heritage lies in France\u201d.\n\nThis laid down a roadmap for the controversial return of the royal treasures taken during the era of empire and colony, a move that could have potential ramifications across European museums.\n\nThe French would have a final glimpse of the objects in the Musee du quai Branly\u2013Jacques Chirac from October 26th to 31st.\n\nFrench culture minister Roselyne Bachelot tried to assuage jitters among European museums, emphasising that this initiative \u201cwill not create a legal precedent.\u201d\n\nA French law was passed last year to allow the restitution of the statues to the Republic of Benin, as well as a storied sword to the Army Museum in Senegal.\n\nBut Bachelot said the French government\u2019s law was intentionally specific in applying solely to the 26 artefacts.\n\n\u201cIt does not establish any general right to restitution and in no way calls into question\u201d the right of French museums to hold on to their heritage.\n\nYet critics of such moves \u2013 including the British Museum, which is in a decades-long tug-of-war with the Greek government over a restitution of the Elgin Marbles \u2013 argue that it would spark a move that could empty Western museums of their treasured collections.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Lagos-Badagry Road, Bida-Minna road, dualisation of Aba-Ikot Ekpene road, others listed\n\n\u2022Deregulation to deliver N12trn savings to Nigeria in four years, says oil company\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\nThe federal government has given the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) the green light to take over the repairs and reconstruction of 21 critical highways spread across the nation\u2019s six geo-political zones.\n\nThis is just as the NNPC has said deregulation of petroleum sector would enable the country save the N12 trillion being spent on subsidy payment in the next four years.\n\nAccording to the federal government, the 1, 804.6 kilometres-long stretch of roads which would be fixed with a total sum of N621.2 billion over a reviewable three-year period would be executed under the tax relief scheme of the present administration.\n\nThe Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, who made these known to journalists yesterday, at the State House, Abuja, after the weekly virtual meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) presided over by the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, declared that six out of the 21 roads were located in Niger State which is known to have one of the worst road networks in the country.\n\nAccording to him, the intervention by the NNPC was a strategic move under the federal government\u2019s Road Infrastructure and Refreshment Tax Credit Scheme.\n\nHe said nine of the benefitting road projects are in north-central, three in north-east, two in the north-west, two in the south-east, three in south-south, and two in south-west.\n\nThe minister disclosed that his ministry presented three memoranda to the Council that were approved, explaining that two of the documents were on road contracts.\n\nHe said the first memorandum had to do with a section of Calabar-Ikom-Ogoja road especially the section to Apet Central where he said had a problem with steel reinforced drain that was discovered there.\n\n\u201cThose drains were put there, about 42 years ago and 86 of them have failed and we need to replace them now with concrete rain drains to allow water pass through otherwise the retention of water will badly impact the road.\n\n\u201cAs a result of that, we have to revise the scope of works from rehabilitation to construction in order to remove all the old steel drains that are corroded and replaced them with concrete drains.\n\n\u201cIt is over 75 kilometers road and that will require an augmentation contract by an additional sum of N12 billion. So that memo was approved,\u201d he added.\n\nFashola further explained that the second memorandum had to do with the road infrastructure tax credit scheme.\n\n\u201cYou recall the Executive Order seven signed by Mr. President allowing private sector operators to identify infrastructure such as roads for which you deploy your taxes in advance with tax and pay.\n\n\u201cAlso recall that I had briefed you here about the use of that policy like the Dangote Group from Obajana to Kabba, Apapa to Oworoshoki roads\n\n\u201cEarlier this year, there were five other roads, the Kaduna Western bypass, the Lekki Port road, the road from Shagamu through Papalanto and couple of others and there is one road in Maiduguri. That was approved about N320 billion.\n\n\u201cSo today, we have another player. We have all the interested players who are still showing interest but we haven\u2019t concluded. We have another player who has shown interest and committed to deploy taxes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the government corporation known as NNPC. So NNPC has identified 21 roads that it wants to deploy. So now the instructive thing about this is that this initiative helps government to achieve many things, including Ministerial Mandates Three and Four, which we discussed at the last retreat if you recall was energy sufficiency, electric power and petroleum energy distribution across the country.\n\n\u201cOf course petroleum energy distribution is being impacted positively and negatively, as the case may be the transport infrastructure, which is the Ministerial Mandate four,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the \u201cNNPC sought and council has approved today that NNPC deployed tax resources to 21 roads covering the total distance of 1,804.6 kilometers across the six geopolitical zones.\n\n\u201cOut of those 21 roads, nine are in North Central, particularly Niger state. And the reason is that Niger State is a major storage center for NNPC. So the reason NNPC is doing this is to facilitate the total distribution across the country.\n\n\u201cWe have seen and have heard every year Niger State gridlock, the governor complaning that his roads are being damaged by trucks, by those who overload the trucks after damaging the roads themselves now protest the damage that they sometimes have induced. Anyway, this is the final solution to that problem.\n\n\u201cSo there are nine like that in north central, there are three in the Northeast. Two in the northwest, two in the southeast, three roads, the entire Odupani \u2013 Itu \u2013 Ikot Ekpene road in LOT 1, 2 and 3 now fully covered.\n\n\u201cThen in the southwest, you have the Lagos-Badagry expressway, the entire junction and you also have the Ibadan to Ilorin in Oyo-Ogbomosho section. So that\u2019s it.\n\n\u201cIn the south-east you have Aba-Ikot Ekpene in Abia and Akwa Ibom states. So that\u2019s a major link, then you have Umuahia to Ikwuano to Ikot Ekpene road and so on and so forth. In the Northwest, it is Gada-Zaima-Zuru-Gamji road, and also Zaria-Funtau -Gusau-Sokoto road.\n\n\u201cIn the north-east, it is Cham-, Bali Serti and Gombe-Biu road. The roads impacted in north central include Ilorin -Jebba-Mokwa-Bokani sections I and II, Suleja-Minna sections I and II, Bida-Lambatta, and then Agaie-Katcha-Baro road. Then Mokwa-Makera-Tegina-Kaduna all in Niger State.\u201d\n\nNNPC: Deregulation to Deliver N12trn Savings to Nigeria in Four Years\n\nMeanwhile, the NNPC has said the deregulation of petrol marketing business in the country would enable the country save N12 trillion subsidy payment in the next four years.\n\nThe corporation said the money could be used to carry out some critical social infrastructure projects in strategic sectors of the economy, including roads, hospitals, power generation, amongst others.\n\nManaging Director of the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC), an arm of the NNPC, Mr. Isiyaku Abdulahi, stated this yesterday in Lagos during his presentation at the ongoing 15th Oil Trading and Logistics (OTC) Africa Downstream Week.\n\nHe spoke on the topic, \u201cNigeria Fuel Congress.\u201d\n\nIsiyaku projected that petrol under-recovery, otherwise known as subsidy, could be N138 per litre when calculated using $80 per barrel oil price, 60 million litres daily consumption and the current official exchange rate of N411 per dollar.\n\nHe added that daily petrol under-recovery could be N8.3 billion while annual petrol under-recovery could escalate to N3 trillion.\n\nNoting that the deregulation of the downstream petroleum sector as contained in the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) would lead to increase investments in the sector and enhanced value to the country, Abdulahi listed some critical social infrastructure projects that could be funded with the subsidy savings.\n\nThe projects cut across roads, health, education, housing, and power.\n\nAccording to him, 7, 500 kilometres (km) of roads could be constructed every year at a cost of 400 billion per km.\n\nHe said the money could also help the country to build well equipped 120 bed tertiary health centres across the country, with 37 to be constructed every year at the cost of N82 billion per hospital.\n\nOther projects, which can be carried out with the projected subsidy savings, according to him included building and equipping 2,400 units of 1,000 bed hospitals across the 774 local government areas of the country.\n\nHe listed others to include building of 500,000 new houses for families through mortgage at N20 million per house; additional 27,000 megawatts (MW) of solar-powered electricity to the national grid; and educating and skilling up of Nigerians with global standard quality of education and sought-after skills.\n\nAlso speaking at the conference, the Group Managing Director of Swift Oil Limited, Mr. Stilian Mitakev, and the immediate past Director General of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Dr Muda Yusuf, knocked the federal government over its insistence to continue controlling the pricing of petrol despite the deregulation of the downstream sector by the PIA.\n\nMitakev expressed doubts about the Nigeria petroleum sector witnessing positive changes even with the creation of new agencies to replace the former ones, arguing that the same staff of the scrapped agencies were the same people to man the new ones.\n\nHe said, \u201cOn the new Act, it is true that DPR, PPPRA and PEF have already been scrapped but the Commission and the Authority will be manned with the staff from the scrapped agencies.\n\n\u201cSo, they will be the same people in the new dispensation. Our only hope is that the CEOs of the two new agencies are seasoned professionals and I\u2019m sure they will still try to achieve much better results in their respective fields.\u201d\n\nHe said there was need for genuine deregulation and incentives to drive development of refining capacity in all parts of the country especially in the northern.\n\nMitakev said one of the serious impediments in the development of a truly deregulated market determined by demand and supply forces was scarcity of foreign exchange.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "This is just as the NNPC has said deregulation of petroleum sector would enable the country save the N12 trillion being spent on subsidy payment in the next four years.\nAccording to him, the intervention by the NNPC was a strategic move under the federal government\u2019s Road Infrastructure and Refreshment Tax Credit Scheme.\nFashola further explained that the second memorandum had to do with the road infrastructure tax credit scheme.\nSo NNPC has identified 21 roads that it wants to deploy.\nAccording to him, the \u201cNNPC sought and council has approved today that NNPC deployed tax resources to 21 roads covering the total distance of 1,804.6 kilometers across the six geopolitical zones.",

In a particular location, petty thieves tried to come and steal something in the night, were resisted, the alarm was raised and they ran off, over the fence. Then some demonic agent picked a hint of such an unsuccessful misadventure of petty criminals and calls it \u2018armed men attack worshippers\u2019.\n\n\"That devil is a bastard. Nothing like that ever happened, nothing like that has happened or will ever happen in the Name of Jesus! Let it be made very clear that rumour, untruth, fallacy and fabrications are being pushed in the air. And everybody pushing such should be ashamed of themselves for pushing stories that are not true!\"\n\n\"So if you leave here and anybody tells you that they heard something, tell them that it is a lie from the pit of hell! Both the devil who concocted it and the intention of that devil suffers frustration. It can never see the light of day!\n\n\"Please be more excited with good news than bad news. There is news that you should never push.\"\n\nThe church was also recently in the news\n\nfor controversial reasons when five youths were arrested during the church\u2019s Sunday service on July 4.\n\nThe five protesters \u2014 Ben Manasseh, Anene Udoka, Henry Nwodo, Samuel Larry and Samuel Gabriel (a blind saxophonist) \u2014 were, on July 4, arrested by the DSS for wearing T-shirts with \u2018Buhari-Must-Go\u2019 inscription to the church.\n\nThe church's security guards handed them over to the Department of State Services (DSS), but the church initially denied having a hand in their arrest.\n\nThe young men subsequently dragged the church and the secret police to court over their illegal arrest, detention and violation of their human rights.\n\nThe DSS on August 4 released the five \u2018Buhari-Must-Go\u2019 protesters over a week after a court ordered their release.\n\nThe Federal High Court in Abuja had, on July 25, ordered the DSS to release the five protesters.",

          "text": "Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg has announced a change in the parent company\u2019s name to \u201cMeta\u201d to represent a future beyond just its troubled social network.\n\nThe development comes as the social media giant tries to fend off one its worst crises yet and pivot to its ambitions for the \u201cmetaverse\u201d virtual reality version of the internet that the tech giant sees as the future, AFP reports.\n\n\n\nHe, however, stated that Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp will keep their names under the rebranding.\n\nA statement from Zuckerberg reads: \u201cWe are at the beginning of the next chapter for the internet, and it\u2019s the next chapter for our company too.\n\n\u201cIn recent decades, technology has given people the power to connect and express ourselves more naturally. When I started Facebook, we mostly typed text on websites. When we got phones with cameras, the internet became more visual and mobile. As connections got faster, video became a richer way to share experiences. We\u2019ve gone from desktop to web to mobile; from text to photos to video. But this isn\u2019t the end of the line.\n\n\u201cThe next platform will be even more immersive \u2014 an embodied internet where you\u2019re in the experience, not just looking at it. We call this the metaverse, and it will touch every product we build.\n\n\"The defining quality of the metaverse will be a feeling of presence \u2014 like you are right there with another person or in another place. Feeling truly present with another person is the ultimate dream of social technology. That is why we are focused on building this.\n\n\u201cIn the metaverse, you\u2019ll be able to do almost anything you can imagine \u2014 get together with friends and family, work, learn, play, shop, create \u2014 as well as completely new experiences that don\u2019t really fit how we think about computers or phones today. We made a film that explores how you might use the metaverse one day.\n\n\u201cIn this future, you will be able to teleport instantly as a hologram to be at the office without a commute, at a concert with friends, or in your parents\u2019 living room to catch up. This will open up more opportunity no matter where you live. You\u2019ll be able to spend more time on what matters to you, cut down time in traffic, and reduce your carbon footprint.\n\n\u201cThink about how many physical things you have today that could just be holograms in the future. Your TV, your perfect work setup with multiple monitors, your board games and more \u2014 instead of physical things assembled in factories, they\u2019ll be holograms designed by creators around the world.\n\n\u201dYou\u2019ll move across these experiences on different devices \u2014 augmented reality glasses to stay present in the physical world, virtual reality to be fully immersed, and phones and computers to jump in from existing platforms. This isn\u2019t about spending more time on screens; it\u2019s about making the time we already spend better.\n\n\u201cThe metaverse will not be created by one company. It will be built by creators and developers making new experiences and digital items that are interoperable and unlock a massively larger creative economy than the one constrained by today\u2019s platforms and their policies.\n\n\u201cOur role in this journey is to accelerate the development of the fundamental technologies, social platforms and creative tools to bring the metaverse to life, and to weave these technologies through our social media apps. We believe the metaverse can enable better social experiences than anything that exists today, and we will dedicate our energy to helping achieve its potential.\n\n\u201cAs I wrote in our original founder\u2019s letter: \u201cwe don\u2019t build services to make money; we make money to build better services.\u201d\n\nThe social media giant has been battling crisis since former employee Frances Haugen leaked internal studies showing executives knew of their sites\u2019 potential for harm, prompting a renewed US push for regulation.",

          "title": "Beyond investing in African startups, Kepple Africa Ventures is creating new industries",
          "text": "For Satoshi Shinada, taking bets and investing is not something he just started doing.\n\nAt the age of 18, he took his first bet to invest in himself by leaving Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years. I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cThat\u2019s bold! Why did he do this?\u201d I had the same thought too, so I asked him about it.\n\n\u201cI was born and raised in Japan, so I wanted to expose myself to a different environment and culture. I also loved reading stories of adventures which exposed me to stories about Africa,\u201d he told me over a Zoom call.\n\nHow was he able to afford the trip? He had just won a pact he made with his grandma. The deal was if he got admitted to the best university in Japan, the University of Tokyo, she\u2019d give him an allowance. It turned out to be an allowance of $10,000.\n\nIn hindsight, Shinada believes he used the money for a better endeavour: instead of buying items, he bought experience. His experience crisscrossing Africa taught him that, even among diverse cultures, trading is a common language.\n\nBefore making the trip around Africa, he was conflicted on whether to become a researcher or a businessman. At the end of the trip, he had chosen to become a businessman.\n\nIn 2010, upon graduation from college, Shinada joined Sojitz, a Japanese company that led investment in infrastructure and energy projects in West Africa. At Sojitz, he was in charge of developing and investing in infrastructure and energy projects like the first desalination project in sub-Saharan Africa at a commercial scale. After seven years on the job, he itched to do something different.\n\nHe took some time off to return to Japan before heading to Harvard Business School for his MBA. Afterwards, he returned to Africa as a general partner at Kepple Africa Ventures.\n\n\u201cWhile at Sojitz, I had started becoming interested in Nigerian entrepreneurs starting their own businesses. I saw a lot of Africans who studied or lived in Europe and the US coming back to their home countries to start businesses that leveraged on new technologies. This was the opposite of the brain drain. I knew I had to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How did Kepple Africa Ventures start?\n\nSatoshi Shinada: The origin of Kepple dates back to when Takahiro Kanzaki, a certified public accountant, left KPMG to provide accounting and back-office support for startups in Japan. After a few years, he saw that his startups turned out to be well-established companies and unicorns. So, he came up with the idea of creating Fundboard, a portfolio management software-as-a-service (SaaS) company for venture capitalists and private equity firms.\n\nAs a result of that decision, today Kepple is at the centre of the startup community in Japan with this tool. This provided Kepple with access to a network of investors to raise $18 million for Kepple Africa Ventures.\n\nThere are three persons involved in Kepple Africa ventures. Takahiro Kanzaki is in charge of fundraising from Japanese investors. Ryosuke Yamawaki handles investing in East and Southern African startups while I focus on investing in West and North African startups. Yamawaki started investing in Kenyan startups in 2018 while I started doing the same in Nigeria the following year.\n\nDA: What\u2019s Kepple\u2019s investment thesis?\n\nSS: Kepple Africa Ventures came to bridge two gaps. The first was the deep gap between seed and Series A because investors are very fragmented. We wanted to become an anchor investor in the seed stage for startups in Africa.\n\nThe second was, we wanted to bridge the mismatch between what African startups needed and the type of investors available in the ecosystem. We wanted to solve this problem by bringing more Japanese companies to invest directly in African startups and providing strategic support/capital, and in the end becoming an acquirer of the startups.\n\nIn Africa, you usually find financial investors and impact-driven social investors from Europe or the US, but you don\u2019t find lots of strategic investors. These strategic investors are supported by the existing big businesses. They drive the growth of the startups through partnerships and end up even acquiring startups and giving exit opportunities to the ecosystems. You\u2019ll find more of these strategic investors in India or Southeast Asia than in Africa.\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve already facilitated Japanese companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to directly invest in our portfolio companies. In the past 10 months, we\u2019ve brought four or five Japanese companies to directly invest into our portfolio companies.\n\nDA: Hmm, that\u2019s good to hear. What do you look for in the companies you invest in?\n\nSS: First, I\u2019d like to point out that our big vision is to create new industries from Africa. So we don\u2019t consider our investment standalone. We want to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nNow to answer your question, we lookout for the quality of the founders; they have to have a big vision to tackle real problems. Beyond having a big vision, they need to understand the biggest pain points of their customers. And why I say so is that in Africa it\u2019s easy to mix up individual pains and social pains. For instance, deciding to tackle the pain point of poverty in Africa, although an important issue, doesn\u2019t really help you to monetise your business model. Africa is also a place where it is very difficult to make people pay for your service.\n\nSo, your service or product should be really laser-focused on the biggest pain points of your customers and then you monetise that solution. We are not charity investors; we are commercial investors, so monetisation and revenue growth are very important.\n\nDA: Are there any sectors you prefer to invest in?\n\nSS: We\u2019re sector agnostic, but we filter the startups we invest in based on four investment pillars. The first pillar is startups helping to complement or supplement the lack of public infrastructure. For example, we invested in a company called Flare. They are building an ambulance network for Africa. You know in Africa it\u2019s difficult to access a reliable ambulance network, but by providing an Uber-like platform to the owners of ambulances and hospitals, they can create that kind of public service infrastructure of the ambulance network to make people\u2019s lives better and safer.\n\nThe second pillar is startups that help businesses to digitise their operations and production, and make them more efficient. In this case, I\u2019m talking about helping companies with a business-to-business (B2B) model, because in Africa, business-to-consumer (B2C) models are not as active as other markets in Southeast Asia or India.\n\nThe third pillar is focused on startups pioneering innovation where Africa does not have legacy infrastructure yet. Sometimes you can find leapfrogging technology from Africa and that technology could be applicable to other parts of the world. An example of this is one of our portfolio companies called Shyft Power in Nigeria. They automate the management of different power sources: grid of generators, solar power or batteries. They could commercialise this technology because in Nigeria many people don\u2019t rely solely on power from the grid.\n\nIt\u2019s not the same in Japan. If we need to develop that technology in Japan, we have to create a very artificial environment where power is not stable enough. Interestingly, in Japan we are seeing more solar power sources being introduced in each home and now they need to get this power generated by solar to be combined with the power coming from the grid and sell to their communities.\n\nTo wrap this up, the fourth pillar is about startups that facilitate African content created by Africans for Africans. That\u2019s why we have invested in a company like Mdundo, which is seen as the African version of Spotify. We\u2019ve also invested in a company called Athlst, which publishes first-person narratives of African athletes from around the world.\n\nSatoshi Shinada, Maya Tada ( team member at Kepple Africa) and Lanre Aina, Co-Founder/CEO of ATHLST\n\nDA: You\u2019ve invested in almost 100 startups within 3 years. That\u2019s unusual. Why?\n\nSS: Yes, it\u2019s intentional for a number of reasons. We didn\u2019t start out early in VC investing in Africa; we entered this market in 2018. But I think we came to the market at the right time. When we came in, the ecosystem had matured, so we thought it would make sense to bet on great startups quickly.\n\nOur swift approach is modelled after one of the most successful VCs in Southeast Asia, BeeNext. BeeNext makes most of its returns from follow-up investments. So their first cheque is to get their feet in so many startups so they become an insider and know what\u2019s going on in their portfolio companies. Once they see signs of exponential growth, they double down on their investment.\n\nAnother reason we invested in many startups was that we were new to the ecosystem, so we had to establish a reputation by increasing our presence so that we would access greater deal flow. Moving very fast and efficiently did that for us.\n\nFurthermore, we wanted to challenge the perception that Japanese companies are slow. Japanese companies are notoriously known for their very slow decision-making process, compared to Indian or Chinese companies.\n\nDA: How have you been able to combine speed and quality while investing in startups?\n\nSS: That\u2019s a good question, It\u2019s always a balance between the quality and the speed. If you\u2019re investing in seed-stage startups, you don\u2019t have to do very detailed due diligence because one day the startup can decide to change its entire business model. This rarely happens in Series A. You just need to do more detailed due diligence on their product, tech, corporate governance and the founder.\n\nFor the seed-stage deals, it\u2019s more based on your conviction and trust in the founders. If you can build enough trust and conviction, with the minimum amount of due diligence, you should go ahead. And that\u2019s the strategy we took: we usually spend less than one month for due diligence when we invest in seed-stage deals. The quickest investment we\u2019ve made took two weeks, from the first introductory call to wiring the capital.\n\nDA: Tell me about some mistakes you\u2019ve made?\n\nSS: I\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\nAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\n\nDA: Have you had any bad experiences with the startups? Has any startup in your portfolio gone bankrupt?\n\nSS: I don\u2019t have any business that went bankrupt in my portfolio companies.\n\nWe\u2019ve had two companies that stopped operating, but it\u2019s not like the founders just disappeared. We understood how it happened and the founders were serious enough to explain to us what\u2019s going on. One of them even gave back 100% of the money that we invested. So, it wasn\u2019t a very bad situation.\n\nInitially, we thought we\u2019d have many cases of the stories you hear about startups going under or disappearing because our investment has been driven more by conviction and trust with our founders than anything else, but that\u2019s not happening yet. I think this is great validation.\n\nSatoshi Shinada, Maya Tada and the co-founders of Releaf\n\nDA: I see on your website it says you\u2019ve stopped accepting applications. What\u2019s happening?\n\nSS: Yes, that\u2019s true. Now we are in transition to our fund two. So we temporarily stopped accepting applications, but we still keep the form open and get about three to four applications per day. We think it\u2019s very important to keep our doors open to any new startups.\n\nInterestingly, about 85% of our investments was made into the startup that was introduced by one of our portfolio companies, or other co-investors. So the referral is the most important source of the deals. But if you just rely on that, you might miss someone coming from outside the network. So, we want to keep that door open for the outside.\n\nDA: What\u2019s your ticket size?\n\nSS: We are focused on seed-stage deals. Our first cheque is between $50K and150K. Once we invest, we look at the revenue growth in our portfolio companies, and if it shows very dramatic growth, we will do a follow-up investment, which could be somewhere between $200K to $1 million. Where we invest $1 million, it would be a syndicate between other Japanese investors.\n\nDA: Talking about Japanese investors, are there any other Japanese investors in Africa?\n\nSS: There are a few other Japanese VCs, but unfortunately, none of them have their cooperation in Africa. They just go back and forth between Japan and Africa; they\u2019re remote investors.\n\nCompared to them, we think of ourselves as very much committed to Africa because of our background of doing business in Africa. We\u2019ve noticed that a number of them just copy our investment deals. We don\u2019t like this and aren\u2019t comfortable with people just copying us while we\u2019re on the ground bearing the cost of making investments.\n\nDA: Hmm, so why are there not so many Japanese investors on the ground like Kepple?\n\nSS: Well, I think it\u2019s not as a result of the lack of capital or lack of willingness from the Japanese investors to invest in Africa; it\u2019s more about the shortage of capable and experienced talents who can manage the funds in Africa. It\u2019s very difficult to find talent who understand the African market and who can commit their lives to Africa.\n\nI\u2019m single, so it\u2019s very easy for me to move around, but my partner Ryosuke, who is based in Kenya, had to bring his wife and two kids along with him. He\u2019s really committed. His family has been around for a while such that his kids now speak Swahili.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "Nigeria became the first country in Africa to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC) this week after President Muhammadu Buhari unveiled the eNaira at the State House in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nIssued by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the digital currency is built on a private blockchain technology developed by Bitt Inc and has the same value as the fiat or physical currency.\n\nThe new currency can be accessed and used via the eNaira wallet (named \u201cSpeed\u201d), a digital storage held and managed on a distributed ledger. The wallet is available for download via app stores like Google Play Store and Apple App Store.\n\nHowever, questions remain about the use cases of the eNaira.\n\neNaira use cases\n\nFinancial institutions are responsible for onboarding their customers and integrating the eNaira wallet feature into their digital banking channels.\n\nFor individuals and merchants/businesses, the wallet is required to access, hold and use the eNaira. Users can also dial a USSD shortcode and follow the required steps to perform transactions.\n\nGoing by CBN\u2019s guidelines, the requirements for opening a wallet, transaction and balance limits, as well as transaction types available, are based on the wallet tier a user belongs to.\n\nThe dedicated individual wallet for eNaira recorded over 100,000 downloads on Google Play Store less than 48 hours after its rollout, according to reports, before it was removed following a series of complaints and poor ratings. The merchant version had been downloaded more than 10,000 times.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor now, eNaira transaction types available to individual consumers via the wallet include person-to-person (P2P) transfers between friends and family; person-to-business (P2B) to pay for goods or services; and person-to-government (P2G) to pay for public services.\n\nNigerians can also transfer cash from bank accounts to the eNaira speed wallet and vice versa, receive support allowance directly from the CBN through government-to-person (G2P) transfers and carry out any other services as may be approved by the CBN from time to time.\n\nUsing the wallet, merchants can send money to their bank accounts and vice versa, as well as carry out merchant/business-to-person (M/B2P) transfers. Merchants also have to sweep their balance(s) into their bank accounts on a daily basis.\n\neNaira Merchant speed wallets can thus be used for receiving and making eNaira payments for goods and services as well as salary payments.\n\nCommercial banks like Stanbic IBTC and Guaranty Trust Bank already have how-to instructions on their websites. According to the banks, the wallet guarantees secure, faster, cheaper, and more convenient transactions for individual and merchant users.\n\nIn the long run, CBN envisions a scenario where financial institutions build an ecosystem of services, such as cross-border transfers, with eNaira as the base product. For instance, a Nigerian trader with a UBA account will be able to settle his import bills from China using eNaira.\n\nThe digital currency could also bring a significant majority of Nigerians without bank accounts into the formal financial economy. The minimum requirement for opening a tier 0 wallet is a phone number while the tier 1 category requires a mobile number and verified national identity number (NIN).\n\nThus, a plumber or vulcaniser in Oyo or Cross River State without a bank account can accept payments via his phone, store them in his wallet, and make transactions with any vendor.\n\nThe eNaira wallet tiers and conditions.

Image credit: CBN whitepaper\n\nIn addition, the CBN plans to integrate the eNaira into its forex process via international money transfer operators (IMTOs) to enable Nigerians easily receive remittances.\n\nTransactions on the eNaira platform are free for the first 90 days from Monday, after which banks will revert to applicable charges as outlined in the CBN\u2019s guide.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

They had even founded an adtech company that wanted to put ad screens in public buses and ride hailing cabs, but the business didn\u2019t scale.\n\nWhile growing up, Kara, ex-CEO of RED Media and Fayankin, ex-COO at Statecraft Inc., were actively involved in small-scale trading and procurement. Kara grew up on his civil servant father\u2019s farm where they reared animals and grew crops, but the farm later folded up due to lack of access to the market.\n\nBefore leaving for university\u2014and afterwards, occasionally during the holidays\u2014Fayakin handled procurement for his family\u2019s hotel business in Akure. Though Kara would go on to do different things after school and Olumide would become a procurement expert, having these early experiences from different perspectives was key to how they were able to quickly connect the dots when they came together to start Vendease.\n\nKara, who considers himself a foodie\u2014somebody who loves to eat\u2014had a light bulb moment when a food truck that sold \u201cone of the best pork chops in the world\u201d in the Lekki area of Lagos shut down due to its inability to cope with the price instability of food materials in Nigeria. The business was running at a loss and the owner told Kara he had to shut down.\n\nVendease co-founders.\n\nKara told his friends about the closure of his best pork chops spot. They all vented and, as usual, discussed the problem for a while, asking what if they could do something to help small food businesses like this to scale. But they soon forgot about it and went on with their lives.\n\nThe eureka moment that would lead to Vandease came when Fayankin and his wife won an online couple\u2019s competition that sent them on an all-expense-paid getaway in one of the finest hotels in Lagos. While in the hotel, Fayakin overheard the manager of the hotel lamenting about the late delivery of items he had ordered for about two days. He engaged the manager and carefully registered all his troubles. He then asked the manager if he\u2019d take an alternative if he saw one. The manager said yes and that\u2019s how Vendease, which hadn\u2019t been named, got its first customer.\n\n\u201cWe stopped after the third successful errand. While running errands for this hotel, on the side, we were talking to other food business owners and learning a lot from the open market, and then we decided to build technology stacks that would help solve the problem at scale,\u201d Kara told TechCabal.\n\nThey reached out to Gatumi who was then CPO at 54gene, Africa\u2019s premier biotech company, and Oyepeju who was a serial techpreneur and has built technologies for a few global tech companies like IBM and MTN.\n\n\u201cWe put a thesis together after a couple of months and analysed what the market size was, and what our market share would be if we were to kick off then. We took our thesis to local angels in the Lagos ecosystem and they gave us our first cheque to prove the business model based on our track records,\u201d Kara said.\n\nPivoting into a more sustainable system\n\nThe initial idea was simple: enable food businesses to get their regular supply at the quality and price they wanted. So they built a marketplace to connect restaurants with manufacturers, vendors and farms. This way, restaurants could compare prices and buy according to their budget.\n\nThey entered the market with this product and, after a while, realised that they\u2019d only digitised the traditional way of procurement. Their customers\u2019 complaints on delayed fulfilment and poor quality still lurked around. So they started building proprietary tech and systems that would allow them to be active in the entire value chain, from the point of order to the point of last-mile fulfilment.\n\nSo how does a food supply operating system work?\n\nVendease doesn\u2019t just allow food businesses place orders for food supplies and track them; they can also manage inventory, track expenses and gain access to credit facilities. The startup is moving towards becoming the only partner food businesses need to scale and stay in business.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAccording to Kara, the company has grown from a procurement marketplace to a full-fledged data company. In the space of 22 months of operations, the company has built a data bank that now gives near-perfect insights on how to serve their customers better.\n\n\u201cWe now have an algorithm that can predict when and what our users are going to order. So we have our trained procurement officers on standby before our customers even make their orders. We can move ahead, and this is how we\u2019ve been able to beat the 24 hours delivery time,\u201d Kara said when asked how the company fulfils a promise of 24 hours delivery in a busy environment like Lagos.\n\nGrowth and traction\n\nThe startup is growing fast from a one-customer business to handling procurement for over a thousand food businesses in three Nigeria cities: Lagos, Ibadan and Abuja.\n\nBecause its algorithm was built on a tough market like Lagos, expanding and operating in Ibadan and Abuja was seamless.\n\nIn September 2021 alone, the startup said it has delivered approximately 100,000 metric tons of food and helped restaurants save approximately 5,000 man-hours in the last 9 months. This has helped the startup to hit a $12.9 million transaction volume in September.\n\nThe startup joined Y Combinator in the summer of 2020 and on Monday, October 25, it announced that it has closed a $3.2 million investment round from Global Founders Capital, Y Combinator, Hustle Fund, Liquid 2 Ventures, Hack VC, Soma Capital. Early backers like Tayo Oviosu of Paga, John Obaro of Remita and Magic fund also participated.\n\nSpeaking on their investment in Vendease, Don Stalter, managing partner at Global Founders Capital, said, \u201cAs a backer of one of Africa\u2019s very first unicorns, Jumia, we\u2019ve seen a great deal of talent in the market\u2014and Tunde and the Vendease team are best in class both in EMEA and globally. Their laser focus and rapid growth are unprecedented, and there\u2019s a massive opportunity ahead.\u201d\n\nThe company plans to use the fund to expand into more African cities and build more technology stacks that will position it as the operating system of food supply.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

All orders in process will be shipped or refunded. Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused,\u201d a message on the Africa eShop website reads.\n\nLaunched in 2019, eShop was designed to help global retailers sell goods to Africa\u2019s consumer markets.\n\nThrough the platform, consumers in Africa could shop directly from more than 200 US- and UK-based online retailers, with purchases delivered to their door by DHL Express.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBeing a global leader in express logistics, DHL appeared to be well-positioned to connect African consumers with global brands, and an early-stage boom suggested that presumption was correct.\n\nWithin seven weeks of operations in 11 countries, DHL expanded the platform to nine more countries across the continent. This followed \u201cimpressive growth\u201d in the usage of the Africa eShop app, Hennie Heymans, CEO of DHL Express Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) said at the time. By August of 2019, the platform had been rolled out to 34 countries across SSA.\n\nOnce considered a threat to leading e-commerce players in Africa, DHL\u2019s eShop offered relatively faster delivery compared to its peers but was also one of the most expensive platforms for international shopping, some of its users told TechCabal.\n\nDHL is closing down its Africa eShop. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nHowever, for reasons not stated, eShop has now been delisted from mobile application stores and some features on the platform have been disabled as DHL moves to shut down the service on October 30.\n\nIt is not immediately clear if the company is closing its eShop operations in other regions too, such as the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).\n\nTechCabal reached out to DHL Africa for answers but has yet to receive a response at the time of publication.\n\nHi, unfortunately the eShop is closing 30 October.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Source: Supplied,\n\nSouth African API fintech startup, Stitch has today announced its expansion into Nigeria and a $2M seed extension, with investment from Future Africa and Norrsken Foundation, among others.\n\nStitch announced an initial $4 million seed in February when it came out of stealth. This brings its total seed round to $6 million.\n\nThe startup launched officially in February 2021 with an API that provides software companies with identity verification tools and access to users\u2019 financial data.\n\nSince its launch, the company claims to have grown by 40-50% month-on-month.\n\nSpeaking about the company\u2019s expansion to Nigeria, Kiaan Pillay, Stitch CEO, says, \u201cNigeria is one of the most active markets on the continent, if not the world, for fintech. The opportunity we see here is endless.\u201d\n\nHe says the company plans to become the \u201cgo-to partner for any businesses building financial products in Africa.\u201d\n\nMore competition: Stitch would be facing off with other API fintech players such as Mono which announced a $15 million Series A earlier this month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMono, which launched in 2020, boasts partnerships with 270 businesses and 200 million financial data transactions.\n\nMeanwhile, this seed extension is to enable Stitch to grow its team in Nigeria as it prepares to expand into other African countries.\n\nCoup attempts in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\u2019s latest military coup occurred on Monday, October 25, 2021, in Sudan.\n\nThousands of Sudanese were met with bullets as they took to the streets to protest the dissolution of their democracy.\n\nPer Reuters, 7 people were killed by gunfire while 140 others were injured in clashes between soldiers and protesters.\n\nCoup \u2018pon coup: As a continent, Africa has experienced her share of challenges, deeply rooted in political tyranny and unaccountability, resulting in coups or dictatorships.\n\nAccording to Intelligence by Techpoint, Africa has witnessed 83 coup attempts since 1990, with 42 successful. Although rare today, coups still threaten democracy.\n\nRecoMed\u2019s $1.5m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tyck via Iwaria\n\nRecoMed, an online healthcare marketplace, has closed a $1.5 million financing round.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the round was led by Vunani Fintech Fund with participation from others including, Growth Grid Venture Capital Partners and Push Ventures.\n\nWhat does RecoMed do? Look at it as an Amazon for healthcare professionals.\n\nLaunched in 2013, it is a platform where patients can request healthcare professionals across South Africa by searching practitioner profiles while checking reviews.\n\nRecoMed says its platform reduces the time it takes for patients to get the medical services they need. The startup takes a cut per requests made on the website.\n\nIs healthtech the next fintech? While fintech startups still get a significant chunk of African funding, healthtech startups seem to be attracting some serious cash.\n\nAccording to Disrupt Africa, funding for healthtech startups increased by 257.5% from 2019 to 2020.\n\nHowever, Africa\u2019s healthcare sector still needs more funding to increase access to quality and affordable health services. According to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), $25-30 billion in new investment will be needed to meet Africa\u2019s healthcare demand over the next decade.\n\nRecoMed plans to integrate new products into its platform with the funding.\n\nUnion54 raises $3m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnion54 Founders, Perseus Mlambo and Alessandra Martini. Credit: TechCrunch.\n\nZambian fintech startup, Union54 has raised $3 million in seed funding.\n\nAccording to TechCrunch, The Y Combinator-backed startup saw investments from Tiger Global, ACE & Company, and Runa Capital.\n\nWhat does the startup do? Union54 owns an API that helps software companies issue debit cards without a bank or third-party processor.\n\nThe startup was launched by a couple, Perseus Mlambo and Alessandra Martini, this year. It is an offshoot of their previous company, Zazu, which launched in 2015 as a neobank in Zambia.\n\nThe duo launched Union54 after they encountered difficulty in issuing debit cards at Zazu. The cards had to be issued through partner banks, a process that took a lot of time.\n\nMlambo told TechCrunch that they \u201crealised that either the processor or the bank was not necessarily well equipped to be able to answer our questions or to be able to give us the product that we\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\nThe funding will be channelled at building a strong engineering and product and sales team.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nNigeria\u2019s March to the Gallows.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction: Naira\u2019s digitisation (the eNaira)\n\nA very recent accomplishment of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is the issuance of the new Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the eNaira.\n\nThe eNaira is the digital form of the Naira issued by the CBN to complement the traditional Naira as a less costly and more efficient means of payment, geared towards fostering financial inclusion of the unbanked population.\n\nThe eNaira has been designed to operate using the two-tier model, \u2018a hybrid system\u2019, where the CBN as developer and regulator relates directly with the users, while the commercial banks, including other fintech organisations, act as intermediaries.\n\nConsequently, financial institutions have the responsibility to onboard their customers and integrate the eNaira wallet feature into their digital banking channels.\n\nAcceptance of the eNaira\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf properly harnessed, a more simplified and less costly payment system would thrive in Nigeria. The country is home to one of the world\u2019s youngest populations, with increasing smartphone penetration, and has made notable advancements in regulations to increase financial inclusion and cashless payments.\n\nCertainly, there are challenges to operating a CBDC, one of which is the possibility of deposit flight from traditional commercial banks.\n\nMeasures to combat this concern include limiting the amount of CBDC held by each consumer as already implemented by the CBN and its zero interest rate, thus disincentivising the need to have a high stock of this asset. Regulators should begin to measure the level of acceptance of this digital currency within the next few months.\n\nBeyond Financial Inclusion\n\nA CBDC Regime for Efficiency in the Flow of Foreign Remittances\n\nOne of the major benefits canvassed for the development of the CBDC is the ability to solve the present inefficiencies in the flow of foreign remittances (FR). FR flow continues to be one of the greatest sources of revenue for developing economies such as Nigeria.\n\nThe World Bank data also indicates that remittance flow to Nigeria accounted for over 40% of remittance flows to the sub-Saharan region in 2020, while remaining the most expensive region to send money to.\n\nHow can the adoption of CBDC by central banks aid in solving the inefficiencies in the flow of FR? A major priority of the G20 has been the need to enhance cross-border payments by addressing the key challenges.\n\nVarious research efforts aimed at addressing these challenges indicate that by leveraging on technological advancement, a model like the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) solution for cross border funds transfer has the potential to complete a multi-currency cross-border payment process utilising wholesale multi-CBDCs (mCBDCs) within seconds.\n\nTo achieve these gains, it is imperative to factor an international dimension into the CBDC\u2019s design. This would require multi-jurisdictional collaboration amongst central banks, which takes interoperability across jurisdictions into account when countries are designing their domestic CBDCs. It is hoped that the design model behind the eNaira can permit coordination amongst peers once mCBDCs models become operational.\n\nBoosting Intra-African Trade by Digitising Trade Finance: A case for mCBDCs\n\nBeyond the tremendous potential for efficiency in the flow of FR, mCBDCs may provide a great avenue for boosting intra-African trade through a unified payment system for cross-border trade in goods and services within the African Continental Free Trade Area (\u201cAfCFTA\u201d).\n\nThe AfCFTA, once fully operational, promises to unlock immense value and economic development for the continent. Blockchain technology is delivering great rewards, which the continent has to fully embrace to make the quantum leap in economic development, especially after the setback experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs already stated, the DLT solution for cross-border and FX funds transfer has huge potentials for simplifying cross-border payment with great savings on time and money.\n\nResearch already reveals that it can deliver advantages like payment verification decentralisation, resilient payment landscape, payment innovation through utilisation of smart contracts, cash tokenisation, data integrity, and interoperability.\n\nThese are emerging solutions to pain points currently experienced in cross-border transactions, and African entrepreneurs and SMEs will benefit greatly from such a system.\n\nThe DLT solution is not without its problems like other technological innovations, and various jurisdictions are still ironing out the kinks. However, the conversation keeps progressing and Africa through AfCFTA must not be left out of the discourse as the DLT solution promises to be one of the major avenues for eliminating non-tariff barriers to trade within the continent.\n\nAsides from Nigeria, many African countries are actively exploring and researching the issuance of CBDCs in their jurisdictions. We believe that CBDC adoption within the AfCFTA is imminent, albeit progressive.\n\nThus, the importance of early cooperation amongst member states at the design stage, or at the latest, the pilot stage, cannot be overemphasised. If this window is missed, coordination at a later stage becomes cumbersome, time-consuming, expensive, and may set the continent back decades in its economic development agenda.\n\nThe unplanned and undesirable alternative would most likely be a proliferation of largely unregulated cryptocurrencies and their variants as a means of payment across large eCommerce platforms and the likely adoption of global alternatives to money such as the stablecoins, which is already a subject of discourse.\n\nConclusion\n\nNigeria has taken another bold step towards trade finance digitisation by introducing the eNaira; however, the journey has just begun. CBDCs have great potential for unlocking the exponential economic growth of Africa.\n\nSome countries and regional economic blocs are making great strides in developing workable solutions to unlock the value in mCBDCs adoption through partnerships with organisations like the Bank for International Systems (BIS).\n\nIf Africa is to tap into the huge potential for trade liberalisation offered by the AfCFTA, it needs to take a cue from these jurisdictions and explore partnerships for research and development into mCBDCs as a veritable means for cross-border payments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAderemi Fagbemi Partner, Tech & Digital Law Desk at Tope Adebayo LLP | +234 809 992 7408 | a.fagbemi@topeadebayollp.com | Website Aderemi is a Partner with Tope Adebayo LLP with almost two decades of experience in the legal profession.

          "text": "The Federal Government will soon place a ban on further importation of barite, a move that would save $300 million every year in foreign exchange (FX).\n\nThis is as 12 barite processors have been found worthy to produce world-class barite that meets American Petroleum Institute\u2019s (API) standards.\n\nThis was disclosed in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Thursday, by Olamilekan Adegbite, minister of mines and steel development; Simbi Wabote, executive secretary, Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), and Godwin Emefiele, governor, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), who was represented by Anthony Ifechukwu, his special assistant, at the launch of the world-class barite product.\n\nBarite is indicated as a high gravity mineral used as sludge in the oil and gas industry to stop explosion of gas during drilling. It is mostly used by the oil and gas industry in Nigeria and this made the Ministry of Steel Development to select Port Harcourt for the launch of the product to bring the awareness closer to the users.\n\nThe major pronouncement on the proposed ban came from the executive secretary of the NCDMB who said a study was commissioned by the Board on Nigeria\u2019s readiness to produce it locally and stop importation.\n\nRead Also: FG to convince oil companies to patronise local barite producers \u2013 Fayemi\n\nWabote stated that the Board commissioned a study which eventually picked out 12 processors that can give Nigeria self-sufficiency in the product and help stop any further importation.\n\nHe said the 12 companies have thus been approved to carry on with the business at API standards. He said the FG would slam the ban in 2022, but he did not mention the specific date.\n\nThe SA to the CBN boss (Ifechukwu), while offering the support of the apex bank to the barite drive, said the CBN would no longer allocate foreign exchange as soon as the ban is placed.\n\nInstead, he said the ministers in charge of the mineral would meet with the CBN governor next week to agree on modalities for a finance package to boost local processing to meet international standards.\n\nThe concern of the CBN, he stated, is to promote whatever would help Nigeria to conserve forex use and rather earn foreign exchange as well as create jobs.\n\nSpeaking, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development (Adegbite), expressed happiness that the CBN was stepping into the mining sector with special funding, and called the launch a watershed moment in the journey to self-sufficiency in barite production.\n\nSaying the Ministry was pursuing a presidential directive as far back as 2016, Adegbite said collaboration has brought the drive to the point of success of using Nigeria\u2019s minerals to capture international market share and attract, saying the sector has already attracted $150m loans in 2017.\n\nHe said the drive also worked to reduce importation and create jobs in areas such as gypsum, kaolin, etc. He mentioned the Benue trough as the area rich in Barite while experts said the nation has mapped out 146 barite spots that can supply for the next 100 years.\n\nHe said Nigerian barite hub is being created for easy coordination with what he called Open Market System.\n\nThe director-general of the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency (NGSA), Garba, described Barite as an industrial mineral that has both upstream and downstream sectors, saying more studies were still ongoing.\n\nHe said, \u201cSoon, importation of Barite into Nigeria will stop because the processes that lead to such a policy are in progress.\u201d",

Leadway Assurance the privately-held and largest insurance company in Nigeria is owned and run by Tunde Hassan-Odukale.\n\nBusinessDay discovered that Hassan-Odukale acquired the bulk of his shareholding in the bank this year.\n\nThe Hassan-Odukale family have held shares in Nigeria\u2019s oldest bank for over 20 years said a person familiar with the family business.\n\nHassan-Odukale\u2019s recent direct and indirect stake in FBN Holdings Plc shows he has been buying the shares of the financial holding company aggressively this year.\n\nAn analysis of First Bank\u2019s annual report shows that Hassan-Odukale\u2019s direct stake in FBN Holdings was 8,854,003 units while his indirect stake was 360,961,091 units as at the end of 2020.\n\nAs at October 26, Hassan-Odukale\u2019s direct interest in the bank is 26,231,887 units while entities he controls indirectly own 1,897,280,212 units in the financial holding company.\n\nA letter from First Bank to the Nigerian Exchange Group on Tuesday, showed that Hassan-Odukale and entities he controls are the largest shareholder in the bank, when combined. Hassan-Odukale and his related parties own 4.16 percent and 1.20 percent of FBNH, respectively, according to the letter.\n\nData gleaned from the letter show that the direct and indirect shares of Hassan-Odukale in the bank now total 1.9 billion units. This a significant jump from the 369.8 million shares held at the end of 2020, according to data from the 2020 annual report of First Bank.\n\nRead Also: Femi Otedola buys 5.07% stake in FBN Holdings\n\nIn other words Hassan-Odukale, directly or indirectly, acquired 1.5 billion First Bank shares in 2021 alone, 78 percent of the stake related to him.\n\nPut together, all the shares linked to Hassan-Odukale bring his stake equivalent to 5.36 percent of First Bank\u2019s total outstanding shares and makes him the single largest shareholder.

          "text": "Investors are increasingly taking rare bets on Nigeria\u2019s healthcare sector as they eye a slice of the estimated $1.5 billion spent on medical tourism abroad yearly.\n\nThe opportunity has been there for long but has been brought to the fore on the back of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused a further uptick in medical tourism.\n\nMoney backed by multinational giants in healthcare investment and big Nigerian banks is flowing into the development of hospitals vast in modern diagnostics and therapy equipment, as well as skilled manpower of international repute, catering to top diseases that drive patients abroad.\n\nThe Duchess International Hospital, the brainchild of the Reddington Hospital Group, is the latest \u2018kid on the block\u2019 of such hospitals springing up in Nigeria\u2019s commercial centre in a year upset by the second and third waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPlayers such as Duchess are closing in on a market that has been controlled over time by leading medical facilities in countries like India, Germany, US, UK, and Dubai, owing to weak infrastructure, poor government spending, and rising loss of medical professionals to improved working conditions elsewhere.\n\nRead Also: A stitch in time for investment in Nigeria\u2019s healthcare sector\n\nNigeria\u2019s healthcare sector\n\nIndia alone accounts for more than half of $1.5 billion that Nigeria loses yearly to purchasing medical services overseas, according to the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA).\n\nYemi Osinbajo, Nigeria\u2019s vice-president said highly invested hospitals such as Duchess could create an attractive proposition to reverse brain drain based on the opportunities offered.\n\nHe said the reasons medical professionals vote with their feet might begin to fizzle away as investments increase in the sector, speaking during the inauguration.\n\n\u201cThis is the 15th facility of the conglomerate of Reddington Hospital in the country. So, there must be some business sense. With investments like these seeking high-quality healthcare, we can even reverse the trend of doctors voting with their feet,\u201d Osinbajo said.\n\nThe 110-bed hospital, fully-equipped facility in the Lagos State capital, Ikeja, is arguably Nigeria\u2019s first private multi-specialty hospital on Lagos Mainland.\n\nIt parades some of the scarce devices in the country such as catheterization laboratory, mammogram, ultrasound, X-Ray machines, ventilators, and anaesthetic machines, among other technology resources.\n\nAccording to Adetokunbo Shitta-Bey, CEO of the hospital, the six-year project is designed to provide ample substitute for medical solutions to chronic diseases sought abroad and also address the disproportionate distribution of healthcare in Lagos.\n\n\u201cWe want to ensure every Nigerian has access to quality care. Nigerians abroad doing wonderful things should be back home to be part of this vision,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite a population growth rate of 3.2 percent annually, estimated to reach 400 million by 2050, Nigeria\u2019s healthcare spending hovers around 3.75 percent instead of 15 percent.\n\nInfant mortality remains at 76 per 1,000 as the country grapples with about 35,000 doctors when 237,000 is needed, according to the World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) estimates.\n\nTo fix bed to population deficit, a 2020 research by Knight Frank, a consultancy services and forecasting firm, states that Nigeria requires an additional 386,000 beds based on the global average, as of 2019 and 646,000 by 2035.\n\nAt least, $82 billion worth of real estate investment in healthcare would be required based on the world average, according to the reports.\n\nIt is a long haul but firms that spot the potential in the sector are getting into the fray.\n\nSupporting the planning, development, building, and equipping of the facility at Duchess International Hospital, GE Healthcare provided a comprehensive suite of solutions such as X-Ray-Brivo DRF, Digital Mammo Senographe Pristina, Cath Lab \u2013 Innova 530, CT-Scan- Optima CT 660, Ultrasound \u2013 Vivid T8, Voluson, Logiq F6, Mobile Xray \u2013 Optima XR 220, LCS-Ventilator, Baby Warmers, and Anesthetic Machine.\n\nEyong Ebai, general manager, GE Healthcare, sub-Saharan Africa, said the partnership with Duchess Hospital showcases the interest in ensuring the best availability of medical equipment for effective world-class healthcare delivery.\n\nGE Healthcare is a $16.7 billion healthcare business, leading global medical technology and digital solutions innovator that enables clinicians with intelligent devices, data analytics, applications, and services, supported by its Edison Ecosystem.\n\nWith over 100 years of healthcare industry experience, the company operates at the centre of an ecosystem working toward precision health, digitising healthcare, driving productivity, and improving patients\u2019 outcomes.\n\n\u201cWe continue to adapt to improved technology in solving the challenges in healthcare through our equipment,\u201d Ebai said.\n\nIndustry analysts project Nigeria could retain a substantial part of the capital flight that follows medical tourism as more multi-billion naira investments like Duchess spring up around the country.\n\nDuchess is coming seven months after Evercare, a fully-fledged multi-specialist hospital began operations, joining leading players including First Cardiology and Lagoon Hospital, among others.\n\nAdeyemi Onabowale, chairman, Reddington Hospital Group, advised that while private players race to benchmark the country\u2019s healthcare quality against other developing nations with high standards, \u201cthe government should provide adequate and realistic funding for the private sector and National Health Insurance Scheme should regulate the technical process for health coverage in the private sector\u201d.\n\nGodwin Emefiele, governor Central Bank of Nigeria responding said the apex bank will not hesitate to restructure the loan terms to give the hospital longer tenure.\n\nHe said the bank has increased the healthcare intervention fund to N200 billion from the initial N100 billion due to demand.\n\n\u201cWe had taken up N100 million to support but the monetary policy has said we should move it further up to N200 billion. We would continue to do whatever can be done to support healthcare,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI want to encourage our banks to lend to them and also members of our private sector community to invest as you don\u2019t have to be a doctor to own a medical facility,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\nAlso, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos State pledged to create an enabling environment for the likes of Dutchess Hospital in different parts of the state, noting that the state has increased our budget in the health sector this year from about 12.1 percent to 13.6 percent. Healthcare is not lip-service.",

Greg Ogbeifun; renowned lawyer, Sir Oladipo Okpeseyi SAN and the General Superintendent of Gospel Light International Ministries (New Covenant Gospel Church), Rev. Dr. Felix Ilaweagbon Omobude.\n\nSome guests at the convocation ceremony include Commissioner for Education, Dr. Joan Osa Oviawe; Esama of Benin Kingdom, Chief Sir Dr. Gabriel Igbinedion; former governor of Edo State, Chief Lucky Igbinedion, and former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Benin (UNIBEN), Prof. Osayuki Oshodin, amongst others.\n\nThe governor, who was represented by his deputy, Rt. Hon. Comr. Philip Shaibu, listed some of the areas to be explored to include endowments, grants, consultancy services, and commercial ventures, among others, adding, \u201cInstitutions should also promote and encourage inter-institutional co-operation and international linkages in sourcing for funds.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe state government is of the firm position that the primary mandate of our tertiary institution shall be teaching, research and community service. It is also of the view that their programmes shall be relevant to meet the needs of the State and engender development.\u201d\n\nObaseki restated that his administration remains committed to upgrading facilities in tertiary institutions in the state, noting that the government undertook fundamental reforms in the education sector in order to produce the required human capital for the economic development of the State.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe state government will ensure accreditation of all courses by relevant statutory bodies. Our tertiary institutions must promote and encourage scholarship, entrepreneurship and produce skilled manpower relevant to the needs of the labour market.\n\n\u201cThese goals, they shall pursue through quality student intake; quality teaching and learning; research and development; staff welfare and development programmes; high standards in the quality of facilities, services and resources, and provision of a more practical based and technology-driven curriculum relevant to the needs of the labour market.\u201d\n\nObaseki said his administration took bold steps and hard decisions to achieve its objective of turning the institution into a world-class polytechnic.\n\nThe governor noted, \u201cThe process of remodelling this institution by the state government commenced with the setting up of a panel to examine, amongst other things, the operations of the school since inception and make recommendations that will refocus and redirect it on the path to greatness, by realizing its primary mandate as a technology-based institution.\n\n\u201cThereafter, government issued a white paper to give effect to the recommendations of the panel. This was the turning point in the life of the institution.\u201d\n\nThe governor celebrated the first lady for her award in recognition of her role in putting an end to gender-based violence, discrimination and subjugation of women and girls.\n\nOn her part, Betsy Obaseki noted that with the current educational development in Edo, the state will soon become the hub of technical manpower for, not only the state, but Nigeria at large.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cWhat is happening here today is not a mistake and if we continue in this way, our institution will produce great technical manpower to service industries across Nigeria. The country needs Edo State for its development.\u201d\n\nIn his convocation speech, the rector of the polytechnic, Prof. Abiodun Falodun commended the governor for his commitment, focus and determination in repositioning the institution.\n\n...",

          "text": "Facebook Inc CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Thursday that the company has been rebranded as Meta, a name change that comes as it battles criticisms from lawmakers and regulators.\n\nIn a statement published online, the company said the new name \u201cbrings together our apps and technologies under one new company brand.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeta is helping to build the metaverse, a place where we\u2019ll play and connect in 3D. Welcome to the next chapter of social connection.\n\n\u201cThe names of the apps that we build\u2014Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp\u2014will remain the same.\n\n\u201cMeta\u2019s focus will be to bring the metaverse to life and help people connect, find communities and grow businesses,\u201d the company said in the statement.\n\n\u201cThe metaverse will feel like a hybrid of today\u2019s online social experiences, sometimes expanded into three dimensions or projected into the physical world.\u201d\n\nThe company announced the rebranding as it faces criticisms over its market power, its algorithmic decisions and the policing of abuses on its platforms.\n\nIn an earlier speech, Zuckerberg said privacy and safety would need to be built into the metaverse, as he opened the company\u2019s annual conference on virtual and augmented reality on Thursday.\n\nThe CEO gave examples of privacy and safety controls that would be needed in the metaverse, such as the ability to block someone from appearing in your space.\n\nZuckerberg is betting that the metaverse will be the next big computing platform, calling it \u201cthe successor to the mobile internet.\u201d\n\nThe metaverse, a term first coined in a dystopian novel three decades ago and now attracting buzz in Silicon Valley, refers broadly to the idea of a shared virtual environment which can be accessed by people using different devices.\n\nZuckerberg has increasingly been promoting the idea of Facebook, which has invested heavily in augmented and virtual reality, as a \u201cmetaverse\u201d company rather than a social media one.\n\nThe company gave a slew of updates for its VR and AR products. It said it would this year launch a way for people using its Oculus VR headset to call friends using Facebook Messenger and for people to invite others to a social version of their home, dubbed \u201cHorizon Home,\u201d to talk and play games as avatars.\n\nFacebook also said it would introduce a way for Oculus Quest users to use different 2D apps like Slack, Dropbox and Facebook while in this \u201cHorizon Home\u201d VR space.\n\nThe company, which began a beta test of its virtual meeting spaces \u201cHorizon Workrooms\u201d earlier this year, said it was working on ways of customizing these with company logos and designs and said it would be bringing more work capabilities into consumer Quest devices.\n\nIt also announced new fitness offerings for Oculus Quest users.\n\nFacebook said this week that its hardware division Facebook Reality Labs, which is responsible for AR and VR efforts, would become a separate reporting unit and that its investment in it would reduce this year\u2019s total operating profit by about $10 billion.\n\nThis year, Facebook created a product team focused on the metaverse and it recently announced plans to hire 10,000 employees in Europe over the next five years to work on the effort.\n\nFacebook also said it would run a $150 million education program aimed at helping AR and VR creators and developers.\n\nFacebook continues to battle criticism over its market power, its content moderation practices and harms linked to its social media platforms.\n\nThe tech giant, which reports about 2.9 billion monthly users, has faced increasing scrutiny in recent years from global lawmakers and regulators.\n\nIn the latest controversy, whistleblower and former Facebook employee Frances Haugen leaked documents which she said showed the company chose profit over user safety. Zuckerberg earlier this week said the documents were being used to paint a \u201cfalse picture.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower documents, which were first reported by the Wall Street Journal, show internal research and employee discussions on Instagram\u2019s effects on the mental health of teens and whether Facebook stokes divisions, as well as its handling of activity around the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and inconsistencies in content moderation for users around the globe. read more",

          "title": "Amidst outcry, FEC okays N621bn NNPC fund to fix 21 roads, Niger tops with 9 projects",
          "text": "The Federal Executive Council (FEC) Wednesday approved the takeover of the reconstruction of 21 federal roads across the six geopolitical zones of the country by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) at the cost of N621billion.\n\nThe decision is coming at a time there is continued outcry by citizens over the state of Nigerian roads.\n\nBriefing State House correspondents at the end of the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo(SAN), Minister of Works and Housing Babatunde Fashola (SAN) said the approval was in line with Executive Order No. 007 of 2019 cited as the Companies Income Tax (Road Infrastructure Development and Refurbishment Investment Tax Credit Scheme) Order, 2019.\n\nThe minister said the strategic intervention under the Federal Government Road Infrastructure and Refreshment Tax Credit Scheme in respect of 21 roads covers 1,804.6 kilometers.\n\nHe said the Executive Order 7 allows the private sector to deploy taxes in advance if they would pay for infrastructure development.\n\nMajor resolutions\n\nThe minister also said nine of the selected projects were in North-central, three in North-east, two in North-west, two in South-east, three in South-south, and two in South-west.\n\nFashola said he presented three memoranda to the Council, all of which were approved, stressing that the first memorandum had to do with a section of Calabar-Ikom-Ogoja road, especially the section to Apet Central.\n\n\u201cThose drains were put there, about 42 years ago and 86 of them have failed and we need to replace them now with concrete rain drains to allow water pass through, otherwise the retention of water will badly impact the road.\n\n\u201cAs a result of that, we have to revise the scope of works from rehabilitation to construction in order to remove all the old steel drains that are corroded and replace them with concrete drains.\n\n\u201cIt is over 75 kilometers road and that will require an augmentation contract by an additional sum of N12 billion. So that memo was approved,\u201d he said.\n\nOn NNPC\n\nFashola also said: \u201cThe second memorandum relates to the road infrastructure tax credit scheme. You recall the Executive Order seven signed by Mr. President allowing private sector operators to identify infrastructure such as roads for which you deploy your taxes in advance with tax and pay.\n\n\u201cSo you recall that I had briefed you here about the use of that policy like the Dangote Group from Obajana to Kabba, Apapa to Oworoshoki.\n\n\u201cEarlier this year, there were five other roads, the Kaduna Western bypass, the Lekki Port road, the road from Shagamu through Papalanto and couple of others and there is one road in Maiduguri. That was approved about N320 something billion.\n\n\u201cSo today, we have another player. We have all the interested players who are still showing interest but we haven\u2019t concluded. We have another player who has shown interest and committed to deploy taxes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the government corporation known as NNPC. So NNPC has identified 21 roads that it wants to deploy. So, now, the instructive thing about this is that this initiative helps government to achieve many things, including Ministerial Mandates Three and Four, which we discussed at the last retreat, if you recall, was energy sufficiency, electric power and petroleum energy distribution across the country.\n\n\u201cOf course, petroleum energy distribution is being impacted positively and negatively, as the case may be the transport infrastructure, which is the ministerial mandate four.\n\n\u201cSo, NNPC has sought and council has approved today that NNPC deployed tax resources to 21 roads covering the total distance of 1,804.6 kilometers across the six geopolitical zones.\n\n\u201cOut of those 21 roads, nine are in North-central, particularly Niger state. And the reason is that Niger State is a major storage centre for NNPC. So the reason NNPC is doing this is to facilitate the total distribution across the country.\n\n\u201cWe have seen and have heard every year Niger State gridlock, the governor complaining that his roads are being damaged by trucks, by those who overload the trucks after damaging the roads themselves now protest the damage that they sometimes have induced. Anyway, this is the final solution to that problem.\n\n\u201cSo there are nine like that in north central, there are three in the Northeast. Two in the northwest, two in the southeast, three roads, the entire Odupani \u2013 Itu \u2013 Ikot Ekpene road in LOT 1, 2 and 3 now fully covered.\n\n\u201cThen in the South-west, you have the Lagos-Badagry expressway, the entire junction and you also have the Ibadan to Ilorin in Oyo-Ogbumosho section. So that\u2019s it.\n\n\u201cIn the South-east, you have Aba-Ikot Ekpene in Abia and Akwa Ibom states. So that\u2019s a major link, then you have Umuahia to Ikwuano to Ikot Ekpene road and so on and so forth. In the North-west, it is Gada-Zaima-Zuru-Gamji road, and also Zaria-Funtau -Gusau-Sokoto road.\n\n\u201cIn the northeast, it is Cham-, Bali Serti and Gombe-Biu road. The roads impacted in north central include Ilorin -Jebba-Mokwa-Bokani sections I and II, Suleja-Minna sections I and II, Bida-Lambatta, and then Agaie-Katcha-Baro road. Then Mokwa-Makera-Tegina-Kaduna all in Niger State.\n\n\u201cSo, as I said, it is a total of 21 roads. What will happen as a result of this is that there will be no financing problems with regarding the execution of these roads anymore. So, some of these roads that I have mentioned, let me tell you, what has changed. For example, Aba-Ikot Ekpene road has an estimate of about N30.33,399 billion to complete it.\n\n\u201cThe provision in the budget this year is only N200 million. If you look at Suleja-Minna road section II, it has N25.763 billion to complete it. The provision in the budget this year is just N100 million. So, with this intervention, all those roads now will be fully funded, we won\u2019t have budgetary challenges and financing challenges. So, council approved this as a strategic funding of these roads.\u201d\n\nPayment mode\n\nThe minister explained that the payment for total sum of the 21 road contracts was not a one off payment.\n\n\u201cThe whole package is N621, 237,143,897.75 billion. Let\u2019s be clear, it will be spread over periodic tax for about three years. On timeframe of completion, the completion time already exists. They have scheduled completion times. What has hobbled and hampered them is that the annual budgetary provisions have not been enough. So, what it does now is that government can save, like the Lagos-Ibadan, 2nd Niger bridge arrangement and all of those types of roads,\u201d he said.\n\nOn whether government would still go ahead to release the funds budgeted for the roads to be fixed by NNPC, he said: \u201cWhat you see here is that, I mentioned some cases, like for the Oku Iboku power plant section, it has N79 billion to finish, there was no provision at all in the 2021 budget. In the places where there\u2019s provision maybe N100 million, we are more than halfway to the budget we started implementing. So, it probably has been paid and where it has not been paid, the certificate is pending, we will pay and from then on, we will move to the new financing structuring just as we transited the second Niger Bridge, the Lagos-Ibadan expressway from the old budgetary arrangement to the new arrangement, we will transit this too. So those are administrative things and we will be meeting all the contractors to review all the agreements and all the performance and then we will take it from there.\u201d\n\nPower sector\n\nIn his briefing, Minister of Power Abubakar D. Aliyu said the council approved award of contract for the design, manufacture, supply and construction of 55 Kilometer Agu Akwa Umuchu 132 KVA double circuit transmission line and substation having two transformers at Umuchu Umuchu with two by 132 KV line bay extension at Agu Akwa for Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN).\n\nHe said the project is between Anambra and Enugu states and was awarded in favour of Messrs Cartlark International Limited and has dollar and naira components.\n\n\u201cThe naira component is N4, 044,309,380.69 inclusive of 7.5% VAT and 7.5% contingency payable to the Central Bank of Nigeria at the prevailing exchange rate with the completion period of 34 months. This is part of the expansion and modernization of the TCN transmission grid and council has approved that.\n\n\u201cThe second one was approval for award of contract for a procurement and supply of two \u201cFail Safe\u201d 60 MVA, 132 /33KV transformers for transmission Company of Nigeria. They are protecting themselves against fire outbreak.\n\n\u201cThey are made in a way that once there is any fire outbreak it will not affect the transformers. So, these are modern equipments that are being procured to replace the old one, this is also part of the modernization of the equipment on the transmission lines.\n\n\u201cSo, the total control sum is N1, 018,432,930.68 made up of \u20ac1,904,237.50 (offshore component) plus N155, 875,000 (onshore component) inclusive of 7.5% VAT, with delivery period of nine months. This was also approved by council.\n\n\u201cThe third one is approval for variation of an ongoing contract for the construction of two by MVA 330 132/33 KV two by 60 MVA 132/33 KV substations, these are all transformers. And four by 330 KV line bay extension at Akure, and four by 330 KV line bay extension each Ochigbo and Benin north was awarded by the ministerial tender board MTV commercials to Messers Metelak SAL Engineering and constructing limited, on 27 September 2011, in the sum of $19,025,535.45 plus N1,068,728,996 inclusive of 5% VAT as at that time. So, it became obvious and necessary to seek for this variation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister further said: \u201cSo, the contractor requested and the necessary checks were done and the contract is now being increased by this memo to the council.\n\n\u201cThis approval seeks to increase the contract amount from the amount stated. The offshore components still remain; the onshore is now increased to N1, 460,398,661.75. This is with inclusive of 7.5% VAT and the council graciously approved this. So, there is an increase of the sum of N377, 669,675.75.\n\n\u201cBut this is not a one off payment. So, let\u2019s be clear, it will be spread over periodic tax of about three years. On time frame of completion, the completion time already exists. They have scheduled completion times.\u201d\n\nTraders lament Abuja/Lagos\n\nMeanwhile, traders moving their goods from Lagos to Abuja and other northern parts of the country have described the Lagos-Abuja road as terrible, lamenting that the route is affecting the movement of their goods.\n\nA cross section of traders, who spoke with Blueprint, said as a result of the deplorable nature of the roads, they were unable to secure trucks that would move their goods to the northern parts of the country despite the high price.\n\nA trader, who preferred anonymity, called on the federal government to salvage the situation, disclosing that truck drivers were using the deplorable condition of the road as an excuse not to come to Abuja..\n\n\u201cLagos-Abuja Road is terrible, help us tell the government, we\u2019re now finding it difficult to get trucks to Abuja. Since yesterday, I\u2019ve been unable to secure a truck despite the high price; they claim that roads to the North are spoiling their trucks\u201d, the concerned trader lamented.\n\nAnother trader, who simply identified herself asHajiya, lamented that she had been denied access to move her goods to Abuja due to the deplorable condition several times, alleging that some truck drivers used the situation to increase their fare unjustly.\n\nShe, however, called on the government to intervene on the route to save her means of livelihood.\n\nBlueprint had earlier reported that some sections of the Nigerian roads were not in good condition. One of our correspondents who recently embarked on a tour of Lagos state from Abuja, observed the poor state of that axis of the roads.\n\nIt was gathered that some sections of Okene/Kabba roads are not in good condition, while Akure-Owo expressway, Akure-Ado Ekiti and Ilesha-Ibadan axis of the road were also in deplorable conditions.\n\nNLC unhappy\n\nAlso, the Ogun state chapter of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has expressed its disappointment at Minister Fashola over what they called unfulfilled promises on the collapsed portion of Sango road.\n\nSpeaking at a protest held Wednesday, the state chairman of the labour union, Comrade Emmanuel Bankole described the minister an enemy of the state, saying \u201cwe don\u2019t want to see him, he lied to us, he fooled us.\u201d\n\nThe NLC had October 6 stormed the Sango portion of the Lagos-Abeokuta highway, with a threat to shut down the state if nothing was done within 21 days.\n\nAt the expiration of the 21- day ultimatum, Ogun workers and residents gathered at Sango again for a protest, carrying placards with various inscriptions such as , \u201cEnough of bad governance\u201d, \u201cDapo Abiodun, let us enjoy the dividends of democracy in Ogun\u201d, \u201cDapo, this suffering is too much\u201d, \u201cHear our cries, Ogun people are suffering\u201d, \u201cDapo repair our roads, it is our right,\u201d amongst others.\n\nThe NLC chairman said: \u201c21 days ago, we were here. We gave ultimatum to the government that we are not pleased with the state of the roads, particularly the minister coming here to promise that palliative works will commence immediately and several weeks after, nothing was done. That was why the 21- day ultimatum was given.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, few days ago, they started some works. We can see some loads of granites by the state government. But this is not what we asked for. The minister was here and he promised to commence immediate palliative, that is yet to happen.\u201d\n\nImo residents lament\n\nIn a related development, the current state of roads in Imo state has become a serious concern to Imo residents, especially now that it rains heavily almost on a daily basis.\n\nSome residents who spoke to Blueprint said there is hardly any road in the state that i motorable, thus putting their vehicles in a state of disrepair.\n\nOne of our respondents, Oparaji from Umuguma in Owerri West local government area, said their youth had to protest over the deplorable state of the World Bank/Umuguma Road Wednesday.\n\nThis, he said, was because whenever it rained, the road would turn into a river and would become impassable, thereby putting residents or pedestrians in a state of jeopardy.\n\nAnother resident living at World Bank Housing Estate, Obichere, was dismayed that the World Bank Road reconstructed by Senator Hope Uzodimma some months ago and which the commissioner of works, Mr Ralph Nwosu, described as solid like the Port Harcourt Road, had started wearing off.\n\n\u201d We are now confused because we do not know whether the former governor, Rochas Okorocha is better than Uzodimma in terms of road construction.

          "text": "The Appeal Court in Port Harcourt, Rivers State will on Friday decide whether or not the Peoples Democratic Party will go ahead with the conduct of its National Convention this weekend.\n\nA panel of three justices, headed by the Justice Haruna Simon Tsammani, reserved the ruling on Thursday after hearing arguments in the application filed by the former Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Uche Secondus to suspend the conduct of the convention.\n\nThe convention, slated for October 30 and 31 in Abuja, had been fixed by the PDP\u2019s National Working Committee as part of efforts to resolve the party\u2019s internal crisis.\n\nThe convention is expected to lead to the election of new national officers.\n\nREAD ALSO: PDP Governors Hold Closed-Door Meeting With Mimiko In Ondo\n\nBut this decision did not go down well with Secondus, hence the filing of the application.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s proceedings, Tayo Oyetibo (SAN), counsel to Secondus, argued that refusing to grant his application to stop the PDP Convention can be likened to \u201cpulling off the rug under the feet of the appellant\u201d.\n\nHe said his client will be permanently denied the right to preside over or participate in the convention if the pending applications bordering on his leadership and membership status go in his favour.\n\nBut the submission was opposed by Henry Bello, counsel to the first to fifth respondents, who are the Chairmen of the Peoples Democratic Party in five Local Government Areas of Rivers State.\n\nThe Chairmen are challenging Secondus\u2019s legal right to resume as National Chairman of the PDP following his suspension from the party in his ward in Ikuru Town in Andoni Local Government Area of Rivers State.\n\nMr. Bello reading an except of his 24-paragraph affidavit sworn to by the First respondent (one of the LGA party Chairmen), argued that the application to stop the PDP convention by Uche Secondus, was alien to the existing appeals before the court bordering on the leadership and membership of Uche Secondus in the party.\n\nThe opposition by Henry Bello was supported by the lawyer to the PDP, Sunday Ameh (SAN).\n\nHe submitted that Secondus voluntarily handed over the authorities of his office to a subordinate who has been acting lawfully as the National Chairman and is bestowed with the right to preside over the National Convention.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe balance of convenience in the matter is in not granting the application\u201d to stop the convention.\n\nAlso, Donald Dee-Nwigwe (SAN), representing the ninth and 10th respondents, picked holes in the argument by Tayo Oyetibo (SAN) that the conduct of the National Convention by the PDP will be a denial of Uche Secondus right to preside over the convention.\n\nHe submitted that, \u201ca Chairmanship position of the PDP is at best a political privilege, not a right\u201d and that the September judgment of a High Court in Rivers State which validated the suspension of Uche Secondus from the party has nullified any such privilege which Uche Secondus seeks to protect through his application.\n\nOther counsels, including Godwin Obla (SAN), Sebastine Horns, who represented other respondents like the National Vice Chairman, South-South of the PDP, Dan Obih, also opposed the application to stop the PDP convention.\n\nTo further defend his application, counsel to Secondus, Tayo Oyetibo argued that the use of the word \u201cShall\u201d in the PDP constitution bestowed on Secondus the right, not privilege to preside over party conventions.\n\nHe also submitted that the application before the court is not to \u201cprohibit the convention of the party, but to suspend the convention pending the determination of the rights of the parties\u201d.",

          "text": "Facebook Inc (FB.O) is now called Meta, the company said on Thursday, in a rebrand that focuses on its ambitions building the \u201cmetaverse,\u201d a shared virtual environment that it bets will be the next big computing platform.\n\nThe rebrand comes as the world\u2019s largest social media company battles criticisms from lawmakers and regulators over its market power, algorithmic decisions and the policing of abuses on its platforms.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg, speaking at the company\u2019s live-streamed virtual and augmented reality conference, said the new name reflected its ambitions to build the metaverse, rather than its namesake social media service.\n\nThe metaverse, a term first coined in a dystopian novel three decades ago and now attracting buzz in Silicon Valley, refers broadly to the idea of a shared virtual environment which can be accessed by people using different devices.\n\n\u201cRight now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can\u2019t possibly represent everything that we\u2019re doing today, let alone in the future,\u201d said Zuckerberg.\n\nThe company, which has invested heavily in augmented and virtual reality, said the change would bring together its different apps and technologies under one new brand.

          "text": "France seized a British trawler fishing in its territorial waters without a licence on Thursday and issued a warning to a second vessel in a dispute over access to fishing grounds after Brexit.\n\nFurious that Britain has refused to grant its fishermen the full number of licences to operate inside British waters that France says is warranted, Paris announced retaliatory measures on Wednesday if there was no progress in talks.\n\nThe French government said it would from Nov. 2 impose extra customs checks on British goods entering France, raising the prospect of more economic pain before Christmas for Britain, which faces labour shortages and rising energy prices.\n\nIt is also reviewing a second round of sanctions and does not exclude a review of its exports of electricity to Britain, which left the European Union on Jan. 31, 2020.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not war, but it is a fight,\u201d France\u2019s Seas Minister Annick Girardin told RTL radio.\n\nEuropean Affairs Minister Clement Beaune signalled France would be forceful in the dispute.\n\n\u201cSo now, we need to speak the language of strength since that seems to be the only thing this British government understands,\u201d Beaune told news channel CNews.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the detained trawler.\n\nBritain has said France\u2019s planned acts of retaliation will be met with an appropriate and calibrated response.\n\n\u201cFrance\u2019s threats are disappointing and disproportionate and not what we would expect from a close ally and partner,\u201d a British government spokesperson said.\n\nBarrie Deas, head of Britain\u2019s National Federation of Fishermen\u2019s Organisations, said Britain was issuing licences in line with the terms of the post-Brexit trade agreement and that France appeared determined to escalate the licence row.\n\n\u201cI suppose we have to wonder why. There is a presidential election coming up in France and I think all the signs are that the rhetoric has been ramped up ahead of that on the fishing issue,\u201d Deas told the BBC.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has not yet confirmed he will seek a second term in April\u2019s election but is widely expected to run.\n\nMARITIME GENDARMES\n\nFrench maritime gendarmes made multiple checks on fishing vessels off the northern French port of Le Havre overnight, the Maritime Ministry said, as France steps up surveillance during negotiations.\n\nThe seized trawler, now under the control of French judicial authorities, had been rerouted to Le Havre under a maritime police escort and was tied up at on the port\u2019s quayside.\n\nThe vessel\u2019s captain could face criminal charges, with his catch confiscated, the ministry added.\n\nThe Marine Traffic app showed a British fishing vessel named Cornelis Gert Jan tied up in the port of Le Havre. The French maritime patrol vessel Atos was moored behind it.\n\nReuters could not immediately confirm the name of the detained vessel.\n\nMarine Traffic data showed that the Cornelis Gert Jan had been operating in the Baie de Seine on Wednesday evening, where the Atos had been conducting checks. Both vessels set course for Le Havre at around 2000 CET (1800 GMT).\n\nBritain has said it issued fishing licenses to vessels able to show a track record of operating in its waters in the years prior to its withdrawal from the EU.\n\nNegotiations between Britain and the European Commission, the EU executive, have continued this week.\n\nFrench officials accuse Britain of failing to honour its word since Brexit, citing fishing and a demand to renegotiate a protocol that aims to maintain the integrity of the EU single market.\n\nAdditional customs checks on goods travelling between Britain and the continent via the Channel Tunnel and ferries could seriously disrupt trade flows just as businesses stock up for the year-end festive period.",

          "text": "The top U.S. military officer, General Mark Milley, has provided the first official U.S. confirmation of a Chinese hypersonic weapons test that military experts say appears to show Beijing\u2019s pursuit of an Earth-orbiting system designed to evade American missile defenses.\n\nThe Pentagon has been at pains to avoid direct confirmation of the Chinese test this summer, first reported by the Financial Times, even as President Joe Biden and other officials have expressed general concerns about Chinese hypersonic weapons development.\n\nBut Milley explicitly confirmed a test and said that it was \u201cvery close\u201d to a Sputnik moment \u2014 referring Russia\u2019s 1957 launch of the first man-made satellite, which put Moscow ahead in the Cold War-era space race.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw was a very significant event of a test of a hypersonic weapon system. And it is very concerning,\u201d Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Bloomberg television, in an interview aired on Wednesday.\n\nNuclear arms experts say China\u2019s weapons test appeared to be designed to evade U.S. defenses in two ways. First, hypersonics move at speeds of more than five times the speed of sound, or about 6,200 kph (3,853 mph), making them harder to detect and intercept.\n\nSecond, sources tell Reuters that the United States believes China\u2019s test involved a weapon that first orbited the Earth. That\u2019s something military experts say is a Cold War concept known as \u201cfractional orbital bombardment.\u201d\n\nLast month, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall alluded to his concerns about such a system, telling reporters about a weapon that would go into an orbit and then descend on a target.\n\n\u201cIf you use that kind of an approach, you don\u2019t have to use a traditional ICBM trajectory \u2014 which is directly from the point of launch to the point of impact,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to avoid defenses and missile warning systems.\u201d\n\nFractional Orbital Bombardment would also be a way for China to avoid U.S. missile defenses in Alaska, which are designed to combat a limited number of weapons from a country like North Korea.\n\nJeffrey Lewis at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies summed up fractional orbital bombardment this way: \u201cThe simplest way to think about China\u2019s orbital bombardment system is to imagine a space shuttle, put a nuclear weapon into the cargo bay, and forget about the landing gear.\u201d\n\nLewis said the difference is that the Chinese re-entry system is a glider.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry denied a weapons test. It said it had carried out a routine test in July, but added: \u201cIt was not a missile, it was a space vehicle.\u201d\n\nU.S. defenses are not capable of combating a large-scale attack from China or Russia, which could overwhelm the system. But the open U.S. pursuit of more and more advanced missile defenses has led Moscow and Beijing to examine ways to defeat them, experts say, including hypersonics and, apparently, fractional orbital bombardment.\n\nThe United States and Russia have both tested hypersonic weapons.\n\nReuters",
