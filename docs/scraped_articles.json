          "text": "The Nigeria Labour Congress says it will strongly advocate against removing Labour from the Exclusive Legislative List.\n\nNLC President Ayuba Wabba said this in a statement entitled \u201cLabour on the Legislative Exclusive List\u201d, on Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nHe noted that labour issues were presently domiciled in the Second Schedule, Legislative Powers, Part 1, Exclusive list, Item 34.\n\nAccording to him, labour, including trade unions, industrial relations; conditions, safety and welfare of labour; industrial disputes; prescribing a national minimum wage for the federation or any part thereof; and industrial arbitration.\n\nHe said, \u201cFor the sake of our national interest, security and industrial harmony, labour should not be one of the items that should be devolved to the states,\u201d he said.\n\nWabba while explaining how it came to be on the Exclusive List, noted that the nation-states legislation on Labour is driven substantially from the International Labour Organisation conventions, protocols and recommendations and other instruments domesticated through the Acts of parliament.\n\nHe added that this explained the near uniformity of labour laws across the nations of the world and relative global industrial order, harmony and an attraction for foreign investment.\n\nHe said this was in realisation of the reality that 17 days after independence in 1960 under a democratic government Nigeria fell in line by rectifying and domesticated ILO Conventions 87 and 98, guarantying the right to organise and collectively bargain.\n\nWabba, however, said that Nigeria had since adopted all the core conventions in its capacity as a sovereign nation and regularly attends ILO organ meetings as a sovereign in line with international best practices.\n\nThe NLC president further said the reasons for Nigeria\u2019s relative industrial growth and development, and evolution into an investor\u2019s haven were partly attributed to its willingness to subject itself to this global order and corpus of international labour standards.\n\nHe noted that the ILO was created in 1919 by the Versailles Peace Treaty ending World War I along with the League of Nations to address widespread demands for social justice and improved living standards for the world\u2019s working people.\n\nHe said that this had survived World War II and today served as a specialised agency of the UN dedicated to promoting labour standards globally.\n\n\u201cIn the light of this, deregulating labour to the states will inevitably create intractable problems. At the membership level, the 36 states of the federation and the FCT are not sovereign which is a basis for ILO membership of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSecondly, a corpus of labour legislation across the 36 states and FCT will almost certainly create a judicial nightmare.\n\n\u201cThirdly, investors will be scared away as they will consider this as an unnecessary addition to the already hostile operating environment. At the level of workers who often act in the national interest, this will whittle down patriotic influence.\n\n\u201dIn the light of this, we will strongly advocate against removing labour from the Exclusive Legislative List. Not even during the military era was this contemplated,\u201d he said.\n\n(NAN)",

The other federal projects are the Nembe-Brass and Sagbama-Ekeremor roads.\n\nIt is designed to link over 100 agrarian and fishing settlements in the predominantly riverine council area, which is one of the biggest local government areas in the federation and projected to unlock the untapped potentials of the area and boost the local economy of the people.\n\nDream come true\u2014 Madam Rose\n\nAn aged woman simply identified as Madam Rose, expressed gratitude to Governor Diri for his commitment to the road project, saying: \u201cThis is a dream come true for us here, you can imagine the joy in the atmosphere when those cars drove into our community for the first time. Some of us have not seen a car until last week.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of our people are farmers and it will be easy to convey their farm produce to the big cities and make more profit as against the practice whereby some middlemen comes around to buy them cheap.\n\n\u201cMy prayer is that all the communities in Southern Ijaw local government area will be linked by road and save us the anguish of transporting our loved ones with emergency cases to hospitals in Yenagoa, the state capital on the turbulent waters,\u201d she said.\u201c\n\nWe\u2018ve waited for years for this moment \u2014Amos, resident\n\nAnother resident, Clinton Amos, said now that vehicles can access the community, they were more than confident that the road would be completed, especially with anticipated flagging off of the bridge to connect Oporoma, the council headquarters by Vice-President Osinbajo next week, as part of activities to commemorate the second anniversary of the Diri-led administration.\n\n\u201cFor years, we have waited for the day we can drive to our community. We thank God for our governor, who has made this possible for us. We are a predominantly fishing and farming settlement and for long, we have relied on middle men from the city, who come here to buy our harvest at cheap price because of their perishable nature.\n\n\u201cMost of our people cannot afford the high cost of river transportation. My own parents never saw a car in their lifetime because they never had the opportunity to travel to the city,\u201d he added, beaming with smile.\n\nDiri impressed\n\nGovernor Diri, who commended his Works Commissioner for his efforts, asserted: \u201cWhat I have seen is quite commendable. You know I have a very capable hand in the Ministry of Works and very competent monitors. I have been receiving reports. I came myself to confirm the reports that I have received so far. What we have seen is very commendable and we are sure that the targets will be met.\u201d",

          "text": "The number of Lagos indigenes that have been invited for the second stage of the ongoing Nigerian Police Force (NPF) constable cadre recruitment exercise has surpassed 500, The Nation has learnt.\n\nThis followed a sensitisation drive by the State Government in partnership with the Commissioner representing Lagos State at the Federal Character Commission (FCC) Abdulwasiu Kayode Bawa-Allah.\n\nBut only 362 of the invitees had turned up for the screening at the Police College in Ikeja so far.\n\nOut of this, 62 were said to have presented fake Lagos Certificates of Origin and were turned back.\n\nBawa-Allah; Police Service Commission Assistant Director, Ademola Adetunbi; and Lagos State Assistant Director, Ministry of Special Duties, Ismail Adekunle Allison made the disclosure at the screening venue.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe NPF and the Police Service Commission (PSC) are conducting the exercise nationwide and it is expected to add 10,000 personnel \u2013 10 from each Local Government Area (LGA) \u2013 to the Force.\n\nThe exercise, which began on February 1, ends on Tuesday with a mop-up session billed for Wednesday.\n\nAbout 127,491 applicants comprising 104,403 from the North and 23,088 from the South have applied to join the police.\n\nBut Lagos is one of the states with the least number of applicants.\n\nBawa-Allah explained that the FCC\u2019s role includes ensuring that \u201cthe process is equitable, just and has the spread all through the LGAs in Lagos State and that the participation among our youths is where it is supposed to be.\n\n\u201cThe state government and our office have done some groundwork because if you recall some days ago the PRO of the NPF did announce that the registration on their portal by the states in the south was not where it was supposed to be.\n\n\u201cBut good enough, we have over 500 applicants that have been invited for this screening exercise. So, that number has grown from the 200 or so that was first reported. Kudos to the Secretary to the State Government and to His Excellency, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu.\n\n\u201cOf course, I would have expected the number to be far more than that, but let\u2019s give credit for what has been done so far. Hopefully, subsequent ones will be better.\u201d\n\nHe encouraged more Lagos indigenes to seize the opportunity, noting that the police have \u201cmany disciplines and require many career scales,\u201d that accommodates a variety of disciplines.\n\n\u201cIt does not mean that if you come in with your school certificate, you\u2019ll be confined to that level, many have risen from. entering as a school cert holder to becoming an AIG, DIG and possibly IG, if you develop yourself,\u201d he added.\n\nAdetunbi, who coordinates the exercise for the PSC, said things had been smooth, but that \u201cthe number of applicants in Lagos is very small. We have less than 550 applicants when other states have over 7,000 applicants, some states even have up to 12,000 applicants\n\n\u201cLagos has just 536 or thereabouts, whereas, at the end of the exercise, we are expected to pick 10 (successful applicants) per local government. By the time they (the 536) will go for computer-based tests (CBT), some of them will still drop. I can\u2019t tell the number that will be eligible for the CBT for now, but based on what we have seen on ground, I\u2019m not sure we (Lagos) is going to meet up with the 10 per LGA.\n\n\u201cIn Lagos Island, for instance, only 25 people applied and when we attended to their applicants on Saturday, not all of them turned up. In some LGAs, only five people turned up. only Badagry LGA came up with over 160 applicants.\u201d\n\nAllison expressed hope that if all the invited Lagosians show up before the exercise ends, the state could achieve over 500 applicants.\n\nExplaining that his ministry was in charge of issuing Certificates of Origin to genuine Lagos indigenes, he added that 300 Lagos indigenes had been cleared during the screening while 62 were not yet cleared. \u201cThe 62 are not Lagos indigenes. Some of the 62 came with fake letters from Obas. They were mostly non-Yoruba,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja and Chinelo Obogo\n\nThere were strong indications, yesterday, that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo will announce his presidential ambition immediately after the All Progressives Congress (APC) national convention, slated for Saturday, February 26.\n\nThis is even as he has reportedly got the nod of his spiritual father and General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Enoch Adeboye, to vie for the position.\n\nThe vice president\u2019s quest was contained in an Instagram post by Omolubu2023, a support group for Osinbajo 2023, which declared him the face of hope.\n\nThe group claimed that sources close to Osinbajo\u2019s strategy team made the disclosure at the weekend.\n\nThe group quoted the sources as saying: \u201cIn spite of the ongoing campaigns against his currently rumoured bid for the presidency by some interests in the South West, where he hails from, Osinbajo had made up his mind to give the presidency a shot. Even more instructive, inside sources claimed, was the fact that Osinbajo had received the blessing and the charge to go ahead with his ambition from Pastor Adeboye.\n\n\u201cTake it to the bank, he will run and he is declaring soon after the APC convention. All is set, including premium consultations already done. The coast is clear and the journey is looking good. I believe Prof. is also motivated by the increasing level of support from across the country, especially, the youths of this country.\n\n\u201cFrom the North to the South, tell me where he has visited recently and the charge has not been that he should contest? He has capacity, competence and knows what the issues are. Importantly, he can also sell them \u2013 I mean the issues. So, why will he not run? Why should the bitterness and envy of some minions stifle him?\u201d\n\nThe group stressed that Osinbajo is unfazed by the growing allegation of betrayal and the push for him to stand down his ambition for his former principal and supposed benefactor, Bola Tinubu, who had since declared his intention to run. He was said to have described the attacks against him as the real motivation to take his chances.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cIn fact, none of such bothers him. But he has done one thing though, he has called his supporters and pleaded with them never to talk down on Tinubu or engage in a mud fight with his support groups, even in the face of obvious provocation.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, APC has said despite speculations, the party has not yet sat down to discuss the issue of zoning its presidential ticket.\n\nSpeaking on a television programme monitored in Lagos, yesterday, Director of Organisation at the national headquarters of the party, Ussiju Medaner, said the fact that all aspirants for the national chairmanship are from the North does not automatically mean the presidential ticket would go to the South or North.\n\nThere have been speculations that the ruling party would zone its presidential ticket to the South, which is why, till date, no southern aspirant has indicated interest in contesting for the national chairmanship of the party, and most of those who have indicated interest in contesting for the presidency on the platform of the party are all from the South, except Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State.\n\nMedaner, however, said it would be faulty to assume that based on where those showing interest in the chairmanship of the party come, the party has zoned the presidential ticket.\n\n\u201cIf you look at our pre-convention activities, you will see that the sub-committees will be announced on February 19, by this, you can see that there is no zoning committee and they have not sat to discuss anything. People have aspirations and, maybe, people from the South are gearing up too because people need to make consultations.\n\n\u201cIf people come out early to indicate interest in the chairmanship, it doesn\u2019t mean it is for this side or for that side. We must have a party before anyone aspires for any position; and right now, we are more focused on building the party. Once we have a party which actually belongs to all Nigerians, they will exercise their franchise because everybody is allowed within the ambits of the law,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the issue of factions in many state chapters of the party, he claimed that most of the states have resolved their issues and that the party is working hard to ensure the February 26 national convention takes place.",

In 2015, we were in a deep hole. In 2023, we will be in an even much deeper hole than in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe challenges facing all those people who are struggling to be president, I hope they understand that the problems that they are going to face are multiples of the problems that were faced in 2015, and all of us have to be ready for difficult decisions; and if they are taken, we are all going to pay for it.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cBut the solution is not for all of us to jump into politics; this country needs good politicians. It needs Imams and Pastors and Bishops who are going to stand up and remind them (politicians) of the fear of God.

The president returned to the country yesterday.\n\nAmong those being considered for the post of national chairman, a source further hinted, included former Minister of State for Mines and Steel, Bawa Bwari from Niger State, Saliu Mustapha from Kwara State, and Senator Tanko Al-Makura from Nasarawa State.\n\nThese three prospective candidates were allegedly mentioned repeatedly by many of the major stakeholders of the party as suitable to lead the APC to a successful election in 2023.\n\nFollowing media reports that APC was considering fielding former President Goodluck Jonathan as its presidential candidate in 2023, the ruling party said defectors to the party, including Jonathan, would be given waiver to contest.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the APC stakeholders were informed that in their search for a consensus candidate for national chairman, \u201cThey should put into considerations factors, like energy, credibility, experience, and ability to drive and sustain the winning streak of the party in the next general election.\u201d\n\nAccording to a northern governor, who pleaded anonymity, \u201cThe president had informed us that the only way he would be part of the much talked about idea of a consensus national chairman is for the stakeholders to ensure that whosoever that will emerge meets certain irreducible leadership criteria, chief of which are character and credibility factors.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the ruling party was considering adopting the consensus option to avoid the crisis that could follow the election of a national chairman, bearing in mind that the national convention was around the corner.\n\nThe source explained that though \u201cthe office of the national chairman has not been officially zoned to any of the geopolitical zones in the north, in principle, the party may yield to the agitations of the stakeholders of the party from the North-central zone.\u201d\n\nThe source explained further that at several meetings of the APC governors with the party\u2019s National Assembly members as well as members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), the three aspirants from the North-central had been consistently mentioned.\n\nBwari was Minister of State for Mines and Steel from 2015 to 2019. He was also Chief Whip in the House of Representatives from 1999 to 2007.\n\nMustapha was Deputy National Chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive change (CPC), Buhari\u2019s legacy party before the merger that birthed APC. He was also Organising Secretary of the Conference of Nigerian Political Parties (CNPP) at some point.\n\nAl-Makura, a serving senator, was governor of Nasarawa State.\n\nWhile Mustapha and Al-Makura had long declared their intentions and embarked on rigorous campaigns across the country, Bwari was yet to officially declare his intention at the time of filing this report.\n\nMustapha and Al-Makura also appear to enjoy the full and open backing of their governors, Mallam AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq and Abdulahi Sule, respectively.\n\nTHISDAY was told that the stakeholders might have drafted the three names for possible security screening to avoid selecting anyone with the baggage of controversies as national chairman.\n\nBarring any further delays, the outcome of the security profiling of the three might form the basis of the choice that would be sent to the president early next week.\n\nAccording to the source, the security profiling was discretely undertaken to avoid any embarrassment to the ruling party.\n\nThough it was gathered that two former governors \u2013 Abduallahi Yari of Zamfara and Modu Sheriff of Borno State \u2013 were still protesting adoption of a consensus option, the source said their protest might not hold water since the president had bought into the idea.\n\nIn the same vein, two aspirants for national secretary from Anambra State, Ambassador Jerry Sunny Ugokwe and Nze Chidi Duru, may emerge. The implication is that the office of National Secretary may have been zoned to the South-east.\n\nMeanwhile, following media reports and on-going permutations that APC was considering fielding Jonathan as its presidential candidate in 2023, the ruling party reiterated that defectors to the party would be given waiver to contest.\n\nJonathan had of late been paying visits to Buhari in Aso Rock, and holding private discussions.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY yesterday by telephone, National Secretary of APC\u2019s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator James Akpanudoedehe, reiterated that anyone that defected to the party, by virtue of the December Resolution, would be given a waiver to contest, including the former president. Though Akpanudoedehe said he was not aware if the former president was planning to come to the party.\n\nAkpanudoedehe said, \u201cGo back to my former reaction. I cannot bring out that topic again on the front burner. I cannot bring up that matter, because I actually answered that question about Goodluck Jonathan and I told Nigerians that anybody that comes into the party by the resolution of December has the right to contest.\n\n\u201cI am not aware that the caretaker committee has endorsed him; I am not aware that the caretaker has endorsed anybody. I\u2019m not aware that he (Jonathan) has been wooed to join the party. I am not privy to that.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Petroleum marketers confirm presence of adulterated fuel in circulation\n\n\u2022 Motorists in FCT spend hours in queues, traffic grounded\n\n\u2022 Group wants alleged petrol hoarders arrested, prosecuted\n\nEmmanuel Addeh and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nFollowing the supply of a wrong specification of petrol in some parts of the country, and its subsequent removal in compliance with a government order, long queues have once more returned to petrol stations in Abuja, parts of Lagos, and some other states.\n\nIndications emerged yesterday that the current challenge being faced in the supply of petrol in some states was as a result of the directive to withdraw adulterated products from circulation.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the shortage of supply from the sole importer, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), had worsened the situation.\n\nIn Abuja and surrounding states, majority of filling stations were shut and motorists spent hours in the sun struggling to buy from the few that were open, and causing serious traffic jams in parts of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nThe Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) blamed the shortage of supply on issues surrounding the presence of bad fuel in the market as well as undersupply from the national oil company.\n\nThe particular cargo with the product was said to have high sulphur, while marketers were advised not to sell to consumers, with at least 100 million litres already in circulation at the time the bad fuel was discovered.\n\nIn addition, it was learnt that the queues returned partly because the gap, which existed when depot owners started hoarding products before the announcement of retention of subsidy by the federal government, had not smoothened. This has affected the lifting of the products to, especially Abuja and other parts of the north from Lagos, THISDAY gathered.\n\nThe federal government had backtracked on its plan to remove fuel subsidy in mid-2022, citing the need to protect the poor and vulnerable.\n\nMany of the fuel stations visited, including Eterna and Enyo on Olusegun Obasanjo Way in Wuse as well as Total on Herbert Macaulay, did not have product and more than half of the fuel pumps at the NNPC mega station in the area were not operational.\n\nSouth-West Zonal Chairman of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Mr. Dele Tajudeen, who confirmed the existence of contaminated fuel in circulation while speaking on a national television yesterday, absolved the organisation of any blame. Tajudeen explained that that IPMAN members had suffered severe losses and may ask for damages from the authorities.\n\nAccording to him, members of his group were supplied with bad products, which had put them in serious trouble, as they had to repair vehicles for their customers whose cars were impacted by the bad product.\n\nStressing that fuel station owners are now rejecting the bad product, he explained that the group was working to resolve the issue amicably with NNPC\u2019s subsidiary, the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC).\n\n\u201cWe need to be compensated, but we don\u2019t want to put the masses in another crisis if we resort to going on strike, demanding compensation because we know people are already in a deep economic problem,\u201d he said.\n\nThe IPMAN official assured that the issue of bad fuel in circulation was already being investigated, stating that Managing Director of PPMC, Mr Isiaku Abdullahi, was intervening in the matter.\n\n\u201cUntil the investigation is concluded, I don\u2019t want to comment more, so as not to pre-empt it, but Mr Abdullahi is making efforts to ensure that all the depots are revived. He is doing a holistic rehabilitation of the depots,\u201d he said.\n\nTajudeen added, \u201cThis (fuel scarcity) is as a result of short supply from the NNPC and, of course, the private depots around Lagos. One of the major reasons for the scarcity is that the five NNPC depots in southwest as at today are not loading products.\n\n\u201cAlso, we witnessed the issue of bad product and I must use this opportunity to tell the masses that it is not from our members. As a matter of fact we suffered serious loss of cash and integrity because we received the product from the private depots.\n\n\u201cAs I am telling you, we have run into millions of naira in losses as a result of this bad product. So, the station owners are not responsible for these product.\u201d\n\nTajudeen commended Abdullahi for his efforts at ameliorating the situation, describing him as proactive. He said most of their customers had been complaining, prompting them to carry out repairs, replacement of the bad fuels and bearing the reputational damage caused by the situation.\n\nHe pointed out, \u201cThe situation is not too good because of non-availability of this product, coupled with this bad product that came in the last two weeks. The products are being rejected now. So, because of that, there\u2019s shortage of product.\u201d\n\nOn the rising cost of diesel, Tajudeen stated that while the product had gone to N401 without the logistics costs, petrol has gone to N156 without transport costs, saying it will then hit N162 to N163 before it gets do the stations. \u201cOur profit margin has been eroded completely,\u201d he lamented.\n\nBut he argued that government could not leave pricing in private hands because it will \u201cstrangulate the masses\u201d, adding that the international crude oil prices does not necessarily tally with the rise in prices in the country.\n\nA top NNPC official who spoke with THISDAY on the matter, stated that whatever the situation, it was the responsibility of the new downstream/midstream authority to speak on the matter.\n\nThe source said, \u201cThey (the queues) will disappear. It\u2019s just a small supply gap. People are bound to make all sorts of speculations, but if the speculation continues, the downstream/midstream authority will come up with a statement to clarify whatever is happening.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a civil advocacy group yesterday called on the federal government to take a decisive action against those alleged to be hoarding petrol in the country, and subjection unbearable hardship on the masses.\n\nThe group, in a letter to the Minister of State for Petroleum and Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), specifically accused members of independent marketers of petroleum products of hoarding fuel, which according to them, was responsible for the long queues at fuel stations across the country, particularly the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and its environs.\n\nThe letter dated February 7, 2022, and signed by the group\u2019s Convener, Mr. Deji Adeyanju, was titled, \u201cPersistent Hoarding of Fuel By Independent Marketers: A Call for Urgent Action.\u201d\n\nIt said, \u201cAs you may already know, in recent months independent marketers of petroleum products have engaged in speculative acts of hoarding petroleum products, particularly PMS, in a bid to criminally increase the prices, cause artificial scarcity and plunge the country into widespread economic chaos.\n\n\u201cFor example, filing stations across the nation\u2019s capital are littered with long queues of vehicles seeking to purchase fuel, while the independent marketers ensured that their filing stations were shut for the day by 6pm.\u201d\n\nThe group, however, lamented that the regulators had not deemed it necessary to call these independent marketers to order, as they had continued to allow them take advantage of Nigerians.\n\nThe convener expressed pain that the development was causing excruciating pain on the people, adding that an artificial fuel scarcity is the last thing they should worry about.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt is equally important to point out that causing artificial scarcity resulting in economic sabotage is a criminal offence under our laws.\n\n\u201cThe federal government must, therefore, put a halt to the ball watching and take urgent steps to address the economic sabotage, especially as there is no reason for artificial scarcity at this time.\n\n\u201cSequel to the foregoing, we call on the federal government to arrest the offending marketers, shut their filling stations and bring this on-going economic sabotage to an end. Nigerians deserves to buy fuel at an accessible rate anytime.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Bill prescribes sanctions for erring parties\n\n*Advises aggrieved potential aspirants to approach federal high court for relief\n\n*Says judicial pronouncement can\u2019t stop primary or general election\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nShould President Muhammadu Buhari sign the new Electoral Act amendment bill recently forwarded to him by the National Assembly into law, all political appointees in his government would no longer be eligible, either as voting delegates or aspirants during the conventions or congresses of their political parties.\n\nThe implication is that some key ministers in Buhari\u2019s cabinet, said to be nursing presidential ambitions would be barred from seeking the nominations of their parties.\n\nWhat this therefore, means is that ministers, commissioners and other political appointees are expected to resign ahead of their parties\u2019 primaries in order to be eligible to contest in the primaries.\n\nTop on the list of the aspiring appointees to be affected by this new amendment are the Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Amaechi; Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola; and Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola. They are believed to have presidential ambitions, even though they have yet to declare their interests.\n\nBut by the provision at issue, political appointees are also barred from voting as delegates in a convention or seeking nomination in the primaries of their political parties.\n\nUnlike what was obtainable in the past when most APC ministers and commissioners took leave of absence to contest their party\u2019s primaries and later went back to their jobs after they lost, that grace is no longer available.\n\nHowever, with the new amendment, if signed by the President, they would henceforth be required to vacate office completely before being eligible to contest.\n\nThe bill also advises aggrieved aspirants to seek redress at the Federal High Court if they suspect the political parties did not comply with the relevant provisions in the selection of candidates.\n\nAccording to Clause 84 of the recommitted bill, \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\n\n\u201cWhere a political party fails to comply with the provisions of this Act in the conduct of its primaries, its candidate for election shall not be included in the election for the particular position in issue.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of this Act or rules of a political party, an aspirant, who complains that any of the provisions of this Act and guidelines of a political party have not been complied with in the selection or nomination of a candidate of a political party for election, may apply to the Federal High Court for redress.\n\n\u201cNothing in this section shall empower the courts to stop the holding of primaries or general election under this Act, pending the determination of a suit.\u201d\n\nBut there appears to be a lacuna in the new law, which may encourage infringements on the inalienable rights of citizens to vie for elective offices.\n\nThe Supreme Court had pronounced at different times that any law inconsistent with the provisions of the constitution is ultra vires and, to that extent, null and void.\n\nSources believe the clause is meant to clip the wings of the governors, who, through appointments, often control those who become automatic delegates and determine the outcome of congresses.\n\nSources further claimed that the idea was originally from the House of Representatives, pushed by a principal officer from Lagos as an agenda to serve some interests. The senate was said to have concurred, just to keep the \u201cone house\u201d refrain of the National Assembly.\n\nBut the fear being expressed by many is that, with a clause that clearly breaches the provision of the constitution, the president might be forced to veto the electoral act amendment bill again. If this happens, a new electoral law may not be ready for the 2023 elections.\n\nThe National Assembly had recently transmitted the new Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill to Buhari for assent, through the Clerk of the National Assembly, Olatunde Ojo. Before the latest transmission, Buhari had in December 2021, vetoed the former amendment bill, leading to a recommittal by the National Assembly.\n\nThere have been misgivings about the new amendment, fuelling speculations on whether or not the president would sign it into law. The latest speculation was stoked by rumours that some governors, especially, those of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), were not comfortable with the new amendment and had planned to prevail on the president to also veto it, as he did in the last one.\n\nThe harmonised version of the Electoral Bill recently passed by the legislature was considered the final agreed version by both Senate and House of Representatives on the amendment to Clause 84 of the bill.\n\nIn this clause, the direct, indirect and consensus modes of primary election by political parties were included. This was after the controversy that trailed the different versions initially approved by the two chambers.\n\nThe senate had in its re-amended bill approved direct, indirect, and consensus primaries for the nomination of candidates by political parties, while the House only provided direct and indirect modes, saying the president did not speak about the consensus option, when he vetoed the previous bill.\n\nBut President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, while presiding at plenary, stated that both chambers had agreed to give a clear and sufficient definition for each mode of primary, and how they would be conducted.\n\nLawan explained that for the consensus method, the two chambers produced a clear-cut definition on how a consensus candidate would emerge.\n\nBuhari had declined assent to the first amendment bill over the provision of direct primary as the only mode of choosing candidates by political parties.\n\nThe bill earlier passed by the National Assembly on November 18, 2021, provided: \u201cA political party seeking to nominate candidates for elections under this bill shall hold direct primaries for aspirants to all elective positions, which shall be monitored by the commission.\u201d\n\nBut Buhari, in declining assent, disclosed that he would only give assent to the bill if the lawmakers provided options for the conduct of primaries by political parties.\n\nThe president also cited several disadvantages of the provision to the system, including security and possible manipulation by incumbent officeholders, who might be seeking re-election, as well as political parties\u2019 inability to muster funds for it.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Fitch: Nigeria\u2019s Oil Sector Weak Performance May Slowdown Economic Growth",
          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nFitch Solutions, an affiliate of global rating agency, Fitch, has predicted that Nigeria\u2019s weak performance in the oil and gas sector may continue to slow down the country\u2019s economy in the coming years. In its latest report on the state of the Nigerian economy, the rating agency stated that from its analysis, the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) might not markedly impact the country in the near term.\n\nForecasting an average annual decline of 0.5 per cent in the next four years, the group added that given the rapid pace of population growth in Nigeria, it expected that average incomes would continue to stagnate in the country.\n\nFitch stated, \u201cWhile the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), which was finally signed in 2021, will create a more stable operating environment, we doubt that it will have a significant effect on investment this year. It will take time for foreign firms to launch any new projects.\n\n\u201cIndeed, despite the new bill, our oil and gas team expects that oil production will gradually fall over the coming years. We predict an average annual decline of 0.5 per cent between 2023 and 2026. All told, fixed investment spending will contribute just 0.6 per cent to headline growth in 2022.\u201d\n\nThe report projected that the poor performance of the oil sector, which is Nigeria\u2019s key foreign exchange earner, would keep headline growth weak over the coming years.\n\nThe rating agency said, \u201cWe expect that real GDP growth will average just 2.9 per cent between 2023 and 2026. Headline growth will be even weaker in per capita terms. Given the rapid pace of population growth in Nigeria, we expect that average incomes will continue to stagnate.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite the slowdowns, Fitch predicted that economic growth in Nigeria would pick up slightly from an estimated 3.1 per cent in 2021, to 3.5 per cent in 2022, primarily driven by increased oil production, which will boost export growth. But the firm stated that it expected that growth would slow to 2.9 per cent in 2023, and over the medium term, that the combination of poor economic performance and rapid population growth per capita income would essentially stagnate.\n\nIt said, \u201cWe at Fitch Solutions expect Nigeria\u2019s economy will expand by 3.5 per cent in 2022. This would be the eighth consecutive year in which Nigeria has underperformed the aggregate growth figure for Emerging Markets (EM). We expect growth of 4.8 per cent across EMs as a whole.\n\n\u201cEven so, 3.5 per cent growth would represent an acceleration compared to the 3.1 per cent growth for 2021, and be Nigeria\u2019s best performance since 2014.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, Fitch solutions predicted that the volume of Nigeria\u2019s oil production would rise by 4.1 per cent in 2022, which would be a significant improvement compared to 2021, when it estimated that output fell by 8.1 per cent as a result of low investment and OPEC+ cuts.\n\nThe report said, \u201cBut with the OPEC+ agreement now ending, we think that output will rise, though it will remain below the recent peak recorded in 2020.\n\n\u201cSince oil makes up almost 90 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s exports, increased production will boost the country\u2019s export earnings. Indeed, given rising agricultural exports, we expect that exports will rise by 11.6 per cent in real terms in 2022.\n\n\u201cWhereas net exports subtracted 1.0 percentage points (pps) from headline growth in 2021, we think that the component will add 1.8pps to headline growth in 2022.\u201d\n\nAccording to the agency, the slow but rising oil production would also fuel strong private consumption growth, spurring private consumption spending to rise by 3.5 per cent in 2022, in line with the outturn in 2021.\n\nThe report explained, \u201cThis will contribute 2.2pps to headline growth. Continued FX shortages and slow productivity growth in the agricultural sector \u2013 which employs almost 35.0 per cent of the workforce \u2013 will prevent a sharper acceleration. Indeed, over the past seven years, private consumption growth has averaged just 0.7 per cent.\n\n\u201cWe expect that government consumption will rise by 3.0 per cent in 2022. The government passed an ambitious budget in late 2021, but recent experience suggests that implementation will be very weak.\n\n\u201cWe are, therefore, sceptical about plans to significantly increase public infrastructure spending.\n\nIndeed, some projects were probably included in the budget for political reasons before the 2023 election, and we expect that very little real progress will be made. Given the small scale of Nigeria\u2019s federal government, public spending will contribute just 0.4pp to headline growth.\u201d\n\nIt emphasised that the government\u2019s failure to raise living standards would probably result in increased social tensions over the coming years, projecting that the febrile political environment can result in violence surrounding presidential elections scheduled for 2023.\n\n\u201cOur current forecasts assume that the vote passes peacefully, but a series of violent clashes \u2013 as happened in 2011 \u2013 could pose a headwind to real GDP growth,\u201d it projected.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Women and e-commerce: Capturing the $14bn opportunity in Africa",
          "text": "In Africa, the COVID-19 pandemic has, to a great extent, brought to the fore the potential of the digital economy. One sector where this is most vivid is e-commerce. Stay-at-home orders boosted online shopping activity during lockdowns and companies, large and small, are now leveraging online channels to drive business growth amid the crisis.\n\nBut much of the gains in e-commerce has so far been realised by male-owned businesses, which saw a collective 7% rise in sales during the pandemic. By contrast, female-owned businesses saw a 7% decline, per Women and E-commerce in Africa, a report by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) that examines the state of e-commerce across Kenya, Nigeria, and Ivory Coast.\n\nMore often than not, technological advances exacerbate existing gender inequalities. In this instance, women lag behind their male counterparts in terms of accessing and using digital marketplaces, despite representing half of Africa\u2019s population and accounting for the bulk of entrepreneurial activity in many African countries.\n\n\u201cThere is a digital disconnect,\u201d says Mercy Wanjau, Director, Legal and Board Advisory, at the Communications Authority of Kenya (KCA) while delivering her keynote speech during the first TechCabal Live session this year. \u201cIt\u2019s provocative and sad. So much progress has been made in connectivity globally, even in Africa, but there\u2019s still a disconnect when you look at the situation from a gender lens.\u201d\n\nWanjau adds that the internet is a \u201cgateway to huge economic opportunities\u201d and with women having no access, there\u2019s a digital disconnect and denial of opportunities, particularly in the low and middle-income countries.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOver the past decade, e-commerce in Africa has expanded rapidly and the market value is expected to quadruple in the next decade. But with equal participation rates from both men and women in e-commerce, the growth could be even higher, per the report.\n\nBeyond participation, however, there exists an earning gap between e-commerce businesses owned by women compared to those owned by men, skewed in favour of the latter. According to the IFC report\u2014compiled with data from Jumia, Africa\u2019s largest e-commerce platform\u2014closing this gap between male and female vendors by 2025 would yield $14.5 billion in additional e-commerce market value in Africa by 2030.\n\nHow can this be achieved?\n\nJuliet Anammah, Jumia Nigeria\u2019s Chairwoman and Chief Sustainability Officer for the Group, notes that increasing the number of women selling through e-commerce platforms is crucial.\n\nIn countries like Nigeria, many women own physical stores while a growing number of female merchants sell through informal social commerce platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram. Helping the latter group transition to selling via formal e-commerce platforms, where they can access wider markets and business records needed to secure loans, is one of Jumia\u2019s objectives, in line with closing the gender gap in e-commerce.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear one of the ways women can grow their businesses through e-commerce is participating on platforms,\u201d Anammah says. \u201cMany traders opt for social commerce but in such instances, you\u2019re a single player and not aggregating data that can be useful when applying for loans. On Jumia, there\u2019s a database on your sales history, transactions, which lending partners use in providing credit.\u201d\n\nAs an entrepreneur and mother of 3, managing her business while taking care of the family was tough for Bukola Ogundijo, until she started selling on Jumia. \u201cThe platform has been very helpful in managing my business in 3 major ways,\u201d the founder of Purple Linings Ventures told the TC Live audience. \u201cWarehousing my product, packaging, and delivery whenever I get orders, all of which has reduced my operational costs.\u201d\n\nIn terms of access to credit to grow her business, Ogundijo says she\u2019s been able to secure low-interest loans from Jumia\u2019s lending partner, which has helped scale the business faster than her pre-Jumia days.\n\nFor Alexa Roscoe, the Disruptive Technology Lead (Gender and Economic Inclusion Group) at the IFC, the value of an enhanced seller base isn\u2019t just about the number of sellers going online but also bringing in more diverse products and services that serve a wider market and more customer needs.\n\n\u201cEntrepreneurs are just half the puzzle of the marketplace,\u201d Roscoe says. \u201cWomen are also buying online and we know they are responsible for making the vast majority of consumer decisions such as what groceries to buy.\u201d\n\nHence, understanding what women consumers want to better serve them is of equal importance, she argues, especially the women new to online shopping. \u201cThat way, they see e-commerce as a way to meet their needs. That\u2019s how we can help grow the market and make it more diverse.\u201d\n\nWhile the report finds that e-commerce companies can lead the way in the bid to increase the number of female entrepreneurs in e-commerce, as well as their sales, the IFC does recognise the importance of partnerships involving investors and policymakers in achieving this goal.\n\n\u201cPartnerships play an important role in bringing together different expertise, expanding knowledge and evidence, and most importantly, scaling impact massively and addressing multiple challenges,\u201d Anne Kabugi, the IFC\u2019s Regional Gender Lead for Africa (Gender and Economic Inclusion Group), says. \u201cThere is a huge e-commerce opportunity in Africa but Jumia alone may not be able to do massive research covering different geographies.\u201d\n\nWith partnerships that bring in the right resources, expertise, and investments to undertake research, players like Jumia can leverage the data to inform strategy and expansion across the continent.\n\n\u201cMore of these partnerships are needed, not just in the private sector but also the public. Government can help remove the legal and regulatory bottlenecks for business expansion and enable women access e-commerce and other digital services through inclusive connectivity policies for instance.\u201d\n\nKCA\u2019s Wanjau holds a similar stance on partnerships between stakeholders. \u201cE-commerce companies or the government can\u2019t do it alone. There\u2019s a need for collaboration across board,\u201d she says. \u201cCooperation between investors, e-commerce platforms, governments, and development organisations is needed to ensure a multi-stakeholder approach to address these issues. This isn\u2019t restricted to national levels because e-commerce is international.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "The Next Wave: Who will win Africa\u2019s music streaming wars?",
          "text": "November 29th 2021\n\nThe Next Wave provides a futuristic analysis of BizTech and innovation in Africa. Subscribe here to get it directly in your inbox on Sundays at 3 PM (WAT).\n\nThe African music industry is booming due to great musical talent, a diverse array of musical sounds, a young population, and increasing internet connectivity. But it was not always like this. For instance, the world\u2019s biggest music streaming service (with a 34% market share), Spotify, entered Nigeria in 2012, around the same time it expanded to Asia and the US. But, in 2012, Nigeria\u2019s smartphone and internet penetration were low, and the majority of the country still used the 2G network. This automatically meant low adoption of Spotify\u2019s service and low revenue. So, they abandoned the market for a while.\n\nIn a bid to tap into the potentials of the African entertainment industry, global players like YouTube Music and Spotify eye the continent. YouTube Music launched in South Africa in 2019 and Nigeria in 2020. Spotify returned to Nigeria last year, years after Nigerians had begun to use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and third-party payment apps like Flutterwave\u2019s payment gateway Barter to bypass payment restrictions.\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo\u2013TechCabal Insights\n\nConverting a big user base to subscribers\n\nA report by Media Research indicates that MENA, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Africa will account for 73% of global music subscriptions by 2028, counting from 2020. But average revenue per user in these developing markets is low\u20143\u20135 times smaller than in the US and Europe. Spotify, for example, charges subscribers in the US $9.9 per month, and for those in the UK $13.97. But, in Nigeria, it charges $1.7 (\u20a6900), and in South Africa $3.9 (R59.99). In India, subscribers pay between $1.63 and $2.00 per month.\n\nSince 2018, Spotify has expanded to 48 African countries, but because it gets its money from subscriptions and the continent has low spending power, it doesn\u2019t seem like the streaming giant will direct too much focus on its play on the continent. According to a study by UK Research firm, Midia Research, worldwide streaming subscriptions grew by 26.4% in the second quarter of 2021. It stood at 521.3 million subscribers at the end of the quarter, a huge growth from 109.5 million from the year before. But because the majority of this growth came from low-spending emerging markets, the 26.4% global growth in subscribers did not translate to a huge increase in revenue.\n\nIt is important to note, though, that Spotify\u2019s game plan transcends music streaming\u2014podcasts, audio advertising, audio branding, and audiobooks are crucial parts of its strategy.\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo\u2013TechCabal Insights\n\nWhat advantages do local platforms have?\n\nEven though local music platforms like Boomplay and Audiomack are barely known in the West, they have had a headstart in Africa. When YouTube Music launched in South Africa, Boomplay already had over 10 million downloads on Google Playstore. Boomplay apps come pre-installed on mobile phones made by China\u2019s Transsion\u2014makers of phone brands like Tecno, Infinix, and Itel, which are ubiquitous in Africa. What this means is that Boomplay\u2019s 60 million registered users might just be its starting point. According to research firm IDC, Transsion recorded over 40% of smartphone sales in Africa in the last quarter of 2019. As more Africans are coming online by the minute, it is very likely that they will use these Transsion phones, and when they do, Boomplay app users will keep increasing.\n\nThese local players also have a deeper relationship with the industry, artistes, music community, and media; and they don\u2019t have the payment barriers some foreign streaming apps have. Not only do Audiomack and Boomplay allow Africans to use their streaming platform for free, and download and listen offline, they allow them to use their service with affordable data. These platforms, instead of introducing just Western musicians to their audiences, serve as avenues for them to discover exciting new African musicians. For new artistes, it exposes them to millions of new audiences, and offers them a ticket to stardom even while they are yet to get a deal with a record label or distributor.\n\nPartner Message\n\nReceive money from over 30 countries directly to your bank account or mobile wallet.

The Abu Dhabi-headquartered streaming platform, which serves the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries, became the first Arab tech company to go public. Anghami has more than 70 million registered users and has a partnership with music\u2019s Big Three\u2014Universal Music Group, Sony Music, and Warner Music Group. Like Boomplay\u2019s Transsion advantage and Audiomack\u2019s partnership with telco, MTN, Anghami partnered with 37 telcos (as of last year) to help subsidise and promote its music services.\n\nPartner Message\n\nThe 10X Thrive Conference brings the best minds from the world\u2019s most successful companies across Africa, Europe, America, Asia.\n\nNo PowerPoint presentations, just real stories and tips you can act immediately to take your life, career, business to the next level!

Clearly, subscription is king, with paid subscriptions accounting for 78% of streaming revenue, growing by 26% year-on-year to reach $4.6 billion. In all, streaming subscriptions accounted for about two-thirds (65%) of total recorded music revenues in the first half of 2021 in the US.\n\nOn the flip side is Africa, whose streaming revenue is much lower. African artistes made $300 million from streaming in the entire 2021. While the majority of music subscribers in the coming decade will come from developing countries, revenue potential on the continent, as it stands, remains unattractive to global companies. Still, there is a chance that the success of Tencent Music Entertainment and NetEase Cloud Music in China and Anghami in MENA (which, combined, accumulated 35.7 million subscribers in a year) can be replicated by local music streaming services like Boomplay and Audiomack in Africa.\n\nHave a great week.\n\n\n\nThank you for reading The Next Wave.

          "title": "Saudi Arabia: A new home for Nigerian startups?",
          "text": "For Nigerians who want to start or already run their businesses, there\u2019s a constant concern about access to supporting infrastructure, funding, and talent. These concerns are the primary causes of high failure among startups on the continent.\n\nThe startup failure rate in Nigeria reportedly stood at 61% in 2021, meaning only 39% survive. This is similar across Africa where startup failure rates range from 75% in Ethiopia and 74% in Ghana to 58.3% in Senegal and 58.7% in Kenya.\n\nIn a bid to increase the success rate and accelerate the transition to a digital economy, the Saudi Arabian government is partnering with Nigerian authorities to provide Nigerian entrepreneurs with expedited entry and support via Digital Cooperation Organization (DCO) Startup Passport.\n\nThe Startup Passport initiative, which will ultimately be between the 8-member DCO countries, rolled out initially in Saudi Arabia and Nigeria. This announcement implies that Nigerian startups building products that primarily serve the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region are invited to build their companies from Saudi Arabia with support from the government.\n\nThis initiative was launched at LEAP, a global event for future technologies being held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from February 1 to 3 and attended by leading technology corporations, global start-up pioneers, and venture capitalists.\n\nFaris AlSaqabi, Saudi Deputy Minister for Future Jobs and Capabilities, explained that the bond between Saudi Arabia and Nigeria is fueled by the country\u2019s movement to a digital economy.\n\n\u201cNigeria is one of the key players in the digital economy. We\u2019ve noticed you cannot do it alone, so we have to partner with other countries.\u201d\n\nAt LEAP, \u201cThe Garage\u201d, a world-class innovation hub to support emerging and disruptive technology-based startups was also announced. The name is inspired by the origin stories of many of the world\u2019s top tech companies that famously started from inside garages.\n\nAlongside other business leaders who were present at the event, Nigerian Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami; Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Communications Commission, Umar Danbatta, and other delegates were attendees.\n\nNigerian Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami in conversation with a representative of the Digital Cooperation Organization. Source: DCO\n\n\u201cOne lesson we can pick from Saudi Arabia\u2019s success is that we should take away the word impossible. We should be optimistic about any plans we have for transforming Nigeria,\u201d Pantami told TechCabal. \u201cWhoever comes to Saudi for the first time after some years and sees the changes will appreciate what\u2019s going on in the digital economy. Their institutions are no longer obsolete. They\u2019re not just advanced but proactive.\u201d\n\nHe further said that his presence at the conference is to connect with potential investors, government officials, tech giants, and even startups. \u201cWe\u2019ve been having a series of meetings with investors on how they can come to Nigeria and invest. Some of the global tech giants are willing to come to Nigeria and establish their manufacturing plants.\u201d\n\nPantami pointed out that Nigeria\u2019s large economy, youthful population, and its exit from the recent recession are some reasons why investors are excited about the country, despite there also being a few areas to improve on.\n\n\u201cThe first meeting I had, they were surprised that Nigeria has 6 successful unicorns and still many are coming. The fastest-growing economy is the digital sector, which played a pivotal role in exiting the country out of recession.\u201d\n\nAlongside the Nigerian delegation, Domineum, Tanadi, Rice Afrika and 7 other Nigerian startups were also present at the event.\n\nAll roads lead to Vision 2030\n\nSo far, investments worth about $10 billion in technology and startups were announced at LEAP.\n\nThe investments and initiatives include the launch of Aramco Venture\u2019s Prosperity7 fund with $1 billion, and a billion dollar investment from NEOM Tech & Digital Company with a focus on future technologies. The Saudi Telecom Company announced MENA HUB, a $1 billion investment in regional connectivity and infrastructure.\n\nIgnite, a $1.1 billion investment targeted at the creative industry, was also launched. This new program is expected to transform Saudi Arabia into a leading digital entertainment and media production hub.\n\nTo provide better internet service, WiFi 6E was launched, supported by the largest amount of spectrum available for WiFi of any country worldwide. This is accompanied by other connectivity-boosting initiatives, including the first regional trial of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite technology to extend reliable coverage to remote areas of the Kingdom.\n\nThese announcements are all connected to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030, a drive to reduce dependence on oil and diversify its economy.\n\nSince the drive to achieve the Vision 2030 began in 2016, there\u2019s been considerable changes in Saudi Arabia, notably the liberalisation of its entertainment sector, provision of tourism visas and relaxing its rules for tourists as well as lifting the ban for women to drive in 2018\u2014the last country in the world to do so.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking about the emerging technologies and the future of jobs for our people because soon millions of current jobs will be replaced by technology,\u201d AlSaqabi said. \u201cThis means we\u2019ll lose millions of dollars if we don\u2019t adopt emerging technologies. There is no excuse to wait for the future to come, we have to go to it.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s identity management agency wants to replace ID numbers with digital tokens",
          "text": "In August 2014, Nigeria\u2019s former president Goodluck Jonathan launched a new national identity project. The new e-ID card was supposed to be the super app of civil registers and traditional ID cards, combining digitally verifiable identification with the ability to make electronic payments, and even withdraw cash at ATMs.\n\nLong story short, it flopped. As had a previous attempt made 10 years prior.\n\nA 2019 court order finally put a temporary halt to new card issuance after a paltry 1.2 million cards had been issued. NIMC then switched attention from e-cards to simply issuing paper-printed National Identification Numbers (NINs). So far, NIMC has successfully registered over 71 million Nigerian residents and citizens, representing roughly 35% of the population.\n\nNow Nigeria\u2019s identity management office is rolling out the next phase of its ambitious digital ID programme, a virtual e-ID that anonymises the personally identifiable information used for KYC verification.\n\nOn the one hand, it\u2019s a long-overdue milestone, and on the other hand, it is a confidence signal that the government is serious about digitally ID-ing Nigerians.\n\nWhy are digital IDs important?\n\nGenerally speaking, legal identification is important. People have the right to be recognised legally by their government for social protection, financial inclusion, and migration. Identification is how people prove that recognition. Theoretically, what digital IDs do is simply replace paper records with digitally stored and accessible ID databases.\n\nOf course, today\u2019s digital IDs do much more than simply recognise and authenticate identity claims. Some governments want them to serve as intermediaries between the population and access to basic services.\n\nIndia\u2019s Aadhaar number is a good example of a widely successful digital identity project. Aadhaar now covers 99% of Indian adults, a huge feat in itself, given the country\u2019s huge population. According to K. Sudhir and Shyam Sunder, both faculty members at Yale, \u201cBecause of Aadhaar, many have gained access to public services they had long been entitled to. Banks and mobile phone companies have enrolled poor people who previously had been seen as too risky and cost-prohibitive to be viable customers.\u201d\n\nSubsidies and food aid, which used to be diverted through \u201cghost\u201d recipients, now go to the people who need them, and rural-urban migrants are able to access an entire suite of services that would otherwise be challenging to access. In Malawi, fingerprinting for credit disbursement helped reduce loan default rates and supported repayment behaviour.\n\nHowever, untokenised unique identifying numbers (UINs), like Nigeria\u2019s NIN, can leave people vulnerable to privacy abuses since the individual has one identifying number which follows them across every database they interact with. For example, NIMC recommends that Nigerians not share their NIN, but the same NIN is one of the channels for verifying customer identity.\n\nA digital token is that crucial additional layer that prevents personally identifiable information (PII) from being recorded while allowing a company to securely verify the user\u2019s identity. My earlier example, India\u2019s Aadhaar, is tokenised in a similar way as NIMC intends. What is more? India\u2019s Reserve Bank has even asked all service providers to tokenise card and card-on-file storage, but that\u2019s a story for another day. The point is, tokenisation is an important component of privacy protection.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nImproving data privacy\n\nIn 2019, following the footsteps of Europe, Nigeria\u2019s National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) issued the Nigerian Data Protection Regulation (NDPR). The NDPR was largely based on the European example, but some analysts argue that it is inadequate and lacks sufficient legal status, as it is not a law. That flaw, combined with the fact that a proposed data protection bill was abandoned by the federal government late last year, has allowed a legal grey zone for how data is handled in Nigeria.\n\nFor example, private companies might handle, store, or even sell personal data in ways that are not only unethical but legally grey. A NIN token prevents that from even happening instead of simply relying on the honor code illusion.\n\nBy tokenising the authentication process, NIMC is helping to prevent users\u2019 personally identifiable information from being accessed and stored unethically by private companies.\n\nNow NIMC has asked service providers to only verify NIN tokens, not the actual NINs. This KYC policy update means that startups, telcos, and the organisations that use NIN will need to update their onboarding processes and app interfaces to be able to verify NIN tokens. According to Kasim Sodangi, Head of Compliance, NITDA, using NIN tokens to verify user identities will be cheaper for private companies\u2019 KYC.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nUsers can create NIN tokens from NIMC\u2019s mobile application or generate the tokens via USSD (*346*3*Your NIN*AgentCode#). Agent codes are like unique merchant numbers that identify the service provider requesting the verification. This means that tokens generated for merchant X can only be used for that merchant and remain valid for only 72 hours.\n\nWhat does this mean for service providers?\n\nIn general terms, nothing much changes. Service providers can still use the Bank Verification Number (BVN) or any other KYC verification channel to authenticate users\u2019 identities. The only big change applies to startups that require NIN for KYC. Such companies will have to apply as enterprises to get unique merchant keys with which they can verify virtual NINs or tokens. Or use KYC verification services like Smile Identity to access NIMC\u2019s API. NIMC also says using the service will be cheaper than using BVNs for KYC.\n\nNIMC launched the NIN tokens in January, and while telcos and Nigeria\u2019s National Pension Commission (PENCOM) have begun dry runs of the new process, Usman Abiola, Principal Product Manager at Smile Identity says they were yet to try the product and expected to get access later in February. NIMC has issued over 70 million NINs despite debilitating trust issues and a generally poor service infrastructure. A lot of that success comes from the mandated linking of NINs to individual SIM cards. Tokenisation will protect people\u2019s personal data, for sure, but that is only one part of the enormous work needed to fix data protection and enforcement in Nigeria.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello!\n\nToday does not seem to be that day of the week where many African startups take over the news with several huge funding rounds. Trust me, funding news does excite me, but not as much as the massive transformations these startups have the potential to deliver in the edtech, insurtech, healthtech, open finance, and other industries they operate.\n\nNonetheless, we do have one. Nigeria\u2019s Reliance Health raised $40 million in a Series B round.\n\nToday on Techpoint Digest, I decided to explore artistes\u2019 interests in African startups, a scenario that has become more noticeable recently. I hope we can all find answers to the \u2018why?\u2019 and \u2018what\u2019s in it for them?\u2019 questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfrican startups X Artistes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, Nigerian startup, AltSchool, raised a $1m pre-seed to provide alternative schools for Africans. Besides VCs, other investors who participated in the round include two popular Nigerian artists, Folarin Falana (Falz) and Akitoye Balogun (Ajebutter).\n\nThis is not foreign to the African startup space. The best person to fit this description would be Ajibade Oluwatosin (Mr Eazi). As a founder himself, he runs a VC company, Africa Music Fund (AMF), that invests in African music talents. In 2020, AMF raised $20m. He also set up a syndicate fund, Zagadat Capital, to invest in African startups.\n\nDid you miss this? \u201cWatch out for pastor Eazi!\u201d \u2014 Mr Eazi, on creative prospects beyond tech investments\n\nDuring my conversation with Mr Eazi last year, he believed that music is a product and that being an artist is similar to running a startup, especially since both involve high uncertainty. Victor Okpala, Spotify\u2019s West African Artist and Label Partnerships Manager, also held a similar opinion during Techpoint Build 2021 while discussing the next frontier in music with other panellists.\n\nAsides from investing, another noticeable occurrence is brand ambassadorship. This is commonplace in almost every industry, from sports to hospitality, and it\u2019s evident that startups are also getting in on it.\n\nLet\u2019s name a few: ChipperCash X Burna Boy, Kuda Bank X Fireboy DML, Flutterwave X Wizkid, Risevest X Teni, among others. Fintech much, huh?\n\nHere\u2019s what I think of this. Fans can be very loyal to their favourite artistes, which means they\u2019ll likely support what they support, no matter what. And what does this loyalty mean to the brand? I see a better monetisation potential. It\u2019s a different level of marketing, you know? That brand will get the same sentimental attachment fans with that artiste. Or am I exaggerating?\n\nWhile I see a massive opportunity here for these brands, I can\u2019t ignore how much goes into these partnerships in terms of funds. But then, these startups are highly valuable to start with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut can we say this is a win-win for both parties? How much ROI do these brands record apart from the familiar metric, which is the customer base? I\u2019m also curious, do artistes request equity instead of money?\n\nI believe you\u2019ll find this interesting? From Burna Boy to TV\u2019s Big Brother Naija, Nigerian startups are spending millions on celebrity endorsements\n\nReliance Health $40m Series B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does it feel to have an emergency surgery sorted without having to break a bank? That\u2019s one of the perks of health insurance. But providing this service within a low-trust space with people cynical about insurance like Africa gets complicated. Still, tech startups are working to change this outlook.\n\nNigerian healthtech startup, Reliance Health plays in this space. The startup partners with hospitals, pharmacies, clinical physicians, specialists, and other healthcare facilities to provide health insurance and telemedicine.\n\nAnd it has just raised $40m in a Series B round led by General Atlantic, Partech, Picus Capital, Tencent Exploration, Africa Healthcare Master Fund, P1 Ventures, Laerdal Million Lives Fund, and M3 Inc.\n\nThe six-year-old startup serves businesses and individuals via a subscription model and claims to be serving over 200,000 customers. This fund will be directed towards expansion to Egypt, to start with; funding two clinics in two Nigerian cities, hiring talents and introducing new products.\n\nInterestingly, Reliance Health\u2019s raise is the largest so far in Africa\u2019s healthtech space.\n\nRead more: Nigerian healthtech startup Reliance Health raises $40M led by General Atlantic\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nPaystack is hiring.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi, there.\n\nIt seems every fifth market day \u2014 I\u2019m borrowing one of Chimgozirim\u2019s phrases here \u2014 there\u2019s some new drama on the streets of Nigerian Tech Twitter.\n\nThis weekend, the employee market took centre stage. And from this school of thought to this one, we saw different takes on whether employees should jump ship within six months of employment and whether they should accept freelance gigs. Made for some scintillating exchanges, if I\u2019m honest.\n\nWhat do you think, though? Should employees take freelance work? Are they unserious when they leave a job within a year? I\u2019m curious to hear your thoughts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, in Today\u2019s Digest, we\u2019d be discussing\n\nThe competition fintechs may not see coming, and\n\nThe tech/Afrobeats combo\n\nWho\u2019s competing with fintechs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting the scene: These days, for a lot of financial transactions that we make, we often have to jump between different apps for them.\n\nTo transfer money, you have options ranging from your bank, your savings apps, and your investment apps. For bill payments, you\u2019d probably have to move to another app. And we\u2019ve not even touched on cross-border payments or options for investment or even the decentralised finance space.\n\nA crossroads: This situation just goes to show how inefficient the traditional banking system had become and why the need for fintechs like Paystack, Flutterwave, Cowrywise, among others, rose. But these fintechs might soon find themselves facing some stiff competition they might not have expected.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, though: I\u2019m not saying fintech startups are having a bad run, but here\u2019s the thing, there are a lot of them. Interestingly, when I talked to Adedeji Olowe last year for The Next Frontier series, he quite disagreed.\n\nAt Techpoint Build 2021, Oluwatobi Boshoro, CEO of Infinitetiks, spoke on Business model innovation: the rise of ecosystems and platforms based on changing customer attitudes. While giving this overview, she touched on several things, including possible competition from non-fintech startups.\n\nCurious? You can check it out here: How changing customer attitudes will affect fintech business models in Africa\n\nThe next frontier in music tech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve followed this newsletter long enough, you probably already know how much I love music \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m always giving you guys recommendations or anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this part of the world, streaming music didn\u2019t become a thing until platforms like Soundcloud, Boomplay, and others burst onto the scene. Before that, most of us got our music from illegal download sites, and if you could afford it, iTunes. Of course, you could purchase CDs and Vinyl too.\n\nNow, platforms like Spotify, YouTube Music, and Apple Music are currently trying to take a huge piece of the African pie.\n\nThey\u2019ve also helped catapult Afrobeats \u2014 one of Africa\u2019s most prominent exports on the music scene \u2014 to the world stage faster. Artists like Rema, Burna Boy, and Tems blazing trails and setting new records.\n\nAt Techpoint Build 2021, the music panel had quite a bit to say, taking us through the history, the now, and probably the future.\n\nGrab your prefered poison and come along for this ride: Afrobeats: \u201cThere are global moments, but the biggest opportunity is Nigeria.\u201d \u2014 Obi Asika\n\nStories from the week before\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nPaystack is hiring.

          "title": "In break with tradition, Nigeria\u2019s external reserves fall as oil prices rise",
          "text": "The rally in oil prices is not translating to more dollars in Nigeria\u2019s reserves for only the fifth time in at least two decades as a growing petrol subsidy bill and low oil production shut Africa\u2019s largest oil producer from the gains of higher oil prices.\n\nNigeria\u2019s gross official reserves slipped below the $40 billion mark to $39.982 billion on Feb 3, the lowest in three months, according to data obtained from the Central Bank\u2019s website.\n\nThe reserves had also declined in the month of January 2022, falling by $481 million to USD40.04bn from USD40.50bn as of the end of December 2021.\n\nThere has been no significant boost for the reserves since last September when Nigeria issued a USD5 billion Eurobond and received a USD3.3 billion Special Drawing Right (SDR) allocation from the International Monetary Fund.\n\nIt is unusual for Nigeria\u2019s external reserves to be declining at a time the price of oil has rallied to the highest level since 2014, which should mean more dollar income for oil-exporting Nigeria. Nigeria\u2019s external reserves and excess crude account tend to see accretion in periods of higher oil prices. But that tradition is increasingly fading.\n\nBrent crude, the global benchmark, has risen by 14.6 percent this year alone to $90.5 per barrel, that\u2019s well above the government\u2019s target of $62 per barrel. While oil prices have soared, the external reserves have however declined by 1.3 percent in the same period.\n\nRead also: Oil price uncertainty, insecurity, threaten Nigeria\u2019s economic outlook \u2013 IMF\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s reserves are steadily declining due to poor oil revenues,\u201d Tunde Abidoye, an analyst at Lagos-based investment bank, FBN Quest said in a note to clients. Nigeria\u2019s oil revenues have tanked for two reasons.\n\nFirst is the rising cost of subsidising petrol, a wasteful practice the government has stuck with in violation of a law it set itself- the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA). The subsidy payment leaves the state-owned oil company, NNPC, with less cash to remit to the country.\n\nBen Akabueze, head of the country\u2019s Budget Office, said oil revenue has been affected negatively by subsidy costs and low oil production despite rising oil prices.\n\n\u201cThe oil sector let the government down (in 2021) with oil revenue coming 50 percent short of the target despite oil prices significantly higher than the budget benchmark,\u201d Akabueze said during the Renaissance Capital Market recap and Outlook for 2022.\n\n\u201cThis was largely due to the effects of unbudgeted fuel subsidy and oil production below even our OPEC quota,\u201d Akabueze said.\n\nThe government\u2019s oil revenues look set to turn out even worse this year with a subsidy bill that is estimated by the NNPC to increase to N3 trillion.\n\nLow oil production has also curbed revenues.\n\nIn 2021, oil output averaged around 1.4 million barrels per day (mbpd), compared with an OPEC quota of c.1.7mpbd.\n\nWith non-oil-based exports relatively low and accounting for less than 20% of total export earnings, the external reserves have remained under pressure.\n\nThat could translate to a weaker currency as the CBN has less firepower to keep the naira stable.\n\n\u201cNigeria is increasingly becoming less of an oil state,\u201d said Egie Akpata, a director at UCML Capital. \u201cNigeria is getting lower oil revenues when rising oil prices is helping oil countries record budget surpluses.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s total assets under management has risen to more than thirteen trillion naira, a growth of near ten per cent year on year to October 2021.\n\nAccording to PenCom\u2019s latest monthly report for Oct \u201921, the assets which came in at N13.2trn, grew by about one per cent month on month.\n\nOf this total, FGN debt securities represented 63.2% of the total and when you include corporate and state government issuance, fixed-income exposure surges to 71.2% of the industry\u2019s assets under management or AUM.\n\nAccording to a report by analysts at FBNQuest, the asset allocation of Nigerian pension funds has generally been biased toward government debt, due mainly to the scarcity of good investible securities available to them.\n\nHowever, in comparison, June \u201921 data from the Kenyan Retirement Benefit Authority estimates that government securities accounted for only 44.1% of the KES1.48trn (USD12.97bn) AUM of the Kenyan pension industry.\n\nRead also: Soft drink prices up 33% on sugar tax\n\nThe value of domestic equities in PFA portfolios increased by c.29% over the 12 month period, bringing the share of equities in the portfolio up to c.6.9% from around 5.8% a year earlier.\n\nWith respect to equities, Nigerian PFAs have adopted a cautious approach, having taken some losses during the stock market meltdown of 2008 to 2009.\n\nAnother noteworthy point is that despite the Nigerian Stock Exchange\u2019s market capitalisation of over USD60bn, selecting high-quality, liquid shares that fit the investment criteria of PFAs is extremely challenging.\n\nThe analysts said \u201cover the course of a year, PFAs cut their holdings of Nigerian Treasury Bills (NTB) from c.NGN653bn to c.NGN280bn.\n\n\u201cThe depressed (low-single-digit) yields on the NTBs is the major reason. In comparison, yields on FGN bonds retraced by well over 500bps across the curve between Q4 \u201920 and Q3 \u201921.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead, the DMO has an onerous domestic borrowing target of c.NGN2.57trn this year. This target does not take into consideration the supplementary budget meant to cover the NGN3trn for subsidy payments by the NNPC. As such, we see yields rising again this year on account of increased supply of paper from the DMO.\u201d",

          "title": "Top risks for Nigerian banks in 2022",
          "text": "Low interest rates, higher effective tax rates, and competition from telcos and fintechs are some of the top risks Nigerian banks are likely to face in 2022, according to a report by Renaissance Capital.\n\nIn 2021, Nigerian banks faced significant margin pressure due to reasons such as the low interest rate environment, the central bank\u2019s drive to reduce the high cost of its liquidity operations, and the punitive cash reserve ratio (CRR) regime.\n\nAccording to the report, 2022 will also be a challenging year and banks may struggle to deliver earnings growth as a result of some risks they are likely to face. The risks are highlighted below:\n\nProtracted margin pressure on low interest rate\n\nAccording to the report, banks will struggle to see a marginal-to-moderate improvement in their margins as interest rates may remain low.\n\n\u201cWe believe that margins bottomed in 2021 but struggle to see a significant shift in the interest rate environment going into 2022,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe report also notes that although there is room for a rate hike during the year, which may be positive for loan yields but the regulator might opt to take a different stance given the moderation in inflation in the past few months, although there was a slight uptick to 15.6 percent in December from 15.4 percent in November.\n\n\u201cThere is upside risk to T-bill yields from increased borrowing by the government, but yields may be kept flattish to help control debt servicing obligations and the regulator\u2019s cost of liquidity operations.\n\n\u201cWe have modelled for a marginal-to-moderate improvement in margins and note that interest income growth could benefit from low base effects of 2021.\u201d\n\nThe higher effective tax rate\n\nNigerian banks will see an increase in their effective tax rate (ETR) as their tax holiday is over. According to the report, this could adversely affect their net income growth and returns.\n\nIn 2011, the former president of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan, signed a Companies Income Exemption Order, which decreed tax exemptions on T-bills, promissory notes, government bonds, corporate bonds, and the interest earned on these instruments for a period of 10 years, starting January 2, 2012.\n\nExcept for Federal Government bonds, the tax exemptions on these instruments expired on January 2, 2022, implying that from this year, the banks will start to pay tax on income earned on these instruments.\n\n\u201cOn our estimates, T-bills and federal government bonds accounted for 19 percent and 7 percent of 9M21 assets at the banks in our coverage universe, respectively.\n\nThe management teams of various banks have given mixed feedback. While some feel the impact on their tax rate will be negligible others argue that it will be sizable. \u201cWe have increased our ETR forecasts by 2-3ppts across the board.\u201d\n\nMuted trading and revaluation gains\n\nThe report notes that the potential lack of volatility in interest and FX rates could hinder the ability of Nigerian banks to book major trading and revaluation gains in 2022.\n\nIn a volatile FX environment, the Nigerian banks\u2019 earnings have been cushioned historically by trading income from interest rate movements and revaluation gains booked on their respective net long positions, the report states.\n\n\u201cFollowing significant volatility in 2020 and a relatively stable environment in 2021, we saw trading income and revaluation gains decline considerably during the year.\n\n\u201cFor a uniform analysis, we computed the sum of trading and revaluation gains at the banks in our coverage universe and determined that the net amount declined by an average of 23 percent YoY in 9M21. The outlier was FBNH, which recorded a 10 percent YoY increase in 9M21 on a significant jump in its FX revaluation gains,\u201d the report states.\n\nAccording to Renaissance Capital, the naira is 12 percent overvalued and has a fair value of N473/$1 and except there is any negative externalities, there would not be any major depreciation in naira in 2022 as a result of strong oil prices and the upcoming elections in 2023, which could see the regulator opt to keep the exchange rate stable\n\n\u201cFor the banks, this potential lack of volatility in interest and FX rates could hinder their ability to book major trading and revaluation gains in 2022,\u201d the report states.\n\nHeightened political risks\n\nAccording to the report, banks will face heightened political risks as the 2023 elections draw closer.\n\n\u201cWe raised our risk premium by 50 bpts to reflect the heightened political risk in the run-up to the general elections in February 2023,\u201d they say.\n\nConstrained loan growth on Basel III policy\n\nWhile the Basel III policy creates certain benefits for the banking system, which includes a sturdier capital base, better leverage structures that can help prevent insolvency in times of economic stress, there are some issues worth considering.\n\n\u201cIncreasing the capital adequacy requirements for the Nigerian banks could constrain loan growth in a bid to conserve capital. We have forecast 10-15 percent loan growth in 2022,\u201d the report states.\n\nRead also: Banking sector and new tax regime\n\nThe report also reveals that excess capital on the banks\u2019 books could also be negative for RoE, given the elevated equity base it could create, as seen with the Egyptian banks. It could also affect the banks\u2019 dividend payout policies.\n\n\u201cIn our view, the banks best placed for Basel III are those that already meet the necessary requirements, and those with earnings diversification strategies i.e., holdcos with non-banking subsidiaries,\u201d the authors say.\n\nCompetition from telcos and fintechs\n\nA major risk Nigerian banks might likely face in 2022 would be the competition from telcos and fintechs. According to the report, there was meaningful growth in e-banking income, up by an average of 50 percent YoY in 9M21.\n\nGTCO has completed its transition into a holdco, Access intends to complete its transition to a holdco this year with a payments business underneath, Stanbic announced plans to launch a fintech subsidiary and we await updates from FBNH on FirstMonie.\n\nOn November 5, 2021, the CBN granted an approval-in-principle (AIP) to MTN Nigeria and Airtel Nigeria to establish a payment service bank (PSB).\n\n\u201cWe note risks regarding competition from fintechs and telcos which could secure their final payment service bank (PSB) licences in 2022,\u201d\n\nThe licence will enable telcos to leverage their massive infrastructure rollout and dealer network to offer some banking services, especially to the underbanked.",

          "title": "THREAT TO 2023 ELECTIONS: THE DANGER OF SPONSORTING THUGS TO WIN OSUN 2022 ELECTION \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe illegal action of sponsoring thugs to win party congresses in Osun is a recipe for violence. Governor Oyetola is inducing violence in Osun APC by orchestrating thugs attack and manipulated the state APC congresses. The use of thugs in Osun APC by Governor Oyetola to conduct ward, local government and state congresses clearly shows the level of bad governance in Osun State. The illegality and the danger of sponsoring thugs to win Osun 2022 election poses a great threat to 2023 election in Nigeria. Every democratic system has to regulate the flow of money and use of thugs for political gains. Illegal thugs funding for Osun 2022 election presents certain problems to future elections in modern liberal and the emerging democracy in Nigeria. Sponsoring of thugs in Osun State fails to guarantee fairness and equality in the competition among candidates and political parties. The outcome of Osun 2022 election may not reflect the interest of the majority in Osun State, but the interest of the financier of the thugs. This will necessitates reactions in the form of violence, which characterized Nigerian political system in the post general election, postelection litigation, and postelection violence. It is important for me to emphasize that many democratic governments to continually strive toward reducing thugs and money in politics. The danger ahead of Osun 2022 election is that Governor Oyetola used thugs to conduct APC state congress and he is set to use thugs against other political parties that will participate in the Osun 2022 election. Governor Oyetola is now a threat to members of Osun APC and a threat to Nigeria\u2019s 2023 elections because he is not committed to free and fair election.\n\nI want to urge Governor Oyetola to concentrate on winning elections by the performance of his party and not by relying on thugs and violence for electoral victory. Good governance remains the surest path towards winning elections especially when you are committed to free and fair and credible elections devoid of the kind of violence witnessed in Osun State today. So instead of trying to pacify by violent and lawlessness just because Oyetola wants to win election, Oyetola should support the stellar performance being displayed by former Governor Aregbesola in Osun State, that way, he will not need the services of his thugs to win Osun 2022 election.\n\nGovrnor Oyetola has been sending thugs to attack members of Osun APC since 2021 so as to disrupt members of Osun APC meetings and prevent them from getting justice. Governor Oyetola is so sad that he will not be able to win Osun 2022 governorship election because of his bad governance. If Oyetola can rely on thugs to win APC PRIMARY, I wonder what will happen to Oyetola during July election. We are now seeing desperation and frustration in the behaviour of Governor Oyetola.\n\nThe attack on the Oranmiyan House, the political edifice of the immediate past governor and current Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola will not help Governor Oyetola to win Osun 2022 election. Osun state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola and some leaders of the faction supported by the governor are sponsoring attacks against Aregbesola\u2019s supporters. Governor Oyetola is pursuing victory without peace in Osun State because he lacks the experience of a leader and he is still behaving as if he is still working in an insurance company. These attacks are sponsored by the state government through the campaign structure of the governor, known as Ilerioluwa.\n\nThe hoodlums that attacking members of Osun APC were identified for the police in the state, but they were yet to make any arrest. I want to call on the Inspector-General of Police Usman Alkali Baba to act swiftly on these attacks.\n\nThugs working for Governor Oyetola have denied members of Osun APC from conducting ward congress and state congress in 2021. Thugs seized their voting credentials and beat them up to produce Famodun as state chairman. The inability to conduct a free and fair state congress in Osun is a reflection of what Governor Oyetola stood for in Osun. The 2,517 aggrieved members of Osun APC have gone to court. It is not Aregbesola\u2019s camp that has gone to court. They are card-carrying members of Osun APC. They are pursuing their rights. I want to correct the wrong impression about labelling aggrieved members as Aregbesola\u2019s camp. Aggrieved members have the rights to go to court. The implication of 2,517 aggrieved members of APC court suit is that Governor Oyetola has lost his popularity and now relies on thugs to conduct ordinary party congress in Osun State. Thugs cannot save Governor Oyetola from defeat in Osun 2022 election. I want to warn that 2,517 aggrieved members should not be reduced to Aregbesola\u2019s name.\n\nAggrieved members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State that dragged the leadership of the party to court to challenge the outcome of the last state congress in the state will go to court of appeal to challenge the judgment. A total of 2,517 aggrieved members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 26 local governments of the State of Osun have approached a Federal High Court, sitting in Osogbo, the state capital, to challenge the Ward Congress of the party, held on July 31, 2021 in the state. They are being victimised by political operatives in Osun loyal to Oyetola.\n\nGovernor Oyetola failed when he refused to submit Aregbesola\u2019s name for ministerial appointment but he was disappointed when Aregbesola was appointed as minister. Governor Oyetola failed when he used thugs to conduct Osun APC ward congress and now he is confused whether to revoke the certificate of occupancy of Oraminyan House in Osogbo. Governor Oyetola has resorted to the use of arrest and judicial harassment of political opponents since he is no longer popular in Osun. In March 2021 Olateju Adunni, the Personal Assistant to Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola was attacked by some hired thugs.\n\nThe popular Oranmiyan House belonging to the Honourable Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Ar\u00e9gb\u00e9sol\u00e1 has constantly come under attack because it the venue of the weekly stakeholders meeting of The Osun Progressives (TOP) .\n\nBystanders who watched the siege from a far how thugs armed with guns and other dangerous weapon unleashed terror on Oranmiyan House couldn\u2019t hold their tears as information has it that the floor targeted by the gun men was proposed to house TOP hierarchies meeting which was billed to hold immediately after the Thursday general meeting. Armed political hoodlums have been sponsored by Governor Adegboyega Oyetola-led IleriOluwa faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC), are currently attacking Oranmiyan House in Osogbo.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes from Osogbo, Osun State.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

It needs technocrats who are going to critique their policies, it needs traditional rulers who are going to speak as the conscience of the people, everyone has a role to play and we should try to play that role to the best of our ability.\u201d\n\nSanusi also denied eyeing the presidency in 2023, saying he is contented with being the spiritual leader of the Tijaniyyah.\n\nSegun Sowunmi, who spoke on behalf of the family, had asked if Nigerians should be expecting a future president in Sanusi.\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

          "text": "A former Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Muhammadu Sanusi II, has warned that the country may sink further into more problems unless citizens were ready to take tougher decisions in the interest of the country.\n\nSanusi, the immediate past Emir of Kano and leader of the Khalifa of Tijaniyya sect in Nigeria, stated this Monday in Abeokuta, at the reception organised in his honour as part of activities marking the 80th birthday of Babanla Adinni of Egbaland, Chief Tayo Sowunmi.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, we are living on extra time. In 2015, we were in a deep hole. In 2023, we will be in an even much deeper hole than in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe challenges facing all those people who are struggling to be president, I hope they understand that the problems that they are going to face are multiples of the problems that were faced in 2015 and all of us have to be ready for difficult decisions and if they are not taken, we are all going to pay for it.\n\n\u201cBut the solution is not for all of us to jump into politics, this country needs good politicians, it needs imams and pastors and bishops who are going to stand up and remind them (politicians) of the fear of God. It needs technocrats who are going to critique their policies, it needs traditional rulers who are going to speak as the conscience of the people, everyone has a role to play and we should try to play that role to the best of our ability.\n\n\u201cI think the most important thing is that we should continue to pray for our country that whoever emerges as President, Governors, Senators, members of the House, leadership at all levels that we get good leaders.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that we should also remind ourselves as Muslims and as citizens that we owe it to ourselves because we know that this country deserves better than we have been giving ourselves.\n\n\u201cAllah commands you that you place trust only in the hands of those who are capable of handling that trust. If you choose somebody who is incompetent to lead you, if you choose somebody who is weak to lead you, if you choose someone who is dishonest to lead you, you can only blame yourself because Allah says you should only give that trust and He also explains to us what it means to be capable of holding that trust, someone who has the competence to do the job and who can be trusted.\n\n\u201cNow, if we go and choose leaders who are not competent because they give us money or because of personal interest and I keep saying to my brothers in Tijaniyyaa that we should stop praying for people who come to talk to us to say come and pray for me to be Governor, come and pray for me to be President, they go and people go and read the Quran for them.\n\n\u201cWe should look at all the candidates, we should choose the people that we think are competent and honest and then we decide who we want to pray for, not who comes to us with money or who comes to us to beg us, whether or not they come for us. And we should go and vote for them and we should pray to Allah that our sincere belief that these are the people who are in the best interest of our nation,\u201d he stated.\n\nDenies eyeing 2023\n\nThe former CBN governor however denied eyeing the presidency in 2023, saying he\u2019s content being spiritual leader of the Tijaniyyah, even as he called on all presidential aspirants to be ready to inherit a sinking country.\n\nHe noted that he had served in various capacities both in the past and present, saying, \u201cI will forever be grateful to Allah.\n\nAt 60, the Islamic scholar said, he had been blessed by Almighty Allah, stressing he prefers the Khalifa Tijaniyah position he occupies to being president.\n\nSanusi said: \u201cWhen they tell me to go into politics, you are telling me to set aside one type of authority and look for another type of authority, to leave what God has given me and pursue something else.\n\n\u201cI am the first and only northern Nigerian to be Chief Executive Officer of First Bank since it was set up in 1823. In this same life, God has made me Governor of Central Bank. He has made me Emir of Kano. He has made me Khalifa of Tijaniyah. What am I looking for?\n\n\u201cIf we all go into politics, who is going to make politicians to account? Who is going to stand up to tell them \u2018you are going wrong\u2019? Who is going to speak with the people and explain sometimes difficult policies that people don\u2019t like, but which are in the long term interest of the people?\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand the role we play as religious leaders, traditional rulers that they think we should go and be a Governor or President. To be honest I think that the role I play can be more than that of the President.\n\n\u201cTo be Khalifa Tijaniyah, is an office that personally has proven the choice between that office and the Presidency, I will choose that office.\n\n\u201cI can only speak about what I want, what I see and what I think, but at the end, we all have to submit ourselves.\u201d",

          "text": "Despite President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s order for military action against terrorists in Niger state, the hoodlums have continued to make incursions into more villages prompting Governor Abubakar Sani Bello to plead with the military to decisively carry out the presidential directive.\n\nAnd to curb the ugly trend, the state government announced a 24-hour curfew in Shiroro and Rafi local government areas of the state.\n\nThe governor made the position known in a statement Monday in Minna, the state capital.\n\nHe said the appeal followed the incessant and sporadic increase in attacks by the terrorists in Shiroro, Munya, Rafi and Paikoro local government areas of the state.\n\n\u201cWith these recent attacks, the terrorists are daring the capability and capacity of the military, hence we must demonstrate our military might through the approved coordinated Air and ground assault to flush out the miscreants from our forests, their hideout,\u201d Bello said.\n\nHe further said: \u201cIf we must win this battle against the terrorists, we must increase and sustain military operations to comb the forests. This has become expedient because our people are dying and the living are becoming more agitated and hopeless.\u201d\n\nWhile appreciating the efforts of the Joint Security Taskforce stationed in the embattled communities, the governor renewed his call to the people to assist the security agencies with credible intelligence that would enhance effective operations against the terrorists.\n\nCurfew\n\nAnd to stem the tide, therefore, the state Commissioner for Local Government, Chieftaincy Affairs and Internal Security Emmanuel Umar Bagna announced government\u2019s decision to impose curfew on the affected areas as a measure to flush out the terrorists and further expose those planning to invade the town.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe decision for the curfew was also due to intelligence reports that bandits are moving into the state in large numbers.\u201d\n\nThe commissioners further appealed to the communities to cooperate with security agencies as they try to restore peace to the area.\n\nBlueprint learnt that residents of Rafi and Shiroro have been told to remain in their homes from 5 pm Saturday till further notice.\n\nIn the same vain residents of Kuta, Gwada and Zumba in Shiroro local government area of the state have been locked down with heavy military patrol.\n\nThe council Chairman, Alhaji Suleiman Dauda Chukuba, confirmed this development, saying anyone seen outside would be taken and treated as a terrorist.\n\nOne killed, 7 rescued in Kaduna\n\nIn a related development, bandits Sunday night abducted Rev. Fr. Joseph Shekari and killed his cook during an attack on a Catholic Parish in Chawai, Kauru local government area of Kaduna state.\n\nThe cook (name unknown), who worked in the Parish House, was reported to have been shot twice by the bandits.\n\nA statement by Catholic Chancellor, Kafanchan Diocese, Rev. Fr. Emmanuel Okolo, confirmed the development.\n\nIt reads: \u201cIt is with great pain that we announce to you the kidnapping of our Priest, Rev. Fr. Joseph Danjuma Shekari. The sad event occurred on Sunday, February 06, 2022 around 11.30pm.\n\n\u201cHe was abducted from his residence at St. Monica\u2019s Catholic Church, Ikulu Pari, in Kauru local government area of Kaduna state.\n\n\u201cWhile we solicit for an intense prayer for his quick and safe release, we equally wish to call on all and sundry to refrain from taking the laws into their hands.\n\n\u201cWe will use every legitimate means to ensure his quick and safe release.\n\n\u201cMay Jesus crucified on the Cross, listen to our prayers and hasten the unconditional release of His Priest and all other kidnapped persons.\u201d\n\nSpokesman of the Kaduna Sate Police Command Mohammed Jalige could not be reached for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, troops Sunday rescued seven people from the clutches of bandits at Ungwan Garama near Maraban Rido in Chikun local government area of Kaduna state, the state government confirmed in a statement Monday Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan said the rescued victims have been reunited with their families.\n\n\u201cSecurity agencies have reported to the Kaduna state government that troops foiled an attack by bandits in Ungwan Garama, located in the Maraban Rido general area of Chikun local government area.\n\n\u201cAccording to the report, a distress call was received from the area and security forces swiftly responded, mobilising to the location and engaging the bandits. After an intense exchange, the superior firepower of the troops forced the criminals to flee in disarray.\n\n\u201cThe security forces exploited the withdrawal route of the bandits, and were thus able to rescue seven persons who had been kidnapped. The seven rescued persons are listed as follows: Buba Samuel, Janet Buba, Rebecca Buba, Precious Buba, David Yohanna, Johnson Yohanna and John Daniel. All of the rescued victims have been reunited with their families.\n\n\u201cReceiving the report, Governor Nasir el-Rufa\u2019i commended the security forces for their spirited efforts and speed of response. He congratulated them on the safe rescue of the seven citizens.\n\n\u201cThe governor conveyed his warm regards and best wishes to the rescued persons. Security forces have sustained patrols in the general area,\u201d Aruwan said.\n\nKogi Police command\n\nAlso, some gunmen Sunday evening attacked the Area Command of Nigerian Police Force in Okene local government area of Kogi state.\n\nIn the ensuing melee, one of the attackers was killed by the combined forces of the Police and other security agents.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlueprint gathered that the gunmen, numbering over 30, stormed the Police Command in Okene around 10:30pm but were effectively repelled while one of the attackers was gunned down and several others escaped with bullet wounds.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpokesman of the state Police Command, William Aya, confirmed the attack and said the gunmen launched the attack around 10pm Sunday, February 6.\n\n\n\nAya, a Superintendent of Police, in statement issued Monday in Lokoja, said t the yet- to-be identified gunmen attacked the police formation with sporadic gunshots and explosives chanting \u2018Allahu Akhbar.\u2019\n\nHe however added that personnel on duty repelled the attackers and killed one of them.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis forced the attackers to flee before the arrival of back up teams from the neighbouring divisions,\u201d the statement added.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the state Commissioner of Police (CP) Edward Ebuka has ordered the immediate deployment of re-enforcement consisting of Counter Terrorism Units, Police Mobile Force, Intelligence team as well as Quick Response Unit along with the military and other security forces, to Okene and its environs.\n\nKGSG lauds security agencies\n\nAlso in a statement, the Kogi State Government said the attackers were shown the strength and efficacy of the state security architecture as the local hunters, men of the State Vigilante Service collaborated with other security operatives to spontaneously foil the attack.\n\nCommissioner for Information and Communications Kingsley Fanwo said this in a statement Monday.\n\n\u201cThe superior firepower of the combined security network of the state ensured one of them was gunned down immediately while others ran away with various degrees of gunshot wounds. Two of their motorcycles were recovered as well as various arms and ammunition,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nBafarawa laments Zamfara killings\n\nSimilarly, a former Sokoto state governor and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain in the Northwest, Alhaji Attahiru Dalhatu Bafarawa has described the incessant killing of innocent citizens by bandits in Zamfara state as alarming.\n\nBafarawa said this in Gusau Monday when he accompanied Sokoto state Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, who was in the state to consult with PDP members over his presidential aspiration.\n\n\u201cI am heartfelt in totality about what is happening in Zamfara where innocent villagers are maimed, killed, properties were destroyed, rampant kidnapping, hence the need for appropriate authority to respond as quickly as possible,\u201d Bafarawa said.\n\nDescribing the killing and destruction of properties as barbaric, the former governor said the suffering among the residents was a consequence of abject poverty caused by insecurity in the state.\n\nHe called on the federal government and other stakeholders to fashion out ways of ending the menace of terrorism in Zamfara and other states of the North-west.\n\n\u201cWe must contribute our quotas regardless of our ethnic, religious and political inclinations in saving our region from total collapse,\u201d he said.",

With that in mind, he is being prosecuted,\u201d he said during the show.\n\n\u201cWe will allow the law of the nation that was indeed breached to take its natural course and perhaps, maybe thereafter bringing him back home after the conclusion of the trial over there for the purpose of facing the Nigerian law that was accordingly breached.\n\n\u201cThe position of things is that we are not interfering in aborting the existing prosecution in the foreign land, taking into consideration that the laws that were alleged to have been breached were indeed the laws of a foreign nation.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Trial Of Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s Co-Defendants: Court Fines AGF Malami N200,000\n\nWhen asked if the Muhammadu Buhari administration was considering a political solution to free both separatist leaders, the Minister neither confirmed nor denied it.

          "text": "The Nigerian government on Monday revealed some of the actions it is taking under the radar regarding the allegations against a police officer, Abba Kyari, and suspected fraudster, Ramon Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi.\n\nTop of these actions, according to the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Mr Abubakar Malami, is the collaboration with the United States government to ensure justice is served.\n\n\u201cThe position now is that there are prima facie grounds \u2013 reasonable grounds for suspicion that have been considered from the perspective of prosecution, from the perspective of likely extradition, if the need for so doing arises,\u201d said the Minister who was a guest on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today.\n\n\u201cIt is an issue that has both national and international dimensions and in respect of the two, actions are being taken; it is a work in progress locally and internationally and we are doing whatever it takes to ensure justice is done within the context of the law, regardless of the personalities involved.\u201d\n\nHushpuppi, an Instagram influencer, was arrested in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in June 2020, and was extradited to the U.S. where most of the victims of his alleged fraudulent activities are based.\n\nHaving spent about one year in custody maintaining his innocence, he later pleaded guilty to multi-million-dollar fraud charges filed against him by the American government.\n\nRELATED\n\nUS Court Issues Arrest Warrant For Abba Kyari\n\nMoney Laundering: Hushpuppi Pleads Guilty, Risks 20 Years\u2019 Imprisonment\n\nIn the process, an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) indicted Kyari, a Deputy Commissioner of Police, leading to a warrant of arrest issued against him by a U.S. magistrate judge, Otis Wright.\n\nThis led to Kyari\u2019s suspension from the police and from his position as the Head of Intelligence Response Team (IRT) by the Police Service Commission in August last year.\n\nSix months after his suspension, the AGF told Channels Television on Monday that the Nigerian government was working with the U.S. on the cases against Kyari and Hushpuppi.\n\nHe stressed that issues that have to do with criminality and enforcement of laws associated with crimes and offences could have local and international colorations.\n\nExtradition Likely\n\nMalami described Hushpuppi\u2019s case as one involving multiple jurisdictions \u2013 Nigeria, the U.S., and the UAE.\n\n\u201cWithin the context of the international comity of nations, as it relates to the prosecution of cases, the international community is indeed collaborating and providing the necessary support for the purpose of ensuring that justice is done to the case with the peculiarities of the matter taken into consideration.\n\n\u201cSo, what I am saying, in essence, is that internationally and locally, all hands are on deck,\u201d said the minister who commended the existing collaboration between Nigeria and the U.S. in tackling criminality.\n\n\u201cSo, Nigeria is, indeed, doing the needful by way of supporting what America is doing for the purpose of ensuring that the cases are tried accordingly within the context of the American aspect of it, and then eventually if there is need for local prosecution, nothing as well stops it.\u201d\n\nAccording to the AGF, both countries have made progress in terms of joint investigations and the outcomes, although no prosecution is happening yet in Nigeria.\n\nHe restated that the government would not rule out the possibility of consideration for the extradition of Kyari, as there have been exchanges of correspondence in that regard as well as investigation and associated matters.\n\nAsked if the suspended police officer was guilty of the offences he was accused of, Malami responded, \u201cYou cannot find someone guilty but perhaps, the reasonable ground for suspicion can be established and will translate to prosecution that will eventually translate to it (being found guilty).\n\n\u201cReasonable ground for suspicion has been established and that will eventually translate to the possibility of prosecution and eventual conviction if, indeed, at the end of the day one is adjudged guilty by a court of law.\u201d",

In 2015, we were in a deep hole. In 2023, we will be in an even much deeper hole than in 2015,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThose struggling to be president, I hope they understand that the problems that they are going to face are multiples of the problems that were faced in 2015. All of us have to be ready for difficult decisions and if they are taken, we are all going to pay for them.\n\n\u201cBut the solution is not for all of us to jump into politics. This country needs good politicians. It needs imams, pastors, and bishops who are going to stand up and remind them (politicians) of the fear of God.\n\n\u201cIt needs technocrats who are going to critique their policies. It needs traditional rulers who are going to speak as the conscience of the people. Everyone has a role to play and we should try to play that role to the best of our ability.\u201d\n\nThe former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor also called on Nigerians to pray for good leaders at all levels. He asked Nigerians to elect leaders who are competent to deliver the dividends of democracy to the benefit of the people.\n\nWhile warning the people against voting for people who woo them with money and other greek gifts, Sanusi advised that the electorates should choose leaders based on merits\n\n\u201cI think the most important thing is that we should continue to pray for our country that whoever emerges as president, governors, senators, leadership at all levels, that we get good leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should also remind ourselves as citizens that we owe it to ourselves because we know that this country deserves better than we have been given.\u201d",

          "title": "Queues Return to Lagos, Abuja, PH as Wrong Fuel Is Withdrawn from Circulation",
          "text": "Following the supply of a wrong specification of petrol in some parts of the country, and its subsequent removal in compliance with a government order, long queues have once more returned to petrol stations in Abuja, parts of Lagos, and some other states.\n\nIndications emerged on Monday that the current challenge being faced in the supply of petrol in some states was as a result of the directive to withdraw adulterated products from circulation.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the shortage of supply from the sole importer, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), had worsened the situation.\n\nIn Abuja and surrounding states, majority of filling stations were shut and motorists spent hours in the sun struggling to buy from the few that were open, and causing serious traffic jams in parts of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nThe Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) blamed the shortage of supply on issues surrounding the presence of bad fuel in the market as well as undersupply from the national oil company.\n\nThe particular cargo with the product was said to have high sulphur, while marketers were advised not to sell to consumers, with at least 100 million litres already in circulation at the time the bad fuel was discovered.\n\nIn addition, it was learnt that the queues returned partly because the gap, which existed when depot owners started hoarding products before the announcement of retention of subsidy by the federal government, had not smoothened. This has affected the lifting of the products to, especially Abuja and other parts of the north from Lagos, THISDAY gathered.\n\nThe federal government had backtracked on its plan to remove fuel subsidy in mid-2022, citing the need to protect the poor and vulnerable.\n\nMany of the fuel stations visited, including Eterna and Enyo on Olusegun Obasanjo Way in Wuse as well as Total on Herbert Macaulay, did not have product and more than half of the fuel pumps at the NNPC mega station in the area were not operational.\n\nSouth-West Zonal Chairman of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Mr. Dele Tajudeen, who confirmed the existence of contaminated fuel in circulation while speaking on a national television yesterday, absolved the organisation of any blame. Tajudeen explained that that IPMAN members had suffered severe losses and may ask for damages from the authorities.\n\nAccording to him, members of his group were supplied with bad products, which had put them in serious trouble, as they had to repair vehicles for their customers whose cars were impacted by the bad product.\n\nStressing that fuel station owners are now rejecting the bad product, he explained that the group was working to resolve the issue amicably with NNPC\u2019s subsidiary, the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC).\n\n\u201cWe need to be compensated, but we don\u2019t want to put the masses in another crisis if we resort to going on strike, demanding compensation because we know people are already in a deep economic problem,\u201d he said.\n\nThe IPMAN official assured that the issue of bad fuel in circulation was already being investigated, stating that Managing Director of PPMC, Mr Isiaku Abdullahi, was intervening in the matter.\n\n\u201cUntil the investigation is concluded, I don\u2019t want to comment more, so as not to pre-empt it, but Mr Abdullahi is making efforts to ensure that all the depots are revived. He is doing a holistic rehabilitation of the depots,\u201d he said.\n\nTajudeen added, \u201cThis (fuel scarcity) is as a result of short supply from the NNPC and, of course, the private depots around Lagos. One of the major reasons for the scarcity is that the five NNPC depots in southwest as at today are not loading products.\n\n\u201cAlso, we witnessed the issue of bad product and I must use this opportunity to tell the masses that it is not from our members. As a matter of fact we suffered serious loss of cash and integrity because we received the product from the private depots.\n\n\u201cAs I am telling you, we have run into millions of naira in losses as a result of this bad product. So, the station owners are not responsible for these product.\u201d\n\nTajudeen commended Abdullahi for his efforts at ameliorating the situation, describing him as proactive. He said most of their customers had been complaining, prompting them to carry out repairs, replacement of the bad fuels and bearing the reputational damage caused by the situation.\n\nHe pointed out, \u201cThe situation is not too good because of non-availability of this product, coupled with this bad product that came in the last two weeks. The products are being rejected now. So, because of that, there\u2019s shortage of product.\u201d\n\nOn the rising cost of diesel, Tajudeen stated that while the product had gone to N401 without the logistics costs, petrol has gone to N156 without transport costs, saying it will then hit N162 to N163 before it gets do the stations. \u201cOur profit margin has been eroded completely,\u201d he lamented.\n\nBut he argued that government could not leave pricing in private hands because it will \u201cstrangulate the masses\u201d, adding that the international crude oil prices does not necessarily tally with the rise in prices in the country.\n\nA top NNPC official who spoke with THISDAY on the matter, stated that whatever the situation, it was the responsibility of the new downstream/midstream authority to speak on the matter.\n\nThe source said, \u201cThey (the queues) will disappear. It\u2019s just a small supply gap. People are bound to make all sorts of speculations, but if the speculation continues, the downstream/midstream authority will come up with a statement to clarify whatever is happening.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a civil advocacy group yesterday called on the federal government to take a decisive action against those alleged to be hoarding petrol in the country, and subjection unbearable hardship on the masses.\n\nThe group, in a letter to the Minister of State for Petroleum and Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), specifically accused members of independent marketers of petroleum products of hoarding fuel, which according to them, was responsible for the long queues at fuel stations across the country, particularly the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and its environs.\n\nThe letter dated February 7, 2022, and signed by the group\u2019s Convener, Mr. Deji Adeyanju, was titled, \u201cPersistent Hoarding of Fuel By Independent Marketers: A Call for Urgent Action.\u201d\n\nIt said, \u201cAs you may already know, in recent months independent marketers of petroleum products have engaged in speculative acts of hoarding petroleum products, particularly PMS, in a bid to criminally increase the prices, cause artificial scarcity and plunge the country into widespread economic chaos.\n\n\u201cFor example, filing stations across the nation\u2019s capital are littered with long queues of vehicles seeking to purchase fuel, while the independent marketers ensured that their filing stations were shut for the day by 6pm.\u201d\n\nThe group, however, lamented that the regulators had not deemed it necessary to call these independent marketers to order, as they had continued to allow them take advantage of Nigerians.\n\nThe convener expressed pain that the development was causing excruciating pain on the people, adding that an artificial fuel scarcity is the last thing they should worry about.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIt is equally important to point out that causing artificial scarcity resulting in economic sabotage is a criminal offence under our laws.\n\n\u201cThe federal government must, therefore, put a halt to the ball watching and take urgent steps to address the economic sabotage, especially as there is no reason for artificial scarcity at this time.\n\n\u201cSequel to the foregoing, we call on the federal government to arrest the offending marketers, shut their filling stations and bring this on-going economic sabotage to an end. Nigerians deserves to buy fuel at an accessible rate anytime.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Addeh and Alex Enumah in Abuja",
          "summary": "This has affected the lifting of the products to, especially Abuja and other parts of the north from Lagos, THISDAY gathered.\nThe IPMAN official assured that the issue of bad fuel in circulation was already being investigated, stating that Managing Director of PPMC, Mr Isiaku Abdullahi, was intervening in the matter.\n\u201cAlso, we witnessed the issue of bad product and I must use this opportunity to tell the masses that it is not from our members.\n\u201cAs I am telling you, we have run into millions of naira in losses as a result of this bad product.\nHe pointed out, \u201cThe situation is not too good because of non-availability of this product, coupled with this bad product that came in the last two weeks.",

          "title": "Nigeria: APC Leaders in Search of Consensus Candidate at Convention",
          "text": "With the February 26 National Convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) inching closer, leaders and stakeholders of the party, particularly, governors, ministers, and members of the National Assembly, are searching for a consensus candidate that would lead the party to the general election in 2023.\n\nA reliable source told THISDAY that President Muhammadu Buhari had consonant views, and that he actually handed down the option of a consensus candidate for national chairman before jetting out to Ethiopia to attend the African Union (AU) meeting last week. The president returned to the country yesterday.\n\nAmong those being considered for the post of national chairman, a source further hinted, included former Minister of State for Mines and Steel, Bawa Bwari from Niger State, Saliu Mustapha from Kwara State, and Senator Tanko Al-Makura from Nasarawa State.\n\nThese three prospective candidates were allegedly mentioned repeatedly by many of the major stakeholders of the party as suitable to lead the APC to a successful election in 2023.\n\nFollowing media reports that APC was considering fielding former President Goodluck Jonathan as its presidential candidate in 2023, the ruling party said defectors to the party, including Jonathan, would be given waiver to contest.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the APC stakeholders were informed that in their search for a consensus candidate for national chairman, \u201cThey should put into considerations factors, like energy, credibility, experience, and ability to drive and sustain the winning streak of the party in the next general election.\u201d\n\nAccording to a northern governor, who pleaded anonymity, \u201cThe president had informed us that the only way he would be part of the much talked about idea of a consensus national chairman is for the stakeholders to ensure that whosoever that will emerge meets certain irreducible leadership criteria, chief of which are character and credibility factors.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the ruling party was considering adopting the consensus option to avoid the crisis that could follow the election of a national chairman, bearing in mind that the national convention was around the corner.\n\nThe source explained that though \u201cthe office of the national chairman has not been officially zoned to any of the geopolitical zones in the north, in principle, the party may yield to the agitations of the stakeholders of the party from the North-central zone.\u201d\n\nThe source explained further that at several meetings of the APC governors with the party\u2019s National Assembly members as well as members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), the three aspirants from the North-central had been consistently mentioned.\n\nBwari was Minister of State for Mines and Steel from 2015 to 2019. He was also Chief Whip in the House of Representatives from 1999 to 2007.\n\nMustapha was Deputy National Chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive change (CPC), Buhari\u2019s legacy party before the merger that birthed APC. He was also Organising Secretary of the Conference of Nigerian Political Parties (CNPP) at some point.\n\nAl-Makura, a serving senator, was governor of Nasarawa State.\n\nWhile Mustapha and Al-Makura had long declared their intentions and embarked on rigorous campaigns across the country, Bwari was yet to officially declare his intention at the time of filing this report.\n\nMustapha and Al-Makura also appear to enjoy the full and open backing of their governors, Mallam AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq and Abdulahi Sule, respectively.\n\nTHISDAY was told that the stakeholders might have drafted the three names for possible security screening to avoid selecting anyone with the baggage of controversies as national chairman.\n\nBarring any further delays, the outcome of the security profiling of the three might form the basis of the choice that would be sent to the president early next week.\n\nAccording to the source, the security profiling was discretely undertaken to avoid any embarrassment to the ruling party.\n\nThough it was gathered that two former governors \u2013 Abduallahi Yari of Zamfara and Modu Sheriff of Borno State \u2013 were still protesting adoption of a consensus option, the source said their protest might not hold water since the president had bought into the idea.\n\nIn the same vein, two aspirants for national secretary from Anambra State, Ambassador Jerry Sunny Ugokwe and Nze Chidi Duru, may emerge. The implication is that the office of National Secretary may have been zoned to the South-east.\n\nMeanwhile, following media reports and on-going permutations that APC was considering fielding Jonathan as its presidential candidate in 2023, the ruling party reiterated that defectors to the party would be given waiver to contest.\n\nJonathan had of late been paying visits to Buhari in Aso Rock, and holding private discussions.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY yesterday by telephone, National Secretary of APC\u2019s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Senator James Akpanudoedehe, reiterated that anyone that defected to the party, by virtue of the December Resolution, would be given a waiver to contest, including the former president. Though Akpanudoedehe said he was not aware if the former president was planning to come to the party.\n\nAkpanudoedehe said, \u201cGo back to my former reaction. I cannot bring out that topic again on the front burner. I cannot bring up that matter, because I actually answered that question about Goodluck Jonathan and I told Nigerians that anybody that comes into the party by the resolution of December has the right to contest.\n\n\u201cI am not aware that the caretaker committee has endorsed him; I am not aware that the caretaker has endorsed anybody. I\u2019m not aware that he (Jonathan) has been wooed to join the party. I am not privy to that.\u201d\n\nChuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, on Monday, disclosed that a prima facie case had been established against suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police Abba Kyari over allegations levelled against him by the United States government in the fraud case involving an internet fraudster, Ramon Abbas, popularly called Hushpuppi.\n\nMalami, who spoke during an interview on Channels Television, noted that multiple jurisdictions were involved in the matter, including the United Arab Emirates, America, and Nigeria. He added that though investigations were still on-going, the possibility of extraditing the officer was high.\n\nThe attorney general also claimed that the number of convictions the administration had so far secured in the fight against corruption clearly established that a recent report by Transparency International had no basis.\n\nMalami explained, \u201cThere are lots of considerations that are on-going, including the possibility of extradition and that is why the collaboration element comes in. There could be a need for extradition.\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned, parties are discussing; we are collaborating and there are exchanges of correspondence. Reasonable ground of suspicion has been established and that will eventually translate into prosecution and eventual conviction.\n\n\u201cThe position now is that there are prima facie grounds, reasonable grounds for suspicion have been considered from the perspective of prosecution, from the perspective of extradition if the need for it arises.\u201d\n\nMalami also addressed the question of terrorism sponsorship and assured Nigerians that nothing would be hidden in terms of names, associated facts, and circumstances.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWork is in progress and nobody has been taken to custody arbitrarily. In a couple of weeks, these people will be charged to court. In a number of weeks, we will have something tangible. I am a man of honour, not out of pride, but when I make promises, I keep to them.\u201d\n\nMalami rejected the Corruption Perceptions Index 2021, which ranked Nigeria 154 out of 180 countries and territories, putting the country back five places from the rank of 149 in 2020. He said before the President Muhammadu Buhari administration, Nigeria had only about 103 convictions in corruption cases between 2013 and 2014. He said the number had moved to 2,000 convictions in 2021 alone in cases brought by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nThe attorney general stated, \u201cToday, as of the end of 2021, EFCC has recorded over 2,000 convictions. So, if you are talking of the year in, year out empirical evidence as it relates to the performance of our institutions, one single institution (EFCC) has established the point that there is no basis by which Transparency International report can stand.\n\n\u201cWhen you juxtapose the report of the Transparency International with that of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), which is more universal and are the best for assessment.\n\n\u201cAs far as we are concerned, when you are talking of Transparency International compared with United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), then, the answer as far as we are concerned is UNDOC stands clear.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the government of President Muhammadu Buhari has been commended and rated as the champion of anti-corruption established a point that there is no basis, no foundation, no justifiable ground and, indeed, to the standing platform upon which Transparency International could stand. We have been acknowledged to be doing very well by United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).\u201d\n\nThe minister insisted that the fight against corruption could only be assessed by the number of prosecutions and convictions, saying the fact that EFCC could records, over 2,000 convictions within a year showed that the present administration has done well in the fight against corruption.\n\nMalami also dwelt on the alleged delay in the prosecution of high profile cases, saying, \u201cAs far as the present administration is concerned, delay of cases does not arise. If you are looking at it from the perspective of the legislative framework, we are enforcing provisions of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, as in day-in-day-out prosecution of cases.\u201d\n\nCiting the the case of former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal, Malami stated that once the matter had been subjected to court, the delay in the prosecution could not be blamed on the presidency, adding that it is exclusively a judiciary affair.\n\n\u201cWe have taken steps to provide the legislative framework; we have taken steps in due diligence of prosecution of cases, which as a result of multiple convictions within a span of a year, is a clear pointer that we have indeed promised and delivered,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, on the case of former EFCC Chairman, Ibrahim Magu, Malami said, \u201cIt\u2019s a work-in-progress,\u201d addeding, \u201cThe report of investigation, having been received, it is only logical to allow the agents of the government to do what they are supposed to do for the purpose of arriving at a certain position.\n\n\u201cThe idea of political persecution does not arise but due process. We allow the institutions to do the needful with a view to arriving at a final decision.\u201d\n\nOn money recovered at an Ikoyi building some years ago, Malami said, \u201cI have to refer back to record,\u201d stressing that, all the monies that had been forfeited to the federal government were part of the funds used to support the budget.\n\nMalami stated, \u201cIn our budgets of 2020, 2021, and 2022, we have a component of budget servicing that relates to recovered assets. So, if there has been a final forfeiture order relating to that money, it may have been applied to service the budget.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the failure to disclose names of those allegedly sponsoring terrorism, he said, \u201cPrima facie case or reasonable suspicion seems to have been established, eventually, prosecution will take place,\u201d assuring that nothing would be hidden in terms of names, associated facts, and circumstances.\n\nHe said, \u201dWork is in progress and nobody has been taken to custody arbitrarily. In a couple of weeks, these people will be charged to court. In a number of weeks, we will have something tangible. I am a man of honour, not out of pride, but when I make promises, I keep to them.\u201d\n\nThe issue of Sunday Igboho and Nnamdi Kanu also came up and the minister said, \u201cWe will allow the law of the country, where he (Igboho) is being detained to take its natural course. Perhaps, thereafter bring him back after the conclusion of his trial over there to face the Nigerian law that has been breached.\n\n\u201cWe are not interfering with his on-going prosecution at the foreign land. A political solution can only be considered after the conclusion of his trial at the Benin Republic. We cannot rule out any possibility in terms of prosecution. In our laws, there are lots of possibilities.\u201d\n\nMalami refrained from debating the Electoral law, saying it would be premature for him to comment on it, as a copy of the Amended Electoral Bill only got to his office yesterday (Monday).\n\nHe explained, \u201cI have not taken steps to review the content of what has been presented for consideration. So, it is premature and pre-emptive for me at this moment to arrive at any conclusion, taking into consideration that I have not seen what it contains and analysed it in accordance with the constitution.\n\n\u201cCertainly, if I am not satisfied and if I am of the opinion that it is against the public interest and against the dictates of the democratic process, I will advise accordingly. One thing I can tell you is that, we are all interested in leaving behind a legacy \u2013 a lasting democracy \u2013 a democracy that accommodates the collective interests of the Nigerian state and advances the national interest,\u201d he said.\n\nWale Igbindade",
