          "text": ".\n\nBy Adeola Badru\n\nThe crisis in the All Progressives Congress (APC), Oyo State took a turn for the worse on Wednesday, as major stakeholders unanimously rejected Isaac Omodewu as Chairman of the party in the state.\n\nArising from a joint meeting, leaders of the two major zones in the State, Ibadan Main City and Ibadan Outer City, made up of 11 out of the 33 local government areas in the state condemned the inauguration of Mr. Isaac Omodewu as the state chairman, adding that the congress that produced him was flawed and had earlier been rejected by the National Caretaker Committee of the party.\n\nThe leaders of the two zones also known as the Progressives Foundation Forum which has the largest voting population in the state said it aligned with the other five zonal leaders which had come up with a harmonised list.\n\nThey said in the harmonised list which was submitted to the National secretariat of the party, Alhaji Abubakar Adejare Gbadamosi was chairman while other positions had also been agreed upon on a zonal basis, during one of the several harmonisation meetings of the zonal leaders and other stakeholders in the party.\n\nThe two zones with a voting strength of about 57 percent are the most populous zones in Oyo State.\n\nEarlier in the week, other major stakeholders of the party had also condemned the inauguration of Omodewu.\n\nThe aggrieved members of the party which included Minister for Youths and Sports, Chief Sunday Dare and former Minister for Communications, Alhaji Adebayo Shittu, Senator Olufemi Lanlehin, Senator Soji Akanbi, Senator Fatai Buhari representing Oyo North Senatorial District, Chief Adebayo Adelabu, gubernatorial candidate of the party in the 2019 election, Alhaji Fatai Ibikunle, Chairman of the Nigeria Lotteries Regulatory Commission, Professor Adeolu Akande, Chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission, Dr Ismail Adewusi, Post Master General of the Federation, Hon Zach Adedeji Adelabu, Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Sugar Development Council, Engr Joseph Tegbe, a gubernatorial aspirant, Dr Azeez Adedutan, former Commissioner of Health, and Hon. Wale Murphy Olatunji, Chairman, National Centre for Technology Management (NACETEM), stated that the inauguration of Omodewu is a threat to the party in Oyo State as the enthronement of a minority group on a majority cannot stand.\n\n\u201cIt will only lead the party to electoral disaster in Oyo State,\u201d they warned.\n\nThe stakeholders said there was no congress on which Omodewu could be returned as state Chairman, wondering the basis on which the National Secretariat could have issued Omodewu with a \u201cCertificate of Return.\u201d\n\nThey vowed to use every legal means to return the party to the majority of its members who overwhelmingly returned Alhaji Abubakar Adejare Gbadamosi as State Chairman of the party.\n\n\u201cThe detail of what transpired on the purported State Congress of the party in Oyo State is an open book. At the stakeholders meeting held at the National Secretariat on November 4, 2021, the National Secretary declared that the purported Congress conducted on October 30 at the Liberty Stadium, Ibadan \u201cwas held in error\u201d and without the knowledge nor approval of the National Chairman of the party.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe apologized to members for the error and the meeting resolved to complete the Consensus election of a State Chairman which had produced Alhaji Gbadamosi as State Chairman.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe purported return of Omodewu is the climax of a reign of impunity which a tiny and minority section of the party in Oyo State in collaboration with outside forces had sought to impose on the party ahead of the 2023 general elections. As such illegalities have always been, it will definitely fail.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe stakeholders resolved to use every legal means to reclaim the mandate given to Alhaji Abu Gbadamosi-led State Executive and establish a party leadership that represents the wish of majority members of the party in Oyo State.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we are witnessing is a temporary distraction that would test our commitment to democratic principles and the rule of law. We will not fail the test.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are attempts to exploit sentiment to rally support for the illegitimate Omodewu executive. We commend our members who have spurned the early morning visits and calls to woo and hoodwink them to support the illegitimate executive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe clandestine visit, calls and blackmail will continue. We are convinced that our history of commitment to democratic principles which have always been on display in Oyo State will make all such nefarious efforts come to nought.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe implore all members of the party in the state to remain calm and law-abiding. Every legal means would be employed to return the party to the overwhelming majority of members who have expressed their preferred leadership through the democratic process enshrined in the Constitution of the party.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Then you begin to think is it that we have no youth in Nigeria that is worthy of being celebrated. So we take up that and decide to start a bursary scheme for youths.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis bursary scheme isn\u2019t just an ordinary scheme but we said we want to celebrate the best of the best among the youth. So the minimum criteria is to have a GP of 3.5 and what we\u2019ve seen today is so pleasing, I\u2019m so happy beyond words because in our universities, the highest GP is 4.0 and we have some people here that scored 3.5 or above and in some other schools, the GP is 5.0 and we have people that scored 4.0 and above, youths in Oyo State, despite all the bad news we\u2019ve been hearing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis youth initiative is not the very first because the purpose of this is to build youths who can face any challenge in the Future. We are the first to partner with the technical university and sponsored a hundred youths to different courses.\u201d\n\n\u201cCourses that are so much in demand and every year we\u2019ve had an annual Jamb programme and this is not just about distributing forms, what we do is to open our portal for interested applicants and we do a mock exam to select the very best that have a good chance of passing the jamb and outside the mock exam.\n\n\u201cWe have a free tutorial to prepare them for the Jamb and after the Jamb is done, we have a scholarship as well for the best performing students in each of the local government that we cover to attend the university of their choice, we sponsor them throughout the years of their course of study. So we have several programmes just to showcase the youths that are sound and very knowledgeable, that we can be very proud of.\u201d\n\nAdekanbi, who said not less that 120 applicants benefited from the bursary said: \u201cWhat we do is, we announced the 5 million budget grant for the bursary at the rate of 20,000 naira each per beneficiary.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got 1000 applications and of the 1000, we have about 120 successful applications and those are the people here. They are here live in person, we have validated them with their IDs. I don\u2019t even know anyone of them and that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t want to know anyone of them, all I want to know is that you\u2019re excellent and have something worthy to be celebrated because some of them are very brilliant, they have challenges and that\u2019s why we are doing this.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe never asked anybody if they belong to the APC which I\u2019m a member, you can be at any party, we don\u2019t care about religion, even your university or your course. All we ask is are you excellent, have you scored 3.5 and above then you\u2019re qualified for this benefits of this scheme,\u201d he said\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Ahmed Idris Wase, Friday, gave a highlight on key issues that were considered in the course of the 1999 constitutional review.\n\nHe said the issues ranged from local government administration autonomy, the legislature, judicial reform, state creation, state police, devolution of powers, women and vulnerable groups, strengthening of institutions, good governance, political parties and electoral matters, traditional institution, federal capital territory administration, fundamental human rights and national security.\n\nSpeaking at a National Assembly joint committee retreat with the state assembly speakers and clerks on the review of the 1999 constitution, Friday, in Abuja, Wase also said that the House received a total of 178 memoranda and 1,980 recommendations.\n\nHe said \u201cAfter our inauguration as a Committee, and in order to make ourselves an accessible platform for Nigerians, the Committee called for the submission of memoranda from 17th November to 9th December 2020. The general public responded overwhelmingly and a total of One Hundred and Seventy-Eight (178) memoranda with One Thousand, Nine Hundred and Eighty (1,980) specific recommendations were received.\n\n\u201cBetween May and June of 2021, the Committee held public hearings across the Country\u2019s Six (6) Geopolitical Zones. During the hearings, some of the issues canvassed by Nigerians were aggregated into thematic areas and Members sponsored bills in line with peoples\u2019 aspirations.\n\n\u201cThese thematic areas include issues bothering on Local Government Administration and Autonomy, the Legislature, Judicial Reform, State Creation, State Police, Devolution of Powers, Women and Vulnerable Groups, Strengthening of Institutions, Good Governance, Political Parties and Electoral Matters, Traditional Institution, Federal Capital Territory Administration, Fundamental Human Rights and National Security.\u201d\n\nWase who is also a co-chairman of the Senate and House joint committee revealed that out of 62 bills that were presented to the House, only 26 were recommended for harmonization with the Senate.\n\nHe said there was no preconceived notion in the exercise, urging the members of the committee to give their best to the clarion call.\n\n\u201cDuring this first batch of the review exercise, the Committee in the House of Representatives considered sixty-two (62) Bills out of which twenty-six (26) Bills were recommended for harmonization with the Senate. Of the 62 bills, eight (8) bills were rejected, twenty-five (25) Bills were retained with modifications and the consideration of 3 bills were deferred.\n\n\u201cWe have worked tirelessly to engage, negotiate, debate, lobby, review and persuade in order to reflect the various competing and contrasting aspirations of Nigerians of different leanings and backgrounds. One thing we are sure of is that no one has been left behind. We have aggregated all manners of proposals, sorted them out to meet the constitutional guidelines and criteria and have ultimately harmonized positions after lengthy debates and majority votes on several critical issues.\n\n\u201cWe have no preconceived positions on anything. We believe that we must do whatever is necessary to provide a platform for Nigerians to air their views, give their positions and canvass whatever they feel would make our country better, and make governance more efficient and successful.\n\n\u201cWe also are cognizant of the fact that we cannot work in isolation if we must achieve concrete results and deliver on the promises we have made to Nigerians. Whatever we have done will still go through the State Houses of Assembly for their own input and vote. Hence the need for this collaborative synergy which will give us the opportunity to engage, consult and harmonize for a smoother, tidier and more efficient Constitutional review\n\n\u201cI urge us all to remember that we act as representatives of Nigerians. As such, as a rule of engagement, may we put Nigeria at the front burner and not our personal interest or sectional interest\u201d, he said.\n\nIn his remarks also, the Deputy Senate President and Chairman of the Senate Committee on the constitution review, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege said that the retreat was a group to harness views from every stakeholder.\n\n\u201cAs this retreat provides us with an auspicious opportunity to interface, reflect and engage as partners working for the peace, unity and development of our dear country, Nigeria; the requirement of section 9 of the Constitution positions State legislatures as distinct and critical partners in Constitution alteration.\n\n\u201cSurely, and without a doubt, the success of this process largely depends on your support and partnership. Going forward, after the passage of the proposals by the National Assembly in a fortnight, you will be the pillar on which this work will be anchored. That is why it is prudent to meet with you today and update you on the progress we have made after the public hearings that were held in 12 centres across the six geo-political zones of the country, of which you fully participated.\n\n\u201cThe proposed amendments in the bills we have shared with you set out institutional and legal reforms, which together with sufficient political will, will help to strengthen institutions of governance, provide for accountability and transparency in governance; and create an independent judicial system that would ensure effective administration of justice in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe overarching rationale for the amendments contained in these bills are thus predicated on the need to amongst others: strengthen the legislature\u2019s authority to enable it to serve as an effective pillar of checks and balance to the executive; strengthen independent constitutional bodies; create and strengthen a culture of good governance; address the issues of corruption, revenue leakages and unbridled government spending.\n\n\u201cI assure you most sincerely that our work up to this point has been guided strictly by best legislative practise, integrity, open-mindedness, and patriotism.\n\n\u201cTherefore encourage you, irrespective of political leanings and other affiliations to abide by the same standards while making your contributions. I know it is the desire of every Nigerian that this process will bring positive transformations to our country. We should all leverage this retreat to bequeath to our nation a constitution that speaks to the yearnings and aspirations of every Nigerian\u201d, he said.\n\nOn his part, the Speaker of the Bauchi State House of Assembly and Chairman Conference of Speakers of State Legislatures of Nigeria, Rt. Hon. Abubakar Suleiman called on the 36 State Houses of Assembly to support the identified amendments in the constitution.\n\n\u201cWe have the onerous responsibility of altering the Constitution to meet the needs and yearnings of our people and these we must do to the admiration of the citizens.\n\n\u201cWe are being confronted with certain challenges in the country that borders on insecurity, economy, devolution of powers, weak institutions etc. The Conference of Speakers subscribes to the calls that the review of the Constitution is one of the legislative actions at our disposal that could be exploited to address these challenges.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, call on both the distinguished members of the National Assembly and the States Houses of Assembly to take this opportunity of yet another alteration exercise to address many agitated issues such as restructuring, devolution of powers community and State Police, etc, etc.\n\n\u201cConference of Speakers of State Legislators of Nigeria has been engaged on behalf of the State Houses Assembly, but we want to respectfully call on the National Assembly to endeavour to carry along with other major stakeholders like the Presidency and the Executive Governors at the State level in the ongoing amendment exercise.\n\n\u201cWe are particular about the executive arms at both tiers of government due to the previous experience in reluctance or selective considerations for presidential assent by the Presidency and challenges of implementation at the state level.\n\n\u201cThis call is born out of genuine concern for the effective accomplishment of the noble goals of the exercise and consideration of our rigorous efforts and scarce resources committed to the exercise\u201d, he said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".\n\n\u2026 highlights role of women and girls in science\n\nBy Ebunoluwa Sessou\n\nAs the world marks International Day for Women and Girls in Science, the Association of Professional Women Engineers of Nigeria, APWEN, has called for collective efforts to highlight the role of women in science and technology in solving water-related challenges.\n\nThe Association also harp on creating awareness and earning a commitment from decision-makers and the public for this issue that affect the lives of millions of people particularly, the disadvantaged.\n\nSpeaking on the theme of the year 2022, \u201cEquity, Diversity, and Inclusion: Water Unites Us\u201d, the President APWEN, Dr Elizabeth Eterigho explained that, the Day was adopted by the United Nations in order to promote full and equal access and participation for women and girls in science.\n\n\u201cIn order to achieve full and equal access to science and participation for women and girls, and also to further achieve gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, the United Nations at the General Assembly in 2015, had to declare the February 11, as the International Day of Women and Girls in Science.\n\n\u201cScience and gender equality are both paramount for the achievement of the development goals, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Over the past thirty-nine years, APWEN has made significant strides in encouraging and engaging women and young girls in science.\n\n\u201cA significant gender gap is visible at all levels of science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines all over the world. Though women have made tremendous progress towards increasing their participation in higher education, they are still under-represented in these fields.\n\n\u201cIn closing this gap, the Association of Professional Women Engineers of Nigeria (APWEN), a non-profit, non-governmental, educational, and service organization in her thirty-nine years of existence, has been an advocate for inspiring young girls into science through her numerous programs such as invent it build it, a catch them young programs, town and gown, fashioned to increase the employability of the young graduates.\n\n\u201cIt is not surprising that this year\u2019s theme is coiled round what is common to all of us; water, the SDGs 6; which is clean water and sanitation; aimed to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.\n\n\u201cWater, Sanitation, Hygiene, WASH, and Ocean issues are at the core of sustainable development because they are closely connected to several key global challenges such as energy, food security, biodiversity, health, climate change, among others.\n\n\u201cThe United Nation recognized the role of women and girls in science, not only as beneficiaries but as key agents to effecting any change, including that of accelerating the achievement of \u201cClean Water and Sanitation for all\u201d.\n\n\u201cWater is the only thing that unites irrespective of genders, ethnic, socio-cultural and religious backgrounds. However, its availability is scarce.\n\n\u201cAccording to the United Nations\u2019 report, one in three people do not have access to safe drinking water globally, two out of five people do not have a basic hand-washing facility with soap and water, and more than 673 million people still practise open defecation.\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has shown the importance of sanitation, hygiene and adequate access to clean water in order to prevent diseases.\n\n\u201cThe World Health Organization reported that handwashing is one of the most effective actions to reduce spread or prevent infections. Yet billions of people still lack safe water sanitation, coupled with inadequate funding for water\u201d, she said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "2023: APC, PDP in zoning dilemma",
          "text": "By Wilfred Eya\n\nThe permutations over which zone should produce the president of Nigeria in 2023 have become a major issue of public discourse. Among various ethnic configurations, political parties and power brokers, zoning is unarguably the central issue as the nation inches toward the next general elections.\n\nWhile the 17 Southern governors have demanded that the region produces the next President, their colleagues from the 19 Northern states have warned that no region can threaten them over the zoning formula.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nAlthough few Northern governors and gladiators have called on political parties to produce a Southerner as President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s successor, others insist that a Northern candidate should still emerge in 2023. And the ding-dong continues. But unlike the PDP, APC initially hinted at zoning its presidential ticket to the South even though it did not state which part of the geopolitical zone will be favoured to produce the party\u2019s flag-bearer.\n\nAt the moment, certain variables seem to be thawing the earlier position of the APC to go down South. So, in the APC and PDP, there is an impasse over which zone should produce President Buhari\u2019s successor when he leaves office in 2023. Judging by all political calculations, it is difficult to predict the outcome as the two major political parties, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) are currently in a fix over which geo-political zone they should give their presidential ticket in next year\u2019s general elections.\n\nBoth parties are battling to wriggle through the zoning conundrum at a minimal cost to their political fortunes in 2023. They are confronted with major but different hurdles though. For the APC, it is being challenged by a moral burden to still retain power in the North after eight years of Buhari\u2019s administration. The President is from North West.\n\nChieftains of the APC pushing for a president from the South insist that the party could not turn around to zone the Presidency to the North after the same region would have ruled the country for eight years in 2023. But again, the headache to the ruling party is that power may slip off its hands if the major opposition party picks its candidate from the North, which is believed to have a more voting population than the South.\n\nFor the PDP, the assumption is that giving its ticket to a Northern candidate seems more attractive as that may be the surest way of recapturing power from the APC if the ruling party zones its presidency Southwards. The PDP also has the moral burden of thinking northwards after President Buhari\u2019s tenure but the counter argument is that the North did not complete its eight years after late Musa Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s death.\n\nProponents of this position, especially those from the North, insist it would be unfair for the South to produce the presidential candidate in 2023 given the fact that since 1999, the South was in power for 13 years out of the 16 years that PDP held sway, while the North governed for just three years.\n\nBased on the above calculations, the APC and PDP are treading with caution because where any of the two parties zones its ticket would have a lot of implications on its chances of winning the election. Before the obvious reality confronting the APC, of course the presumption in many quarters was that after President Buhari, power would naturally come down South following the gentleman understanding between gladiators from the North and South of the ruling party. But considering emerging political exigencies, the APC seems to be developing cold feet and being more cautious on zoning the presidency to the South because of the consequences should the PDP decide to pick its candidate from the North.\n\nFollowing that, there are indications that the APC is currently in a dilemma over the zoning of the 2023 presidency. The permutation is that although the party is looking southwards to pick its presidential candidate, there is still the possibility that it could throw the race open for both Northern and Southern aspirants at the end. It is a strategy geared toward ensuring that the party retains the presidency in 2023.\n\nIn the same way, as an opposition party hungry to recapture power, the dominant argument among critical observers is that the best bet for the PDP is to go up North for its presidential candidate in the event that the APC settles for a flag bearer from the South. In a recent poll conducted among PDP members in six states across the geopolitical zones (Kano, Borno, Rivers, Imo, Lagos and Abuja), 70 per cent of those who took part in the survey agreed that the main opposition party should zone its ticket to the North.\n\nIn 1998, the PDP had reached a \u201cgentleman\u2019s\u201d agreement that in the interest of \u201cequity and justice\u201d, the South would have an eight-year stint and this would be returned to the North in 2007.It was on that premise that late Umaru Yar\u2019Adua became the anointed candidate from the North under the banner of the PDP. But in a twist of fate, Yar\u2019Adua died barely three years in office on May 5, 2010. The tragedy placed the party in a quagmire.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nIt was in accordance with the constitution but against stiff opposition and massive support that Goodluck Ebele Johnathan became the President of the country, before deciding to run for the same office in 2011. One of the most vocal supporters of the PDP shopping for a candidate of Northern extraction is a chieftain of the party, Chief Raymond Dokpesi. For him, only a Northerner can win the 2023 presidential election for the PDP. He said party members who are canvassing zoning of the ticket to the South are only doing so because they want to copy APC whose members are rooting for conceding the ticket to the South after the completion of President Buhari\u2019s tenure in 2023.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are all Nigerians and there is no need for us to keep deceiving ourselves at this point in time. At the age of 70 and with my experience in organising campaigns in this country, I can tell you that unless there is a candidate from the North, in my own considered opinion, PDP will not stand a chance of winning the election.\n\n\u201cOn the ambition of those from the South who are asking for the presidency to be zoned to the South, I can say that they are only echoing what prevails in APC. In that party, President Muhammadu Buhari has done eight years, so it is imperative on APC to cede the presidency to the South.\u201d But recently, former Aviation Minister and a chieftain of the PDP, Osita Chidoka, said the main opposition party is in a dilemma over the zoning of presidency to any region.\n\nChidoka, who spoke during an interview on Channels Television\u2019s Politics Today, said he would personally want the PDP to field a Southerner from the Eastern part of the country as its candidate. He, however, explained that his party is faced with two tough options \u2013 either to struggle to clinch power or embrace zoning to the detriment of winning the polls.\n\nHe said: \u201cPDP is in a kind of dilemma. Do we struggle to win power first or continue our zoning as we have done or do we continue with the zoning even if that candidate may or may not win the election?\u201d\n\nSo, the calculations on the issue of zoning are similar in terms of the ultimate goal of winning the election but different in the moral burden for fielding candidates from the South.\n\nRealistically, Northern power brokers in APC who are in support of power going down South are more than those in the PDP thinking in the same direction. For instance, among many others, the Katsina State governor, Aminu Masari, has maintained that a Southerner should succeed President Buhari. He had said clearly: \u201cWith regards to zoning, fair is fair. If you ask me, I would, as a person, Aminu, think we should move the presidency to the Southern part of the country,\u201d\n\nA member of the manifesto committee of the defunct merger committee of APC, Chief Osita Okechukwu, went further to say there was a mutual agreement on power shift at the inception of the APC. He said: \u201cThere is a convention. It is a convention. From 1999, the convention of zoning was adopted. It is not written in black and white. It is a convention which provides guidance in liberal democracies. So, nobody can come out and say there was no agreement.\n\n\u201cIn time past, some politicians were persuaded not to run for president for the sake of equity, fairness and justice. So, after President Buhari\u2019s eight years, it should go to the South. The good thing is that there is no part of the country that does not have competent people.\u201d\n\nBut his view is a sharp contrast to the position of ex-Governor Ahmed Sani who expressed doubts about such gentleman\u2019s agreement that power should alternate between the North and the South. His words: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything like agreement. You can ask Mr President, he led the group. Asiwaju (Tinubu) was there. I was part of it. There was no meeting I didn\u2019t attend or any meeting that I attended that there was such agreement. (Such) agreement can\u2019t be verbal; it has to be written. In any case, any agreement that is contrary to laws of this country is not an agreement.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution is very clear. We are in a democracy and democracy is governed by processes and procedures and by laws.\u201d\n\nAlready, for both the APC and PDP, there is an array of aspirants from the North and South for the presidential tickets but many are anxious to see whether the concept of zoning would play a major part in who succeeds President Buhari in 2023.",

          "title": "11 African startups to watch out for in 2022",
          "text": "It\u2019s safe to say the Africa startup ecosystem came full circle last year with a record-breaking number of new innovative startups and huge investment to match it. If innovation is a reflection of economic, social, and technological advancement, then we can say the ecosystem has advanced.\n\nSo, out of hundreds of excellent startups in Africa, we have curated 10 that we think you, our readers, should watch closely as we expect them to do some incredible stuff this year.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFintech/cryptocurrency\n\nFounded in February 2020 by Stephen Young, NFTfi is a decentralised and peer-to-peer cryptocurrency loan platform where users can list their NFT collateral to get loan offers from other users.\n\nOn the platform, you can request for a loan using your NFT and other users start bidding to lend you money in cryptocurrency with varying interest rates and repayment terms. Once you accept an offer, you\u2019ll receive wETH or DAI liquidity in your wallet and your NFT is transferred into a double-audited escrow smart contract for the loan duration. If you repay the loan before it expires, you\u2019ll get your NFT back. If you default, the lender can foreclose and receive your NFT.\n\nThis is a good innovation considering the amount of money locked in NFTs. Imagine being able to access liquidity without selling off your NFT.\n\nAs crypto continues to gain mass acceptance and adoption, so does the need to make it easy for holders to transact with it. Lazerpay, founded and launched into beta in November last year by Njoku Emmanuel, is a payment gateway for crypto. Think of Paystack, but for crypto.\n\nLast year, Lazerpay secured an undisclosed amount of investment from Nestcoin, an innovative venture that builds, operates, and invests in crypto and Web3 products. As it\u2019s set to launch to the public, the startup is expected to do to cryptocurrency what Paystack and Flutterwave are doing to fiat in Africa.\n\nCo-founded by Jude Dike, William Okafor, and Temitope Ekundayo, and launched in July 2021, GetEquity says it wants to make funding easy and quick for African startups, and at the backend of it, help common people have a bite of the booming startup ecosystem.\n\nOn GetEquity, users get to invest as little as $10 in startups. Startups get instant access to several angel investors, syndicates, and institutional investors. Startups also get the chance to raise investment from their communities and customers, \u201cgiving ownership and building a stronger sense of belonging with their most loyal customers\u201d.\n\nAs at December last year, according to the co-founders, the company has experienced a 100% growth rate across all metrics. It has over 4,000 users on its platform. About 20 startups are currently listed on its platform and over $400,000 has been invested on the platform.\n\nFounded by Jesse Ghansah and Barima Effah, Float, formerly known as Swipe, was launched in June 2021 as a cash management and credit provider fintech company for Africa\u2019s fast-growth companies.\n\nThe startup recently picked up $17 million in equity and debt funding from notable investors across the world including Cauris, Tiger Global, and Justin Mateen\u2019s JAM Fund, Ingressive Capital, Magic Fund, and many angel investors.\n\nThe company is already operational in Nigeria and Kenya and the seed round is expected to expedite its growth this year.\n\nLaunched in April last year by Ahmed Sabbah, a co-founder at Swvl and Youssef Sholqamy, a former engineer at Uber, Telda is a digital bank that provides free accounts for its users and enables them to send and receive money. It also provides them with a card to use online, in stores, make withdrawals and pay bills.\n\nIn May, just a month after it launched, the company announced that it has raised $5 million pre-seed funding led by Sequoia. It also affirmed that it is the first company to receive a license from the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) under its new regulations to issue cards and onboard customers digitally.\n\nOwing to its achievement in a short period of time, we expect the startup to even achieve more in 2022, so get your eyes peeled on this one.\n\nEdtech\n\nCraydel is an edtech startup that was launched in March 2021 by Manish Sardana, John Nguru, and Shayne Aman Premji. The startup creates a reliable portal to guide African students in their tertiary education, course selection, and career decisions.\n\nCraydel provides a digital end-to-end higher education service. Its service spans from the point of students choosing schools, programmes, and courses to the application and admission stages. The company also provides visa support for those who choose to study abroad, all for free.\n\nCraydel is already in partnership with 90 institutions across Canada, the UK and US, Ireland, and African countries like Malawi and Kenya. There are over 3,000 courses\u2014spread across undergraduate and postgraduate programmes\u2014available to choose from.\n\nFounded in May 2021 but launched into beta in December by former Google Nigeria boss, Honey Ogundeyi, Edukoya says it wants to empower learners and their parents to take control of their learning and make it easier for them to access high-quality learning material and expert help.\n\nThe platform is built to target Nigerian secondary school learners. It has raised a $3.5 million pre-seed capital war chest from Target Global and top African founders like Shola Akindolu and Babs Ogundeyin, among others, to bring effective education to its target audience.\n\nWith the founder\u2019s experience, quality of the team, and the early investment secured, we expect this startup to do great things in the edtech sector this year.\n\nHealthtech\n\nBypa-ss was founded by Dr Andrew Saad in 2019 and entered the market with its proprietary product, HealthTag, a platform for Health Information Exchange (HIE), offering physicians a free cloud-based clinic management solution.\n\nThrough linking with a cloud database, HealthTag securely stores medical records collected from different healthcare providers and gives them to their rightful owner, the user.\n\nAs of November last year, Saad said the company currently has over 17,000 HealthTag cardholders and over 3,500 healthcare providers\u2014mainly in clinics, pharmacies, labs, and radiology centers using their product.\n\nBuilt on the blockchain technology, Afya Rekod wants to create a seamless mobilised healthcare in Africa, where the patients\u2014who are the only moving parts in healthcare\u2014own all the rights to their data.\n\nFounded in 2019 by the co-founder and CEO of Adanian Labs John Kamara, Afya Rekod provides 4 unique offerings to its customers: its core patient\u2019s portal; electronic health record systems (EHRs) for hospitals; diagnostic centres for medical labs; and disease management for control and management of chronic diseases like Ebola and COVID-19.\n\nEcommerce and logistics\n\nTendo is a social ecommerce platform that eases setup and operating costs for social commerce entrepreneurs by providing them with logistics, financing, and marketing.\n\nFounded by Derrick Mungai, Evans Darbo Boateng, Felix Manford, and Primerose Katena, Tendo provides a curated catalogue of products, marketing tools, and other tools that facilitate trading for its users\u2014resellers\u2014to choose from. Once they sell the product at their own chosen price, Tendo handles the rest\u2014ships the product, subtracts the cost and remits the profit in the account of the seller.\n\nTendo simply enables anyone to start an online shop with zero capital. The company has a unique solution to social commerce. It also made it into Y Combinator 2022 Winter Batch, and this is an indicator of its potential to be watched closely.\n\nFounded in June 2021 by Tola Onayemi and Tope Obanla, Norebase, a one-stop-shop digital platform for African businesses to expand, file trademarks, and patent intellectual property (IP) across the continent.\n\nThe startup handles everything it takes for a business to launch in a new African country. It\u2019s a 360-degree business launchpad: business registration, opening of business bank accounts, compliances, license acquisition, and further legal requirements\u2014all from one dashboard.\n\nWe think this startup is building a game-changing product; something that will have a significant impact on the growth of African startups.\n\nWe know you have some startups you are rooting for this year that we might have missed.

          "text": "Nigeria has set in motion what could herald a new dawn for African tech startups as it moots the adoption of new listing rules to encourage tech companies to go public.\n\nThis story was contributed to TechCabal by Seth Onyango/bird\n\nThe Nigerian Exchange Group (NXG) is going on a charm offensive to attract tech unicorns to the bourse, in part to resuscitate the market after a lull in new listings.\n\nIts pivot towards fintech firms underpins the coming of age of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem \u2013 now a top destination for foreign direct investment (FDI).\n\nNXG is now setting up a NASDAQ-style board to consolidate on the fast-growing internet economy created by local tech firms.\n\nOlumide Bolumole, division head of stock exchange listing activities at NXG revealed that the bourse will make sweeping changes to make listing attractive to tech companies.\n\nHe singled out \u201cbreaking even\u201d, one of the current prerequisites for listing a firm at the bourse, asserting that this requirement was stymieing the growth potential of tech outfits.\n\nNGX demutualised in 2021, taking the company private in a move that it hopes will attract greater flows of foreign and domestic investment into Nigeria\u2019s bourse, with a renewed emphasis on corporate governance and the ability to expand into other markets and sectors.\n\nNGX consists of a holding company and three subsidiaries that cover the operations of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), its regulation, and its real estate. This structure is similar to those of other international market groups such as the London, New York, and Johannesburg stock exchange groups.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nNigeria and a few other African states boast unicorns \u2013 startups that have attained a market valuation of over a billion US dollars and Africa is now home to seven: Jumia Technologies, Interswitch, Flutterwave, Andela, Wave, OPay, and Chipper Cash.\n\nFive of these became unicorns in 2021, including two in September alone, indicating the growing levels of interest in Africa\u2019s startup market not seen before.\n\nBut despite having the fourth-largest stock market in Africa none of Nigeria\u2019s home-grown top startups to date have been listed on the Lagos-based NSE. The proposed reforms should help tech firms tap into larger capital markets, starting at home.\n\nAccording to Wee Tracker (WT), the Nigerian government is in the process of implementing the Nigerian Startup Bill (NSE).\n\nIt will create a new regulatory framework that should allow innovation-driven businesses to thrive.\n\n\u201cThe bill also intends to address prevalent shortcomings such as insufficient digital infrastructure, tax holidays, and capital access,\u201d WT said.\n\nListings for Africa\u2019s tech firms have many benefits, including fundraising and providing a seamless exit route to investors, supervision and control of trading in securities, and fair price for the securities.\n\nTimely disclosure of corporate information and better corporate practice are also some of the advantages of a company going public. Studies have also shown that consumers are often more willing to support listed firms.\n\nFor Nigeria, getting startups to list could help revive the country\u2019s bourse after a three-year listing drought. In recent decades, Nigeria\u2019s stock market capitalisation has fallen well below potential.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, the market cap of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) swelled to $1.05 trillion, equivalent to 235% of the country\u2019s 301 billion US dollars GDP,\u201d according to Wee Tracker.\n\nWhile the NSE outperformed in 2020, growing by as much as 50 percent with 4.5 billion dollars in new listings, its market capitalisation of $56.6 billion \u2013 just 13.1% of the nation\u2019s comparatively enormous $432.3 billion GDP \u2013 shows there is considerable room for growth.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Valentine\u2019s is fast approaching and so is the race to win people\u2019s hearts with gifts. For many, the outcome of February 14 will decide if Christmas this year will be celebrated wearing matching pyjamas, or joining unnamed Zikoko team members blocking and muting words like \u201clove\u201d and \u201cme and mines\u201d later.\n\nFor Christmas, we gave you a guide to help you navigate gifting during the holiday season. Now we\u2019ve created this one to help you navigate Valentine\u2019s.\n\nThere\u2019s tech in everything, even gift-giving. If you\u2019re looking to steer clear of basic gifts like one-time food platters that will be consumed in single sittings, this is the guide for you. For example, James Wardle created a $1 million game\u2014Wordle\u2014for his partner who loved video games. Locket, an app that helps users share their photos to their friends\u2019/lovers\u2019 home screens, was built by Matt Moss as a present for his girlfriend. Even Zoom was the product of a founder who wanted to connect with his girlfriend long distance.\n\nLast year, the African tech ecosystem raised a whopping $4 billion+ so we know things are working. As we invest and build more startups, it\u2019s also important to invest and build relationships. And that\u2019s why you should move away from chocolates and roses to\u2026\n\n1. Professional courses\n\nLevel: Series C\n\nIf you can\u2019t build your partner apps The New York Times will later buy for millions of dollars, at least enrol them in courses where they can learn to build, design, market or manage those apps\u2014for themselves or future lovers. \ud83e\udd2d\n\nThere are a few online schools where you can pay for courses like software engineering, design, product management, marketing, or content creation. Check out AltSchool, Moringa School, Decagon Institute, Coursera, and Pluralsight.\n\nYou should also sign them up for TC Daily, a daily newsletter that can give your lover comprehensive insight into tech.\n\nWe\u2019re always talking about getting more people into tech. Use this Valentine\u2019s and help people kick-start their journey into tech.\n\nPrice range: > $99\n\nWe\u2019ve labelled this a Series C-type gift because it\u2019s a long-term investment beneficial to all involved. It\u2019s expensive but also profitable in the long run. Unless, of course, the giftee gets acquired by another gifter. \ud83d\udc80\n\n2. Music streaming subscriptions\n\nLevel: Seed\n\nImage source: Stuff.tv\n\nThis one is a given.\n\nMusic heals our body, soul, and mind. It\u2019s also one of the greatest ways to connect with people. Over the past 5 years, the growth of streaming services\u2014indigenous and foreign\u2014has doubled.\n\nFor Valentine\u2019s, get your loved ones subscriptions on Apple Music, Spotify, YouTube Music, and Boomplay.\n\nPrice range: $2 \u2013 $4 (for Individual plans)\n\nWe\u2019re labelling this a seed-type gift because, any way you dice it, you\u2019re sowing seeds. You\u2019re either sowing seeds of \u201cThis is how we chose our wedding songs\u201d, or breakfast seeds that will lead to many Adele playlists. Happy planting. \ud83c\udf31\n\n3. Video streaming subscriptions\n\nLevel: Seed\n\nImage source: The Streamable\n\nEver heard of Netflix and Chill? Well, here\u2019s how you can someday build up to that: get them video streaming subscriptions for Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nWith multiple plans to choose from, Iroko TV and Netflix have been giving us really amazing African content in the past few years.\n\nGet a Nollywood lover an Iroko or Netflix subscription for Valentine\u2019s.\n\nPrice range: From $7 (+ Free basic Netflix plans in Kenya)\n\nThis is also a seed-type gift because it\u2019s affordable and useful if things go sideways. Renewing the subscriptions marks the token of your shared love, and not renewing can be a new way to end the relationship, instead of ghosting.\n\n4. Data subscriptions\n\nLevel: Pre-seed\n\nData is life. And the more of it you have, the more you can access information available online. Data on the continent is still relatively expensive, and in some countries, people can pay as much as $7 for 1GB of data.\n\nAll the digital gifts we\u2019ve listed above are data-dependent so make sure you\u2019re getting your loved ones access to the gifts you give.\n\nWith data, people can stream as many movies and videos as they possibly can. Log on to your MTN, Safaricom, Airtel, or Ethio Telecom services and gift your loved one gigabytes of data.\n\nPrice range: From < $1\n\nThis is the only pre-seed gift here because you can decide how much or how little you want to invest here.\n\n5. Home services\n\nLevel: Series C\n\nImage source: Yung Nollywood\n\nWhat\u2019s better than one-time food platters? Daily food packages that trump the time-consuming activity of cooking.\n\nThere\u2019s tech in everything, and that includes automating home services like laundry and cooking.\n\nStartups like Eden Life have created platforms where you can subscribe to monthly packages for laundry, cooking and cleaning services. If you\u2019re going to go with the food option for Valentine\u2019s, then go all the way.\n\nPrice range: From $50\n\nThis is labelled Series C because it\u2019s also a long-term gift. Every time your loved one eats or steps into clean rooms and clothes, they\u2019ll think of you and how much you\u2019ve made their lives easier.\n\n6. Crypto\n\nLevel: Series C\n\nImage source: Corporate Compliance Insights\n\nRoses are red, violets are blue. Crypto is here, and its promise is true.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to talk much about crypto. Like your relationships, it has its ups and downs, \ud83d\udc80 but that\u2019s what makes us love it.\n\nFor Valentine\u2019s, add to your loved one\u2019s crypto stash and help them build their way into digital wealth. There are many cryptocurrencies to choose from, like bitcoin, ethereum, and doge. And if you\u2019re worried about the chances of the coins depreciating, remember that even your relationship is a gamble.\n\nGet on BuyCoins, Yellow Card, Quidax, Nestcoin, or Bitsika to mine your way into people\u2019s hearts.\n\nPrice range: From $1 (invest as required).\n\nThis is a Series C gift because it\u2019s long-term for both of you. If the relationship dips, you can take comfort in knowing that whenever crypto dips, so will your ex\u2019s happiness.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please give TechCabal a gift by sharing it on Twitter, Facebook, Whatsapp or Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "This developer transitioned to blockchain development in order to solve Web2 problems",
          "text": "Akinyemi Akindele, 27, studied computer science at the University of Ibadan, where he trained as a Web2 software developer.\n\nHowever, his journey into the blockchain world did not start until he got an internship in 2015 at Interswitch, one of Africa\u2019s earliest unicorns. At Interswitch, he worked in the research and development team where he got the opportunity to test out interesting emerging technologies like AI and blockchain\u2014technologies that the business was not focusing on at that point.\n\nAkindele was neck-deep into the blockchain and soon realised its power. \u201cPeople were talking about the future of finance and I got to work on it early on,\u201d Akindele said. As a Nigerian experiencing the rapid decline in value of the naira, Akindele resonated with bitcoin\u2019s promise to provide a store of value not tied to the traditional financial system or government\u2019s whims.\n\nHe was a man of varied interest, his final year paper at the university was based on artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014with a focus on artificial neural networks. Upon graduating from university, he returned to work at Interswitch and started learning how to develop blockchain solutions. Eventually, he got to build a blockchain supply chain solution with his team, the first of its kind in the country, he said. The blockchain solution made the loaning and contract awarding process involving Dangote Plc bidding suppliers and banks seamless.\n\nAkindele attended hackathons, and ethereum meetups organised by Consensys in Lagos, where he had to build smart contracts on ethereum. He won some\u2014worth 1 to 3 million naira\u2014and that was pivotal to his career growth. He admitted that he won a lot of those hackathons because he already had a lot of experience in building ethereum solutions at his workplace, Interswitch.\n\nIn one of the hackathons, he met an American founder, Daniel Block, who was building an NFT marketplace for properties, as far back as 2018. He was on a mission to tokenise real estate properties in Africa, had digitised land records in Ghana, and had his sights set on Nigeria.\n\nAkindele joined Block\u2019s company, SESO Global, as its first blockchain engineer, where he helped build an NFT marketplace. There, he spent a year building their enterprise ethereum, and wrote smart contract code to power those NFTs\u2014years before the NFT buzz of 2021.\n\nA rich blockchain development experience\n\nIt was in one of those hackathons, where he had been an outstanding competitor, that Akindele met Yele Bademosi, Nestcoin co-founder, who was then director of Binance Labs, the venture arm of global crypto exchange, Binance. Yele was a judge in those hackathons, and he kept in touch with Akindele because of his outstanding performance. So, when Yele needed a team to start a project internally inside Binance, he reached out to Akindele.\n\nAkindele joined Binance\u2014where he was earning about $48,000 per year\u2014as a blockchain engineer, and with a team of backend, mobile, and blockchain engineers, helped build a cryptocurrency exchange right from the scratch. \u201cIt was interesting because we got to learn a lot of new things. For example, I did a lot of encryption, wallet generation, and signing off; and I got to know a lot of different coins listed on the exchange.\u201d\n\nAkindele recalled that the project commenced when Facebook announced Libra, a cryptocurrency, wallet and an exchange, all in one. \u201cIt looked like the hottest thing ever!\u201d Akindele further explained that Binance was worried Facebook might take over developing countries due to the proposed Libra\u2019s reach, so Binance started a competing project, which gave birth to Bundle Africa.\n\nAt the time, Bundle Africa ran as a startup inside Binance and was also a remote-first company. Within 16 months, Bundle Africa got 650,000 users, majorly by word of mouth, community marketing, and a small marketing budget. The way its adoption skyrocketed made Akindele realise the huge potential crypto products had.\n\nAfter two years at Binance, Akindele joined EMTECH, a US blockchain company that builds digital currency for central banks across the world. At EMTECH\u2014where he was earning about $84, 000 per year\u2014he helped build tokens, did DevOps work and helped in shipping projects. EMTECH had created the world\u2019s first CBDC for the Bahamas and was the go-to fintech company for central banks looking to create digital currencies.\n\nBreaking into blockchain development\n\nAnother idea that endeared Akindele to blockchain engineering was that the blockchain was a melting point for a lot of things. \u201cTo be very good at blockchain you have to know things beyond your engineering skills, like finance, and compliance and regulations. You have to think about these things every time you write a code or develop anything.\u201d\n\nAkindele believes that anyone who wants to transition into becoming a Web3 developer must believe that it is the future. \u201cYou have to convince yourself because no one is coming to convince you that ownership rights on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will be big in the future.\u201d\n\nHe further advised aspiring blockchain developers to learn how to build on a popular blockchain like ethereum, develop ethereum Decentralised applications (Dapps) and write Solidity code. \u201cIt is at this point you will realise that you have new powers because you would be able to write smart contracts, deploy them on a public blockchain and see people interacting with your blockchain.\u201d\n\nSolving problems with Web3\n\nAkindele left EMTECH to found a startup, BetDemand, a decentralised finance (DeFi) sport betting platform where every player who lose their bets still get their initial staking.\n\nThe idea for BetDemand came to him while he studied game theory to understand why and how people play games and the economic models designed as part of those games. He discovered that economic incentives in the traditional sports betting model are harmful: a large number of people were losing money but couldn\u2019t stop playing because they were already addicted to betting.\n\nBetDemand eliminates the major problem people have with betting: losing their money. \u201cImagine telling a punter that even if he loses, he will get his money back after a week. That is an irresistible offer,\u201d Akindele said. Players can only bet on football for now, with naira\u2014for as low as \u20a650\u2014and crypto.\n\nBetDemand gathers all the money staked by players in a single pool, introducing a lock-up period of 1 week, where players do not receive their money back until after a week. During this lock-up period, BetDemand converts this pool of funds to USDT, a stablecoin, which would then be deposited in Venus protocol, a DeFi lending and borrowing platform. The pool of funds then earns 12% to 15% annual percentage yield (APY).\n\n\u201cEverybody gets their money back at the end of the day, whether you win or lose, and the interest we get during the lock-up period is shared with the winners.\u201d\n\nAkindele explained that they could have opted for other coins that would raise their yield to as high as 30% but, right now, they are sticking with USDT because stablecoins are non-volatile. They make less profit but it\u2019s just enough to sustain the business.\n\nIn the last week of October, when BetDemand launched, the size of its pool of funds was $450; now it has increased to $26,000 per week.\n\nBetDemand calculates winnings by multiplying the amount that players bet by total odds\u2014a method not particularly different from how traditional betting companies calculate winnings. The day of the week in which one places a bet also affects winnings; it\u2019s called the \u201cday factor\u201d. The difference with BetDemand, however, is that payouts are based on the interest the pool of funds yields over the week, so players can\u2019t earn as high as they would with traditional betting. \u201cBut what we pay is enough to keep people coming back.\u201d\n\nLike the buzzy play-to-earn gaming Web3 companies, BetDemand is charting its course as a DeFi gaming company. And, although, yet to be announced, it has raised an angel round and is in the process of closing a pre-seed round.\n\nAkindele, speaking about what Web3 will do for Africa, said, \u201cWeb3 will be very big for Africa, because when the internet was being built in Silicon Valley, a lot of Africans did not participate in that. But we have a chance to do so now. Every time new technologies are built, a lot of wealth is created around that period, and people involved in building these technologies, or those that exist at the time, benefit from it.\u201d\n\nHe advised developers hoping to start their blockchain engineering journey to join communities on Discord, connect with people, and ask questions, especially from founders, to see why they make the decisions they make. He also advised them to contribute to open source blockchain projects and look for ways to solve the problems that exist today in Web2 with Web3.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there.\n\nThe rate at which Africans use the Internet for cybercrime is alarming and rapidly increasing. Cybercrime affects all countries, but Africa is particularly vulnerable due to inadequate network and security.\n\nAn estimate shows that cybercrime costs the global economy $500 billion, as of 2016. A 2021 study by Techshielder, a technology and online security platform, describes Nigeria as the second most notorious country in the world for romance scams, after the Philippines.\n\nIf I continue with the types of fraud and the countries that top each list, it won\u2019t be surprising to see an African country on every list, which is very worrisome. For instance, South Africa, after Kenya, is the African country most affected by fraud, draining millions of dollars from the mobile accounts of cellular users worldwide on a daily basis, according to research.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Evina, a French cybersecurity firm with a presence in more than 70 countries worldwide \u2013 including 15 in Africa \u2013 a recent report titled State of Mobile Fraud in Africa, shows that professional cybercriminals targeting Africa\u2019s one billion mobile phone users continue to be a significant problem.\n\nTo fight this, the company which claims to specialise in fighting fraud in Africa has recently raised a \u20ac20 million (~$23m) Series A to help them improve their game in fighting fraud.\n\nI find that interesting because the company declared that at least half of the \u20ac20 million capital injection will be used to combat fraud in Africa. Yes, you read that correctly; over $12 million will be invested in combating mobile fraud in Africa.\n\nWhile I\u2019m interested in how the company intends to accomplish this, there\u2019s also an indigenous company in Nigeria, Stellas digital bank planning to combat fraud. But before I discuss that, let\u2019s see what happens to your data when you die.\n\nSide bar: Is it possible that the rise of startups focused on combating fraud will help achieve its purpose in Africa? What do you think? Please, click the reply button to respond.\n\nSo, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nWhat happens to your digital assets after death\n\nStellas digital\u2019s plans to fix fraud\n\nWhat happens to your digital assets after death\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens to your data when you die?\n\nWho will have access to your accounts if you die right now? Do your siblings or parents have access to all of your digital assets?\n\nNot to scare you, but those thoughts were playing through my head about a fortnight ago. What if, despite my optimism, I kick the bucket without any warning? What will happen to my social media accounts, email accounts, and the small sums of money I\u2019ve saved in Cowrywise and Piggyvest if I don\u2019t wake up again after tonight? I mean, I\u2019d like my family to have it, but how likely is that after I die?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith so many daily functions, tasks, and memories now taking place online, the question of what will become of your digital legacy \u2013 who will preserve, control, or delete your accounts after you die \u2013 has become increasingly important.\n\nMaking a plan now can help you avoid identity theft, save documents and records you want to keep, and keep your friends and family from receiving painful pop-up reminders on social media.\n\nHowever, there are numerous potential stumbling blocks to organising your digital will, ranging from privacy concerns and cybersecurity to copyright.\n\nBut, where does your data go when you die in Africa, where you technically have no rights to your data after death?\n\n\n\nIn the Privacy Roundtable series, Ogheneruemu walked us through what happens to our data when we die. Please read, where does your data go when you die?\n\nStellas digital\u2019s plans to fix fraud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the launch of the NIBSS Instant Payment (NIP) scheme in 2011, interbank transactions in Nigeria have become much faster, with several experts hailing it as one of the best globally.\n\nFraudsters have also taken advantage of this, executing faster due to the increased speed. Consequently, Nigeria has lost $13 billion to cybercrime in the last decade and $12 million in the first nine months of 2020.\n\nBecause fraud remains a problem for both digital and traditional banks, Stellas digital bank \u2014 a microfinance bank founded in 2017 to provide easy access to financial services \u2014 has launched a digital bank to \u201coffer banking services with ease.\u201d\n\nWhat does this mean? The company plans to protect user identities when conducting transactions to prevent identity theft and ensure privacy and security.\n\nBut how is the Bukola Solomon-led company doing that? To know how, please, read: Stellas digital bank launches, plans to fix major loophole for fintech fraud in Nigeria.\n\nPoS for the web\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSending money from one bank to another 25 years ago was a very different process than it is today. Transfers frequently took several days to reach their intended recipients. To withdraw money, you had to go to the branch where you opened your account.\n\n\n\nHowever, banking innovation has caused the industry to evolve to the point where transfers can now be completed in a matter of minutes. And the industry has grown at an unprecedented rate due to these changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith more people shopping online, digital payments have become the order of the day, with startups introducing new features to aid this \u2014 like a Point-of-Sale (PoS) solution for the web, for instance. Thepeer, a startup that creates infrastructure that allows businesses to share data, has launched Checkout to create a simple online checkout experience.\n\nCheckout, according to the startup, is simple to integrate and use on a business\u2019s website. Users can shop online and pay from their favourite businesses using Thepeer Checkout.\n\nTo know what the startup does, please read: Backed by Flutterwave, Thepeer wants to help businesses share data seamlessly using its API\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nMental health advice to my younger self.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 2011, interbank transactions have gotten much faster in Nigeria with the launch of the NIBSS Instant Payment (NIP) scheme, an infrastructure that several experts laud as being one of the world\u2019s best.\n\nUnfortunately, this speed of execution meant that fraudsters have been able to execute with greater speed. In 10 years, Nigeria has lost $13 billion to cybercrime, and in just nine months of 2020, it lost $12 million to electronic fraud.\n\nNigeria\u2019s banking space is, perhaps, one of its most critical sectors, as these companies are tasked with providing essential services to millions of people. Interestingly, we\u2019re observing a trend of banks moving from physical branches to having an online-only presence.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s not clear how much Nigerian consumer behaviour has adapted to this trend, investors are seemingly betting that these companies will usher in the future of banking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith different incentives and hooks like free transfers, micro-lending, speedy and efficient customer lending, these banks aim to capture segments of the market that have experienced relative neglect by traditional banks.\n\nHowever, fraud remains the bane of both digital banks, and traditional banks alike. For the newly launched Stellas digital bank, it plans to guard against one major loophole.\n\nLed by Bukola Solomon, an executive with extensive experience in the investment banking space, Stellas microfinance bank started in 2017, to provide easy access to financial services, and it soon became one of Nigeria\u2019s leading financial services providers.\n\nToday, the company is launching a digital bank to \u201coffer banking services with ease\u201d. With this launch, it plans to promote privacy and security in the financial services space with its \u201cGhost Mode\u201d feature, as well as other savings and budgeting features, but more on these later.\n\nSolomon explains that the company has always prioritised user experience as one of its biggest value offerings, and it brought that philosophy with its digital banking launch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen several instances of people who need to make transactions but want it to remain confidential and private. With our Ghost Mode feature, you can execute confidential transactions, and more so, it serves as a security feature. We can encrypt transactions so that even if they get access to your phone or that of the recipient, your data is secure,\u201d he says.\n\nBasically, Stellas plans to protect user identities when making transactions, to guard against identity theft and ensure privacy and security.\n\nIn 2020, $219 million was lost to identity theft, and these usually come in different forms from social media activities, emails, or credit cards. Solomon points out that transferring money to a random stranger you bought items from could be another potential loophole for identity theft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSolomon also reveals that all transactions are fully insured by the National Deposit Insurance Commission (NDIC) and will strictly comply with anti-money laundering and anti-fraud regulations.\n\nInteresting bells and whistles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough Solomon talks up the Ghost Mode feature, he also reveals that the company has integrated a budgeting feature that would help users create better economic plans for themselves.\n\nSo far, Solomon claims it already has a massive userbase with exciting projections for the future.\n\n\u201cWe have 10,000 users already, and we expect it to reach 200,000 in the first month.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s highly likely that Stellas would be offering its digital banking services to its existing customers, but it would be interesting to see how it would ht 200k users in one month.\n\nIn a space graced by the likes of Kuda, Sparkle, Fairmoney, and Carbon, Nigeria\u2019s digital banking space look set to be exciting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator.

          "text": "You have put in a lot of time, energy, and resources to acquire an original work of art. It is now in your possession and you are over the moon with your recent purchase. The very last step you now need to consider is how to protect it.\n\nWhether you are a newbie or a seasoned collector, your enviable art collection when uninsured hedges a lot of risk. Risks including theft, robbery, and general damages, can be easily eliminated with the right art insurance. If you are reading this and you have art pieces worth thousands of dollars that are uninsured, now is the best time for you to get on with it. This digest will arm you with everything you need to get started on the process of insuring your art pieces.\n\nHomeowner or renter protection\n\nIf you own your home or you are leasing a property that you placed an insurance policy on, chances are that you may already be covered. Some homeowner policies cover collectables such as jewelry, artworks, and other collections so it might be worth combing through your policy to see what you already got.\n\nIf you discover that you do indeed have general coverage for art in your policy, you might want to get special coverage from art insurers specifically for art items. This additional step boosts your confidence because you will be dealing with an art insurance expert who will carefully craft the best policy that protects you from any type of damage, spoil, and other unforeseen occurrences. Working with a fine art insurance company ensures that your artwork or collection is covered to its most recent appraised value.\n\nAppropriate documentation\n\nEvery piece of documentation is important at this stage. You want to provide all documentation that validates you as the owner of those art pieces and also show their worth. Such\n\ndocumentation includes but is not limited to proof of ownership, bill of sale, photographs, and the most recent appraisal on the art piece(s) or collection.\n\nCredential appraisal\n\nNext, you need to work with a credential appraiser. When it comes to art appraisals, you want to ensure that you are working with a credible appraiser. If you do not have one, most often than not, the insurance company you are dealing with will recommend one to you. When this happens, be sure to conduct due diligence on them.\n\nIf you are insuring an older piece of art that was handed down to you as inheritance or similar instances, you want to ensure that you get a good and up-to-date assessment that takes into consideration the state of the current art market and projections for the future. If at the point you are to insure it you discover that it is a great time to sell off and make real profits and you are open to it, your appraiser should be able to make informed advisory on such matters.\n\nRead also: Art and nature \u2013 The artistic works of Aisha Tukur Buratai\n\nArt appraisals are one of many services that we at Patrons offer to our individual and corporate clients. We work with the best insurance companies to provide you with a full suite art insurance package tailored to your specific need. It does not matter where in the world you are, we collaborate with our partner insurers to appraise and insure your African art pieces and collections. To get started, send us an email: art@patronsmcaa.com to begin the process.\n\nCreate a tailored plan\n\nBe sure to get a comprehensive insurance package that covers theft, floods and natural disasters, transportation or when-in-taxi mishaps, fire, and other unforeseen occurrences. If you live in an area that is prone to hurricanes or floods, you want your insurer to take these into consideration.\n\nIf you or someone in your family has ever leased or is currently leasing an art piece to a Museum or any institution, or if the art is constantly in commute from one location to another, you want your appraiser and insurer to consider these factors when making professional recommendations to ensure all eventualities are fully covered.\n\nAppraise regularly\n\nThere is no right or wrong answer to how frequently you should have your collection appraised. However, I would recommend yearly appraisals if you collect very often, otherwise, every 3 years is a decent time interval. When you schedule an upcoming appraisal, be sure to specify that it is for art insurance purposes to ensure you are given the most up-to-date market value of your artwork or collection.\n\nRegular appraisals are important for artworks purchased for investment purposes. These frequent check-ins keep you informed on the value of your collection. If you purchased an artwork for $3,000 3 years ago that is now worth $10,000, you want to ensure that it is now insured at the $10,000 value to protect you in case of theft or damages.\n\nStay informed\n\nYour professional advisors \u2013 appraiser and insurer \u2013 may want to keep you updated with the latest tips. Be sure to stay informed on an ongoing basis on how to preserve your art, store it, frame it, and take care of it while it is in transit. Stay educated about these things as well as the current affairs in the art market. Information such as these will inform you when it is the best time to flip any piece of art in the secondary market. Do not be shy, always ask questions and expect detailed, well-informed answers from your professional advisors.\n\nArt Index Top 5 Monthly\n\nJanuary\u2019s digest kicks off 2022\u2019s top 5 monthly showdown.

With the development, 10 percent of Edo population are now members of PDP.\n\nThe e-registration and revalidation exercise is aimed at migrating the party\u2019s membership database from analogue to digital, building a durable and comprehensive database of party members.\n\nThe exercise, in its pilot phase, targets to register at least one million persons in Edo. The party has now hit a record of 500,000 whose biometrics, phone numbers and addresses are captured in the PDP digital database.\n\nThe governor noted that with the successful exercise, the party was well-positioned to retain power as the ruling party in the state.\n\nAccording to Obaseki, \u201cI want to assure our loyal party members that we are truly proud of what is going on in terms of registration, which is inching towards half a million (500,000) members in the State.\n\n\u201cOur leaders are working diligently, going round the state to register and revalidate members. By the grace of God, before the end of this month 10 percent of the population of the state will be PDP members.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see how PDP will lose power again in Edo State, provided we continue to provide services for Edo people,\u201d he added.\n\nCharging members and leaders of the party on the need to remain united so as to win future elections in the state, Obaseki further noted: \u201cThere must be party discipline going forward; we can\u2019t tolerate indiscipline and disloyalty to the party. If you can\u2019t get what you want, it doesn\u2019t mean the party must be disunited.

Oladimeji Fabiyi denies knowledge of the amorphous groups insisting that they are mischief makers being used by disgruntled individuals to advance their narrow interests.\n\n\u201cI would like to make it abundantly clear that the AASG which has the records of hundreds of credible and authenticated Atiku support groups nationwide and in the Diaspora does not know of such amorphous groups. Let it be known that these so-called groups are at best interlopers,\u201d Dimeji said.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, Atiku Abubakar is eminently qualified under the constitution of Nigeria to contest for any office in the land. Above all, he is experienced, competent and has the capacity to preside over the affairs of our country at this critical point of its life.\n\nIt is therefore ridiculous and malicious to see some individuals acting in ignorance of the provisions of the law.\n\nIt is, however, not surprising because at every political season such as we are in, we witness all sorts of political jobbers, paid agents and charlatans masquerading as groups to do the bidding of enemies of democracy. Indeed, Nigerians expect more of such shenanigans.\n\nAlready our intelligence has exposed the plot of these enemies of democracy to malign and discredit Atiku Abubakar in order to advance their narrow interests. Printed materials at UTC in Area 10 of Abuja are awaiting deployment.\n\nEven as security agencies are being put on notice of these nefarious activities, I call on Nigerians to ignore them as one can see that some of the reasons adduced by the groups are not only ridiculous, but lacking in substance.\n\n\u201cThe question that should be asked is who is afraid of Atiku? Everyone can see that Atiku is the issue in 2023; he is the phenomenon in 2023 that is why you see all the attacks from all angles both within the PDP and APC directed at him. We have seen how these desperate elements have gone to the extent of mass printing anti Atiku campaign items in Abuja which can never help them and their pay masters. For Atiku and his supporters it\u2019s about the real issues, it\u2019s about discourse on how to move Nigeria forward not about their shenanigans and inordinate ambition. Atiku remains the preferred choice of the majority of PDP members and Nigerians at large therefore, the attack by enemies to stall Nigeria\u2019s progress cannot stop an idea whose time has come.\u201d",

          "text": "Education is a leveller, as it makes citizens have choices, strengthens the office of the citizen, and develops critical minds needed to question duty bearers and bring them to account, which is essential for social justice. Ipso facto, education is a productive investment that is worthwhile; and one of the most powerful and proven vehicles for sustainable development.\n\nSadly, there are serious challenges facing schooling in the country, which stressed the need to strengthen the quality of basic education in Nigeria by confronting head-on those factors that deny children access to basic education.\n\nTruth be told, the current challenges affecting the educational system in the country have left much to be desired.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) indicates that the population of out-of-school children in Nigeria has risen from 10.5 million to 13.2 million, the highest in the world.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith the nation\u2019s current population of over 195.9 million, 45 per cent of which are below 15 years, there is a huge demand for learning opportunities, translating into increased enrolment. This has created challenges in ensuring quality education since resources are spread more thinly, resulting in more than 100 pupils for one teacher as against the UNESCO benchmark of 35 students per teacher and culminating in students learning under trees for lack of classrooms.\n\nThe link between education, democracy, and development was duly emphasized by Nelson Mandela when he noted that \u201can educated, enlightened and informed population is one of the surest ways of promoting the health of a democracy.\u201d\n\nParents who are financially incapacitated in providing the educational needs of their children in many cases are compelled to send their wards into child labour.\n\nSome state governments in Nigeria in tackling the menace have introduced free education in both primary and secondary schools to encourage more pupils and students to access basic education.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDespite state government efforts, some students and parents are bogged down with the inability to provide educational materials such as textbooks, school uniforms, pens, school bags, and other writing materials.\n\nPublic schools in Edo State just like other states of the federation are not exempted in these challenges which inform the decision of stakeholders, spirited individuals, and families to take upon themselves to make an impact and support the development of education.\n\nAs both the federal and state governments in the country continue to grapple with the skyrocketing number of out-of-school children, recently, the family of late Benin Billionaire and philanthropists, Captain Idahosa Okunbo, popularly known as Captain Hosa, on the 3rd of February, 2022, fulfilled the promise made to honour their late father, as they gave out scholarships to 100 indigent students drawn from public schools to mark the 64th posthumous birthday of the deceased.\n\nThe efforts according to them is to reduce the number of out-of-school children to the barest minimum, adding that the streets are known for breeding all forms of criminals and other social misfits who constitute the real threat to society.\n\nMost of the beneficiaries before now reside in Northern Nigeria where the activities of Boko Haram insecurity and banditry have disrupted their academic pursuit.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor other children, it is extreme poverty and lack of institutional support from stakeholders which has over time denied them of achieving basic education.\n\nThe decision by the family it was gathered was largely informed by the spirited effort of their late father\u2019s immense contributions and love for education.\n\nThe first child of the late billionaire and wife of the Olu of Warri, Olori Atuwatse III, who spoke on behalf of the Okunbo\u2019s while making presentations in Benin urged the students to emulate the life of her late father, who she said was not born with a silver spoon but made it through hard work and determination.\n\nQuoting the 2018 UNICEF survey she said the survey showed that the population of out-of-school children in Nigeria had risen from 10.5 million to 13.2 million, a figure she described as alarming.\n\nSpeaking further, she said the survey showed that there is still a huge number of those who are in school, but are learning nothing. She urged teachers to always pay keen attention to students in school.\n\nOlori, a wife of the Olu of Warri, who was flanked by her siblings, other family members, and heads of schools, said, \u201cCaptain Hosa was many things to many people. My father went to school in this city; my mother went to St Maria Goretti so I want to encourage you.\n\n\u201cHe was one of the children in the family of eleven, his parents were teachers so he was not born with a silver spoon but through hard work, dedication and determination, he rose to be a man of great impact and great value so I want you to take that as an encouragement.\n\n\u201cLook at him and know that this is the same Benin City that he grew up in and you are growing up in, you have all it takes to make an impact on the society.\n\n\u201cEducation is so important to us and we decided to put this together to mark his posthumous 64th birthday. We know we can do feeding but the food will get finished, we can build a road but the road will get bad someday and it came to me, why don\u2019t we invest in lives, why don\u2019t we transform lives, why don\u2019t we ensure that pupils can go to school so that the multiplier effects will felt.\n\n\u201cWe have touched one hundred lives today but I dare say we have touched a hundred thousand lives,\u201d the Itsekiri Queen noted.\n\nSpeaking earlier, the Olori\u2019s younger brother and first son of Okunbo, Osahon Okunbo, and Executive Director, Pipeline Infrastructure Nigeria Limited said Nigeria invested in his late father through earned scholarships and \u201che always referenced that to let people know that and wanted to always give back to Nigeria because of what Nigeria did for him and this is one way we can continue that and honour him.\u201d\n\nThe younger Okunbo urged the beneficiaries to immediately \u201cbegin to ensure that you are the best. Always give more than you take, try to be selfless, and for every decision you make, always ask yourself how that decision will benefit your community.\n\n\u201cIf all of us can do that, we will have a better state, we will have a better community and you will have embodied the values my father stood for.\u201d\n\nThe gesture from the family attracted representatives of the State Universal Basic Education, SUBEB, School administrators, parents/guardians who came to witness the presentation.\n\nOne of the beneficiaries, Uwaila Obasohan, a Senior Secondary, SS3, student of Itohan Girls Grammar School, while thanking the family of Okunbo said she had given up hope of writing her final examinations on account of lack of funds.\n\nIn a tear of joy, she said \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening to me. I never knew this kind of gesture would come my way. I\u2019m so happy now that I can pay my West Africa School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) fee and attend to my other educational needs. God will continue to bless the family\u201d\n\nThe parent of another beneficiary, Mr Wellington Ikponmwen who spoke on behalf of her daughter, Divine Ikponmwen said gestures of this nature are rare just as he thanked the family of Late philanthropist.\n\n\u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t know how to express my joy. I have never seen this kind of goodwill before, not just for one person but for many people. I just want to say thank you.\n\nThe provision of these cash donations was also extended to 20 students of the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) who were accompanied by the camp supervisor, Pastor A. Omogie.",

          "text": "How is the campaign going so far?\n\nSo far so good. We are moving around to canvas the support for the movement. There is no much to say but we will not like to reveal our strategy for any other person to go and adopt because I\u2019m Nigeria we have quite alot of people that are very good in trying to adopt what you have to move forward or as a your own strategy. So for now I can tell you that all is going on well.\n\nWhat is the selling unique point of Yari going into this contest?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe is bringing unity and cohesion to the party. He will bring everybody together to ensure APC wins the 2023 elections. He has done it before and you know that he can still do it. He was former national chairman of Nigeria Governors Forum which led to some people calling him junior president of the nation event though, constitutionally, President Buhari remains the president of Nigeria. But that expression about Yari came because of the way he led the governors of 36 states. So he has proven that he has done it before and he is going to do it again. Nevertheless, he is a party man. He was former secretary of the state government and party chairman in his state and he delivered fantastically. And because of the strategy he has put in place, we dethroned the sitting governor of PDP. So that proves he can do it.\n\nBut does he enjoy the support of the governors?\n\nHe has the support of other governors because they know what he did when he led them at the Nigeria\u2019s governors forum. Yari led them well such that he became the longest serving chairman of the governors\u2019 forum. So that shows clearly that all the governors will say they are with him.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAre you concerned that the rift between Yari and his successor will affect his chances?\n\nYou see, the party is open for all to come in. Yari whole heartedly accepted the governor\u2019s coming into the party but we accepted that there should be condition, that there should be a sit-down and agreement on issues but nobody called us. You cannot tell us that after Yari has built the structure, somebody who is just coming in yesterday will tell us that he is the leader, and that he owns party. Where does that ever happened? Can he win an election? Somebody who was just given mandate and you\u2019re telling us he can win an election. So as far as APC is concerned people are talking about who can help them and Yari has helped people. If he should go to Zamfara now everything will stand still. We are talking about people who know politics and you are talking about somebody who just start politics. He should have stayed in his own party, let him go and stay in PDP and face us. Yari is not somebody that can be played with.\n\nAs we speak there are people who are pushing for the zone to be considered for the position. Some are saying the North Central, some are saying it should to be for someone of CPC extraction. What is your position?\n\nI ask is it constitutional? Is zoning part of constitution? It is not. I know what happened to us in Zamfara. So nobody will come and tell us that they are zoning anything. They are not going to zone anything. Who gave them the authority to zone? There is nothing like zoning, they should give fair treatment to all. Everybody should be given enabling environment to contest, everybody should go and show his strength. So I do not believe in zoning.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhat of the about consensus arrangement?\n\nIf it favors my candidate then it is fine and good. I want it to favor my candidate.\n\nThere are those in your party who are saying that your candidate is not a good party manager going considering what happened in Zamfara in 2019 which led the party to lose all the positions to opposition party?\n\nAs far as I\u2019m concern Yari, is a good party manager. What happened in Zamfara was a calculated action to undermine us. I was the director general of the campaign. So I know what happened. So whoever says Yari is not a good party manager is biased because you need to go and study or ask about what happened before you can make that comment. So, as far as I\u2019m concerned, he is a very good party manager because we won all our elections. So everybody should be given an enabling environment to go and show his strength.\n\nThe issue of candidates with EFCC case has been rife. What is this thing surrounding Yari and the EFCC?\n\nI have never seen such because I was his chief of staff. The whole of his administration was done by me. Abdullazeez worked for his people. He developed Zamfara from grass to top. In the whole of that zone, nobody that did what Abdullazeez did. This is a political season anybody can attempt to paint him black by saying he has case with EFCC.\n\nMost of the said petitions were sponsored by mischief makers from within and outside the state. But they cannot be prove their fictitious allegations.",

          "text": "The personnel of Operation Thunder Strike, a Nigerian Air Force organization, have killed no less than 20 terrorists.\n\nFollowing a tip that the terrorists planned to target the Nigerian Defence Academy in Kaduna, Afaka, security forces started an offensive against them.\n\nAccording to a report by PR Nigeria, armed men riding over 50 motorcycles were observed approaching towards the military facility on Thursday evening.\n\nIn August 2021, militants attacked the Nigerian Defence Academy\u2019s Afaka Barracks in Kaduna State, killing a navy officer.\n\nAt the time, the armed men are claimed to have kidnapped two majors and injured several others with gunshot wounds.\n\nThe newest attempt on Thursday, however, was halted when gunmen were apprehended after a tip-off on their progress in the broad environs of the military school.\n\nAccording to reports, Nigerian Air Force helicopter gunships were ordered to engage the offenders who had taken off from Damari Village in Kaduna State\u2019s Birnin Gwari Local Government Area.\n\nThe bandits were spotted in improvised tents with roughly 50 motorcycles.\n\nA part of the report said, \u201cOn sighting the aircraft, the bandits started fleeing into the fringes of the forest. This brought about an objective and very decisive rain of hell from above on the miscreants as surviving bandits seen to be scampering for safety from the superior air presence were effectively mopped up.\n\n\u201cMoreso as it is customary, feedback received on Friday after the operation from both the ground forces and local sources, revealed that the bandits were effectively disoriented and suffered a loss of about 20 bandits.\n\n\u201cAlso, their plans of harassing and shaming the Nigerian Defence Academy and the Government of the day was effectively thwarted.\u201d",

          "text": "The Academic Staff Union of Universities\u2019 National Executive Committee will meet for two days at the University of Lagos, Akoka, on Saturday to finalize the union\u2019s decision on an upcoming strike.\n\nAccording to PUNCH, members of the ASUU NEC will make the ultimate decision on the strike \u2013 which will be reached by voting \u2013 at the end of the meeting on Sunday.\n\nThis comes amid claims that the federal government has refused to implement some of the union\u2019s agreements dating back to 2009.\n\nOn November 15, 2021, ASUU issued a three-week ultimatum to the Federal Government for failure to meet the demands.\n\nThe danger of a new strike by ASUU was amplified this week, after the union\u2019s direction to its branches to have lecture-free periods to educate the public about its demands and why another round of industrial action could be necessary.\n\nAs a result, the union declared Monday, February 9, 2022, a lecture-free day in order to mobilize its members ahead of what it described as the world\u2019s longest strike.\n\nSeveral union chapters embraced the instruction, holding several congresses in which they urged the public to hold the government accountable if the union went on strike.\n\nThe ASUU NEC will convene at UNILAG from February 12 (today) to February 13 to make a final decision on the approaching strike.\n\nMeanwhile, if the Ministry of Education and the National Universities Commission fail to resolve the conflict between the Federal Government and ASUU, Chris Ngige, the Minister of Labour and Employment, has promised to intervene.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe Ministry of Education is their employer and we have handed over the necessary tools to them. The major issue with ASUU now is the deployment of UTAS which is under the purview of NITDA which is under the Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy. The NUC also has its own role to play.\n\n\u201cMy role is to play a reconciliatory officer. If their employers and the NUC fail to reconcile them, then I step in as the reconciliatory officer. It\u2019s not more than that. But I know their employers are finding ways to resolve these issues.\u201d\n\nNational President of Parent-Teacher Association of Nigeria, Danjuma Haruna, appealed to President Buhari to quickly intervene to dissuade ASUU from embarking on a fresh nationwide strike.\n\nHaruna made this appeal in a statement on Friday, following recent threats of a fresh strike by many branches of ASUU.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cEmbarking on a new nationwide strike would definitely affect the educational system in the country. So many students would be forced to go home thereby increasing social vices in the country. Solving ASUU\u2019s problems would help to improve the standard of education in all the universities across the 36 states of Nigeria.\u201d",

He also told us that even when he overpowered the deceased, she told him that she will allow him only if he used a condom.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe first accused person also told the investigation team that in the process of having sex with the deceased, he removed the condom and the deceased started struggling with him again. He said while he was still on top of the deceased, she carried iron and hit him on the forehead.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe said that in order not for the deceased to shout, he Uduak-Abasi, now collected a black cloth and stuffed into her mouth and tied her mouth.

He told us that he became afraid as if she had already died.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe first accused also said he used the Jean trousers of the deceased to strangle her completely. The first accused told us that he now stepped out of the house and went to the compound, found a space and dug a 3-feet grave, and then went back to where the body of the deceased was, dragged the body with her jean trousers tied to her neck, to the dug grave.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe further told the investigating team that he wrapped her (deceased) body with a blanket and with her mouth still tied, and the Jeans on her neck and buried her in the grave. He further told us that the incident happened between 13:00hours and 20:00hours on the 29th of April, 2021.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe witness told the court that the first accused further told them that after burying the deceased in the shallow grave, he now went back to where he killed Iniubong Umoren and cleaned the blood and tidied up the place so that nobody would know what happened.\n\n\n\nOkeke further testified that in the course of their investigation and also an interview with the first accused, he told them that the second accused person, Frank Akpan, who is his father, was not around when the incident happened.",

          "text": "A judge on Friday ordered protesters at the Ambassador Bridge over the U.S.-Canadian border to end the 5-day-old blockade that has disrupted the flow of goods between the two countries and forced the auto industry on both sides to roll back production.\n\nIt was not immediately clear when or if law enforcement officers would be sent in to remove the demonstrators, who parked their pickups and other vehicles in a bumper-to-bumper protest against the country\u2019s COVID-19 restrictions and an outpouring of fury toward Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberal government.\n\nChief Justice Geoffrey Morawetz of the Ontario Superior Court said during a virtual hearing that the order would be effective at 7 p.m. to give protesters time to leave.\n\nWindsor police immediately warned that anyone blocking the streets could be subject to arrest and their vehicles may be seized.\n\nThe news was met with defiance by protesters.\n\nAt the Ambassador Bridge, an unidentified person grabbed a microphone and addressed them, asking if they wanted to stay or leave when the deadline rolled around. By a show of applause, it was agreed they would stay. \u201cOK,\u201d\u2019 the man said. \u201cLet\u2019s stand tall.\u201d The protesters responded by singing the Canadian national anthem.\n\nThe crowd later grew in size and intensity, with flag-waving and frequent chants of \u201cFreedom!\u201d More patrol cars moved in around the site, and police handed out leaflets warning that a state of emergency would come into effect at midnight.\n\nSince Monday, drivers mostly in pickup trucks have bottled up the bridge connecting Windsor to Detroit. Hundreds more truckers have paralyzed downtown Ottawa over the past two weeks; it was a party atmosphere there Friday night, when they even set up a concert stage.\n\nAnd protesters have also blocked two other border crossings, in Alberta and Manitoba.\n\nThe judge\u2019s decision came after a 4 1/2-hour court hearing at which the city of Windsor and lawyers for auto parts makers argued that the blockade was causing undue economic harm for the city and region.\n\nSupporters of the protesters, some of them truckers, argued that an order to disband would disrupt their right to peacefully protest vaccine mandates that hinder their ability to earn a living.\n\nThe ruling came in a day of fast-moving developments as federal, provincial and local officials worked simultaneously on different fronts to try to break the standoff with the so-called Freedom Convoy, whose members have been cheered on by the right in the U.S., including Fox News personalities, Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\n\u201cThis unlawful activity has to end and it will end,\u201d Trudeau warned just hours earlier.\n\n\u201cWe heard you. It\u2019s time to go home now,\u201d the prime minister said, cautioning that \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d for ending the blockades.\n\nAlso Friday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford declared a state of emergency and threatened heavy penalties against those who interfere with the free flow of goods and people.\n\nFord said he would convene the provincial cabinet on Saturday to urgently enact measures that make it \u201ccrystal clear\u201d it is illegal to block critical infrastructure. Violators will face up to a year in prison and a maximum fine of $100,000, he said.\n\n\u201cThere will be consequences for these actions, and they will be severe,\u201d Ford said. \u201cThis is a pivotal, pivotal moment for our nation.\u201d\n\nThe measures will also provide additional authority \u201cto consider taking away the personal and commercial licenses of anyone who doesn\u2019t comply,\u201d according to the premier\u2019s office.\n\nTrudeau called Ontario\u2019s decision \u201cresponsible and necessary\u201d and said he spoke with U.S. President Joe Biden about it.\n\n\u201cWe discussed the American and indeed global influences on the protest,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cWe talked about the U.S.-based flooding of the 911 phone lines in Ottawa, the presence of U.S. citizens in the blockade and the impact of foreign money to fund this illegal activity.\u201d\n\nTrudeau said that on some fundraising platforms, as much as 50% of the donations are coming from the U.S.\n\nHe said he and Biden agreed that \u201cfor the security of people and the economy, these blockades can\u2019t continue.\u201d\n\nTrudeau said he understands the protesters are frustrated by the pandemic, but \u201cthese blockades are hurting everyday families, auto assembly workers, farmers, truckers, blue-collar Canadians.\u201d\n\nThe protests have caused shortages of auto parts that have forced General Motors, Ford, Toyota and Honda to close plants or cancel shifts.",

          "title": "US: In Reversal, FDA Puts Brakes on Covid shots for Kids under 5",
          "text": "COVID-19 vaccinations for children under 5 hit another monthslong delay Friday as U.S. regulators abruptly put the brakes on their efforts to speed review of the shots that Pfizer is testing for youngsters.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration, worried about the omicron variant\u2019s toll on kids, had taken the extraordinary step of urging Pfizer to apply for OK of the extra-low dose vaccine before it\u2019s clear if tots will need two shots or three. The agency\u2019s plan could have allowed vaccinations to begin within weeks.\n\nBut Friday, the FDA reversed course and said it had become clear the agency needed to wait for data on how well a third shot works for the youngest age group. Pfizer said in a statement that it expected the data by early April.\n\nFDA\u2019s vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks said he hoped parents would understand that the agency\u2019s decision was part of its careful scientific review of the evidence Pfizer has submitted so far.\n\nThat information \u201cmade us realize that we needed to see data from a third dose from the ongoing trial in order to make a determination,\u201d Marks told reporters. \u201cWe take our responsibility for reviewing these vaccines very seriously because we\u2019re parents as well.\u201d\n\nThe nation\u2019s 18 million children under 5 make up the only age group not yet eligible for vaccination.\n\nRachel Perera, the mother of an 8-month-old from Los Angeles, said Friday\u2019s news felt \u201clike the rug just got pulled out from under me.\u201d\n\nAfter consulting with her pediatrician, Perera hoped a vaccine would be available this winter, or in early 2022 at the latest. The education policy researcher and her husband are caring for their child to avoid the unpredictability and risks of child care during a pandemic. But that means working on her dissertation for the Ph. D. she is pursuing when her child sleeps. On top of that, the daily calculations of risks, she says, have left her with \u201cdecision fatigue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just tired, and it feels like \u2018when is this going to end\u2019?\u201d Perera said. \u201cIt feels like people around us are moving on with their lives, and we\u2019re being left behind.\u201d\n\nVaccine experts had been concerned with the sudden race to evaluate Pfizer\u2019s vaccine \u2014 and now wonder what parents will make of the back-and-forth.\n\n\u201cI think they made the right decision to be careful and wait for the third-dose data,\u201d said Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, a former FDA vaccine chief.\n\n\u201cIt was great to hear that there might be some promising data from two doses but it came out as \u2018Hey everybody, you can expect a vaccine in a few weeks,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cI think this messaging gets very confusing for people.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first delay. Pfizer originally had expected to know by late December if the extra-low doses worked for kids under 5 \u2014 only to face a disappointing setback. Preliminary study results showed two shots were safe and strong enough to give good protection to babies as young as 6 months. But once tots reached the preschool age \u2014 the 2- to 4-year-olds \u2014 two doses weren\u2019t protective enough, prompting the addition of a third to the study.\n\nSo it was a surprise when a few weeks ago, FDA urged Pfizer and its partner BioNTech to go ahead and apply. Next week, the agency\u2019s independent scientific advisers were set to publicly debate if it was OK to start giving tots two shots before there was proof that a third would give them the extra needed protection \u2014 a highly unusual move.\n\nFriday, the FDA abruptly canceled that meeting, promising to hold it once Pfizer submits the third-dose evidence. Even if Pfizer completes its submission by early April, it will take the FDA and other health authorities several weeks to review and publicly vet the data.\n\nEarlier this week, FDA\u2019s Marks had promised the agency wouldn\u2019t cut corners but also noted how rapidly the pandemic was changing. Before Thanksgiving, no one had heard of omicron, by last month pediatric COVID-19 infections had hit an all-time high \u2014 and now cases are dropping fast as the latest mutant burns out.\n\nHow long to wait for new vaccine data \u2014 and how much to require \u2014 is a difficult balancing act for the FDA. It is caught between pressure to be more proactive against a rapidly changing virus and the risk that acting too quickly may deter families already on the fence about vaccinating their children.\n\nPfizer aims to give children as young as 6 months shots that contain one-tenth of the dose given to adults \u2014 two shots three weeks apart followed by a third at least two months later.\n\nThat\u2019s a smaller dose than youngsters ages 5 to 11 receive, a third of the adult dose.\n\nVaccination rates have been lower among children than in other age groups. As of last week, just 22% of kids ages 5 to 11 and just over half of 12- to 17-year-olds were fully vaccinated, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Nearly three-quarters of adults are fully vaccinated.\n\nA Kaiser Family Foundation poll taken last month found just 3 in 10 parents of children under 5 would get their youngster vaccinated as soon as shots were authorized, while about a quarter said they definitely would not.\n\nDr. Moira Szilagyi, the pediatricians group\u2019s president, recognized parental frustration but said in a statement that doctors were committed to \u201ca careful, robust and transparent process to evaluate the evidence.\u201d\n\nDr. Natasha Burgert, a pediatrician in Overland Park, Kansas, said, \u201cWe\u2019re just gutted. We need this protection for our kids.\u2019\u2019\n\nShe said some families likely feel relieved \u201cbecause they didn\u2019t want to make that decision without good efficacy data. Other groups of parents are just crying out, \u2018Give us a choice. Show us what you\u2019ve got and let us make a choice. Let us have access to it.\u2019\u2019\u2019",

          "text": "The United States is set to evacuate its embassy in Kyiv as Western intelligence officials warn that a Russian invasion of Ukraine is increasingly imminent.\n\nU.S. officials said the State Department plans to announce early Saturday that virtually all American staff at the Kyiv embassy will be required to leave ahead of a feared Russian invasion.\n\nA small number of officials may remain in Kyiv but the vast majority of the almost 200 Americans at the embassy will be sent out or relocated to Ukraine\u2019s far west, near the Polish border, so the U.S. can retain a diplomatic presence in the country.\n\nThe State Department would not comment.\n\nThe department had earlier ordered families of U.S. embassy staffers in Kyiv to leave. But it had left it to the discretion of nonessential personnel if they wanted to depart. The new move comes as Washington has ratcheted up its warnings about a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said a small number of U.S. diplomats may be relocated to Ukraine\u2019s far west, near the border with Poland, a NATO ally, so the U.S. could retain a diplomatic presence in the country.\n\nThe Pentagon announced Friday it is sending another 3,000 combat troops to Poland to join 1,700 who already are assembling there in a demonstration of American commitment to NATO allies worried at the prospect of Russia invading Ukraine.\n\nThe additional soldiers will depart their post at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, over the next couple days and should be in Poland by early next week, according to a defense official, who provided the information under ground rules set by the Pentagon. They are the remaining elements of an infantry brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division.\n\nTheir mission will be to train and provide deterrence but not to engage in combat in Ukraine.\n\nThat announcement came shortly after Jake Sullivan, President Joe Biden\u2019s national security adviser, issued a public warning for all American citizens in Ukraine to leave the country as soon as possible. Sullivan said Russian President Vladimir Putin could give the order to launch an invasion of Ukraine any day now.\n\nIn addition to the U.S. troops deploying to Poland, about 1,000 U.S. soldiers based in Germany are shifting to Romania in a similar mission of reassurance to a NATO ally. Also, 300 soldiers of an 18th Airborne Corps headquarters unit have arrived in Germany, commanded by Lt. Gen. Michael E. Kurilla.\n\nThe American troops are to train with host-nation forces but not enter Ukraine for any purpose.\n\nThe U.S. already has about 80,000 troops throughout Europe at permanent stations and on rotational deployments.",
