          "title": "We\u2019ll forward amended Electoral Act bill to Buhari this week \u2013 Lawan",
          "text": "The President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, has expressed hope that the National Assembly will pass the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill on Wednesday (today) and present it to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), for assent this week.\n\nLawan disclosed this in an interview with State House correspondents on Monday after a meeting with the President at the Aso Rock Villa, Abuja.\n\nHe, however, said that if the \u201ccleaning process\u201d took more than a day to complete, then it would be represented to Buhari early next week.\n\nHe said, \u201cBy the grace of God, tomorrow both chambers, the Senate and the House of Representatives, will pass the bill. And I hope that by the end of the week, the bill could be brought back to Mr President for his assent.\n\n\u201cI hope that but one thing I\u2019m sure by the grace of God is we are passing the bill, the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2010, tomorrow, Wednesday in both chambers, and we are happy that at the end of the day, we have been able to narrow down our differences and arrive at the very patriotic resolution that our country must have a new electoral law that will guide the 2023 general elections in the country, and Nigeria would have everything to benefit from this law.\n\n\u201cAnd for us in the 9th Assembly, the Electoral Act Amendment Bill is one of the primary legislative agenda that we wanted to deal with in the 9th National Assembly, and to the glory of God Almighty Allah by tomorrow (Wednesday), we will be able to pass that bill for Mr President to consent to it.\n\n\u201cI hope that the cleaning process will not take more than a day. But if it does, then it has to be early next week. But I\u2019m very optimistic that there is not much to clean up because normally, when we pass a bill like this, it goes to the legislative drafting unit of the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, specifically said on Tuesday that the electoral bill, from which the President withdrew assent, would be reworked and passed on Wednesday, and subsequently resent to the President.\n\n\u201cI remain convinced that the proposal for direct primary elections is valuable for building accountability in our political system. But we must not allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the House will reintroduce the amendment this tomorrow (Wednesday). And we will work quickly to address the mitigating concerns, pass the bill and send it back to His Excellency President Muhammadu Buhari for assent,\u201d Gbajabiamila said.\n\nBuhari had vetoed the electoral bill over the restriction of political parties to direct primary, insisting on the direct, indirect and consensus options.\n\nBoth the Senate and the House of Representatives had suspended action on the bill till resumption on Tuesday, after the Christmas and New Year break.\n\nGbajabiamila, in his opening address, restated the benefits of restricting political parties to direct primary while criticising the parties for lacking comprehensive membership registers.\n\nAccording to him, a strict direct primary option would have forced the parties to have a documented register.\n\nHe partly said, \u201cUnfortunately, that bill did not receive presidential assent, and it is unlikely that it will in its current form. Now, we have to choose between sticking to our guns regarding the provision to mandate direct primary elections for political parties or reworking that provision to save the rest of the bill.\n\n\u201cNow let it be clear to all that our only objective in introducing that provision was to strengthen the foundations of our democracy so that it works for all of our nation\u2019s people. The process by which political parties nominate candidates for election is essential, perhaps even just as important as the general election itself.\n\n\u201cA primary nomination process that deprives the majority of party members of the opportunity to choose who represents them in the general elections is susceptible to bad outcomes and ought to be fixed.\u201d\n\nThe Speaker noted the argument by some Nigerians that political parties do not have proper registers of their members, which was a reason to reject the direct primary option.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, it is disappointing that the failure of political parties to adequately document their membership is being used to not give the Nigerian people the power to fully participate in our nation\u2019s politics,\u201d said Gbajabiamila.\n\nGbajabiamila also decried the errors said to have been discovered in the bill, noting that the version transmitted to the President was different that the one being scrutinised by the public.\n\nThe Speaker said he had, however, set up a technical committee to review the legislation which is expected to report back by Thursday.\n\nGbajabiamila subsequently called for an executive (closed-door) session which lasted about 20 minutes.\n\nThe Senate, however, held its executive session before plenary.\n\nEmerging from the session, Lawan said, \u201cThe Senate postponed discussions on the consideration and response of Mr President on the Electoral Act 2010 (Amendment) Bill to enable us to consult with our counterparts in the House of Representatives and consult our constituents.\u201d\n\nElectoral Amendment bill: INEC to release 2023 polls timetable after Buhari\u2019s assent, says INEC\n\nIn a related development, INEC has said the passage of the contentious Electoral Act Amendment Bill will determine its preparation for the 2023 polls.\n\nYakubu bared his mind in Abuja during the first quarterly meeting of INEC with political parties in 2022.\n\nAccording to him, the commission is looking forward to the speedy passage of the bill.\n\nHe said that the commission would release the timetable for 2023 elections immediately the President signs the bill.\n\n\u201cOn the Electoral Amendment Bill currently before the National Assembly, the commission is encouraged by the Senate President\u2019s assurance to give priority attention to the bill when the National Assembly reconvenes from its recess today, and the commitment by the President to assent to the Bill as soon as the issue of mode of primaries by political parties is resolved.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to a speedy passage of the bill, which is crucial to our preparations for future elections. As soon as it is signed into law, the commission will quickly release the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 general elections based on the new law\u201d, Yakubu said.\n\nThe INEC chairman said 2022 would be a very busy year for the commission and the political parties, with the 2023 general election just 396 days away, adding that all the critical preparations must be concluded this year.\n\nOn the Continuous Voter Registration, Yakubu said that as at Monday January 17 a total of 8,260,076 eligible Nigerians commenced the online pre-registration, completed the registration physically or applied for transfer to new voting locations, replacement of their Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards or updated their voter information records as required by law.\n\nResponding on behalf of the political parties, the National Chairman of the Inter Party Advisory Council, Yabagi Sani, said the successes recorded in the last Anambra State governorship elections and the deployment of technologies aided the success of the election. ,,\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Hoodlums, suspected to be members of the Indigenous People of Biafra, on Tuesday, stormed the St Theresa Catholic Church, Calcutta Parish, Awada, near the Ukaegbu junction, Onitsha, in a bid to enforce the sit-at-home directive.\n\nThe young men in their large numbers were said to be heavily armed with machetes and kegs of fuel and caused a stampede in the church as members, who had gathered for a service, ran helter-skelter.\n\nThe hoodlums were said to have approached the altar, where the priest, identified simply as Rev Fr Joseph, was conducting the 5.30am mass, and interrogated him on why he was conducting the service when he knew that their leader, Nnamdi Kanu, would be in court.\n\nIt was gathered that the priest answered them in a diplomatic manner by telling them, \u201cYes, we are in church to pray for Kanu.\u201d\n\nAn eyewitness said the men, after interrogating the priest for several minutes, walked round the church and left.\n\n\u201cAfter walking round the church and seeing that the people, who came for the morning mass had fled, the boys left and on their way, they met a tricycle operator at the Ukaegbu junction, who was waiting for passengers, they ordered him out and burnt his keke,\u201d the eyewitness said.\n\nMajor roads were deserted and markets and motor parks were locked up, while banks remained shut in Onitsha.\n\nThe youths, chanting Biafra songs, were seen making bonfires on major roads and streets of Onitsha and discussing sundry issues.\n\nSchools in Owerri were shut on Tuesday in compliance with the sit-at-home directive of IPOB.\n\nSome private schools are scheduled to reopen today (Wednesday), while students of public schools have been asked to resume on Thursday.\n\nThere was reduced vehicular movement in parts of Owerri such as the MCC Road, while major business premises remained closed.\n\nPetty traders and mini shop owners, however, partially opened for business despite the directive.\n\nMotor parks, markets, malls and bus stops in Owerri and environs fully complied with the sit-at-home order.\n\nThe popular Relief Market and the Lagos/Abuja motor park along Egbu Road, as well as the state-owned Imo Transport Company, all in Owerri, were on total lockdown.\n\nAlso, popular malls such as the Everyday Supermarket in Ikenegbu and bus stops such as the Fire Service roundabout remained empty.\n\nHuman and vehicular movement in the areas monitored by one of our correspondents was low as security agents were not sighted on the streets.\n\nEconomic and social activities were grounded in Enugu, the capital of Enugu State, and its environs on Tuesday as a result of the solidarity sit-at-home order by IPOB for their leader, Kanu.\n\nThe residents were on Monday compelled to observe the sit-at-home following the violence that broke out last week in some parts of the state capital and its suburbs.\n\nOne of our correspondents, who monitored the development in Enugu, observed that markets, schools, motor parks, supermarkets, malls, shops, restaurants and banks as well government offices were shut to members of the public.\n\nMajor highways and streets were all deserted. There were no security personnel at all the checkpoints around the state capital, which normally constitute gridlock in the city centre.\n\nDespite the absence of security personnel around the city, there was no reported incident of violence.\n\nCommercial transport operators, including bus drivers and tricycle operators, withdrew their services, while some private vehicle owners plied the roads in the city centre with utmost caution.\n\nA resident, Mrs Christiana Ogbu, said security agents and governors of the South-East observed the sit-at-home.\n\nIn Aba and Umuahia, Abia State, the observance of the sit-at-home was near total.\n\nThough no movement of security agents were seen, stores were closed and the streets were empty of human and vehicular traffic till late in the evening,\n\nIn Umuahia, the compliance lasted till around 2pm when some vehicles started showing up, while in Aba, it was total.\n\nKanu declines to take plea, accuses FG of ambush, supporters, security agents clash\n\nKanu, on Tuesday at the Federal High Court in Abuja, declined to take his plea on the 15 counts of terrorism filed against him by the Federal Government.\n\nHe accused the Federal Government of ambushing him with the fresh charges served on him late on Monday.\n\nKanu, through his new lead counsel and human rights lawyer, Dr Mike Ozekhome (SAN), alleged that the government had breached the principle of fair hearing with the way and manner the new charges were brought to them.\n\nDuring the resumed trial, Ozekhome complained that the fresh charges were the sixth in the series, adding that his client could not proceed to take plea on charges he had not studied to prepare for the defence as required by law.\n\nHe stated, \u201cMy Lord, as I am talking now, Kanu does not know the charges yet. He is just interacting with me. He cannot be made to take plea to charges he has not seen.\n\n\u201cThe principle of fair hearing is just being violated by the Federal Government. The frail-looking Kanu standing in the dock there has not been allowed access to his family as directed by this honourable court.\u201d\n\nOzekhome claimed that the proof of evidence was not legible enough for their understanding of the fresh charges.\n\nHe added, \u201cI went to the DSS to see him and I was almost stripped naked before I could see him.\n\n\u201cWe pray that the arraignment be adjourned till tomorrow (Wednesday) to enable his lawyers to study the new charges along with him in the interest of Justice.\u201d\n\nThe request for adjournment was not opposed by the prosecuting counsel, Shuaib Labaran.\n\nJustice Binta Nyako fixed today (Wednesday) for the arraignment.\n\nShe ordered that Kanu and his lawyers be allowed to have interface in the courtroom before he would be taken into the DSS custody.\n\nEarlier, Kanu had through his lawyer complained of poor feeding, clothing and denial to practice the religion of his choice.\n\nJustice Nyako, in response, reminded him that the detention facility \u201cis not a five-star hotel,\u201d but ordered that Kanu be allowed to come to court today (Wednesday) in new clothes.\n\nThe judge declined the request that an American lawyer, Bruce Fein, be allowed into the courtroom to observe the trial.\n\nAccording to her, the request will be granted upon a written application and approval by the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court.\n\nKanu was welcomed into the courtroom by five members of his family and he took time to exchange pleasantries with journalists and members of his legal team.\n\nEarlier, the supporters of Kanu and security operatives clashed outside the courtroom.\n\nOperatives of the Department of State Services and the Nigeria Police Force barred some journalists and lawyers from entering the court premises.\n\nThe PUNCH reports that Kanu\u2019s supporters had assembled opposite the Federal High Court chanting \u201cHoly, Holy, Holy, Nnamdi Kanu is another saviour.\u201d\n\nThe supporters also called on God to set the IPOB leader free, but security operatives pursued them.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\n\u2013 Decries \u2018pathetic national maladies\u2019\n\nBy Ibrahim Hassan-Wuyo\n\nA group, the Good Governance League of Nigeria ( GGL-N) has thrown its weight behind Governor Emmanuel Udom of Akwa Ibom State ahead of the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe group in a communique said it was committed to backing the deepening of democracy, proactive and result-oriented leadership for Nigeria, we have held an enlarged meeting of the Coalition of civil societies in Abuja to review the State of the Nation and the future of our nation\u2019s civil rule in general.\n\nComrade Balarabe Rufai, the convener of the group, signed the Communiqu\u00e9 which was issued to journalists.\n\nThey said : \u201cThe Good Governance League of Nigeria(GGL-N) is the convener of this enlarged meeting, while 19 others are like-minded groups, associations eveready to promote civil rule by all legitimate means and reflect all Northern States.\n\n\u201cHaving critically examined the State of the Nation, notably the growing insecurity, economic instability and associated problems, we have observed critical areas that require urgent attention:\n\n\u201d In view of the prevailing confusion on the weakening value of our National currency, high inflation rate; 34% increase of unemployment rate; over N4trillion domestic and foreign debt; increase in PMS and Gas pump price; unpaid pensions and protracted insurgency, banditry and kidnappings, it is noticeable that Nigerians have had enough.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that these pathetic national maladies are mainly brought about by poor leadership choice and fraudulent elections in which moneybags who are over 70 years dominate State, Local Government and Federal Government spaces as elected representatives.\n\n\u201d That all of our current challenges revolve around the desirability of searching for competent managers of this country and especially the economic superstructure. This nation cannot afford to look on, while its economy sinks, accountable leadership seems more like a mirage and a number of Nigerians seem to be struggling with a crisis of confidence, as to whether or not 2023 will offer a better alternative.\n\n\u201cDespite the current level of stagnation, there is seeming desperation by overly ambitious politicians in both the ruling All Progressives Congress(APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP), among others, to dominate the stage. But beyond these sharks, there are Nigerian politicians with proven records of good management of men and resources and the capacity to obliterate or, at least minimize conflicts in their domains. But they constitute a fraction of our current political leaders.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we share the position of Northern Elders Forum and former President Babangida, that in 2023 Nigerians should go for energetic, competent and credible candidates for the presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201d It is our conviction that both the elders and the former president were referring to politicians like Governor Gabriel Emmanuel.\n\nIn the end, the meeting has critically examined the above realities and a lot more. Following hours of critical appraisal, observations and counter-observations by stakeholders at the meeting, we have resolved as follows:-\n\n\u201cThe current helmsman at Akwa Ibom, Governor Emmanuel Udom should be supported to take a shot at the 2023 Presidency as someone with a proven record of good governance, who is methodical in approach to economic and security challenges in his domain. It is a well-known fact that, by his leadership of Akwa Ibom State, he has demonstrated that it is possible to turn around the fortunes of any society, with the right kind of leadership.\n\n\u201cThe Akwa Ibom Governor is on record to have the most violent-free State in today\u2019s Nigeria. No killings, no cult gang clashes, no kidnappings in the magnitude we see in many parts of this country today.\n\n\u201cIn terms of economic empowerment and revitalization, Akwa Ibom\u2019s Governor Udom Emmanuel has made a lot of spectacular moves. He pursued and is still pursuing vigorous empowerment projects, especially in rural areas. This effort has made hundreds of thousands of proud millionaires who are currently training and re-training others to become economically self-reliant.\n\nSecondly, when he became Governor, he started running the Akwa Ibom Airport with about five (5) airlines on the government\u2019s fleet at Airport. In his effort at expansion, he has now brought in Ten (10) more. Now, the Akwa Ibom airport has 15 aircraft competing for space. He has also rehabilitated the runway and roads linking the airport to communities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Governor has also been executing multimillion naira infrastructural projects since his inauguration into office non-stop.\n\n\u201d In terms of managing the political leadership, holding the rungs of power in the State, he has also made some indelible footprints. And this partly explains why you hardly read the news of Executive/Legislature rift or uncontrollable internal political party bickering in Akwa Ibom State.\n\n\u201d It is our conviction that this nation, more than all else, needs a true game-changer with past experience of tackling crisis situations \u2013 whether political or economic. He should be a leader with exposure to domestic and international standards of good governance and realistic development policies. Such a leader must have a good grasp of the political economy in a highly-competitive world. We dare say that this governor \u2014 being a trained economist has the capacity to turn around the fortunes of this country. It is already familiar knowledge to all, that economists are the most versatile.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn conclusion\u2026without prejudice to the right of other Nigerians to contest the nation\u2019s presidency in 2023, we believe Governor Emmanuel Udom has the capacity to deliver on his mandate that would be freely given by the Nigerian electorate in 2023 and even beyond.\u201d",

If you miss that area, if your polytechnics does not have the capacity to develop skills or the entrepreneural ability of its students and researchers, then it has failed the nation.\n\n\u201cThat is athe area that has been very worrisome for us each time will reflect. It is very embarrassing that in Nigeria, if you go to construction sites, it has improved recently, believe me, Some ten years back, you will to likely to see Francophone personnel that are at construction site more than Nigerians, that shows something is missing, but the polytechnics are trying to address it,\u201d Bogoro said.\n\nWhile saying the Centres of Excellence in the colleges of education will focus on relevant pedagogical development, the TETFund boss said beneficiary centre will get about two million dollars.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, which also had in attendance experts from the World Bank-sponsored African Centres of Excellence in universities, Executive Secretary of National Board for Technical Education (NBTE), Prof. Idris Muhammad Bugaje, commended Bogoro for his passion for institutionilisation of Research and Development.\n\nBugaje, who said Bogoro\u2019s name would be written in gold if the history of the country\u2019s academic community will being written, said polytechnics must wake up to their responsibility of producing skilled manpower in the country.\n\nThe NBTE boss expressed serious concerns that most major infrastructure projects in the country are being dominated by skilled personnel from other countries.\n\n\u201cThere is need for our polytechnics to be focused on skills training, that is why we say from 2023, NBTE shall never go for any accreditation to any polytechnic where there is not a single skills training centre,\u201d Bugaje said.\n\nRecall that TETFund had recently established Centres of Excellence in six polytechnics and six colleges of education.\n\nThe beneficiary institutions selected equally from each of the six geo-political zones in the country are; Federal Polytechnic Nasarawa, Nasarawa State; Federal College of Education, Pankshin, Plateau State (North Central), Federal Polytechnic, Bauchi, Bauchi State, Federal College Education, Yola, Adamawa State, (North East), Federal Polytechnic, Kaduna, Kaduna State, Federal College of Education, Zaria, Kaduna State (North-West).\n\nThe South-East has Federal Polytechnic, Nekede, Imo State and the Alvan Federal of Education, Owerri, Imo State.

The drive to revamp the quality output of higher education in Nigeria rest squarely on the shoulders of prominent citizens like you.\n\n\u201d We are confident that you will bring your wealth of experience, adherence to and respect for the rule of law and due process to bear in the discharge of your duties.\n\n\u201cYour choice for this important assignment is a testimony of your records of successful endeavours in the past, either in your private or public capacity. You stand among Nigerians who have recorded tremendous achievements in life, and have garnered vast experiences which you are now willing to deploy in the service of our father fand. I, therefore, wish to express the appreciation of President Muhammadu Buhari to you all for accepting, once again, to serve our dear country.\u201d\n\nNoting that:\u201dIn accordance with the law, Council shall be the governing body of the institution with powers of general control and superintendence over the policy, finances, and properties of the institution\u201d, the minister reminded them that:\u201dThe tenure of the Council is three years from the date of inauguration.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, essential that you familiarise yourselves with the specific law establishing your institution as well as with other relevant laws of the Federation. I urge you to exercise this power with utmost sense of responsibility and in the best interest of your institution.\n\n\u201cJust as it is important for you to identify your functions, powers and privileges as a Council, it is also imperative that you know the limits of such powers and how best to avoid situations of conflict in discharging your duties.\n\n\u201d I want to, particularly, draw your attention to the provisions of the Public Procurement Act (PPA) 2007. Prior to the enactment of this Act, the Governing Councils of Tertiary institutions were responsible for procurement matters, through the Council\u2019s Tenders Board. However, with PPA 2007, the Chief Executives of all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAS) took over the responsibility for procurement matters.\n\n\u201d Thus, in the Polytechnics the Rectors and his/her Management are responsible for procurement while in the Colleges of Education, the Provosts and his/her Management teams are in charge of procurement. The Chief Executive is, however, expected to brief the Governing Councils regularly on all procurements, as it is done on all financial and other matters.\n\n\u201cAll chairmen and members of the Governing Councils need to take due cognisance of this, as it had, in the past, led to unnecessary frictions between the councils and Managements of some polytechnics and colleges of education,\u201dhe said.\n\nNoting also that,\u201dPoor management of funds remains major operational constraint in the sector\u201d, the minister said:\u201d It is expected that the limited funds allocated by government should be judiciously utilised.\u201d\n\n\u201d Also it is evident that government cannot provide all the funds required to run federal polytechnics and colleges of education, councils should think out of the box and endeavour to generate more revenue, outside government allocations,\u201dhe added.\n\nHe spoke further:\u201d In this regard, Councils should enlist the support of philanthropic organisations, individuals and other sources of revenue through endowment for additional funding of their institutions.\n\n\u201d It is expected that Councils will respect the Principle of Federal Character in the appointment of members of staff. Some Polytechnics and Colleges of Education have become parochial and primordial enclaves and the concept of universalism in education has been jettisoned, especially in matters regarding staff employment. The councils should work with the Federal Character Commission to ensure compliance.\n\n\u201cCouncils should also adopt best practices and comply with statutory guidelines in the performance of their supervisory functions.\u201d",

Aniekpon Ekpo, over alleged gross misconduct and misappropriation of funds.\n\nThe House also directed the Vice Chairman of the Council, Hon. Mercy Bassey, to take over from the suspended chairman in acting capacity, pending the conclusion of investigation into the matter.\n\nThis followed a report of the House Committee on Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs led by the Chairman, Rt. Hon.

During the committee meetings, weightier allegations/petitions bordering on outright abuse of office and gross misconduct by the chairman would normally be submitted to the committee on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cThe grader purportedly returned to the council by the chairman is different from the grader belonging to Mkpat Enin Local Government Council.\u201d\n\nAfter considering the report at the Committee of the Whole, the House ordered the chairman to return the council grader with immediate effect.\n\n\u201cDue to the obvious interference and plethora of fresh and weighty petitions against the Chairman of Mkpat Enin Local Government Council bordering on fraud, the House ordered the immediate suspension of the Chairman, pending the outcome of investigations of the Ad-hoc Committee set up by the Speaker.\n\nIn his remarks, the Speaker, Rt. Hon. Aniekan Bassey, directed the Clerk of the House, Mrs Mandu Umoren to communicate the resolution of the House to the Executive Governor.",

          "title": "Excitement as The Sun begins 2022 with praises, thanksgiving",
          "text": "By Job Osazuwa\n\nIt was undiluted excitement as the management and staff of The Sun Publishing Limited, yesterday, gathered at the company\u2019s headquarters in Kirikiri, Lagos, to praise God and give thanks for sustaining the organisation for 19 years.\n\nThe theme of the celebration was \u201cGod Never Fails.\u201d The service afforded members of staff the opportunity to renew their hope for a better year.\n\nThe company\u2019s annual thanksgiving service and staff award is a way of beginning every new year and committing the organisation\u2019s activities into God\u2019s hands for divine guidance. It has become a tradition for the company and an event that every staff looks forward to.\n\nFor the 19th time, the employees, particularly those in Lagos, didn\u2019t disappoint, as they turned out in their large numbers to start year 2022 on a glorious note. Indeed, the glory of God was again made manifest as they all appreciated God\u2019s uncountable blessings, grace and mercies on the company and staff in 2021.\n\nLeading the thanksgiving was the pastor in charge of Missions and Network at the Citadel Global Community Church (formerly Latter Rain Assembly), Christian Ike. He assured The Sun Publishing Limited that it would continue to shine not only within Nigeria but across the world. He prayed that no power would be able to bring down the company or stop it from shining.\n\nAt 10.10am, the Sun\u2019s Christian Fellowship choir set the ball rolling by charging the atmosphere with soul-lifting praise and worship songs. The staff spontaneously raised their voices to high heavens as they danced and acknowledged God\u2019s might.\n\nAfter he had taken the first Bible reading from Joshua 21, verse 43 to 45, the managing director and editor-in-chief of The Sun Publishing Limited, Mr. Onuoha Ukeh, expressed delight at being part of the workforce that witnessed another thanksgiving service.\n\nMr. Iheanacho Nwosu, editor, Daily Sun, read the second Bible reading from Psalms 100, verse one to five.\n\nUkeh stated that holding the event on a Tuesday, as against Friday, which had been the case in the past, was not by mistake. He announced that it was on January 18, 2003, that the first copy of The Sun Newspaper hit the newsstand.\n\nSaid he: \u201cIn June that same year, The Sun went daily. So, it is happy anniversary to all of us. It is the Lord\u2019s doing. We were looking at Friday this week to hold the event but the man of God (Pastor Tunde Bakare) we invited gave us January 18. He was not aware that January 18 was our anniversary. As they say, when the spirit directs, we mortals follow.\n\n\u201cIt has been 19 years of good news. We have seen the good, the bad and the ugly, but we are still standing and The Sun is shining. This is a tradition that started many years ago that we have religiously kept. At the beginning of the year, we gather to thank God for what He has done for us in the previous year. We commit the company into His hands to direct us and determine our fate, and God has always done it for us such that, even in turbulent times, we have overcome.\n\n\u201cIn the year 2020, when we gathered here to thank God for 2019, the world was on lockdown as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. There was anxiety when Nigeria went into lockdown in March. But we got a message at that thanksgiving, where we were told to fear not that the Lord was with us. We didn\u2019t fear and that year came and went and we stood still.\n\n\u201cLast year, a man of God came here and prayed and said that the year would be like never before. It manifested. We saw it.\u201d\n\nStill thanking God for His faithfulness, Ukeh recalled how the organisation, in 2021, broke a world record by publishing over 250 pages of adverts in a single day. He admitted that it was God who made it happen despite the fact that the staff might have put in their best.\n\nOn that note, with a standing ovation, he ushered in the anointed guest speaker, Pastor Ike.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nThe man of God apologised on behalf of his principal, Bakare, for his inability to make it to the thanksgiving service, saying the renowned pastor would have loved to be present, having benefitedfrom the immensurable goodwill of the newspaper.\n\nHe congratulated The Sun on its 19th anniversary, quoting Psalms 90, verse 12, which says: \u201cTeach us to number our days that we may gain a heart of wisdom.\u201d\n\nHe explained that wisdom is the principal thing which can locate anything planted on earth for the benefit of man.\n\nThe cleric reminded the gathering that, despite the fact that the sun has existed for thousands of years, yet it waxes stronger. In like manner, he prophesied that The Sun would never diminish, even for hundreds of years to come.\n\n\u201cWhen wisdom plants you, you have nothing to be terrified about. You do not lose sleep. You will have confidence. When the Lord connects you, nothing can disconnect you, because you are connected to the source. All that you lay your hands to do you will prosper. His thought for us is not of evil but of good and He will bring you to an expected end,\u201d he prayed and the congregation chorused a loud \u201cAmen.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the theme of the programme, he said it was undisputable that God never fails. According to him, the theme is the revelation of God\u2019s nature, potency and power. He took the congregation to Psalm 8, pointing to how David appreciated God\u2019s uniqueness, attributes and promises.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s not in God\u2019s nature to fail and He has never failed. It is also in His nature to love us. That is why He has not failed The Sun for 19 years. There is nothing too difficult for God to do because He is supreme.\u201d\n\nHe charged the company to sustain the tradition of always thanking God for His faithfulness. He assured them that God would continue to make His goodness and mercies available as they sail through 2022.\n\nHe analyzed Psalm 103, from verse one to the end, saying that God is slow to anger and making His mercies available to those who fear Him.\n\nLooking at the Book of Jeremiah, chapter 32, verses 17 and 26, saying He is great and mighty, stressing that there was nothing too difficult for God to do.\n\nHe also read Isaiah 55, verses eight and 11, saying He keeps His word and promises. He assured every believer in His word that He would fulfil His promises concerning His children. He said God can never lie.\n\nIke decreed that the blessings that God has commanded to The Sun Publishing Limited, no power would be able to reverse them. He concluded that the future of The Sun was safe and secure, despite the challenges that might come its ways.\n\nThe employees who had displayed diligence and were described as outstanding in discharging their duties were Job Osazuwa (Most Diligent Reporter of the Year), Akeem Adesola (Most Diligent Planner), Jelili Olatunji Alli (Most Outstanding Printing Staff), Andrew Omolola (Most Outstanding Pre-Press Staff), Sunday Okolo (Most Outstanding Technical Staff), Sanyaolu Olukunle (Most Outstanding Driver), Nnenna Shuaibu (Most Outstanding Advert Executive), Samuel Udofia (Most Outstanding Advert Production Staff), Uju Chiekezie (Most Diligent Account Staff), Jane Nwosu (Most Diligent Human Resource and Admin Staff), Clementina Ayino (Most Supportive Library Staff) and Chigozie Okeagu as Most Diligent Audit Staff.\n\nTwenty-seven staff members were rewarded, having served the company for 10 years.

It is guaranteed under both the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the African Charter on Peoples\u2019 Rights. I am here today because I believe that the charge against the Defendant is baseless\u201d, he added\n\nMeanwhile, the arraignment of the pro- Biafra agitator has been stalled following his objection to the fresh charges.\n\nKanu, who appeared before the Abuja division of the Federal High Court on Monday, accused the Federal Government of ambushing him with the new charge.\n\nHe accordingly asked the court to allow him time to study the new charge before his plea could be taken.\n\nHe was expected to take a fresh plea to an amended 15-count treasonable felony and terrorism charge the Federal Government preferred against him.\n\nThe adjournment followed Kanu\u2019s complain that the Federal Government failed to promptly serve him the fresh 15-count amended charge it brought before the court.\n\nKanu, through is team of lawyers led by a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Chief Mike Ozekhome, further accused FG of denying him the necessary facility to defend the charge against him.\n\nOzekhome, SAN, told the court that the amended charge was served on them, barely 24 hours to the scheduled hearing.\n\n\u201cMy lord, the proposed amended charge was served on us yesterday evening. As I speak to you my lord, the Defendant who was just brought in, has not even seen the charge which he is being told to enter his plea.\n\n\u201cWith due respect, that is not Justice. It is ambushing. I know that the Administration if Criminal Justice Act, ACJA, allows them to amend, but this is the 6th amendment they are making, and each time they do it, they serve us a day to the hearing, just to frustrate the trial\u201d, Ozekhome added.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

This one is almost off-white. Also make sure that you allow him to exercise\u201d, Justice Nyako added.\n\nIn the amended charge that was signed by the Director of Public Prosecution, DPP, M. B. Abubakar, and dated January 14, the IPOB leader, who hitherto faced a seven-count charge, was accused of attempting to use his broadcasts to \u201cdestabilize the fundamental political and economic structures of Nigeria\u201d.\n\nHe was further accused of inciting the public \u201cto stage a violent revolution in furtherance of an act of terrorism against the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the people of Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe Federal government also accused of illegally importing a Radio transmitter known as Tram 500L, concealed in a container of used household items which FG said the Defendant declared as used household items.\n\nThe prosecution alleged that Kanu had in furtherance of an act of terrorism, issued a deadly threat that anyone that flouted his sit-at-home order should write his or her will.\n\nFederal governments alleged that as a result of Kanu\u2019s directive, banks, schools, markets, shopping malls, fuel stations were not opened for businesses, with vehicular movements grounded in the South East region of the country.\n\nIt said the action amounted to an offence contrary to and punishable under 1(2) (b) of the Terrorism Prevention Amendment Act, 2013.\n\nThe IPOB leader was said to have \u201con or about the 28th April, 2015 in London, United Kingdom did in a broadcast on Radio Biafra monitored in Enugu, Enugu state and other parts of Nigeria within the jurisdiction of this honourable court, referred to Major General Muhammadu Buhari, GCON, President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as a paedophile, a terrorist, an idiot and an embodiment of evil, knowing same to be false and you thereby committed an offence contrary to section 375 of the Criminal Code Act, Cap C. 38 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004\u201d.\n\nHe was alleged to have committed treasonable felony, an offence punishable under Section 41(C) of the Criminal Code Act, CAP C38 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria\n\nHe was alleged to had between 2018 and 2021, through Radio Biafra, professed to be a member of IPOB, a proscribed organization in Nigeria, and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 16 of the Terrorism Prevention Amendment Act, 2013.\n\nFG equally alleged that Kanu had on April 22, 2021, in London, United Kingdom, on Radio Biafra monitored in Enugu and other parts of Nigeria, did an act of terrorism \u201cin that you incite the other members (followers) of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), a proscribed organization in Nigeria, to look for security personnel, their family members through a Radio Biafra on 102.1FM monitored through the IPOB Community Radio, and you thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under section 1 (2) (h) of the Terrorism Prevention Amendment Act, 2013.\n\nAttached in support of the initial amended charge dated October 14, 2021, included a seven-paragraphed affidavit of completion of investigation deposed to by one Loveme Odubo, a prosecutor in the Federal Ministry of Justice.\n\nFG equally lined up five witnesses to testify in the matter, among whom are officials of the DSS and one Ronald S. who was identified as the manager of a Hotel in Lagos.\n\nMeanwhile, security has been beefed up at the court premises and its environs, as all roads leading to the court have been effectively blocked by operatives of the Department of the State Service DSS to ward off possible threat to life and businesses by hoodlums.",

          "title": "The Thrills of Buhari\u2019s Visit to Ogun",
          "text": "By Bolu Adeosun\n\nThere are many reasons President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s visit to Nigeria\u2019s Gateway State on Thursday is a memory to treasure. His last visit to the state, made during the 2019 campaign period, had been all but pleasant: political forces intent on foisting an unpopular candidate on the people had turned the MKO Abiola stadium into a battleground, throwing objects at the Number One citizen in a fit of comedic anger. And recently when he postponed his visit, the naysayers jubilated to no end, saying that they had aborted the visit with their influence. But Buhari\u2019s coming proved just the opposite: he is his own man, he belongs to everybody and to nobody, and would not be railroaded into precipitate decisions. His interest is the good of the land and wherever he sees honesty, probity, transparency and accountability, that is where he goes. He attested to that much when, during the thick of the coronavirus pandemic, he turned down the request for N5bn by the Kano State government, saying that he gave that sum to Ogun and Lagos because he saw their sincerity of purpose in tackling the scourge.\n\nAnd so on Thursday, basking in the traditional warmth of the people that brought back memories of his days as a young infantry soldier, the president, who arrived at the Mojoda inauguration venue in Ijebu-Ode area at 11:37am and was received by Abiodun, governors of Yobe, Ekiti, Ondo and Osun states, among other top government officials, literally rode into the state in a blaze of joy. And he said just as much. As the chief host, Prince Dapo Abiodun, made clear, choosing the five projects the president would commission out of hundreds of projects was a herculean task. All his projects \u201chave the inputs and are informed by the needs of the people as expressed by them at different engagement fora that we provide. This is because we anchor our \u201cBuilding our Future Together\u201d Agenda on inclusiveness, equity, fairness, transparency, accountability, justice, and obedience to the rule of law.\u201d\n\nThe president inaugurated the Ijebu-Ode-Epe road , a strategic arterial road that links the Lekki / Epe corridor of Lagos State to the eastern corridor of Ogun State at Ijebu-Ode, provides a ready alternative to the Lagos/Ibadan expressway for those going to Lekki and adjoining areas, and which, in Governor Abiodun\u2019s own words, is set to boost socio-economic activities in the South East and South South zones of Nigeria through the linkage of the road to Sagamu-Benin Expressway for easier access by motorists to Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s largest economy. He commissioned the 42 km Sagamu Interchange-Abeokuta road, the main arterial road that leads to the state capital. It comes with a dual carriageway with streetlights, median and other road furniture, vastly redesigned and reconstructed to address the daily challenges being experienced by commuters, and to make commuting between the state capital and other parts of the State and, indeed, the rest of the country safe, secure and pleasant.\n\nThe president did not leave out the Gateway City Gate, an architectural masterpiece made of composite materials towering to a height of 27m and warmly welcoming visitors to the state, and neither did he fail to commission the two Housing Estates for low, medium and high income earners at Kobape and Oke-Mosan. Kobape has 300 units of one, two and three bedroom flats described as a \u201cSmart City\u201d where people can live, work and play, complete with solar streetlights, sewage system, primary health centre, drainage, water, electricity, tarred road and a police post. Kings Court Estate, located in Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta, has CCTV cameras, perimeter fence gated with security personnel, connected drainage and interlocking complemented by uninterrupted power supply, walkways, pipe-borne water, package sewage plant and recreational parks, among other features, and completed the five wonders Buhari officially unveiled for the good of the Ogun populace. Of course, there are many projects awaiting completion, including the first phase of the Ogun State International Agro Cargo Airport at Ilishan and the Atan-LUSADA-Agbara expressway which leads to Agbara Industrial Estate, the industrial nerve center of Ogun State, Nigeria and indeed, the entire ECOWAS Sub-region.\n\nThe Ogun helmsman could not hide his joy at hosting the president: \u201cSome naysayers had said, Mr President, that you were not going to come but I knew that you were going to come and I want to thank you personally for coming.\u201d And Buhari, baptized with a new name, Omowale, basked in the welcome by a large crowd. \u201cThe traditional hospitality of the people of this State has not waned a bit. Today, I am \u201cOmowale\u201d and very happy at this homecoming to meet my brothers and sisters whose goodwill I have always enjoyed. Thank you,\u2019\u2019 Buhari said at the Gateway City Gate. To him, the Gateway City Gate is not just a park beautification project, but one that depicts that something new is happening in Ogun State\n\nHe thumbed up Prince Abiodun\u2019s delivery of visionary and trail-blazing projects for the people, even in the midst of prevailing and challenging circumstances occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, adding that the lofty projects he commissioned could not have materialised without the state government\u2019s huge investment and commitment to security of lives and property, which he said had Ogun State one of the safest and most peaceful states in the country and investors\u2019 destination of choice. The president was particularly impressed by the quality and standard of the road projects, and the creative way the governor had deployed resources to reconstruct and rehabilitate them. His words: \u2018\u2018It is significant to note that the two road projects being commissioned today are federal roads. This is an example of constructive engagement, cooperation and collaboration between the States and Federal Government. These roads also fit well into our rail transportation masterplan that connects Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s economic capital to Kano, with Ogun State having more rail stations, along the Lagos-Ibadan rail corridor.\u2019\u2019 The housing programme of the Ogun governor, he added, fostered inclusiveness, cutting across different social strata and capturing low, medium and high income earners.\n\nThrilled, the president assured that the Lagos-Ota-Abeokuta and the Sango Otta-Idiroko roads would receive Federal Government attention, that the Federal Government would consider extending tax credit as funding option for the reconstruction of the roads, as done for the 100km Sagamu Interchange-Papalanto-Ilaro road, and would consider approving the reconstruction of Sagamu-Ogijo road by NNPC Ltd under the tax credit scheme. His concluding remarks will linger in memory: \u2018\u2018When state governments deliver impactful projects, in consultations with stakeholders, like we have witnessed in Ogun State, the trajectory of our national development will be enhanced.\u2019\n\n\u2019 That was spot on because, beyond these physical projects, the Ogun helsman has a series of fiscal and policy reforms, including the reinvigoration of the Security Trust Fund; establishment of Public-Private Partnership Office; the Ogun Digital Economy Infrastructure Projects, and the Ogun State Land Revenue and Management Systems (OLARMS). It is no surprise that Ogun State now ranks 4th on the scale of Ease-of-Doing-Business in Nigeria. And it\u2019s set to become number one very soon.\n\nAdeosun contributes this piece through boluadeosun@aol.com\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "What exactly is Web3?",
          "text": "Venture capitalists (VCs) and investors in Silicon Valley are saying the internet will evolve to become a place where users will be able to run their own servers, control how their data is used and shared by third parties, own digital property, and have access to a seamless and borderless payment system based entirely on the internet. But not many people have a clear picture of this great vision.\n\nTo explain it in one word, Web3 is all about decentralisation\u2014from platforms Meta, Alphabet (Google), and Amazon; governments; and the traditional financial system. By placing power in the hands of individuals instead, Web3 promises to deepen the democratisation of the internet.\n\nTo help you understand this promised new dispensation of the internet, let\u2019s take you through the origins of the previous and current versions of it.\n\nA brief history of the internet\n\nWeb 1.0 (Web1), the earliest version of the internet, existed roughly between the early 1990s and mid-2000s and was characterised by web pages that were static or read-only. This version of the internet was built by web developers to deliver mostly texts and graphics to participants, who could only consume the content but not interact with it. This version is considered decentralised because it used open-source internet protocols from the 1970s and 1980s, where anyone could build on them without permission from any quarters.\n\nAfter Web1, came Web2\u2014the version we have now\u2014which is a product of the Dotcom Bubble burst, where the initial rush of investments in internet-based companies yielded losses. This was historic as it helped filter out shams and highlight the real success stories, which laid the foundation for subsequent successful internet companies. While Web2 can be explained to be when the internet became an interactive and a social web\u2014where everyone with access to it could create content\u2014it is much more than that.\n\nA year and a half after the term \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d was popularised, there was still a lot of debate as to what it meant. At some point, it was even labelled a meaningless marketing buzzword. (You might have heard this said about Web3 now.)\n\nWeb 2.0 is characterised by tech companies that build their own platform on the free layer of the internet and lock it in while providing a rich user experience that prevents users from wanting to leave. In this version of the internet, apps are built in a way that allows users to become creators. YouTube, Google, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and other social media are some popular examples of Web 2.0 applications.\n\nWeb2 companies build sleek and revolutionary apps that become popular quickly, and as the app\u2019s popularity increases, so does its user base. While users can access these applications for free, they pay by inadvertently offering up their personal data, which Web2 companies sell to advertisers and sometimes political campaigners. Consequently, some of these companies have grown to become the most valuable in history\u2014in less than two decades.\n\nSince these web apps are controlled by a single internet company, users can only use them as long as the company wants them to. This is one of the reasons ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, decided to abandon centralised systems and, subsequently, create the widely used cryptocurrency. The Russian-Canadian programmer wrote on his personal website: \u201cI happily played World of Warcraft during 2007\u20132010, but one day, Blizzard [the maker of the game] removed the damage component from my beloved warlock\u2019s Siphon Life spell. I cried myself to sleep, and on that day I realised what horrors centralised services can bring.\u201d\n\nAll these confer so much power on these companies and make data breaches more dangerous and frequent. Additionally, governments have used centralisation to bully internet companies to censor or shut down the accounts of dissidents. This is usually because the government knows the exact company and centralised servers it is targeting.\n\nIs Web3 the next version of the internet?\n\n\u201cWeb3\u201d was coined in 2014 by Gavin Wood, president and founder of Web3 Foundation, and he said then that it was going to be the next version of the internet. At the time, Wood had just developed ethereum, the cryptocurrency whose prominence and market size is behind only bitcoin.\n\nWeb3 will be built on the blockchain\u2014a network of multiple servers (peer-to-peer nodes) working independently from different parts of the world. But what is truly enticing about Web3 is its strong financial implications\u2014also tied to cryptocurrency. Proponents of Web3 believe it will remake the way the world works\u2014reshaping organisations, money, value, rights, the internet, and even liberal democracy.\n\nAt the core of Web3 is decentralised finance (DeFi), which aims to take power away from traditional governmental institutions and corporations. The term \u201cDeFi\u201d was coined in a Telegram group by a community of software developers and entrepreneurs who sought a name for a new financial system that would be automated, outstrip traditional banks, and place a premium on individualism (as against institutions) by using a blockchain. As a matter of fact, black people are quite certain that DeFi or crypto presents the key to a better future for them. So, it\u2019s not surprising that they would seek refuge in a system that doesn\u2019t centre their exploiters.\n\nWeb3 intends to disrupt the way startups, businesses, and organisations are run, through decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs)\u2014a social community of like-minded people who create rules and regulations embedded in programming code called a smart contract and may issue governance tokens. In comparison to traditional companies, DAOs have a democratised organisation. The governance of DAOs is based on community. All the members of a DAO need to vote for any changes to be implemented.\n\nIn DAOs, decisions regarding the design of products and spending of funds can be made only if members vote and an agreement is reached. In September last year, the Blockchain Nigeria User Group, a group of blockchain developers, created one of Africa\u2019s first DAOs, called BNUGDao.\n\nThat brings us to decentralised applications (dApps), which are powered by smart contracts\u2014a decentralised network, instead of a single server. A dApp may feel like your regular app, but it uses the ethereum blockchain for data storage and smart contract for its app logic. Examples of dApps include OpenSea, Rarible, Metamask, Audius, etc.\n\nWho are Web3\u2019s champions?\n\nIn this thread republished as an article, Andreessen Horowitz partner, Chris Dixon, who has been called the \u201cKing of Web3\u201d, in an argument in favour of Web3, wrote: \u201cTokens align network participants to work together towards a common goal\u2014the growth of the network and the appreciation of the token. This fixes the core problem of centralised networks, where the value is accumulated by one company, and the company ends up fighting its own users and partners.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that Dixon\u2019s firm has invested a massive amount of money in cryptocurrency companies and stands to gain heavily from the success of Web3. This is, in fact, why some other tech founders like Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk believe that it is just a marketing ploy by rich investors to further enrich themselves.\n\nWhile some believe that the decentralisation that Web3 proposes will come from ethereum, at the polarising end are people like Jack Dorsey who believe that bitcoin, not ethereum, is the only cryptocurrency that is truly decentralised.\n\nOne more problem: This version of the internet could be difficult for ordinary users to adopt, as they would need high technical literacy to use blockchain-based internet products. That is why Nigerian crypto entrepreneur, Yele Bademosi, started out his Web3 development plan in Africa with Breach, a platform that uses newsletters, blog posts, quizzes, etc to teach Africans complex Web3 topics.\n\n\u201cTo those who don\u2019t believe, everything is too early until it\u2019s not. My general focus is on builders and believers. And through the products that we build and the traction that we will get, we get more believers over time,\u201d said Bademosi, who is also the founder of Nestcoin, an African company that is building in the Web3 ecosystem with products like a pay-to-earn-crypto game, Metaverse Magna; the earlier-mentioned publication Breach; and a DAO.\n\nAn internet version where it\u2019s easier to monetise content?\n\nIf you\u2019ve spent time on Twitter, you must have seen discussions on why Web3 technology, like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) powered by ethereum, are either useful or worthless evidence of ownership of digital assets. In case you don\u2019t know, NFT uses blockchain technology to allow individuals and artists to claim ownership and sell their digital assets.\n\nLast week, OpenSea raised $300 million and is now valued at $13 billion. The company, which was founded in 2017, hugely benefited from the huge investment in NFT that dominated last year and facilitated $14 billion worth of transactions, representing a massive increase from a now meagre $22 million recorded in 2020. It is important to note that OpenSea charges a 2.5% transaction fee and, this year already, trading volume has passed $1 billion.\n\nAfrican creators, like others around the world, have benefited from NFT: Nigerian artist Jacon Oshinachi sold 3 NFT arts worth $70,000 in just 10 days; South African artist Norman O\u2019Flynn sold the country\u2019s first-ever NFT for around $35,000 in March; and, in April, Kenyan marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge sold highlights of his career as NFTs for $50,000. Projects like Art X\u2019s Reloading\u2026, in partnership with digital art marketplace SuperRare, are part of an effort to support the unprecedented rise of NFTs on the continent.\n\nProponents of Web3 believe it is a perfect opportunity for content creators to monetise their content. \u201cBlockchain is going to allow information that shouldn\u2019t be free to not be free,\u201d explained Mike Novogratz, an entrepreneur who has half of his $700 million net worth in crypto assets.\n\nWeb3 wants to make it so that content creators make money. Web3 promises to give creators a fair share of what they contribute. By using the NFT technology games like Axie Infinity, Web3 has made it possible for people to make a living from playing\u2014as much as $2,000 monthly.\n\nAn opportunity for builders\n\nWeb3 is an opportunity to build an entirely new tech ecosystem crypto. \u201cWhen I moved back to Nigeria in 2015, there was a lot going on in the ecosystem\u2014community related activities, developers training programmes, early-stage investors putting money in early-stage founders. I think it\u2019s the same thing all over again. We need to build an ecosystem,\u201d said Bademosi.\n\nNFT gaming is a huge part of Web3, and like Metaverse Magna, Thrill Digital has built a crypto gaming product, Astra, that will allow players to win real-life luxury fashion.\n\nThese startups will go ahead to hire hundreds of designers and developers to build out these ideas. A huge opportunity such as this will create opportunities for developers on the continent and prompt more of them to learn relevant languages and stacks. This will increase Africa\u2019s chances of not only supplying the world with developers that can build emerging technology products\u2014as there is a deficit\u2014but also building out crypto-native products that will scale globally.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s new deal with Twitter is not a win for the government or citizens",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s new deal with Twitter is its government\u2019s most recent effort to control social media. While experts tell us that this is a failed attempt at the project, they warn that the deal will definitely have a bearing on internet freedom in the country.\n\nThe Nigerian government banned Twitter for 7 months and only lifted the ban last week after it claimed Twitter has agreed to certain terms. The social media company has, reportedly, agreed to register as a legal entity in Nigeria, pay taxes, and cooperate with Nigeria, through the Partner Support and Enforcement Portal, to regulate harmful content.\n\nTomiwa Ilori, an internet freedom researcher, says the Twitter ban sets a very bad precedent for internet freedom in the country, and if freedom of information requests and lawsuits seeking to get accurate, official, and economic explanations for the government\u2019s actions are not filed now, \u201cwe might have opened up the online right of Nigerians to express [themselves only according] to the whims of politicians.\u201d\n\nIn Nigeria, like in other parts of Africa, laws made by the government to regulate violent, harmful, and fake speech are used to stifle legitimate online speech.\n\nWhile explaining that he isn\u2019t aware of the exact law that the government relied on for the Twitter ban, Ilori said the Nigerian Communications Act\u2019s (NCA) long history of being weaponised to block access to internet websites makes it a prime suspect. \u201cMy guess is that they used the provisions of sections 146 and 148 of the NCA to get the telcos to block access to Twitter, as they have done in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne major issue with these NCA provisions is that the government gets to decide what is in the public interest or is an emergency, as the basis of their request to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). There is no judicial review, human rights impact assessment of proposed actions before and after such requests, or public access to requests made to the internet service providers (ISPs) by the NCC. It is also important to note that ISPs do not push back or carry out necessary assessments before compliance.\u201d\n\nThe lifting of the ban is not a win for Nigerians\n\nIlori explained that the lifting of the ban means that Nigerians need to start thinking about terms of legal reforms for online expression in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI think the portal could be a great avenue for bridging sides. Having a dedicated means of reporting speech capable of causing violence and harm by proximate actors could help forestall violence. But who are these actors? I ask, because Twitter and the government should not be the only ones determining the nature and type of expression that Nigerians are allowed to share,\u201d Ilori says.\n\nIlori believes that there is a need to expand the content governance arrangement to include civil society actors, experts, and activists.\n\nThe government memo which contained the terms of lifting the ban states that the Portal would serve as a channel for law enforcement agencies to submit a report with a legal justification where it suspects that content violates Nigerian laws.\n\nHowever, Ilori thinks that the government\u2019s power in the agreement is secondary and the actual moderation of content would lie with Twitter.\n\nIt\u2019s not a win for the government either\n\nFor Gbenga Sesan, executive director of Paradigm Initiative, a digital rights group, the government didn\u2019t score any points with the Portal, as it has existed for a while now; it only looks like a win for the Nigerian government because it hasn\u2019t used it before.\n\nAccording to Twitter\u2019s Transparency Report\u2014a report that gives insights into information and removal requests from around the world, by country\u2014Nigeria has made zero removal requests and just 7 information requests, at the time of reporting. However, India has made 12,435 legal removal requests, 67 court orders, and 12,368 other legal demands, representing 6% of global removal requests. According to the report, Twitter complied with 12.4% of India\u2019s requests.\n\nIn February last year, India\u2019s government enacted a fresh social media rule that made social media companies like Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, and others more accountable to legal requests. This law allows the government to tag content as \u201cunlawful\u201d while forcing messaging service providers to identify posters of specific messages.\n\nThis regulation has its origin in the Indian government\u2019s semisweet relationship with Twitter. The government asked Twitter to take down some content it alleged was spreading misinformation about farmers protesting agricultural reform. But, to the chagrin of the Indian government, Twitter partially complied and restored access to some of the accounts it had blocked \u201cin a manner that we believe was inconsistent with Indian law,\u201d Twitter wrote at the time.\n\nThis, Sesan said, was the reason the Nigerian government has repeatedly tried to enact social media bills. But failed. First came the Frivolous Petitions Bill, which seeks to prevent the spread of falsehood on social media, with jail time and a $10,000 fine. Like subsequent remakes of the bill, it was withdrawn, after 6 months of widespread public criticism.\n\n\u201cSocial media bills\u201d as they would later be called, have been resurrected, over the years, in the form of 2 other bills: the Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulation Bill and the National Commission for the Prohibition of Hate Speech Bill.\n\nBut Sesan says Nigeria\u2019s internet restriction tactics are miles behind India\u2019s because the latter drew up regulations; Twitter will only respond to legal requests backed by legislation. \u201cIndia drew up new laws on social media that were specific. Nigeria made similar demands, but there is no bill in parliament making that case.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "After 6 months, the Nigerian government has lifted the suspension of Twitter operations in the country following approval by President Muhammadu Buhari. The removal of the suspension took effect from 12 AM Thursday, January 13, 2022.\n\nThe announcement was made on Wednesday by the Chairman Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement and Director-General National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi.\n\nAbdullahi stated that the approval was given following a memo written by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Ibrahim to the President. In the memo, the minister updated and requested the President\u2019s approval for the lifting of the suspension based on the Technical Committee Nigeria-Twitter Engagement\u2019s recommendation.\n\nRecall that the Nigerian government suspended Twitter\u2019s operation on June 4, 2021, following the platform\u2019s decision to remove a controversial tweet by the Nigerian President, which it said breached the site\u2019s rules. The Nigerian government has insisted the suspension is a matter of national security and not related to the president\u2019s tweet.\n\nThe government\u2019s decision to ban Twitter triggered widespread criticism as online-based businesses recorded huge losses; lawsuits filed against the Nigerian government; and national assembly hearings held to probe the circumstances leading to the ban.\n\nMy heart and tweet goes out to all the small businesses that lost revenue and opportunities during the #TwitterBan. May you find creative ways to recover speedily.

The execution timeline for the conditions begins from this week.\n\n\u201cConsidering Twitter\u2019s influence on our democracy, our economy, and the very fabric of our corporate existence as a nation, our priority is to adapt, not ban, Twitter,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn wake of removal of the suspension, Nigerians have come online to celebrate the end of an era of using VPNs to access Twitter. They\u2019ve also pointed out that the suspension was unnecessary and wonder if the removal was incentivised by the desire to use the platform to campaign for the country\u2019s upcoming elections next year.\n\nNot FG lifting the #TwitterBan 13 months to election, so they can come back and use this same social media to campaign.\n\n\n\nAffliction shall not rise a second time.\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe#KeepitOn \u2014 QueenEsther Iroanusi (@QueenExtha) January 12, 2022\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloud computing in Africa hasn\u2019t caught on as much as in the West. However, there are clear signs that the market is growing. The cloud computing industry in Africa and the Middle East is expected to be worth $31 billion by 2026 from $14 billion in 2021.\n\nOn Wednesday, January 12, 2022, Nigerian cloud-based HR and payroll management platform, SeamlessHR, raised $10 million to take its business across Africa with plans of setting up shop outside the continent.\n\nNew players such as Y Combinator-backed Bento and Workpay is also proof that cloud-based computing is on the rise in Africa, though most of them are in the HR and payroll management sector.\n\nOrda is another emerging player providing cloud-based services. While they are common with HR and payroll management, Orda offers its services to restaurants and food business owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe startup is popping into the cloud-based scene with a $1.1 million pre-seed led by Lofty Inc Capital with participation from Microtraction, Norrsken Foundation, Magic Fund, Ire Aderinokun, and other angel investors.\n\nLaunched in April 2021, Orda was founded by Guy Futi (CEO), Adinlewa \u201cFikayo\u201d Akinwale (CTO), Mark Edomwande, Kunle Ogungbamila, and Namir El-Khouri. It is an electronic point of sale (ePOS) and restaurant management system that helps food business owners manage all their operations from one place.\n\nThe platform can take dine-in orders and orders from third-party apps such as Jumia Foods and social media apps. It manages these operations and gives customers relevant insights that help them make important business decisions to grow their businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to managing all restaurant operations, Orda also offers restaurants a lightweight website, mobile app, and inventory management system. It connects offline and online sales with inventory and provides data on supplies the restaurant is running out of.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, Futi said the idea for Orda came while the co-founders were looking to build restaurants that had the technology to support payments, transfers, and logistics.\n\nBut as they built, they realised the tech would be great for many restaurants, and they saw an opportunity.\n\n\u201cMany restaurants did not have the proper tools and software to run their business efficiently, and so thinking about it and going deeper into the problem, we decided to build Orda.\u201d\n\nThe platform essentially makes restaurant management easier, tracking everything that happens online and offline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the CTO, Akinwale, \u201cOrda was built after 18 months of a collaborative customer feedback loop. We listened to everything, from how African restaurants reconcile inventory, how customers pay, to how they handle logistics and more. We can confidently say that no one has done as much work as we have to build an end-to-end solution for our food business owners. We are excited to usher in much-needed digitisation to the sector.\u201d\n\nFuti, the former Managing Director at Jumia Foods, became familiar with restaurants in Nigeria and their challenges when it comes to management. This is perhaps why Orda added credit services to the platform, a service Futi says is growing rapidly.\n\nSince the startup became fully operational in June 2021, Futi said transactions and Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) have been growing 15% week over week.\n\nThe startup\u2019s cloud-based system is currently available in Nigeria and Kenya. However, it plans to expand across Africa with the funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

Be it bookkeeping, logistics and eCommerce, to a total overhaul of their operations, 2021\u2019s numbers showed these startups meant business.\n\nThis year, the trend has not stopped. Float, a Ghanaian fintech has raised $17 million seed to help, you guessed it, power small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The round was a mix of $7 million equity led by Tiger Global and Jam Fund, and $10 million debt led by Carius.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith slight tweaks to their approach, you\u2019ll find the likes of Brass, Kippa, Alerzo, Capiter, Sabi, and Payhippo playing in this space.\n\nMicro-lending platforms are waxing strong, but SME lending still remains a difficult nut to crack in Africa and really generous estimates in Nigeria put the gap at $28 billion. These SMEs account for the bulk of employment in nearly every continent and contribute a huge chunk to the GDP.\n\nThough there are potentially 44 million African SMEs to onboard, depending on the model these companies operate, this number could shrink when you narrow parameters to those who have registered businesses, own smartphones, and are computer literate.\n\nAt the end of the day, it comes down to those who acquire the right customers and find ways to make non-factors of the little hurdles I mentioned above.\n\nRead more: Ghanaian fintech Float raises $17M seed to power cash flow for commerce in Africa\n\nAsaak\u2019s raise to support asset financing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Asaak\n\nCrazy things are happening in Morocco: On Friday, January 14, 2022, Ghita Mezzour, Minister Delegate to the Head of Government in charge of Digital Transition and Administration Reform, announced the launch of the initiative \u201cMoroccoTech.\u201d\n\nWell, maybe not so crazy, but what\u2019s MoroccoTech? According to Mezzour, it is the national brand to promote the Moroccan digital sector. The idea is to position the country as a digital destination of choice internationally while creating a global dynamic that will benefit all Moroccan ecosystems in their digital transformation.\n\nIn 2021, Moroccan startups hit a record-high of $29 million in funding, perhaps an indication of the country\u2019s burgeoning tech ecosystem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was worse: In 2017, the Moroccan government sought a $50 million loan from the World Bank to close the funding gap for tech startups and going by this analysis, there was quite a lot wrong with the ecosystem.\n\nFrom a nascent private equity scene to lack of access to credit to restrictive regulations, Morocco\u2019s investment scene required some push. Personally, I\u2019m not sure most African countries were all that different.\n\nAt some point in the country\u2019s recent history, Moroccans could not enjoy the use of WhatsApp, Facebook, Skype, or even YouTube.\n\nThe launch of MoroccoTech should hopefully see more Moroccan startup success stories. At least, much better than has been heard in the last few years.\n\nTL;DR: Morocco is looking for outside investments into its tech ecosystem.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nHow Wiicreate is helping African startups improve brand visibility with branded merchandise.

          "title": "Inflation surge unlikely to raise interest rate",
          "text": "The first increase in Nigeria\u2019s inflation rate in nine months is unlikely to lead to a hike in interest rates when the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets next week.\n\nNigeria\u2019s headline inflation accelerated for the first time in nine months last December, settling at 15.63 percent in December 2021, from 15.40 percent in the previous month, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) show.\n\nThe NBS in a Consumer Price Index report released on Monday attributed the marginal increase to higher demand during the yuletide, which pushed prices up.\n\n\u201cDespite the uptick in December inflation, we do not expect this to have a significant impact on Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) Monetary policy,\u201d Razia Khan, managing director, chief economist, Africa and the Middle East, Global Research, Standard Chartered Bank, said on Monday.\n\nThe removal of COVID-19 era monetary measures later in 2022 will be of greater relevance than any (less impactful) monetary policy rate changes, she said.\n\nThe CBN kept Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 11.5 percent and other indicators unchanged at the last meeting in November following a sustained gradual recovery of key macroeconomic indicators. This is as inflation moderated for the seventh successive month, buoyed by a deceleration in the core and food components of inflation.\n\nTaiwo Oyedele, an economist and head of tax and corporate advisory services at PwC Nigeria, said the acceleration in inflation rate must have been as a result of the high demand during the yuletide, which was not matched with increased production and other supplies. This is in addition to the insecurity challenges across the country that continues to impact negatively on transportation and food supply, major components of the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n\n\u201cI do not expect the acceleration in inflation rate to impact on the MPC\u2019s rate decision at their next meeting given that the acceleration is likely to be transitory,\u201d Oyedele said.\n\nPressure on Nigeria to increase interest rates is likely to come from global rising interest rates.\n\nFollowing the highest annual US inflation reading since 1982, more Federal Reserve officials are signalling support for a hike as soon as March.\n\n\u201cThis implies that the MPC may raise interest rates earlier than anticipated,\u201d Ayodeji Ebo, head, retail investment, Chapel Hill Denham, said.\n\nRead also: Inflation may be driven beyond the projected 13% in 2022\n\nWhile the inflation rate was pushed upwards majorly by food inflation in December, there are several pressure points that will lead to higher inflation this year from taxes, removal of electricity subsidy, electricity tariff, and election spending, Ebo said. This will impact consumers\u2019 purchasing power and investors will be in search of investment with higher yields.\n\nThe headline inflation rate is expected to moderate to 15.35 percent, and 14.91 percent by December 2021 and February 2022, respectively, Godwin Emefiele, governor, CBN, said at November 2021 bankers\u2019 dinner.\n\nThe inflation outturn was mainly driven by food inflation, as festive induced spending drove the month-on-month (MoM) uptick to 2.20 percent (2x higher than November\u2019s MoM food inflation rate).\n\n\u201cWe link the food price pressures to the continued uptrend in Automotive Gas Oil (AGO) prices (+9.4% MoM), which might have translated to higher haulage costs for agricultural produces,\u201d analysts at CardinalStone Research, said in a report.\n\nThe report noted that core inflation increased marginally by 2bps to 13.87 percent YoY, reflecting continued price pressure on cooking gas and AGO. Notable price increases were seen on 93 percent of the core inflation sub-components, with alcoholic beverages, tobacco and kola (+55bps), and housing, water, electricity, and other gases and fuel (+55bps) leading the pack.\n\n\u201cAs highlighted in our 2022 economic outlook, we expect inflation to moderate for most of H1\u201922 due to the high base effect.\u201d\n\nHowever, the analysts said the base effect should begin to wane in May 2022, leaving legroom for price worries to become more evident on a MoM basis.\n\nNigeria inflation quickens for first time in nine months\n\nNigeria\u2019s headline inflation has accelerated for the first time in nine months, settling at 15.63% in December 2021.\n\nThe headline inflation is about 0.2 percent higher than the 15.40 percent in November 2021, but a decline from 15.75 percent recorded about the same period in 2020.\n\nAn analysis of the trend indicates that headline consumer price decelerated to 18.12% in April 2021, 17.93% in May; 17.75% in June; 17.38% in July; 17.01% in August; 16.63% in September; 15.99% in October, and 15.40% in November.\n\nAccording to the NBS, food inflation settled at 17.37% in December as against 17.21% the previous month.\n\nCore inflation during the period also slightly went up to 13.87% as against 13.885%.\n\nUrban Inflation for December was 16.17%, while November recorded 15.92%. On the other hand, Rural Inflation was 15.11% and 14.89% in December and November 2021, respectively.\n\nOn state-by-state comparison, consumer prices accelerated the most in Ebonyi State with 18.71%, while Kwara State recorded the slowest with 12.32%.\n\nOn the other hand, Food Inflation was highest in Kogi State with 22.82%, while Edo State was the lowest with 13.24%.\n\n\u201cIf you check the trend, you will discover the increases in the month of December, and that is because every Nigerian saves money for December purchases. So that has the tendency of increasing the prices of a lot of commodities, and that affected the numbers that are collected from the field.\n\n\u201cThat also explained why we could not maintain a trajectory of consistent decline in the numbers,\u201d the new statistician general, Simon Harry, said, speaking on the CPI report.\n\nOn the inflation projections for 2022, Harry stated, \u201cAgain, I will say that if you go through the trend you will discover that after the rise in December, the demand of goods in January begins to go down and as demand goes down, you discover that the price of goods begin to go down.\n\n\u201cAnd so that also has the tendency to affect the numbers collected from the field. So, we may return to a gradual decline from the month of January, which certainly will be below the 15.63 percent we are recording.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be able to mention a specific figure but I can assure you that as demand wanes, the inflation rate will be brought down.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s plan to take more loans from China to fund critical infrastructure might come to a halt on the back of the country\u2019s intent to cut lending to African countries as a result of the continent\u2019s rising debt profile.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping, while speaking with the triennial Forum of China-Africa Cooperation, held in Senegal last year November, indicated that China, over the next three years, would slash the headline amount of money it supplies to Africa by a third (1/3) to $40 billion with more emphasis on SMEs, green projects and private investment flows rather than large infrastructure, which was the former norm.\n\nThis came barely five-month President Muhammadu Buhari said it would continue to collaborate with the Chinese government in the area of provision of critical infrastructure June last year.\n\nFemi Adesina, special adviser to the president on media and publicity, stated this when he hosted Cui Jianchun, Chinese ambassador to Nigeria, in his office at the State House, Abuja.\n\n\u201cNigeria has high respect for China and what China is helping Nigeria to achieve, particularly in the area of infrastructure.\n\n\u201dPresident Buhari came at a time of severe infrastructure deficit in the country and resolved to make a difference and he is making that difference with the assistance of China. Nigeria appreciates China a lot for these and will continue to collaborate with it,\u201d he said then.\n\nChina is Nigeria\u2019s biggest bilateral creditor, Damilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst, stated, saying, \u201cA significant number of the country\u2019s big-ticket infrastructure projects are financed by China.\n\nRead also: Stanbic IBTC introduces Smart Loan to support customers\n\n\u201cAnd now that China is saying they want to cut down on these lending, it might affect Nigeria a bit in terms of getting cheap funds for infrastructure projects because the money they are getting from China is concessionary funds (long-term maturity at low-interest rates).\u201d\n\nLast year, Rotimi Amaechi, minister of transportation, said they plan to take more loans from China in a bid to extend rail services to more states in the country.\n\n\u201cWe raised funds from China to do the Lagos-Ibadan. Currently, we are doing Kaduna-Abuja from the budget, but we are yet to get the loan. We are still negotiating with China and we hope that before March next year, we should be able to get the loan so that we can continue,\u201d Amaechi said.\n\nFrom almost nothing, Chinese banks today make up about one-fifth of the total lending to Africa, concentrated in a few strategic/resource-rich countries, some of which include Nigeria, Angola, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Zambia, and Uganda.\n\nAccording to reports from the Debt Management Office (DMO), Nigeria\u2019s bilateral loans stand at $4.40 billion as of September 31, 2021. Out of that figure, China accounts for the largest share of 81 percent followed by France (11.9%), Germany (3.9%), Japan (1.6%), and India (0.7%)\n\n\u201cIt is not going to be a good one for Africa because it is another tactic of course. The kind of planning that needs to go into transiting to green energy is massive. A lot of African countries are not well planned for that now,\u201d Damilare Asimiyu, a senior analyst at Afrinvest Securities Limited, said.\n\nHe said in terms of our growth dynamics, it was not going to be favourable for us because we don\u2019t have the capacity to make that transition now.\n\nHaving dived head-deep into one of the world\u2019s poorest continents, Chinese lenders have grown more cautious as some nations have reached the limit of their borrowing capacity and the prospect of default looms large.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) lists more than 20 African countries as being in, or at high risk of debt distress.\n\nChinese banks have learned many lessons over two decades of lending to African governments. In the 2000s, they experimented with financing infrastructure in resource-rich countries, such as Angola and the Republic of Congo, by securing loans against oil or mineral shipments or future-derived revenues.\n\nRising African debt and the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic may force China\u2019s banks to adjust their lending practices yet again.\n\nBankers and lawyers however caution that a systemic crisis could overwhelm Chinese banks\u2019 attempts to protect their interests through escrow accounts and exemption from global debt restructuring deals.\n\nIt is going to be a major setback in infrastructure development in Nigeria, Ayodeji Ebo, head, retail investment, Chapel Hill Denham, said.\n\n\u201cWe depend significantly on them (China) to execute a significant number of our projects, especially now that we want to execute our National Development Plan,\u201d Ebo pointed out.\n\n\u201cIt is high time we began to look to other countries for loans,\u201d he said.\n\nAdding fuel to the flames, events from China\u2019s debt repayment debacle with Uganda last year served as a stimulant that accelerated the decision by the Chinese government to eventually cut back on lending to Africa.\n\nThe crux of the matter was centered on a contract signed six years earlier between the Ugandan government and China Eximbank; one which some Ugandan lawmakers, officials and lawyers said undermined national sovereignty.\n\nA Ugandan report last year even suggested that Beijing could seize Entebbe Airport (the country\u2019s main international gateway), a claim that echoed accusations of Chinese \u201cdebt traps\u201d and one forcefully denied by both governments.\n\nIn response, China\u2019s two main policy banks \u2013 China Eximbank and China Development Bank \u2013 thus adopted increasingly hard-line lending terms. The conditions have, however, proved difficult as pandemic-related economic hardship puts a strain on more indebted African countries.\n\nWhile some analysts draw a parallel with western financial institutions, including IMF and World Bank, which lent generously to African governments in the post-independence period only to impose harsh structural adjustment programmes on them from the 1980s after governments struggled to repay, others are of the opinion that some of the concerns over the contract clauses are overblown.\n\nIn both cases, however, all project revenues are currently channelled into China\u2019s debt repayment reserve account; in effect, giving Chinese lenders first dibs on revenue of any African country, if the country at any point becomes distressed, Nigeria inclusive.",

          "text": "January 2022 when the proposed Lagos Monthly Rent scheme is planned to start is here, yet the enthusiasm that should greet such a scheme remains to be seen. This may be partly because many of the tenants do not have the right information on how the scheme will serve their needs.\n\nBeyond the announcement that tenants in the state would no longer be paying advance rents and that the state government has set aside N5 billion for the scheme, prospective beneficiaries do not know that yearly rent still stays but with much relief.\n\nWhat tenants need to know, according to Debo Adejana, chairman of, Real Estate Developers Association of Nigeria (REDAN), South-West zone, is that the state government is going to create a body that would be working with the private sector to implement the scheme.\n\nAdejana, who quotes the state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, explains that prospective tenants would be seeking and obtaining a one-year loan from the new body with which they will pay their landlord\u2019s one-year rent, but repays the loan monthly.\n\n\u201cThis is the information that is not available to everybody and I think the government needs to find a way to communicate this well to the people because this is a laudable scheme that, in my view, is the way to go,\u201d he tells BusinessDay.\n\n\u201cWhat the scheme simply means is that somebody is going to pay on behalf of those who need houses to rent but cannot pool together all the money needed for one year\u2019s rent at once,\u201d he states.\n\nRead also: Estates excite investors on security concerns\n\nHe notes that the money to be repaid won\u2019t be the same as the money borrowed as there would be interest and other charges, but because it is the government\u2019s social programme, the charges are not going to be as high as what obtains in an open market.\n\nAnother good side of the scheme, he discloses, is that a portal would be opened where tenants could go to search for rental properties of their choice. The portal would also be open to landlords who might wish to place their properties there for rent.\n\nTenants who are interested in the scheme, which will be starting with the formal sector, must be registered residents of the state and must be up-to-date in their tax obligations to the state.\n\nThe Lagos State government, late last year at the Lagos Real Estate Market Place Conference and Exhibition, announced that it would be implementing a monthly rent scheme starting from January this year.\n\nToke Benson-Awoyinka, a special adviser to the state governor on housing, explained during a discussion on Rental Policies at the event that the new initiative was a social investment scheme initiated by the state government to ease the burden of yearly rent payment on residents.\n\nArguments against the scheme for which the state government said N5 billion had been set aside, are that job security in the country is not guaranteed; there are no government\u2019s alternatives that tenants could resort to, and that the scheme could discourage investment in housing in the state.\n\nBut Moruf Akinderu-Fatai, the state\u2019s commissioner for housing, dismissed these fears, assuring that the government would protect the interest of investors, tenants, and landlords and would guard against payment default or abuse from tenants.\n\n\u201cThere is a system we are working on to make sure that the tenants, landlords, and our private sector partners in this scheme are protected,\u201d the commissioner said at an interactive session with property editors.\n\nContinuing, he assured, \u201caside from talking to the private sector and investors to see how they can help, we are also doing our part alongside our partners who have the same interest because not everyone can buy a house.\u201d\n\nThe monthly rent scheme is part of efforts by the state government to solve its huge housing problem. Lagos is an active rental market where it is estimated that 60 percent of its population live in rented accommodation spending about 50 percent of their income on rent.\n\nApart from its own developments, the state also partners with private sector players, all in an effort to reduce its housing deficit estimated at 3 million units.",

Having consulted, the Senate will expeditiously look into the issue\u201d.\n\nOn the issue of the security challenges facing the country, the Senate President said the Security situation in the country is still dire.\n\n\u201cWe must remain focused and determined to work with Executive arm of government, and also continue to support our armed forces and security agencies. We must continue to prioritize the Security and welfare of our citizens as enshrined in your constitution nor despair\u201d.\n\n\u201cI urge us not to be discouraged by the situation. We should make this year as the year for the final securing of our nation from the numerous security challenges\u201d, he added.\n\nLawan also assured Nigerians that the review of the 1999 Constitution is a topmost in their legislative agenda, adding that the Committee on Review of the 1999 Constitution has done so much work on it while working with their counter parts in the House of Representatives the report of the Committee will be presented to the Senate for consideration soon. The Senate will consider the report and the National Assembly will communicate to the State Houses of Assembly within the first quarter of this year.\n\nThe Senate President also noted that political activities leading to 2023 general elections have already started and the Senate will continue to provide the support that Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) needs for successful elections across the country.\n\nLawan also pointed out that, the funding of the 2022 Budget is predicated on significant borrowing. \u201cOur country is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. We have to construct and provide infrastructure, in all parts of our country because infrastructure is needed for our nation to develop\u201d.\n\n\u201cHowever, we do not generate enough revenues to fund the provision of such infrastructure. Until more revenues are generated, the country has to borrow and also resort to other sources of funding our infrastructural development. But we cannot continue to borrow endlessly. It is imperative that we need to improve on the revenue to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratio.

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nA group of concerned technocrats, professionals, businessmen and religious leaders under the aegis of Abia Freedom Alliance (AFA), have called on former bank CEO and chieftain of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Dr. Alex Otti to declare his intention to run for the governorship of the state ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\nThe association which made the call in a communique signed by Prince Uzor Nwachukwu, its Convener; Dr Caleb Ajagba; Chief Joe Ezearu; Bishop Bernard Nwaogu and Mr. Okey Kanu and issued at the end of its third quarter meeting in Umuahia last week, noted that Dr. Otti remained the best man for the Abia governorship job.\n\n\u201cAbia State needs in 2023 is an individual equipped with the necessary economic, political and social leadership skills, training and intellect to drive the engine of growth and development so as to move the state forward, having stagnated, indeed regressed, for the past 23 years under PDP,\u201d the communique read.\n\n\u201cAFA finds such quality of candidate in the person of Dr Alex Otti, OFR, a consummate first-class economist and accomplished former Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Diamond Bank Plc; a man who through his Alex Otti Foundation has touched and continues to touch the lives of residents of Abia State, through award of scholarships for university students, building and equipping of medical centres, provision of financial supports for small and micro enterprises, Churches, widows, orphans and the down-trodden.\n\n\u201cAFA calls on Dr Alex Otti, OFR, to make his intention to serve Abia State known, and that AFA will endorse and support his candidacy if and when he chooses to step out.\u201d\n\nThe group which decried what it described as years of bad governance in the state, called on the incumbent governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu, to endeavour to pay state civil servants their salaries.\n\nThe group also condemned strongly, the various acts of insecurity, including killings, rape, arson and kidnappings for ransom, against innocent citizens of the state and security agents, often blamed on the \u201cUnknown Gunmen\u201d and called on perpetrators to stop, even as it raised concern over the prevalence of drug abuse by a segment of the youth population.\n\nIt commiserated with families and individuals who have lost loved ones or have been victims of these heinous acts, while calling on the leadership of the Nigerian security agencies, especially the armed forces and police, to restrain their personnel from acts of brutality and torture unleashed on the youths of Abia State, as they seek to contain various acts of insecurity in the state.\n\nLikewise, the association cautioned Abia youths to be law abiding and refrain from acts that would put them at loggerheads with the security agencies.\n\n\u201cThat AFA totally condemns the abuse of various mind-bending substances, especially Methamphetamine, otherwise known simply as Meth or Mkpuru mmiri in Igbo language and called on the narcotic agencies, the NDLEA and NAFDAC, to do their utmost to unravel the source and suppliers of this destructive hard drug with a view to cutting off the supply and rehabilitating the abusers,\u201d the communique continued.\n\n\u201cThat AFA frowns at the attitude of the state governor, Okezie Victor Ikpeazu and his government, towards outstanding salary arrears, pensions and non-payment of workers\u2019 salaries as and when due, despite various grants and Paris Club Refund monies running into tens of billions of Naira, received by the administration from Federal Government, meant purposefully for such and other developmental projects in the state.\n\n\u201cThat AFA notes with regret and embarrassment the continued non-payment of outstanding salary arrears, pensions and gratuities to serving and retired civil servants, respectively, running into several months and years. It becomes even more disheartening when some of those owed are saddled with the responsibility to provide services in the area of health care and education for the citizens, in the case of those in service; and the aged, weak and sickly with regard to the retirees.\n\n\u201cThat AFA frowns at the dilapidated state of infrastructure in all of Abia State, especially Aba, the commercial capital. The association condemns in strongest terms the state of roads in Abia and the amount of monies purported to have been sunk into road projects in the state that have not seen the light of the day.\n\n\u201cAFA calls on Governor Okezie Ikpeazu to be mindful of the kind of legacy he wants to leave behind in Abia State, after eight years in office. Whether he wants to be remembered as the governor who could not provide his state with the most basic infrastructure and pay workers\u2019 salaries or one whose non-performance led to the untimely death of numerous retirees because they could not raise the necessary finances to take care of themselves due to non-payment of their pensions and gratuities.\n\n\u201cAFA calls on all well-meaning sons and daughters of Abia State to rise up and condemn the attitude of Governor Okezie Ikpeazu and PDP, towards the governance of the state and hold him and his party to account, at least for the remaining period of the governor\u2019s stay in office.\n\n\u201cAFA calls on the political elites in Abia State to get out of their lethargy and begin to mobilise the people with a view to dispensing with the PDP government which has held Abia State down without progress for the past 23 years, as the momentum towards the general elections in 2023 begins to gather.\u201d",

          "title": "AFCFTA drags one year after \u2026as Nigeria, others fail to pull weight",
          "text": "By AYOOLA OLAOLUWA\n\nNigeria and the 53 other African nations that signed up for the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) may have to wait much more longer for the benefits of the treaty, as poor infrastructure, red-tapism, entrenched protectionism, as well as the effects of the coronavirus pandemic continued to dog the program.\n\nAfter several months of delay, African countries officially began trading under a new continent-wide free trade area on January 1, 2020. It promoters aim to bring together 1.3 billion people in a $3.4 trillion economic bloc that will be the largest free trade area since the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n\nApart from allowing the continent to develop its own value chains, backers had projected that trading between African neighbours would be boosted by about 60% by 2022.\n\nAccording to a research conducted by the African Development Bank (AfDB), only 16% of international trade by African countries takes place between African countries.\n\nThe World Economic Forum (WEF) in it\u2019s own report, said African nations currently trade more internationally than with one another. The forum puts the trade volume between the continent and Asia at 59 per cent and 68 per cent for Europe.\n\nHowever, one year into the official takeoff of the ambitious programme, it has failed to live up to expectations owing to several obstacles on it\u2019s part, leading experts to advise participating countries to quickly remove the obstacles if AfCFTA is to reach its full potential.\n\nFindings by Business Hallmark show that two of the major challenges facing the program is the lack of political will to implement the deal and the protectionist stance of many African governments and interest groups who fear losing out to more competitive neighbours.\n\nFor instance, out of the 54 African countries that have signed the AfCFTA deal, only four have deposited their instruments of ratification at the AU depositary, with 50 others, including Nigeria yet to do so.\n\nOne of such countries where AfCFTA has recorded a false start is Nigeria. BH reliably gathered that apart from some challenges preventing the program from taking off in the country, such as poor infrastructure, consensus on trade protocols and strategy among stakeholders and red-tapism, it is also bugged down by the scepticism of the pan-African project on the part of some influential members in the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nSources in government and the private sector confided in our correspondent that the operational phase is yet to commence in the country.\n\nAccording to one of the sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity, the major challenge preventing the takeoff of the project in the country is the provision in the treaty establishing AfCFTA that there should be 90 per cent tariff liberalisation on goods originating from the continent and the insistence by the Federal Government that it wants at least 180 products produced in Nigeria protected.\n\nWhile 131 products are on the FG\u2019s import prohibition list, the remaining products on the exclusive list were picked based on national priorities, trade volume, food security and competitive advantage, the source stated.\n\nMeanwhile, only seven per cent of sensitive products and three per cent of exclusive products have already been negotiated, leaving over 4,300 tariff lines under the liberalised list.\n\nThe demands, it was further gathered, had been submitted by Nigeria\u2019s trade delegation to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for negotiation.\n\nBased on the AfCFTA treaty, some sensitive and exclusive products have to be liberalised within the 10-year period agreed in the deal.\n\nAnother obstacle on the path of the successful take off of AfCFTA is the snail speed in the negotiation of the Rules of Origin (RoO).\n\nThe RoO, it was learnt, are at about 87.65 per cent completed with outstanding work of about 10 per cent on textiles and two per cent relating to automobiles.\n\nIt was also learnt that while the Federal Government had received offers from 41 countries, the offers are yet to be verified.\n\nAlso, Phase 2 negotiations on investment, intellectual property and competition are at early stages while talks on women and youth in trade and digital trade are yet to start.\n\nApart from the challenges of trade nationalism and red-tapism, another obstacle that worked against the smooth kickoff of AfCFTA, is the disruption of international trade by by the Covid19 pandemic.\n\nThe restrictions imposed by many countries in their desperate efforts to contain the spread of the virus disrupted global supply chains, with manufacturers unable to get raw materials and access to markets for their goods.\n\nReacting to the slow implementation of AfCFTA, the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), advised the Federal Government to continue to liaise with the private sector in making it operational.\n\n\u201cNow that we have signed, ratified and deposited the instrument of ratification at the repository, the National Action Committee (NAC) should be effectively supported to continue to vigorously engage the private sector and relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies of government to accelerate the putting in place of all structures required for beneficial trade.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, we implore government to urgently embark on establishing the Designated Competent Authority that will superintend the administration of Rules of Origin and Commission the automation of the Certificate of Origin and export and import documentation processes for AfCFTA transactions,\u201d the MAN boss, Mansur Ahmed advised.\n\nIn his own response, the Secretary-General of AfCFTA Secretariat, Mr. Wamkele Mene, beseeched Africans to be patient, explaining that the target of the agreement is to achieve zero duty on 97 per cent of all products traded in the continent by 2035.\n\n\u201cI think Africans should be patient and understand that we are in the initial stages of significance to go together under a single set of rules.\n\n\u201cWe will learn from the experience of the European Union (EU) that it took 72 years to get to this point of market interventions that it enjoys today.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing is not an easy task, it is time-consuming, and it requires patience to see results in years to come.\n\n\u201cI am not worried about the slowness because typically, negotiations and implementation of trade agreements is not something that happens overnight,\u201d Mene noted.\n\nA researcher with the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), Teniola Tayo, said the decision to launch trade on 1 January 2021, highlighted the urgency to negotiations among participating countries.\n\nAccording to her, the slow takeoff of the project did not come as a surprise to her as the politics behind tariff agreements in individual countries could be difficult, as witnessed in Nigeria.\n\nCorroborating Tayo, the Head of African Futures and Innovation at the ISS, Jakkie Cilliers, said the slow start recorded by the project did not in any way cast doubt on the viability of AfCFTA, insisting that the launch was just a symbolic gesture while negotiation go on behind the scenes.\n\n\u2018The road to AfCFTA is a long one and the 1 January 2021 trading start date is generally seen for what it was, a symbolic gesture.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be many more delays and false starts. I think the question is rather how AfCFTA will work if sub-regional arrangements have not,\u201d the Head of African Futures and Innovation at ISS stated.\n\nLike in Nigeria, the AfCFTA project has failed to live up to expectations in many African countries. From Ghana, to Egypt, Ethiopia, South Africa, Togo, Morocco and many others, the story is the same.\n\nDisturbed by the development, Ghana\u2019s International Trade and Finance conference (GITFiC), recently lamented the failure of most African countries to fully develop a comprehensive National AfCFTA Implementation Strategy.\n\nWhile conceding that countries may have existing trade policies and developed guidelines, GITFiC insists that was not enough to maximise the full benefits of AfCFTA.\n\nA consultant at ISS, Peter Fabricius, said: \u201cComplex trade negotiations no doubt take time. But by firing the starting gun almost a year ago when no runners were out of the starting blocks, African leaders have created confusion, especially among traders.\n\n\u201cMaybe the early start date was needed to drive negotiations. But to sustain momentum, the AfCFTA secretariat and participating states should do a better job of keeping traders in the loop about why implementation is taking so long\u201d, said Fabricius.",
          "summary": "After several months of delay, African countries officially began trading under a new continent-wide free trade area on January 1, 2020.\nAccording to a research conducted by the African Development Bank (AfDB), only 16% of international trade by African countries takes place between African countries.\nOne of such countries where AfCFTA has recorded a false start is Nigeria.\nLike in Nigeria, the AfCFTA project has failed to live up to expectations in many African countries.\nA consultant at ISS, Peter Fabricius, said: \u201cComplex trade negotiations no doubt take time.",

          "title": "Wike Reconciles Diri, Alaibe 2 Years After Bayelsa PDP Gov\u2019ship Primaries",
          "text": "A former managing director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Chief Nditimi Alaibe, has reconciled with the Bayelsa State governor, Senator Douye Diri, after two years of soured relationship following the controversial governorship primaries of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) in the State about two years ago.\n\nGovernor Diri had won the governorship primary with 561 votes while his main rival, Alaibe scored 365 votes.\n\nAlaibe, however, rejected the outcome of the primaries and pursued his case up to the Supreme Court where he also lost out.\n\nAlaibe, however, extended an olive branch to Governo Diri after exhausting his legal options but his peace moves were rejected by Governor Diri, who described such peace offering as belated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey are both from the same Kolokuma/Opokuma local government area and have been political associates for over 20 years.\n\nHowever, LEADERSHIP gathered that the governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, played a major role in reconciling the duo. Wike was reported to have prevailed on Governor Diri, during his last week visit to Yenagoa, to end the cold feud with Alaibe.\n\nA PDP source told LEADERSHIP that Diri accepted Wike\u2019s reconciliatory offer but said all is left for Alaibe to make such peace move.\n\nIt was clear that during the closed-door meeting between the two governors at the Bayelsa Government House, the reconciliation matter was discussed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWike immediately nominated the former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Austin Okpara, and a former Transport Minister, Abiye Sekibo, to meet with Alaibe and reconcile the duo.\n\n\u201cOkpara and Sekibo met with Alaibe and discussed the issue. They told Alaibe that the reconciliation is important for Bayelsa and national PDP politics. That the State is losing the clout and knowledge of politics associated with a politician like Timi Alaibe. Many other things were said by Timi Alaibe but it is not for print,\u201d the source said.\n\nMeanwhile, Chief Alaibe, who on Sunday evening visited Governor Diri at his residence in the Bayelsa Government House in open acceptance of the reconciliation effort initiated by Governor Wike and peace in the state, confirmed the development in a statement issued few hours later, insisting that the reconciliation was achieved after repeated interventions by mutual friends, business partners and political associates.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI finally considered it necessary to put an end to the ugly past, drop political differences and re-establish age-old friendship with my brother and State Governor, Douye Diri. That happened on Sunday January 16. Let me state here that Governor Diri and I have come a long way. We have not only been political partners, there is a deep sense of brotherhood in our relationship. Somehow, in 2019, political differences thrust a sharp knife into that bond; and as the late Chinua Achebe would say, things fell apart and the centre could no longer hold.\n\n\u201cBut then, blood is thicker than water. We both knew that what happened was temporal. Our mutual friends decided to wade in; especially those who knew what happened and believed that Governor Diri could not be held directly responsible. He only had favour thrusted upon him. I must admit that out of a deep sense of humility and friendship, Governor Diri had, at several times, shortly after taking office, personally reached out to me. I chose to remain silent as I reviewed the situation. But all that is now history.\n\n\u201cTime has healed the wounds and I have chosen to do the right thing. There is no doubt that the reconciliation will surprise a lot of people; particularly some political jobbers who profited from our temporary silence. What has happened might also be misinterpreted and given various coloration by different people. But the truth is that I have chosen to listen to the voice of wisdom and re-establish a cherished relationship; which politics tried to destroy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cTo demonstrate the sincerity of my intentions and reciprocate the same humility, which Governor Diri had displayed previously, I refused to meet him on a neutral ground. Instead, in company of close friends, I went to the governor\u2019s official residence in Yenogoa and I was warmly welcomed by him and his team. I am thoroughly impressed by the sincerity displayed of my governor. So, the past is behind us. Politics has taken the backstage. Friendship and the collective interest of Bayelsa people are in the centre-stage now. We are back to work together in love and unity. Join us,\u201d Alaibe stated.\n\nIn his response, the Bayelsa State governor also confirmed the reconciliation and end to the cold war between him and Alaibe, saying: \u201cA great day indeed when I received my brother, the man we call \u201cPrincipal\u201d, Chief Timi Alaibe, proud son of Kolokuma/Opokuma Local Government Area of Bayelsa State.\n\n\u201cWe have been in this political journey together for over 20 years and I am glad to reunite with him for the love and development of our dear State of Bayelsa. It\u2019s indeed a new dawn! A whole new chapter has been opened as we all reflected on the past. Together, we can make that difference for our people.\u201d",
          "summary": "Governor Diri had won the governorship primary with 561 votes while his main rival, Alaibe scored 365 votes.\nAlaibe, however, extended an olive branch to Governo Diri after exhausting his legal options but his peace moves were rejected by Governor Diri, who described such peace offering as belated.\nWike was reported to have prevailed on Governor Diri, during his last week visit to Yenagoa, to end the cold feud with Alaibe.\nA PDP source told LEADERSHIP that Diri accepted Wike\u2019s reconciliatory offer but said all is left for Alaibe to make such peace move.\nADVERTISEMENT\u201cTo demonstrate the sincerity of my intentions and reciprocate the same humility, which Governor Diri had displayed previously, I refused to meet him on a neutral ground.",

          "text": "The passage of the contentious Electoral Act Amendment Bill would determine the preparation of the Independent National Electoral Commission for the 2023 general elections, its Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, emphasised on Tuesday.\n\nYakubu bared his mind in Abuja during the first quarterly meeting of INEC with political parties in 2022.\n\nAccording to him, the Commission was looking forward to speedy passage of the Bill.\n\nHe said that the Commission would release the timetable for 2023 elections immediately the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), signs the Electoral Amendment Bill into law.\n\n\u201cOn the Electoral Amendment Bill currently before the National Assembly, the Commission is encouraged by the Senate President\u2019s assurance to give priority attention to the Bill when the National Assembly reconvenes from its recess today, and the commitment by the President to assent to the Bill as soon as the issue of mode of primaries by political parties is resolved.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to a speedy passage of the Bill, which is crucial to our preparations for future elections. As soon as it is signed into law, the commission will quickly release the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 general election based on the new law,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nThe INEC chairman said that the year 2022 was going to be a very busy year for the Commission and the political parties, with the 2023 general election just 396 days away, adding that all the critical preparations must be concluded this year.\n\nOn the Continuous Voter Registration, Yakubu said that as at Monday January 17, a total of 8,260,076 eligible Nigerians commenced the online pre-registration, completed the registration physically or applied for transfer to new voting locations, replacement of their Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards or updated their voter information records as required by law.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe commission has been publishing weekly progress reports of the exercise. We are aware that Nigerians want to know when their PVCs will be available for collection. At the moment, the Commission is undertaking the most comprehensive cleaning up of the data to ensure that only eligible citizens are added to the voters\u2019 register for the 2023 general election and will share our findings with Nigerians and the actual dates for the collection of the PVCs nationwide will be announced very soon.\u201d\n\nThe INEC chairman advised political parties to continue to encourage eligible voters who have not registered to do so, bearing in mind that those who had registered at any time previously need not register again.\n\nHe said, \u201cTurning to the major end-of-tenure and off-cycle elections, party primaries for the Ekiti State governorship election are scheduled for January 4 to 29, 2022. For the Osun State governorship election, primaries will hold from February 16 to March 12, 2022. In the case of Ekiti State, all the 18 political parties have served the mandatory notices for the primaries.\n\n\u201cLet me seize this opportunity to draw the attention of parties to the necessity for transparent and rancour-free primaries. Parties should also respect their chosen dates for the primaries based on the Commission\u2019s timetable and schedule of activities.\n\n\u201cAlready, many parties have rescheduled their primaries several times. While the commission has earmarked a period of three weeks and four days (that is 25 days) for the conduct of the Ekiti State governorship primaries, virtually all political parties have decided to hold their primaries in the last four days January 26 to 29, 2022. In fact, seven political parties have chosen the last day for their primaries.\u201d\n\nYakubu said that no party had so far submitted its list of aspirants, the composition of its electoral panel, or the register of members or list of delegates depending on the chosen mode for electing its candidates adding that, only one party has indicated the venue for its primaries.\n\nHe told the political parties to do so immediately to enable the Commission to work out the detailed plans for monitoring the primaries.\n\n\u201cAll primaries for electing candidates must take place in the constituency where election will hold as required by law. In the cases of Ekiti and Osun State governorship elections, any primaries conducted outside the two states will not be monitored by the Commission and their outcomes will not be accepted,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on the February 12 FCT council elections, Yakubu said, \u201cIt is now 25 days to the Area Council elections in the FCT. Major activities have already been carried out, including the conduct of primaries and nomination of candidates by political parties. Only last week, the Commission presented the register of voters to political parties while the PVCs for new registrants, requests for transfers and replacement of cards have been printed and delivered several weeks ago to our FCT office for collection by voters.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cFor emphasis, the BVAS will be deployed in the FCT elections which is the second major election after the Anambra governorship election held in November last year.\n\n\u201cThe 68 constituencies in the FCT (six chairmen and 62 councillors) covering extensive urban and rural locations sharing border with five states in the North Central and North Western parts of the country is another opportunity to pilot the efficacy of the BVAS in a different geographical, geo-political and electoral context.\n\n\u201cThe same technology will be deployed in all forthcoming bye-elections across the country. For all elections going forward, polling unit results will be uploaded in real-time to the INEC Result Viewing portal.\u201d\n\nResponding on behalf of the political parties, the National Chairman of the Inter Party Advisory Council, Yabagi Yusuf Sani, said the successes recorded in the last Anambra State governorship elections and the deployment of technologies aided the success of the election.

And I hope that before the end of the week, the bill could be brought back to Mr. President for his assent. I hope that.\n\n\u201cBut one thing I\u2019m sure by the grace of God is we are passing the bill, the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2010, tomorrow Wednesday the 19th in both chambers.\n\n\u201cAnd we are happy that at the end of the day, we have been able to narrow down our differences and arrive at the very patriotic resolution that our country must have a new electoral law that will guide the 2023 general elections in the country, and Nigeria would have everything to benefit from this law.\n\n\u201cFor us in the ninth assembly, the Electoral Act amendment bill is one of our major legislative agenda that we wanted to deal with in the ninth National Assembly, and to the glory of God Almighty Allah. By tomorrow, we will be able to pass that bill for Mr. president to assent to it.\n\n\u201cI hope that the cleaning process will not take more than a day. But if it does, then it has to be early next week. But I\u2019m very optimistic that there is not much to clean because normally when we pass the bill like this, it goes to the legislative drafting unit of the National Assembly. So what you have in the National Assembly, as passed, is not the final document that comes to the President,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Senate President said Nigerians have raised concern that the Electoral Act Amendment Bill contains many flaws which the lawmakers need to address.\n\n\u201cI know that many people were saying there were so many flaws in the bill that was brought to Mr. President, maybe what they had was the bill passed in the Senate or in the house, not the one that was cleaned up, the final document that was cleaned up, because even us we didn\u2019t have that document.\n\n\u201cBut I appreciate the efforts of all Nigerians in taking interest in what we do, and even participating by way of looking for what is right and what is not when we pass our bills, or in terms of legislative activities, generally.\n\n\u201cOn the whole, I think it\u2019s a worthwhile exercise that we\u2019ve worked so hard in a very bipartisan manner to pass the electoral amendment bill before and Mr President to raise the observations he did, and for the National Assembly, having consulted widely with Nigerians, with our constituents, and we came to the conclusion, in both chambers, across party lines, in a very patriotic way to say, oh, what we need to do is not waste time, time is of essence in this respect, we should just look at the possibility of opening up the mode of primaries so that you can have direct, you can have indirect and even consensus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to political parties to decide which option is okay for them, and at what time, but I\u2019m sure that all the options will be used, all the options will be used by political parties, in different occasions or whatever,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Chinese state media report parcels mailed from overseas may have spread the omicron variant of the coronavirus in Beijing and elsewhere.\n\nGlobally, health experts have stressed the virus mainly spreads through respiratory droplets when infected people breathe, speak, cough and sneeze. However, China has repeatedly emphasized the danger of infection from packaging, despite only trace amounts of the virus being found on such items, and it has boosted testing of frozen food and regular items shipped from overseas.\n\nThe Communist Party newspaper Global Times cited the Beijing Center for Disease Control and virologists as making the link between the latest infections and packages from abroad. The report Tuesday said investigators found people newly infected had picked up packages mailed from Canada and the U.S.\n\nChina has locked down parts of Beijing\u2019s Haidian district following the detection of three cases, just weeks before the Chinese capital is due to host the Winter Olympic Games. Another person in the southern technology hub of Shenzhen who tested positive for omicron had handled packages sent from North America.\n\nChina remains on high alert for new outbreaks ahead of the Olympics. Around 20 million people are under lockdown and mass testing has been ordered in neighborhoods and entire cities where cases have been discovered.\n\nThe Beijing Games organizers announced Monday that only \u201cselected\u201d spectators will be permitted at the events that officially open Feb. 4. Beijing had already announced that no fans from outside the country would be permitted and had not offered tickets to the general public.\n\nChina has largely avoided major virus outbreaks with a regimen of lockdowns, mass testing for COVID-19 and travel restrictions, although it continues to fight surges in several cities, including the port of Tianjin, about an hour from Beijing.\n\nDespite China\u2019s \u201czero-COVID\u201d policy, one city that has endured weeks of lockdown appeared to find some relief. Falling numbers of cases in Xi\u2019an, a city of 13 million famed as the home of the Terracotta Warrior statue army, have prompted authorities to allow people to gradually leave their homes and return to work.\n\nJust one additional case was reported in the city among China\u2019s total of 127 new domestically transmitted cases announced on Tuesday.",
