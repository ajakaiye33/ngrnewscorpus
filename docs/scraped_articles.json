          "text": "-Says self-medication no solution to sleeping disorders\n\nAmarachi Okeh\n\nA neurologist, Prof. Ikenna Onwuekwe, has warned persons suffering from sleep disorders against the indiscriminate use of sleeping pills.\n\nAccording to Onwuekwe, engaging in self-medication by indiscriminately taking sleeping pills is not only a wrong way to treat sleep disorders, it could also be dangerous.\n\nOnwuekwe who is a professor of Neurology at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu stressed that it is wrong to use sleeping tablets to treat sleep disorders, noting that it was always important to first find out the type and cause of the health condition.\n\nSome sleep disorders, he said, cannot be treated with sleeping pills.\n\nThe neurologist explained that there are different types of sleep disorders, adding that insomnia is not a single issue because it has different facets.\n\nSleep disorders, according to myclevelandclinic.org \u2013 a medical news site, are conditions that impair sleep or prevent people from getting restful sleep and, as a result, can cause daytime sleepiness and other symptoms.\n\nOnwuekwe, who is also the head of the neurology unit at UNTH, stressed that every sleep disorder has to be properly assessed and classified noting that they are not all the same, including insomnia.\n\n\u201cEven insomnia has different facets to it and the management is not all the same. Every case has to be properly investigated and managed properly with the primary health condition that is causing it.\n\n\u201cIt is only when you cannot find the primary cause that you now treat it symptomatically,\u201d he said.\n\nThe consultant neurologist noted that sleep is a multistage procedure that involves several neurological segments.\n\n\u201cEach segment can be where the problem lies. For instance, there\u2019s a stage we call the initiation phase of sleep, which is how you get to sleep.\n\n\u201cWhen you have now slept off, we talk about the realm sleep, when people dream. We talk about non-realm sleep when people don\u2019t dream. There\u2019s also the duration of sleep, then we talk about how satisfactory the sleep is.\n\n\u201cSo, you can have about four or five sub-stages to analyse in that person who complained of difficulty in sleeping.\n\n\u201cOne person can have a problem only with falling asleep. He can lie awake for a long time and then sleep off and sleep very well.\n\n\u201cBut another person can tell you that he has no problem falling asleep, just that when he sleeps, he wakes up after one and half hours and is not able to go back to sleep again.\n\n\u201cWhile another person will tell you that he has no problem falling asleep and sleeping for six or seven hours but that he wakes up in between because of nightmares. You look at that person\u2019s realm stage of sleep and know what is wrong with him,\u201d Onwuekwe explained.\n\nHe added that people with prior neurological or psychiatric conditions like epilepsy who do not get enough daily sleep also risk having more seizures.\n\nThe neurologist also stated that people who may have mental, physical, surgical, or cardiac issues could suffer from sleep disorders as it is a sign of such looming health challenges.\n\nOnwuekwe advised that people who suffer from sleep disorders should see a neurologist to get optimal analyses and treatment.\n\nRegarding how many hours of sleep an adult should get, the consultant neurologist said between six to seven hours of daily sleep is sufficient for an adult, noting that sleeping shorter or longer than these hours could cause harm to the health and could also lead to death.\n\n\u201cIf you sleep shorter than 7 hours or longer than 9 hours daily, studies have shown that you may die earlier than you should.\n\n\u201cNon-satisfactory sleep causes its own problems. It is associated with high blood pressure, acute cardiac conditions like heart attack, obesity, increased risk of stroke, and diabetes. These problems are the same with people who sleep too much as well.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.\n\nThis material, and other digital content on this website, may not be reproduced, published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed in whole or in part without prior express written permission from PUNCH.\n\nContact: [email protected]",

          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nA study by the European Society of Cardiology has found that people who work the night shift are at increased risk of developing heart problems.\n\nThe study revealed that people who work the night shift are at increased risk of developing irregular and often abnormally fast heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation.\n\nResearchers in the new study published in the European Heart Journal said the study is the first to investigate the links between night shift work and Atrial Fibrillation.\n\nUsing information from 283,657 people in the UK Biobank database, the researchers found that the longer and more frequently people worked night shifts over their lifetimes, the greater their risk of heart problems.\n\nThey found that people who currently worked night shifts on a usual or permanent basis had a 12 per cent increased risk of AF compared to people who only worked during the day.\n\n\u201cThe risk increased to 18 per cent after ten or more years for those who had a lifetime duration of night shifts.\n\n\u201cAmong people who worked an average of three to eight-night shifts a month for 10 years or more, the risk of AF increased to 22 per cent compared to daytime workers.\n\n\u201cAmong participants currently working night shifts, or working night shifts for 10 or more years, or working a lifetime of three to eight night shifts a month, the risk of coronary heart disease increased by 22 per cent, 37 percent and 35 per cent respectively compared to daytime workers,\u201d the researchers noted.\n\nThey evaluated the overall genetic risk based on 166 genetic variations known to be associated with the condition but found that the genetic risk levels did not affect the link between working night shifts and AF risk, regardless of whether participants had a low, medium, or high genetic risk.\n\nThe study, according to the researchers, included 286,353 people who were in paid employment or self-employed.\n\nAmong the participants free of heart disease and stroke when they joined the study, 73,986 provided information on their employment history. During an average follow-up time of over ten years, there were 5,777 AF cases.\n\nThe research team, led by Prof. Yingli Lu, of Shanghai Ninth People\u2019s Hospital and Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China, and Prof. Lu Qi, of Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, New Orleans, USA, investigated whether genetic predisposition to AF could play a role in the increased risk.\n\nProf. Lu said, \u201cAlthough a study like this cannot show a causal link between night shifts and atrial fibrillation and heart disease, our results suggest that current and lifetime night shift work may increase the risk of these conditions.\n\n\u201cOur findings have public health implications for preventing atrial fibrillation. They suggest that reducing both the frequency and the duration of night shift work may be beneficial for the health of the heart and blood vessels.\u201d\n\nAccording to Prof. Qi, there were two more interesting findings.\n\n\u201cWe found that women were more susceptible to atrial fibrillation than men when working night shifts for more than ten years. Their risk increased significantly by 64 percent compared to day workers.\n\n\u201cPeople reporting an ideal amount of physical activity of 150 minutes a week or more of moderate-intensity, 75 minutes a week or more of vigorous-intensity, or an equivalent combination, had a lower risk of atrial fibrillation than those with non-ideal physical activity when exposed to a lifetime of night shift work.\n\n\u201cThus, women and less physically active people may benefit particularly from a reduction in night shift work\u201d, Prof. Qi said.\n\nAn earlier 2021 study by Washington State University gave insight into the risk of night shift work, revealing that night shift workers are at increased risk of developing certain types of cancer compared to those who work regular daytime hours.\n\nThe findings suggest that night shifts disrupt natural 24-hour rhythms in the activity of certain cancer-related genes, making night shift workers more vulnerable to DNA damage while also causing the body\u2019s DNA repair mechanisms to be mistimed to deal with that damage.\n\n\u201cThere has been mounting evidence that cancer is more prevalent in night shift workers, which led the World Health Organisation\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer to classify night shift work as a probable carcinogenic,\u201d said co-corresponding author Shobhan Gaddameedhi, an associate professor formerly with the WSU College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

This is abominable and it should not happen again. Some of them would meet female farmers in the bush and rape them.\n\n\u201cSome of these women are old and have stopped mensuration a long time ago and even their husbands don\u2019t touch them again. But they would meet them in the bush and molest them sexually.\n\n\u201cFulani girls and women are beautiful but despite that, no Yoruba boy or man has even met them in the bush and rape them. It has never happened around this axis.\n\n\u201cSo, let us tell them that their children (young herders) must not molest our mothers and other females again. Anybody caught doing this should be heavily punished according to the law and I believe that will serve as a deterrent to others.\u201d\n\nReacting, the secretary of AFAN in the state, Mr Adewumi Abass, said a meeting would be organised so that stakeholders could say whatever was bothering them, assuring that all the issues would be addressed.\n\nHe said everything must be done to ensure peaceful coexistence between farmers and herders because both were into food production.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere must be a peaceful relationship between herders and farmers. Farm destruction must stop because pastoralists who rear livestock are doing so for money and farmers who grow crops also do so for money. Therefore, we must not allow one to disturb the other.\n\n\u201cDestruction of crops and farmland will aggravate food scarcity and this will affect everybody. Herders must not destroy crops and farmers should also not kill herders\u2019 animals. We have been living together peacefully before and this should continue.\u201d\n\nThe leader of Fulani in Iseyin Local Government Area, Alhaji Yakubu Bello, identified the language barrier and ethnicity as some of the factors responsible for the incessant crisis between herders and farmers.\n\nHe, however, said such a crisis was not common in the local government area because of the understanding and respect the host community and Fulani people had. He expressed joy about the meeting and said he and his kinsmen would also ensure that the relationship between the two groups got better.\n\n\u201cAnybody who commits a crime should be punished, whether he or she is a herder or a farmer. That will serve as a deterrent to others,\u201d he emphasised.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

He said that information at the disposal of the task force indicated that the protest is proposed to commence from the Jos Central Mosque axis to the State House Assembly premises.\n\nTakwa warned that the 24-hour curfew imposed by the state government in Jos North Local Government Area had not be lifted, hence anyone found wanting would be decisively dealt with.\n\n\u201cOur attention has been drawn to a message circulating on social media calling on Muslim youths to embark on peaceful protest slated for Wednesday, August 18\n\n\u201cThe message stated that the demonstration is expected to commence from Jos Central Mosque to the State House of Assembly Complex.\n\n\u201cWhile we will not want to join issues with the organisers of the planned protest, it is instructive to state that in view of the fragile nature of peace on the Plateau, this protest is unnecessary and uncalled for. We are fully aware that religious leaders have distanced themselves from the planned message. They have categorically stated that they are not in support of the peaceful demonstration. We are, therefore, sending a strong warning to those planning this demonstration and the originators of the message to have a rethink.\u201d",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nLeading leaders from the three geopolitical zones in the North, yesterday, listed key challenges bedeviling the 19 northern states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nThe leaders who met in Abuja, said the challenges include political, economic and social, principal among which are the collapse of traditional values, uncaring leadership, mismanagement of opportunity and inequity.\n\nThey claimed the region is sitting on a keg of gunpowder, warning that it may explode sooner than later.\n\nSome of the leaders who attended the meeting included the 1993 presidential candidate of the defunct National Republican Convention (NRC), Ibrahim Tofa, former secretary to Government of the Federation, Yayale Ahmed, former chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Attahiru Jega, former governors, ministers, senators and military officers.\n\nAddressing newsmen after the meeting, Tofa announced the formation of the Roundtable, a new group comprising independent, non-partisan and non-governmental organisations founded by eminent sons and daughters of the region to address the challenges facing the region.\n\nSpeaking on behalf the group, Tofa said it was common knowledge that the North has been facing multiple challenges over time, which has escalated into a crisis over the past few years.\n\n\u201cThese challenges are many and they cut across the region. These have manifested in the collapse of institutions and services, widespread poverty and inequality, mutual suspicion, endemic insecurity, disunity, despair and dearth of hope across the region. Every community has challenges but to overcome challenges, there is need to admit their existence.\u201d\n\nTofa said all was not well with the North and urged leaders to take responsibility and proffer solutions.\n\n\u201cWe have no difficulty admitting all is not well with Northern Nigeria and taking primary or vicarious responsibility for the current state of affairs. We must all \u2013 leaders, followers and passive onlookers \u2013 accept our share of responsibility but, beyond that, we must collectively resolve to take action and remedy what went wrong going forward.\n\n\u201cWe owe this to ourselves and to succeeding generations who I would bear the consequences of our action and inaction even though they bear no responsibility for how we got here. No parent would wish to bequeath a precarious future to his child and no price is too high to pay to secure the future of succeeding generations of Northerners.\n\n\u201cWe are fully aware attaining these objectives will not be easy as the conditions and forces of division have taken root and have been left to fester unchecked over a long period. But the journey of a thousand miles, they say, begins with a single step.\n\n\u201cWe are also hopeful that, as collective victims who have paid the price of division, our people have arrived at the realisation that unity is required to resolve other challenges afflicting the region. Recent consultations with eminent political, traditional and religious leaders across the North are encouraging.\n\n\u201cThey reveal a strong desire to remove all obstacles to Northern unity and a commitment to overcome its challenges. We will widen and deepen these consultations in the coming weeks, months and, if necessary, years in order to attain our objectives.\u201d\n\nProferring solutions to the many challenges, Tofa said: \u201cThe most urgent task, therefore, facing the peoples of Northern Nigeria is to overcome fear and suspicion, jettison unhealthy division and create consensus around common goals and aspirations. These are necessary for creating the enabling environment to address our most stubborn challenges such as insecurity, widespread poverty, collapse of institutions and services, etc so that order, peace and prosperity may once again return to our region.\n\n\u201cWe are the ones who occupy this region, we are the ones who suffer the consequences of its diminution and we are the ones who must remedy the situation. It is in our common and enlightened interest to do so.\n\n\u201cWe would like to seize this opportunity to call on all stakeholders, particularly our political, business, technocratic, traditional, religious, community and youth leaders to support this initiative to recreate the entire northern landscape and make it conducive to a future worthy of succeeding generations, regardless of ethnic, sectarian and sectional considerations.\n\n\u201cA new, united, secure and prosperous North is possible but we have to work for it collectively in equity, good faith, mutual respect, love and goodwill towards each other.\u201d\n\nOn the state of insecurity, he said: \u201cThe state of insecurity across Nigeria is worrisome, but the state of insecurity in Northern Nigeria has reached existential proportions, threatening to render the region hostile to civilized existence. We acknowledge the efforts of the relevant authorities at both the state and federal levels to deal with the difficult, complex and evolving security situation but it is becoming clear on a daily basis that a lot more of these efforts is required.\n\n\u201cThe pain, agony and unwarranted suffering of ordinary people across the region has become completely unbearable as agriculture, education, commerce and the normal rhythm of life have been severely disrupted.\n\n\u201cTo bring the state of insecurity in Northern Nigeria under control, more and better collaboration among the states across the region and between the states and federal authorities is required. There is also need for more and better coordination among the military and security agencies and between them and the civilian population.\n\n\u201cHowever, the ultimate remedy to the state of insecurity in Northern Nigeria is a collective resolve by all northern communities to live in peace with each other, in equity and justice, and quality investment by the three tiers of government, as well as the private sector, in human capital, agriculture, healthcare and infrastructure, particularly power, transport and telecommunication.\n\n\u201cThese investments are necessary for job creation to catch up with our rapid growth in population. No effort should be spared to bring an end to the wanton death and destruction that have been unleashed on the region.\n\n\u201cWe cannot blame anyone for this failure but ourselves. Basic education is the responsibility of local and state authorities. In this respect, our local and state authorities have consistently failed us over the years. We are not building enough classes to cater for our population, which is growing out of control.\n\n\u201cIn most communities, the classes are exposed to the weather and not conducive to learning. Our teacher training institutions are too few and poorly funded, while teachers are at the lowest rung of the ladder in our communities and among the worst paid.\n\n\u201cSo-called basic education commissions at both the federal and state levels, have become suffocating bureaucracies with little, if any impact, on the quality of basic education in our states.\u201d",

But we are mindful of the fact that this will bring some hardship which is why we are not going to jump into implement it.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe implementation framework will take care of that, as well as how we are going to alleviate the sufferings that this might bring.\n\n\u201cIt is not going to be automatic. We have been working with labour to ensure that there is a framework that will allow us to implement this deregulation provision of the Act.\u201d\n\nOn the ongoing discussions with the organised labour on subsidy removal, Sylva explained that the consultations were not yet concluded.\n\n\u201cThe issue is not just about discussing with labour, because we agreed between labour and government that we need to put a framework in place for the implementation of deregulation.\n\n\u201cBecause more or less there is consensus across the table now that deregulation is desirable. But how do we achieve it? That\u2019s the question now. Labour and government have agreed and so we are now in the process of putting the infrastructure and process in place.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cOnce we are able to agree on that process with labour then we are ready to deregulate.

          "text": "\u2022FG: No immediate removal of petrol subsidy\n\n\u2022Explains why govs are clamouring for price hike\n\n\u2022Private sector operators, APC commend president on new oil sector law\n\n\u2022Wike: 3% allocation to host Communities insufficient\n\nEmmanuel Addeh,\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja Dike Onwuamaeze in Lagos and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari will today unveil an implementation committee for the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), THISDAY learnt yesterday.\n\nTHISDAY exclusively gathered from a reliable source in the Presidency that the committee may be chaired by either the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva or someone with good knowledge of development economics.\n\nThe committee which has 12 months to carry out its tasks, would be saddled with the responsibility of establishment of Nigeria Upstream Regulatory Commission, Nigeria Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority as well as the corporatisation of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to a Limited Liability Company, which will now be called Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited.\n\nIn addition, the committee would also be tasked with the responsibility of determining the assets and liabilities of the NNPC, which would be transferred to NNPC Limited.\n\nAlso, the committee would be tasked with the responsibility of determining the stranded or toxic assets and liabilities which would be taken over by government.\n\n\u201cThe committee has 12 months to finish its job. Also, the committee will look into the conversion of the Oil Prospecting Licences (OPL) and Oil Mining Licences (OML) to Petroleum Prospecting Licences (PPL) and Petroleum Mining Licences (PML) respectively, which are the new names under the Act,\u201d the source who preferred to remain anonymous added.\n\nThe PIA which was birthed on Monday, would serve as framework for the operations in the oil and gas industry. The law which had suffered several setbacks since 2008, when it was first presented to the National Assembly, aims at removing legal and regulatory uncertainties that have held back the industry\u2019s growth.\n\nThe PIA provides legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the Nigerian petroleum industry, the development of host communities, and related matters.\n\nBut the federal government yesterday clarified that it is not going to immediately remove the current subsidy being paid on the pump price of petrol, saying that it intends to manage the process to ensure that vulnerable Nigerians are not heavily impacted.\n\nHowever, while members of the organised private sector and the president\u2019s All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday welcomed the PIA, saying it would unlock investment opportunities in Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector, Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has described the three per cent allocation for host communities in the Niger Delta region as contained in the PIA as meagre.\n\nFG: No Immediate Removal of Petrol Subsidy\n\nThe federal government has said it will not immediately end its current subsidy regime, saying it intends to manage the process to ensure that vulnerable Nigerians are not heavily impacted.\n\nSylva, who spoke at a briefing in Abuja, to mark his two years in office, noted that although desirable, operationalising the free market regime would require that a lot of economic shock absorbers will be out in place.\n\nSylva noted that because deregulation would come with a lot of changes, it would not be advisable to suddenly remove the subsidy, saying it would become a reality when the law becomes fully operational.\n\n\u201cIt (deregulation) is something that is desirable, which I have always said. I\u2019ve never deviated from that. Deregulation is desirable because that is the sustainable way out of where we are. But also, the reality is that deregulation is going to come with some changes.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, when people have been used to certain behaviours, behavioural patterns which means you\u2019ve been used to subsidy for this long, and you want to change that, you have to have some kind of change management process in place.\n\n\u201cYou cannot just change the policy on everybody without looking at some of the problems that this might create. One of which is that we know that this is going to entail increase in price. How do we alleviate the problems that will come with this increase?\n\n\u201cThis is not a mindless government. It is a government that really, really cares about the Nigerians. So, we have to really look at all these possibilities of how to at least alleviate the pains and the problems that this increase might occasion. And that\u2019s why we are taking our time. And that\u2019s why it will not happen overnight.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m just telling you that there is a provision in PIA that will make this happen, that we have to jointly ensure that we\u2019re able to come up with a workable way of making this happen. And that process is already ongoing,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe admitted that although the new law has actually deregulated the sector, it wouldn\u2019t mean that there would be an immediate implementation of pricing.\n\nThe minister further said that governors were asking for deregulation and by extension a price increase because it would be in their interest, adding that a hike means they would have access to more revenue from the federation account.\n\nHe noted that governors are currently getting less from the federation, saying that they had realised that in the end, they are just cutting their noses to spite their face with subsidy.\n\nAlso, contrary to the position of the Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, that Nigeria was consuming about 103 million petrol daily, Sylva described that figure as a \u201cflash\u201d which happens once in a while, pegging the figure at 52 million litres daily consumption on the average.\n\n\u201cBut of course, you know we have flashes. Sometimes, we have these flashes. The daily consumption was at about 66 million litres per day when we came in, and were able to bring it down to about 52 million. That\u2019s really the average.\n\n\u201cBut once in a while, you have that flash and it goes up, maybe because of the activity of smugglers. Well, those are not really the ideal situations, so you cannot really use that as the measure of what is the average consumption.\n\n\u201cThe average product consumption has actually reduced from about 66 million on average. But of course you can\u2019t discount these flashes that you have, which you cannot really judge us on,\u201d he added.\n\nOn the host communities\u2019 fund, the minister explained that it was better to have three per cent of what the communities are sure of.\n\nHe described all the levies and taxes paid by oil companies as a balancing act, saying the new legislation has been fair to the host communities and pointing out that for the first time, there is now a pool of funds targeted at the host communities in this country.\n\nOn the rising prices of cooking gas, the minister stated that the market has been fully deregulated, emphasising that government was no longer in control of how much the product is sold.\n\n\u201cWe are not in a position to determine gas pricing because gas is not a regulated product. But then we are also very concerned that prices are high. We are also doing something about it.\n\n\u201cJust in the interest of the ordinary Nigerian, I have discussed with some of the suppliers. But I can tell you that it is not really our role. But just in the interest of Nigerians we are trying to see how we can intervene with the suppliers and have discussions to allow us see how we can bring down the price of gas to make it more affordable.\n\n\u201cI understand that the average cost of cylinder now is N5,000 to N6,000. But we are following the price and we are doing something about it with the suppliers,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe minister who also took time to explain the frontier exploration fund, noted that the frontier territories are not only in one area of the country.\n\n\u201cThere are frontier territories in Cross River, in the North-east and in the South-west. So when people just locate frontier territories in one part of the country and settle on that, then there\u2019s a problem. So, we must come together as a country, frontier and host communities,\u201d he advised.\n\nHe argued that Nigeria has had about 37 billion barrels reserve for the past 10 years and has not added to it, saying there was need to bring vigour into the industry.\n\n\u201cWe cannot go back to where we are coming from. Let\u2019s look forward as a country, we must look at Nigeria. First, who is the one that is gaining. And I think in this case, it is Nigeria that is the ultimate beneficiary,\u201d he noted.\n\nSylva added that the sector has been able to reduce the cost of production by over 5 per cent, despite the issues of currency fluctuations, as the industry has rationalised contracts, renegotiated others, while many expatriates who were paid in hard currency left because of COVID-19 pandemic, allowing Nigerians to step in.\n\nOPS Hails Buhari, Call for Transparent Implementation of New Law\n\nMeanwhile, representatives of the Organised Private Sector of Nigeria (OPSN) have commended the federal government over the PIA.\n\nBoth the Director General of the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA), Ambassador Ayo Olukanni, and the Director General of the Nigeria Employers\u2019 Consultative Association (NECA), Dr. Timothy Olawale, said the PIA was a landmark decision.\n\nThe representatives of the OPSN, in separate statements noted that the PIA 2021, would herald a positive change in the oil and gas industry, noting that they looked forward to a more robust industry with improved investor confidence and the creation of more employment opportunities for the generality of Nigerians.\n\nOlawale stated that, \u201cthe relevant changes to the governance, administration, regulatory and fiscal framework of the petroleum industry will enhance transparency and further position the industry to contribute effectively to national development.\n\n\u201cWhile some provisions of the PIA are far-reaching with various degrees of implication and consequences for operators in the industry, we urge the government to create a platform of proactive and continuous engagement with the operators in the sector for a smooth implementation of the provisions of the PIA.\u201d\n\nHe urged the federal government to carry stakeholders along in setting up the implementation and monitoring committee in order to ensure the maximisation of the benefits inherent in the PIA.\n\nSpeaking in the same vein, Olukanni, said NACCIMA expects that the PIA would reposition the Nigerian oil and gas sector to attract more investments.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe NACCIMA welcomes the signing into law of the PIB by President Bhuari. After a long journey, the association commends this bold and strategic step to reposition the Nigerian oil and gas sector to restore investor confidence and attract much needed Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and local participation.\u201d\n\nHe argued that the growth of the sector had been stagnated as a number of principal players, \u201cplaced new investments on hold or even divested existing assets due to perceived unstable legal and policy environment.\u201d\n\nThe director general of the NACCIMA also noted that, a restructured NNPC and its ownership structure would help create a wider opportunity and space for members and the oil producing communities to participate.\n\nOlukanni, however, noted that NACCIMA was of the view that the PIA should be implemented in a structured and disciplined manner in order for it to achieve its purpose in the long run.\n\nHe said: \u201cSuch an implementation approach will ensure transparency and focus while reinforcing confidence among local and international players.\n\n\u201cIt is also the view of the association that the private sector is in a prime position to drive the realisation of the objectives of the PIB and as such should receive the requisite support and policy enablement to play this key role in the upstream, midstream and downstream segments.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, a former Senior Technical Adviser, Upstream and Gas, at the Ministry of Petroleum, Gbite Adeniji, yesterday said the PIA would cut wastages in the oil and gas industry.\n\nSpeaking on Arise Television, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm, Adeniji, who was an adviser when Dr. Ibe Kachikwu was petroleum minister, said the new law is not only a petroleum sector reform document, but an economic legislation that could remarkably impact the country.\n\nHe explained that the Act would open the petroleum sector up to a new wave of opportunities, stressing that the country now has a basis for deregulating the downstream.\n\n\u201cWe can cut away all the subsidies that we have completely mismanaged in the last 20 or more years, and redirect some of that towards more useful social and economic needs in the country.\n\n\u201cIt also creates the opportunity for leveraging on Nigeria\u2019s main abundant natural resource, which is natural gas, because if you look at the law, it\u2019s got provisions galore on natural gas.\n\n\u201cAnd this is the first time ever, we actually have provisions dealing with that endowment. So when you think of the energy transition, if you have clarity around the legislative framework for gas, I think that basically positions Nigeria for that future,\u201d he said.\n\nAdeniji emphasised the need to move quickly into a gas-based industrialisation era, stressing that the new law also addresses issues around environmental regulation in the industry, both in the upstream, midstream and downstream.\n\nHe explained that as Nigeria liberalises its oil and gas industry, it also needs laws that would curtail the potential for abuses and monopoly, which the new legislation substantially addresses, saying aside the NNPC, the industry has a number of monopoly operators currently.\n\n\u201cSo, there\u2019s a statutory duty to move away from subsidies. We then have to now see how they set up the regulatory agencies, and how they actually go about implementing the mandate, which is to see that the wholesale transactions as well as seeing petroleum products being sold on a willing buyer, willing seller basis, as opposed to the way we are doing things currently,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that there would be need to appoint experienced management consultants to support the process to see to the proper design of the new national oil company, which the law envisages.\n\nWhile stressing that six months might be too short to do a proper job of assessing and unpacking the assets that are not critical to the future of the new national oil company, including the issue of liabilities, Adeniji noted that competent hands should be hired to turn around the fortunes of the corporation.\n\nOn the refineries, he stated that although currently a liability, the facilities have the capacity to begin to add massive value to the operations of the corporation when they start working.\n\nWith PIA, Buhari Has Shown Courage, Says APC\n\nIn its reaction, the All Progressives Congress (APC) said President Buhari showed courage by signing the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) 2021 into law, ending the long jinx which had seen the bill delayed since early 2000.\n\nThe National Secretary of Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Sen. John Akpanudoedehe, in a statement yesterday, said the economy would be the ultimate beneficiary.\n\nHe said the new legislation would overhaul the oil and gas industry. He further said it would also provide legal, governance, regulatory and fiscal framework for the Nigerian petroleum industry, the development of host communities as well as offer new fiscal incentives to investors.\n\nAkpanudoedehe added, \u201cThe new Petroleum Industry Act may not be a perfect document. No law anywhere in the world is a finished product. It is a good way to start, after decades of groping in the dark in the oil industry.\n\n\u201cMr. President has broken the jinx on many fronts, this is a clear demonstration of the will of a leader, determined to do the right thing. We salute the President\u2019s forthrightness and his courage to lead Nigeria right.\u201d\n\nThe secretary stressed that before now, Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry used to lose as much as $15 billion in investments annually due to the delayed passage of the PIB, adding that this was about to change with the Petroleum Industry Act.\n\nAkpanudoedehe argued the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) attacks of the PIA showed that the opposition party was ready to play politics with the historic feat.\n\n\u201cWe ask, what was the fate of the PIB during the wasted 16 years the PDP was in government? We will let the discerning public be the judge. Meanwhile, the APC will not get tired of righting the PDP\u2019s wrongs,\u201d he said.\n\nRivers State: 3% Allocation to N\u2019Delta Communities Meagre\n\nHowever, Wike has described the three per cent allocation for host communities in the Niger Delta region as contained in the Act as meagre.\n\nThe governor who commended the passage of the law, stated that the stipulated allocation for the host communities of oil exploitation was unacceptable.\n\nSpeaking in Port Harcourt yesterday, Wike said: \u201cWe believe that three per cent is not enough as regards the kind of pollution and environmental crisis we have had because of oil exploitation. I thought what Mr. President would have done was to tell members of National Assembly, yes, you have done what you are supposed to do, but again, you need to take into consideration the yearnings of the host communities.\u201d\n\nThe governor bemoaned the exclusion of oil producing state governments in the implementation and administration of the three per cent oil revenue recommended for host communities in the PIA.\n\nHe expressed concern that the international oil companies would take advantage of this, to continually instigate crisis in oil producing communities in order not to pay the three per cent due the host communities.\n\nSpeaking on the ongoing constitutional amendment process, Wike said it was satisfying to know that such function was not an exclusive preserve of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cThe confidence people have today is that the amendment of the constitution will get to the states. Take for example, the federal government may not be in support of state police, but you have two-third of states that say they need state police, so in that case, state police will pass. There are issues that you may not like, but these are done on clause by clause basis.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Oluchi Chibuzor with agency report\n\nSaudi Aramco is in advanced talks for an all-stock deal to acquire a stake in Reliance Industries Limited\u2019s oil refining and chemicals business, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg.\n\nThe Saudi Arabian firm is discussing the purchase of a roughly 20 per cent stake in the Reliance unit for about $20 billion to $25 billion-worth of Aramco shares, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.\n\nThe announcement comes about two weeks after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved the acquisition of 20 per cent minority stakes by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) in upcoming Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refinery.\n\nDangote Petroleum Refinery is a 650,000 barrels per day (BPD) integrated refinery project under construction in the Lekki Free Zone near Lagos, Nigeria. It is expected to be Africa\u2019s biggest oil refinery and the world\u2019s biggest single-train facility.\n\nThe Pipeline Infrastructure at the Dangote Petroleum Refinery is the largest anywhere in the world, with 1,100 kilometers to handle 3 Billion Standard Cubic Foot of gas per day. The Refinery alone has a 400MW Power Plant that is able to meet the total power requirement of Ibadan DisCo.\n\nThe Refinery will meet 100 per cent of the Nigerian requirement of all refined products and also have a surplus of each of these products for export.\n\nIt is designed to process Nigerian crude with the ability to also process other crudes.\n\nReliance, which is backed by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani, could reach an agreement with Aramco as soon as the coming weeks, the people said.\n\nShares in Reliance extended gains to as much as 2.6 per cent in Mumbai after the Bloomberg News report.\n\nA deal would forge a closer alliance between the world\u2019s biggest oil exporter and one of the fastest-growing consumers. Ties and trade between the two countries have grown in recent years as India looks to bolster its energy security and Saudi Arabia reduces its support for Pakistan over the disputed territory of Kashmir.\n\nRiyadh and New Delhi elevated their relationship to a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d in 2019.\n\nIt would seal more than two years of negotiations and mark Aramco\u2019s first all-stock deal since its initial public offering in 2019.\n\nAmbani confirmed talks about a deal with an implied stake valuation of $15 billion that same year. Discussions were delayed by the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and slump in oil prices.\n\nEnergy markets have since recovered, with crude prices jumping around 35 per cent this year to almost $70 a barrel. Aramco said last week due diligence on a deal with Reliance was underway.\n\nA transaction would boost Aramco\u2019s sales of crude to India. For Reliance, it would help to lock in a steady supply of oil for its giant refineries and make the Indian company a shareholder in Aramco.\n\nBased on Aramco\u2019s market valuation of about $1.9 trillion, a transaction would give Reliance a stake of around one per cent.\n\nDetails of the potential transaction are still being negotiated, and talks could drag on longer or fall apart, the people said. A representative for Aramco declined to comment.\n\nThe Saudi government\u2019s Center for International Communication didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email requesting comment.\n\nA representative for Reliance said the company does not have anything to add beyond Ambani\u2019s comments at the shareholders\u2019 meeting in June, when the conglomerate appointed Aramco Chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan to the board. Ambani had said Reliance could finalize an investment deal with the oil producer this year.\n\nThe transaction would help Aramco reach its goal of more than doubling refining capacity to between eight million and 10 million barrels of crude a day. The Saudi firm had 3.6 million barrels a day of capacity at the end of last year, including stakes in joint ventures.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Do not succumb to any covert enticement from the customs service, no matter what they offer or promise to do for you.\n\n\u201cWhatever they want to do for you, let it be in the open, not in secret. \u201cIf you accept any secret offer, then, you will be truncating government\u2019s efforts to seek justice for you, but if you resist any untoward move, the organisation will then have to rethink its attitude towards its host community\u201d.\n\nRecall that Masari had last week told the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya, that the state was under severe attacks by bandits and kidnappers, a situation he said had left 10 out of the 34 local government areas of the state vulnerable.\n\nThe governor, who expressed worry over the prevailing security challenges in the state, affirmed that the deteriorating spate of banditry accompanied by kidnapping, raping of innocent women and armed robbery on the state\u2019s highways, were afflicting his government\u2019s effort of restoring peace and normalcy in the state.\n\nMasari, who hinted at this while receiving Yahaya at the Government House, Katsina, said both residents and security agencies must work together to up the ante in the war against bandits, kidnapping and other criminal activities in the state.\n\nHe said the military and other security agencies in Nigeria needed logistics support and manpower to tackle banditry, kidnapping and other insecurity challenges confronting the nation, particularly in the North-west region of the country.\n\nHe, however, called for the deployment of modern technology to tackle insecurity in the country, saying the world has gone into the era of technology, adding that, \u201cwith technology, you can fight your war with minimum number of personnel\u201d.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Social media giant, Twitter, has refused to join its social media counterparts in banning the Taliban from its platform, saying it'll monitor content to ensure there aren't messages \u201cglorifying violence.\u201d\n\nThe move is in stark contrast to the company's Big Tech rivals, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram (both owned by Facebook), TikTok and YouTube who have all banned and terminated accounts that are related to, promote or praise the Taliban.\n\nAccording to Daily Mail, Twitter said in a statement that it will \u201ccontinue to proactively enforce our rules and review content that may violate Twitter rules, specifically policies against glorification of violence, platform manipulation and spam.\u201d\n\nThe social media giant used this justification to permanently ban former United States President, Donald Trump, after the January 6 Capitol Riot, causing cries of censorship from Trump supporters.\n\nTwitter defended its decision to allow Taliban-related accounts to remain active, saying that people in Afghanistan are using the platform to seek help and refuge.\n\nFacebook, which also has muzzled Trump, has had its ban on the Taliban in place for years because it considers it a 'dangerous group.'\n\nThis double standard drew the ire of Americans who are Trump\u2019s supporters and conservatives.\n\nThe two Taliban spokesmen, Suhail Shaehee and Zabihullah Mujahid have more than 351,000 and 310,000 Twitter followers, respectively. Their accounts have been active for years.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rep. Doug Lamborn sent a letter to Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey, expressing concerns about members of the Taliban being allowed to use the platform to get their message out.\n\n\u201cWhy does Twitter allow two Taliban spokesmen to have a platform but restricts the First Amendment Rights of former President Trump? It's past time to hold #BigTech accountable. #Taliban,\u201d he tweeted.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban Spokesman has a Twitter account without any problem. Meanwhile, President Trump is banned from the platform,\u201d tweeted Rep. Claudia Tenney, a New York Republican. 'Something is very wrong here.'\n\nAdrian Hilton, a conservative academic and lecturer on political philosophy in the UK, also pointed out the apparent double standards.\n\nDuring a Tuesday press conference in Kabul - which was broadcast and translated into English by Al Jazeera and posted on Twitter - a spokesperson was asked about freedom of speech.\n\n\u201cThis question should be asked to those people who are claiming to be promoters of freedom of speech who do not allow publication of information. I can ask [the] Facebook company,\u201d he replied.\n\nThe Taliban spokesman's comments were greeted by virtual applause from Donald Trump Jr. on Twitter, who retweeted the 30-second video clip and said, \u201cLOL ... Also not wrong.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan was all but complete, after the U.S. spent two decades and billions of dollars attempting to prop up a democratic government friendly to the West.\n\nThe U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 ousted the Islamist militants from power, but they never left, and returned to power after Afghan government forces completely capitulated.",
          "summary": "Twitter defended its decision to allow Taliban-related accounts to remain active, saying that people in Afghanistan are using the platform to seek help and refuge.\nFacebook, which also has muzzled Trump, has had its ban on the Taliban in place for years because it considers it a 'dangerous group.'\nThe two Taliban spokesmen, Suhail Shaehee and Zabihullah Mujahid have more than 351,000 and 310,000 Twitter followers, respectively.\n\u201cWhy does Twitter allow two Taliban spokesmen to have a platform but restricts the First Amendment Rights of former President Trump?\nMeanwhile, President Trump is banned from the platform,\u201d tweeted Rep.

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria has just frozen the bank accounts of Nigerian fintech platforms Risevest, Bamboo, Trove and Chaka for the next six months.\n\nAccording to The Whistler, the Federal High Court in Abuja has granted an exparte motion which sought temporary freezing of bank accounts belonging to these online investment and trading platforms where Nigerians are transacting business online.\n\nThe motion was filed by Chief Micheal Kaase Aondoakaa, SAN, on behalf of the Central Bank Of Nigeria Governor for the purpose of probing the financial activities of these four fintech companies in Nigeria.\n\nThe CBN alleged that Rise Vest Technologies Limited, Bamboo Systems Technology Limited, Chaka Technologies Limited and Trove Technologies Limited were complicit in operating without license as asset management companies \u201cand utilizing FX sourced from the Nigerian FX market for purchasing foreign bonds/shares in contravention of the CBN circular referenced TED/FEM/FPC/GEN/01/012, dated July 01, 2015.\u201d\n\nThe prosecutor told Justice Ahmed Mohammed that the foreign exchange deals done with the defendants were making the Naira weaker to the United States dollars, hence, the need to block 15 of their accounts for about 180 days.\n\nNotably, all four companies affected by this action have gotten licenses from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate as digital platforms for buying and selling stocks.\n\nIn response to this announcement, Risevest\u2019s CEO Eke Eleanya Urum and Bamboo have come out on Twitter (that\u2019s banned) to assure users of Risevest that trading activities will continue as usual and the issue will be sorted out with the regulators.\n\nHey guys, in respect to the most recent news regarding @Risevest and our FX dealings, rest assured all user investments and funds are safely managed, funding and withdrawals will continue to be processed as normal and all our US operations are intact. \u2014 Indaboski of Investing \ud83d\ude80 (@eldivyn) August 17, 2021\n\nHi everyone, we\u2019re aware of the recent reports about us.

This action comes on the back of the recent move by the CBN to stop the sale of foreign exchange (FX) to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in the country, and a restriction on these platforms for not being duly registered in April.\n\nAccording to a source from one of the affected companies, they lost a lot of users and deposits after the April announcement.

          "title": "Nigerian startup checks out of Afghanistan post Taliban takeover",
          "text": "Yesterday, a horrific video from Afghanistan broke the internet. Hundreds of Afghans, in a desperate bid to flee the country, were captured in the footage running after and clinging to the body of a US Air Force plane as it prepared to depart Kabul airport.\n\nOver the weekend, the Taliban hijacked the government and assumed total control of the capital city\u2014 it wasn\u2019t long before they had the whole country to themselves. The central government was disbanded; Ashraf Ghani, the president of Afghanistan fled the scene unannounced, leaving what remained of his administration in the mercy of the Taliban.\n\nAfghani citizens aren\u2019t the only ones affected by the current crisis. African entrepreneurs and skilled workers who run operations in Kabul are also dealing with the consequences of the Taliban\u2019s actions. How are they coping with this heat? Are they packing their loads and fleeing or are they staying put to see where the leaf drops?\n\nLast year Olumuyiwa Olowogboyega, former senior reporter, TechCabal, interviewed Vincent, a Nigeria Cybersecurity expatriate working out of Kabul, who described Afghanistan as a city on the edge, an unstable mountainous city with two presidents.\n\nMore recently, Chekkit, a Nigerian authentication and product tracking startup, expanded to Afghanistan after landing a partnership with the Afghanistan Ministry of Health to help in combating the endemic counterfeit medicine products in the country.\n\nIn a conversation with Tosin Adelowo, Chekkit CMO, I asked: why Afghanistan? Tosin disclosed that the country was urgently looking for a solution to the counterfeit market plaguing its cities and streets and \u201cChekkit has the perfect solution to the problem\u201d and that, alongside other brokering factors, is a major determinant of the expansion.\n\nAfter a successful pilot of Chekkit\u2019s drug verification solution in collaboration with their blockchain partner, Fantom Foundation (which was the major broker of the deal), the Afghanistan Ministry of Health announced the rollout of the service nationally on the 2nd of May 2021.\n\nNow, a little over three months later, Chekkit is pulling the plug on all its operations in Afghanistan. Their exit wasn\u2019t much of a decision as all their partners have been forced to exit the country.\n\n\u201cWe have discontinued our communication/operation in the region as our partners have also exited the region due to the civil unrest,\u201d Adelowo told TechCabal in an email. \u201dOur heart is with the people of Afghanistan and we pray for strength for them to withstand and surpass the current issues.\u201d\n\nChekkit\u2019s exit is just the beginning of a series of backward movements that are expected to happen in Afghanistan as a result of this unrest. And in the absence of Chekkit\u2019s solutions, and similar solutions in the market, there\u2019s a likelihood that counterfeit products will return with unchecked and unverified vengeance.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSince the takeover, different analyses have been released on the impact it will have on trade and economy of the country. According to Times Now, the Afghan economy has been reliant on international aid with a limited private sector. Nearly half (around 44%) of its workforce is in agriculture.

          "title": "Iyin Aboyeji, Caleb Zipperstein, on why Future Africa is opening an office in Israel",
          "text": "Last week, a former associate director with leading Isreali VC OurCrowd Caleb Zipperstein, announced his appointment as a venture partner with Future Africa, and the launch of their Israeli office. This was a bit of a surprise as most local startups or funds have historically looked to Europe or Asia, as alternative sources of capital. So we sat down with Future Africa co-founder Iyin Aboyeji and Caleb to get some insight behind the move.\n\nAdegoke: Iyin. You have a reputation of being ahead of the curve and spotting the next best startup idea or trend so I\u2019m curious. Why are you opening an office in Tel Aviv, Israel? When everyone else is looking to the West then maybe Asia, for capital?\n\nIyin: The first reason is Caleb. You can\u2019t go to Israel without a professional like Caleb to support you both in terms of his political savvy with the existing prime minister\u2019s office and experience and numbers with Israeli VC OurCrowd which is a firm that is tailored after ours. Working with Caleb was the first direction. I think we would have worked with Caleb anywhere he was in the world.\n\nThe other benefit is when we think of the kind of challenges we face here, from security to agriculture, I think there\u2019s a lot we can learn from the Israeli venture community. We are in the US you know. So it\u2019s not a question of us looking away from the West but really looking in places where others wouldn\u2019t, to find a new class of limited partners (LPs).\n\nAdegoke: What does the current state of ecosystem relationship between Africa and Israel look like and where will Future Africa take that relationship to?\n\nIyin: There\u2019s been a long history, maybe hidden, when it comes to things like cybersecurity. A lot of us know Cybersun. That\u2019s an Israeli firm in Nigeria. Even agriculture. A lot of drip irrigation technology that is used across the country is Israeli tech.\n\nCaleb: Yeah. Netafim. In fact, they announced last year a $60 million deal or something like that with Rwanda. Tala communications which is in Kenya raised from an Israeli VC. Zipline raised from an Israeli VC. There are lots of collaborations. Today, Israel has three direct flights to Addis Ababa and their schedules were barely altered during the pandemic.\n\nIyin: My mindset is there are hidden relationships between the Nigerian and Israeli tech communities. It\u2019s not at an all-time high though. So there\u2019s an opportunity for us to really build that with Caleb in Israel, get more Israeli LPs, people that are very optimistic about technology and its use for solving real problems. And we\u2019re not stopping with Tel Aviv. At the moment, we\u2019re having conversations about an office opening in Dubai and London. We\u2019re going to be scaling Future Africa very fast around the world and building this global investment firm that\u2019s focused on Africa.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAdegoke: How did you meet Caleb?\n\nIyin: I had this bunch of really interesting calls with Caleb. He reached out to me when he was thinking about moving to Rwanda during the pandemic to learn about and explore the innovation and VC ecosystem in Africa. We met online and started talking a lot and I told him that a good way for him to get involved would be to work with us especially around investor success. This is because he comes with that understanding of how to get investors infectiously excited about Africa.\n\nCaleb Zipperstein\n\nAdegoke: I agree! Caleb is always enthusiastic every time I speak with him.\n\nIyin: Yeah. That\u2019s the kind of energy we need in our firm to bring more investment into Africa.\n\nAdegoke: How would you characterize the Israeli ecosystem in terms of the size of investments, the biggest startups, or entrepreneurs?\n\nCaleb: What\u2019s going on in the Israeli ecosystem is that the economy is maturing. We\u2019re seeing more unicorns and growth deals than ever before. There were 19 IPOs last year. We\u2019re not seeing less private capital coming into the country but we\u2019re seeing a little bit less of early-stage investing. I\u2019m a little bit curious if this then presents some market opportunity for investors who are looking for early-stage deals. Through the pandemic, Israelis have these key hidden records in fundraising. We\u2019ve had more unicorns, Lemonade, and two companies\u2019 IPO recently. The former commander of the Israeli Mossad, the most elite secret service spy agency in the world, was just hired to be Israel\u2019s representative for SoftBank. It\u2019s crazy what is happening within the tech ecosystem in terms of big solutions. Israel\u2019s Prime Minister was a cybersecurity entrepreneur and an investor. The former mayor of Jerusalem made his money as an early investor in Checkpoint Cybersecurity. Generally, through the pandemic, the Israeli tech ecosystem has grown, the values have grown, the companies have matured. Now the question really is how this affects the early stage landscape. Israel will always be entrepreneurial, innovative, looking to solve problems. I\u2019m interested in if there\u2019ll be more opportunities for collaboration with neighbouring markets, which in this case would include Africa.\n\nAdegoke: Outside of Israel, which market would you say receives most of Israeli tech investment?\n\nCaleb: I\u2019d say Silicon Valley. VCs like Ribbit Capital. I think Ribbit led the last round in ChipperCash. So there could be a really interesting Israeli-African connection. I\u2019m really hoping that Israeli innovators will look to Africa and also that Israeli startups, growth companies, and corporate venture funds in Israel will be working closely with Future Africa and its portfolio companies. There\u2019s a huge fintech following but there are not enough jobs for Israelis. There\u2019s room for more great fintech but seeing the fintech boom in Africa, we think there could be some great ways for talent exchange and collaboration.\n\nAdegoke: Is the predominant investment thesis in Israel similar to what we have here? Beyond key sectors like fintech, do you see investors putting their money in other business areas?\n\nCaleb: Israel is not a B2C market. We\u2019ve also very recently have become more of a scale-up market. There are many startups that were sold for hundreds of millions of dollars before they were even selling a single product. In Africa, the way to become a unicorn is to have a great product, management team, execution. I think the potential ways in which Israel is.\n\nIyin: Caleb\u2019s remit is going to go beyond Israel. So the presence in Israel is just a part of the full picture. We want to be visible to investors, particularly to those that can add a lot of value to our portfolio. And this is where we may be looking for partnerships and solutions. Like in Dubai, there\u2019s a whole bunch of companies coming particularly from Europe who leverage Israel as their premier headquarters. Caleb\u2019s going to be working with us across the world, with our investors. We currently have over 300 investors from across the world. And we\u2019re looking to further scale our presence for investors all over the world \u2013 from current offices in the U.S., Tel Aviv, and Lagos, with plans to set up in London, Dubai, etc, \u2013 and we\u2019re hiring quite a number of people for the expansion.\n\nAdegoke: Nice! How do you plan to sell the African story to entrepreneurs and investors?\n\nCaleb: I\u2019m going to show them articles on TechCabal which have been showing stories about big rounds in companies, startups reaching unicorn status, Paystack getting sold, Flutterwave creating the impact that they\u2019ve had, and reaching business milestones that they\u2019ve had. The numbers don\u2019t lie. The number of deals in Africa is growing year over year \u2013 literally at an out-of-control pace. And early investors in those deals have been able to benefit demonstrably from those wins which is the embodiment of VC \u2013 high risk, high reward. Honestly, I cannot think of a better person to introduce the African VC ecosystem to this country than E because of his experience as an entrepreneur and an investor.\n\nShare this article\n\nAdegoke Oyeniyi | Author @seunadegoke01",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

And I know that in the case of my business, attending the last edition of SME Clinic, listening to all the panelists moderate insightful sessions, and winning a grant all contributed to the growth of my business today. Since then, we have gone on to increase our product offerings, added to our collection, and leveraged technology for the best of publicity.\u201d \u2014 W. Habib, CEO Smiley Socks Company.\n\n\u201cGiven the nature of my business, it\u2019s one that\u2019s full of unpredictable turns. Attending SME Clinic in 2020 really helped me with strategies to grow my brand, plus the grant I won at the event came just in the nick of time and was effectively utilised. During the lockdown, I was still able to onboard offline customers to our, at the time, new online platform, and this helped me reach more people and especially, made for ease of interaction with offline clients.\u201d \u2014 F.

          "title": "I want more women to become angel investors \u2014 Yemi Keri on angel investing and building Rising Tide",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

This is as students are warned to steer clear of the hostels if they are not legal occupants.\n\nMr Azeez, in the statement, noted that all the extant rules and regulations with the associated penalties guiding hostel residency are still applicable for compliance by all students.\n\nHe said all the eligible hostel occupants are also expected to abide by the guidelines for admittance into the hostels.\n\nThe statement reads in part; \u201cEligible students are expected to abide strictly by the guidelines for admittance into the Halls of Residence and such students must have been duly registered for the second semester exams, ready to always wear face masks, use hand sanitisers and also stick only to their bed spaces.\n\n\u201cThey must also present coloured Examination Docket for 2nd semester 2019/2020 examinations; present a bottle of hand sanitizer- minimum of 500ml; present, at least, 10 pieces of face masks; wear face mask into and out of the hostels at all times, and only use their allocated bed spaces.\u201d\n\nAvailable isolation\n\nTowards guiding against untoward eventualities, the university said arrangements have been made with its teaching hospital arm and a nearby general hospital owned by the Lagos State Government for possible isolation of cases.\n\n\u201cIn order to ensure the safety of staff and students during this period, the University will adhere strictly to all COVID-19 protocols. Special arrangements have been made with the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) and Gbagada General Hospital for necessary isolation and treatment of any incidence of COVID-19 case during the examinations,\u201d the statement added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

We appealed to him on the need for him to forget what has happened in the past. We told him that the problem is not peculiar to our administration\n\n\u201cThey have their reason but whatever that may be their reasons we are still on top of the matter. We are appealing to them because we are all collaborating for the peace and security of the state and we believe our principal the Chief Executive of the state which is in charge of the security we not allow the matter to go out of hand.\n\n\u201cThe present new of Amotekun will use everything within our reach to resolve the matter. The Hunter groups are not separating from us the deputy commandant of hunters is a member of this committee of new Amotekun in Osun and we believe he would help us to talk to his people.\u201d\n\nCorroborating the Chairman, the Corps Commandant, Brigadier General Bashir Adewimbi (Rtd) urged residents of the state to be security conscious saying the security of the life and prosperity required a collective efforts of every individuals.\n\nHe, however, charged the residents in the state to always alert security personnel whenever they observe strange movement in their area at appropriate time.\n\n\u201cThere should be synergy and collaboration between Amotekun and residents of the state.\n\n\u201cWhen people see strange faces around them they should alert the security agencies at the appropriate time. Information should not be hidden by any body.\n\n\u201cIf you see strange or foreign face that can put threat to the security of the area the public should as a matter of urgency alert the security agencies through a telephone number 293.\u201d Adewinmbi concluded",

          "title": "ICYMI: Nigerian governors sue Buhari, FG over N2.28T loot",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s 36 governors have taken the Federal Government to the Supreme Court over the status of an estimated N2.28 trillion recovered loot.\n\nThe governors sued under the umbrella of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum.\n\nThey are asking the apex court to, among others, compel the Federal Government to account for about N2.28trillion (both in cash and assets) so far recovered from looters and suspects since 2015.\n\nThey claimed that between 2015 and now, the Federal Government had recovered about N1.8 trillion in cash and about N450 billion worth of non-cash assets, alleging that it diverted same into the Consolidated Revenue Accounts (CRA) and other accounts not recognised by the constitution, as against the Federation Account (FA), as required.\n\nThe plaintiffs, in the suit marked: SCN/CV/393/2021 filed by a legal team, which include Femi Falana (SAN), want the court to compel the Federal Government to give detailed account of the recovered assets and remit same into the FA. They also want the Revenue Mobilisation and Fiscal Commission (RMFAC) to design modalities for distributing the recovered loot among the federating units.\n\nListed as the sole defendant in the suit filed on June 16, is the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF).\n\nThe affidavit supporting the suit by the states was deposed to by the Director-General of the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), Asishana Okauru.\n\nIn it, the plaintiffs accused President Muhammadu Buhari and the AGF of engaging in constitutional breaches with regard to the Asset Tracing, Recovery and Management Regulation, 2019.\n\nThey contended that contrary to constitutional provisions, the Asset Tracing, Recovery and Management Regulation, 2019, created the Federal Government of Nigeria Asset Recovery Account domiciled in the Central Bank of Nigeria and prescribed that all proceeds from the Final Forfeited Assets should be paid into the said account.\n\nThe plaintiffs noted that the Asset Tracing, Recovery and Management Regulation, 2019 also created the Interim Forfeiture Recovery Account, into which all funds belonging to other tiers or forfeited to other tiers shall be paid.\n\nThey contended that by establishing the Asset Recovery Account and Interim Forfeiture Recovery Account, into which revenue from recovered assets is to be paid, \u201cthe Asset Recovery Regulation contradicts the provisions of the constitution. The Honorable Attorney-General of the Federation has also acted beyond his constitutional powers.\u201d\n\nThey stated that numerous illegally acquired assets have been recovered by the FG since 2015 through agencies like the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) and the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation (OAGF).\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that the President, his ministers, law enforcement agencies and others \u201chave failed to remit the receipts, proceeds or income derived from the recovered assets to the Federation Account as constitutionally required.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has consistently diverted these funds to other purposes, including payment into its Consolidated Revenue Account for its sole benefit,\u201d they added\u2019\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that, rather than pay the recovered cash into the Federation Account (FA), the Federal Government illegally diverted it into the Consolidated Revenue Accounts (CRA) and other accounts not recognised by the constitution.\n\nThey said: \u201cA common pool of all revenues of the federation of Nigeria\u201d, the Federation Account houses the funds that are meant to be shared among the federating units based on agreed revenue sharing formula, the plaintiffs explained in an affidavit filed in support of the suit.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, the CRA, according to the plaintiffs, is the account into which the federal government\u2019s share from the Federation Account, other federal earnings, and funds belonging to specific state governments are paid.\n\n\u201cOther federal earnings payable to the CRAs include receipts from Federal Government licenses and land revenue, administrative fees, earnings and sales, rent of government property, interests from Federal Government investments, repayments from state governments, Personal Income Tax of Armed Forces, and others.\n\n\u201cFunds in the CRAs strictly belonging to the federal government and specific states, are not distributable among the federating units.\n\n\u201cWhen funds are allocated from the Federation Account to the Federal or State Governments as the case may be, they are transferred to the respective Consolidated Revenue Accounts from which appropriation for government expenditure is made by an Appropriation Act or a Supplementary Appropriation Act, whichever the case.\u201d\n\nSections 162(1), 162 (10) and 80 of the Constitution and Section 2 of the Finance (Control and Management) Act, 1958 argued that recovered funds qualified as revenue payable to the Federation Account, instead of the Consolidated Revenue Account of the Federal Government.\n\nAccording to the plaintiffs, it amounted to a violation of the constitution for the Federal Government \u201cto remit or divert revenue payable into the Federation Account to the Consolidated Revenue Account of the Federal Government or any other account whatsoever, or to apply the said revenue to any other purpose.\n\nThey added: \u201cWhere revenues payable into the Federation Account have been illegally diverted into the Consolidated Revenue Fund, or applied to any other contrary purpose by the Federal Government, the illegally diverted revenue must be repaid, and the repayment is charged on the CRA of the Federal Government or its share of allocation from the Federation Account.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs, who are praying the court for 13 reliefs, want, an order directing the President, the Minister of Finance, the AGF office, the Accountant-General of the Federation, and all other relevant authorities and/or agencies of the federation to give an account of the receipts, income, returns or proceeds derived from all assets recovered, seized, confiscated and/or forfeited to the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nAlso, they want the court to direct the President, the Minister of Finance, the AGF, the Accountant General of the Federation and all other relevant officials and agencies \u201cto remit\u201d the N1, 836, 906, 543, 658.73 (cash) and N450, 000, 000, 000.00 (non-cash) into the Federation Account immediately, in line with the provision of Section 162 of the Constitution.\n\nThe plaintiffs also want an order directing the President, relevant officials and agencies, including the Revenue Mobilisation and Fiscal Commission (RMFAC) \u201cto determine forthwith, the modalities for distributing the receipts from seized, forfeited and recovered assets among the Federal, State and Local Government from the Federation Account.\u201d\n\nAs at Tuesday, the AGF was yet to file a response, and the Supreme Court, currently on its annual long vacation, is yet to fix a date for the hearing of the case.\n\nBut, in a statement by his media aide, Dr. Umar Gwandu, Malami argued that the governors were on a wild goose chase, contending that the recovered loot, both domestic and international, are not governed by local laws.\n\n\u201cInternational Recoveries are more or less governed by international conventions, negotiations and agreement of parties. It is never a straightjacket application of local legislation.\n\n\u201cRevenue Mobilization and Fisical Commission Act has nothing specific on funds recovered from indicted public officers. It merely mentions accruals and disbursement of revenue from the Federation Account. So questions of recovery of stolen funds from indicted public officers are appropriately dealt with by other relevant laws.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, misleading to give the impression that such recoveries and usage of stolen funds and stashed abroad are provided for by the Revenue Mobilization, Allocation and Fiscal Commission Act. One cannot situate rights and entitlements on looted funds and recovered assets with myopic and narrow understating of concepts of the application of local legislations.\n\nRead more",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has condoled with the family of former Deputy Senate President Ibrahim Nasir Mantu, saying the deceased dedicated most of his life to the service of his people.\n\nA family source said Senator Mantu died in the early hours of Tuesday.\n\nMantu\u2019s personal secretary, Zaharaddeen Ibrahim, who is also a nephew to the deceased, confirmed the death.\n\n\u201cHe had been in hospital for the past one week in Abuja. He died at about 3 o\u2019clock in the night,\u201d Zaharaddeen said.\n\nThe aide said the deceased \u201cleft behind his wife, his four children- two females and two males- Zahra, Zuwaira, Musa and Umar.\u201d\n\nThe funeral prayer of the late elder statesman held at the Apo Legislative Quarters Mosque Abuja, and had since been buried in accordance with Islamic rites.\n\nBuhari mourns\n\nMeanwhile, President Buhari has joined the government and people of Plateau state in mourning the passing of the renowned politician.\n\nHe also commiserated with the leaders and members of the National Assembly, friends and political associates of the former lawmaker.\n\nThe president prayed for the repose of the soul of the departed, believing his legacy of reconciliation and promotion of peaceful co-existence would always be remembered, especially in bringing more harmony to his state and the country at large.\n\nHe will be sorely missed \u2013Atiku\n\nSimilarly, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the last general elections, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has expressed shock over Mantu\u2019s demise.\n\nIn a statement issued by his media office in Abuja Tuesday, Abubakar said his association with Mantu dates back to the era of military-guided political transition programmes\n\n\u201cThe former Vice President noted that while he was in the defunct Social Democratic Party (SDP), Mantu was a leading political light in the National Republican Convention (NRC).\n\nHe said Mantu, who until his passing away, was a member of the PDP NEC, \u201cwas a friendly soul who loved Nigeria and promoted national unity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Waziri Adamawa said that as Vice President following the restoration of democratic rule, he worked together with Mantu, who was then the Deputy Senate President and others to stabilise the nascent democracy within the first tenure of the Fourth Republic.\n\n\u201cMantu was very central in the management of the frosty relationship between the executive and the legislature in those difficult years of learning the nuances of democratic practice.\n\n\u201cHe alluded to Mantu\u2019s dogged and tenacious spirit which he said was instrumental in lifting him from humble beginnings to a life of statesmanship.\n\n\u201cHe noted that as a senator representing Plateau Central and a Deputy Senate President, Mantu saw his responsibility as going beyond the Plateau and the Senate chambers to the level of a nationalist who thought of Nigeria first.\n\n\u201cHe said that Nigeria will miss Senator Mantu \u2018s political experiences which spanned over four decades.\n\n\u201cAtiku Abubakar prayed to Allah to forgive Ibrahim Mantu\u2019s sins, console the family he left behind, the government and people of Plateau State and the Senate which he served with distinction,\u201d the statement said.\n\nA dazzling political mobiliser gone -PDP\n\nAlso, the PDP in statement Tuesday by its national publicity secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said it is \u201cdevastated and inconsolable over this huge tragedy which has befallen not only the party but the entire nation, Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIt said: \u201cSenator Mantu was a highly resourceful leader, an excellent lawmaker, exemplary democrat and dazzling political mobiliser, a very humble and detribalised statesman, who spent his life in innumerable sacrifices towards the unity, stability and economic development of our dear fatherland.\u201d\n\nThe PDP recalled \u201cthe incalculable contributions by Senator Mantu, who brought his love for the nation as well as his skills to bear in the Senate where he served as chairman, Senate Committee on Information as well as the Deputy Senate President.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the Deputy Senate President, Senator Mantu played key roles in stabilising the Senate for greater legislative productivity. His political dexterity as the chairman of Joint National Assembly Constitution Review Committee from 2001 to 2003 and from 2003 to 2007, laid the strong foundation for successful reviews of the constitution to reflect the aspirations of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSenator Mantu was a pillar in the PDP and our party will never forget his sacrifices to ensure the success and growth of the PDP at all levels.\n\nAbove all, Senator Mantu was a good man, a God-fearing soul, who spared nothing in ensuring the wellbeing of others above personal pursuits.\n\n\u201cSenator Mantu\u2019s death is indeed a big blow to our party, but we draw solace in the fact that he lived a fulfilled life and made impart (sic) in his calling as a patriot.\n\n\u201cGiven that the PDP grieves at this moment, the meeting of the National Working Committee (NWC) earlier slated for today, Tuesday, August 17, 2021, has been rescheduled for tomorrow, Wednesday, August 18, 2021, in honour of Senator Mantu.\n\n\u201cOur party commiserates with the Mantu family, the PDP fold in Plateau state, the people of Plateau central as well as the entire state. The PDP also prays to God to grant eternal rest to the faithful departed and to the bereaved, the fortitude to bear this huge loss,\u201d the statement said.",

          "text": "The Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), a platform for all the 36 state governors, has dragged the federal government to the Supreme Court over alleged illegal diversion of over N1.8 trillion recovered loot.\n\nThe governors also accused the federal government of diverting another N450 billion worth of non-cash assets recovered proceeds of crime since 2015.\n\nThey claimed that rather than paying the cash into the Federation Account, the federal government illegally diverted it into the Consolidated Revenue Accounts (CRA) and other accounts not recognised by the Nigerian Constitution.\n\nThe governors\u2019 position was made known in an affidavit deposed to by NGF Director-General Asishana Okauru, on behalf of the plaintiffs.\n\nA \u201ccommon pool of all revenues of the federation of Nigeria\u201d, the Federation Account houses the funds that are meant to be shared among the federating units based on agreed revenue sharing formula, the plaintiffs pointed out in the affidavit filed in support of the suit.\n\nOn the other hand, the CRA, according to the plaintiffs, is the account into which the federal government\u2019s share from the Federation Account, other federal earnings, and funds belonging to specific state governments are paid.\n\nOther federal earnings payable to the CRAs include receipts from federal government licenses and land revenue, administrative fees, earnings and sales, rent of government property, interests from federal government investments, repayments from state governments, Personal Income Tax of Armed Forces, and others.\n\nThey contended that the funds in the CRAs strictly belonging to the federal government and specific states are not distributable among the federating units.\n\n\u201cWhen funds are allocated from the Federation Account to the Federal or State Governments as the case may be, they are transferred to the respective Consolidated Revenue Accounts from which appropriation for government expenditure is made by an Appropriation Act or a Supplementary Appropriation Act, whichever the case,\u201d the supporting affidavit added.\n\nCiting sections 162 (1), 162 (10) and 80 of the Nigerian constitution and section 2 of the Finance (Control and Management) Act, 1958, the plaintiffs argued that recovered funds qualify as revenue payable to the Federation Account instead of the Consolidated Revenue Account of the federal government.\n\nTherefore, it is \u201cunconstitutional to remit or divert revenue payable into the Federation Account to the Consolidated Revenue Account of the Federal Government or any other account whatsoever, or to apply the said revenue to any other purpose,\u201d they further submitted.\n\nThey are therefore asking for the remittance of N1.8 trillion (cash) and N450billion (non-cash) in recovered loot since 2015 into the federation account.\n\nThey are also asking for a detailed account of the recovered assets not remitted into the Federation Account by the Muhammadu Buhari administration, as well as all the relevant officials and agencies of government.\n\nThey also asked the apex court to compel the federal government through the Revenue Mobilisation and Fiscal Commission (RMFAC) to design the modalities for distributing recovered assets among the federating units.\n\nThe state governments, whose legal team is led by widely known Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Femi Falana, filed the suit with far-reaching implications on the handling of forfeited assets in Nigeria at the Supreme Court on June 16, 2021.\n\nThe court document cited Monday, has the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, representing the federal government, as the sole defendant in the suit marked, SCN/CV/393/2021.\n\n\u2018How Buhari violates Nigerian constitution\u2019\n\nA legal action spearheaded by the NGF led by Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti state and supported by all the 36 state governors across party lines, the suit accuses President Buhari of various constitutional breaches in his handling of the forfeited assets.\n\nThe plaintiffs said, while claiming to be promoting his anti-corruption agenda, Buhari \u201chas consistently contravened the provisions of the Constitution, violated the rights of the states and abused the Federal Government\u2019s position as trustee of the Federation Account\u201d.\n\nThey accused him of committing these violations \u201cby diverting funds meant for the Federation Account into other accounts owned and operated by the federal government, including the Consolidated Revenue Accounts, and applied the said revenues for the sole benefit of the Federal Government\u201d.\n\nThey also attributed more constitutional violations to the Asset Tracing, Recovery and Management Regulation, 2019, made by the Buhari administration through the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami.\n\nContrary to the constitutional provisions, the plaintiff argued, the Regulation \u201cestablishes the Federal Government of Nigeria Asset Recovery Account domiciled with the Central Bank of Nigeria and prescribes that all proceeds from the Final Forfeited Assets should be paid into the said account\u201d.\n\nThey added that the Regulation also establishes the Interim Forfeiture Recovery Account into which all funds belonging to other tiers, or forfeited to other tiers shall be paid into.\n\n\u201cBy establishing the Asset Recovery Account and interim Forfeiture Recovery Account into which revenue from recovered assets is to be paid, the Asset Recovery Regulation contradicts the provisions of the Constitution. The Honorable Attorney General of the Federation has also acted beyond his constitutional powers,\u201d they said further.\n\nDiverted recovered loot\n\nThe plaintiffs noted that since 2015, \u201cnumerous recoveries of illegally acquired assets have been secured through anti-corruption and law enforcement agencies\u201d, including the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), the Nigerian Police Force and the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation.\n\nBetween 2015 till date, they said, the federal government has secured both international and municipal forfeiture, recovery and repatriation of stolen assets, including a total sum of N1, 836, 906, 543, 658.73.\n\nOther such recovered assets, according to the plaintiffs include, about 167 properties, 450 cars, 300 trucks and cargoes, and 20, 000,000 barrels of crude oil worth over N450 billion, according to the state governments.\n\nThey, however, said the President, through his ministers and anti-corruption and law enforcement agencies \u201chave failed to remit the receipts, proceeds or income derived from the recovered assets to the Federation Account as constitutionally required\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe federal government has consistently diverted these funds to other purposes, including payment into its Consolidated Revenue Account for its sole benefit,\u201d Mr. Otauru said in the supporting affidavit.\n\n\u201cWhere revenues payable into the Federation Account have been illegally diverted into the Consolidated Revenue Fund, or applied to any other contrary purpose by the Federal Government, the illegally diverted revenue must be repaid, and the repayment is charged on the Consolidated Revenue Account of the Federal Government or its share of allocation from the Federation Account,\u201d the plaintiffs argued further.\n\nPrayers\n\nThe plaintiffs asked the court to grant them 13 specific prayers.\n\nThese include, a declaration that \u201cby the provisions of Section 162(1) and Section 162(10) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (As Amended), all income, returns, proceeds or receipts howsoever described derived from confiscated, forfeited and/or recovered assets constitute revenue of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which must be remitted to Federation Account for the collective benefit of the Federal, State and Local Governments\u201d.\n\nThe plaintiffs also urged the court to declare that the failure and/or refusal of the President, the Minister of Finance, the AGF office and the Accountant General of the Federation, and all other relevant authorities and/or agencies of the federation to remit the receipts, income, returns or proceeds derived from all assets recovered, seized, confiscated and forfeited into the Federation Account to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of Section 162 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (As Amended)among the Federal, State and Local Governments is unconstitutional.\n\nThey sought, among others, an order directing the President, the Minister of Finance, the AGF office, the Accountant General of the Federation, and all other relevant authorities and/or agencies of the Federation to give an account of the receipts, income, returns or proceeds derived from all assets recovered, seized, confiscated and/or forfeited to the The Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nThe assets the plaintiffs asked the apex court to compel the officials to account for include N1, 836, 906, 543, 658.73 (cash) and N450, 000, 000, 000.00 (non-cash) ,which were not remitted to the Federation Account in line with Section 162 of the Nigerian constitution.\n\nThe plaintiffs also sought another order directing the President, the Minister of Finance, the AGF, the Accountant General of the Federation and all other relevant officials and agencies \u201cto remit\u201d the N1, 836, 906, 543, 658.73 (cash) and N450, 000, 000, 000.00 (non-cash) into the Federation Account immediately.\n\nThey also asked the apex court to direct Mr Buhari and the officials and aforementioned officials and agencies, including the Revenue Mobilisation and Fiscal Commission (RMFAC) \u201cto determine forthwith, the modalities for distributing the receipts from seized, forfeited and recovered assets among the Federal, State and Local Government from the Federation Account\u201d.\n\nNext stage\n\nThe Supreme Court is the court of original jurisdiction on disputes between the federal government and the federating units.\n\nAnd being a constitutional matter, it will be heard by a full panel of seven Justices of the Supreme Court.\n\nBut as of Tuesday, the federal government, through the office of the AGF has yet to file its defence. (Premium Times)\n\nMalami reacts\n\nBut in a reaction, Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami, SAN, said the recovered stolen funds were governed by \u201cconflict of laws\u201d principles and not local legislation, explaining that its workability entails multiple sovereignties.\n\nThe AGF spoke Tuesday in a statement by his media aide, Dr. Umar Jibrilu Gwandu in Abuja.\n\nHe said \u201cthe international recoveries are more or less governed by international conventions, negotiations and agreement of parties. It is never a straightjacket application of local legislation.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, questions of recovery of stolen funds from indicted public officers are appropriately dealt with by other relevant laws,\u201d the statement clarified.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, misleading to give the impression that such recoveries and usage of stolen funds and stashed abroad are provided for by the Revenue Mobilization, Allocation and Fiscal Commission Act.\n\n\u201cOne cannot situate rights and entitlements on looted funds and recovered assets with myopic and narrow understating of concepts of the application of local legislations.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt and the purpose of setting the record straight, the application of the looted funds can only be factored within the context of mutual understanding and negotiations of international and multifaceted jurisdictional and territorial legislative issues.\n\n\u201cThe recovery of stolen assets and the subsequent uses to which these funds may be employed are subject to international agreements between Nigeria and the affected countries, thereby bringing conflict of laws into contemplation.\n\n\u201cImportantly also, these repatriated funds are based on cooperation and mutual assistance agreements, especially the United Nation Convention against Corruption and Implementation of the Global Forum on Asset Recovery (GFAR) Principles on the Repatriation of Stolen Assets,\u201d Malami said.\n\nIn domesticating the issue, the AGF said \u201cthe African Union and the ECOWAS Protocols on recovery of illicit funds are equally relevant when it comes to the role of the Nigeria in relation to its other partners.\n\nAs a member of the comity of nations and a respectable international partner, the minister added that Nigeria must always strive to fulfil its international commitments in the repatriation and use of stolen funds and assets.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs a way of example, the Federal Government of Nigeria has entered into numerous agreements such as the one with the United States and the Island of Jersey in 2020, and including with other countries around the world.\n\n\u201cWhere the agreements assume an international character, the specifics of the agreement often dictate the trajectory of recovery, sharing, transfer and implementation. Some element misunderstood the issue of international recoveries and locally generated funds in relation to monies belonging to the Federal Government that are locally generated. It is not to be confused with stolen funds and assets domiciled in foreign jurisdictions whose recovery and subsequent repatriation are based on international legal arrangements between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the foreign custodians of these funds.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be further noted that even recoveries of local assets are in most cases regulated by the applicable legislations and judicial pronouncements associated with these legislations and not Revenue Mobilization and Fiscal Commission Act exclusively. One can cite for the purpose of clarity recoveries done by the NDLEA, EFCC, ICPC among others.\u201d\n\nCSOs laud move\n\nSpeaking to Blueprint on the legal brawl, Executive Director Peering Advocacy and Advancement Centre in Africa (PAACA) Ezenwa Nwangwu said it a very important litigation which would advance the principle of federalism and expands constitutional democracy.\n\nNwangwu also expressed surprise that \u201cgovernors want democracy at the top while they behave like czars and emperors in their states.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope this also triggers and compels citizen and civic groups to institute legal actions that help to promote, financial transparency and openness in the states.\n\nAlso, former Secretary General, Organisation of African Trade Union Unity (OATUU), Mr Owei Lakemfa, said Nigeria is a federation, which in practice is run as a unitary system.\n\nHe said \u201cthe states are beginning to wake up from their slumber and the country will benefit and there might be less agitations for restructuring.\n\nLakemfa said \u201cthis is why this suit by the 36 states is salutary; the same way the Rivers State Government case against the Federal Government and the FIRS on VAT and other basic taxes is commendable.\u201d\n\nThe labour leader said he looked forward to the day state governments \u201cwill assert their right to determine who will become the Inspector General of Police and other such appointments.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Governance Manager, ActionAid Nigeria, Celestine Odo, said the governors were right in suing the federal government.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey represent Nigerians and Nigerians deserve to know because they have been clamouring for the assets recovery, transparency and monitoring value amongst others. Nigerians have been rooting for accountability and transparency as regards assets recovery.\n\nOdo said the federal government was yet to tell Nigerians the total amount given to the country on COVID-19 intervention funds and Nigerians deserved to know.\n\nHe said \u201cwhat the state governments\u2019 demands are in line with the Fiscal Responsibility Right and the Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) are in support.\u201d",
          "summary": "The governors also accused the federal government of diverting another N450 billion worth of non-cash assets recovered proceeds of crime since 2015.\nThey are therefore asking for the remittance of N1.8 trillion (cash) and N450billion (non-cash) in recovered loot since 2015 into the federation account.\n\u201cBy establishing the Asset Recovery Account and interim Forfeiture Recovery Account into which revenue from recovered assets is to be paid, the Asset Recovery Regulation contradicts the provisions of the Constitution.\nHe said: \u201cThey represent Nigerians and Nigerians deserve to know because they have been clamouring for the assets recovery, transparency and monitoring value amongst others.\nNigerians have been rooting for accountability and transparency as regards assets recovery.",

          "text": "Worried about the occurrence of preventable deaths in Nigeria, the National Surgical, Obstetric, Anaesthesia and Nursing Plan (NSOANP), in collaboration with Smile Train, has embarked on capacity building for nurses in the country.\n\nExperts in the health sector have revealed that a good number of deaths in the nation\u2019s health facilities were a result of a limited number of healthcare professionals including nurses, lack of modern medical equipment, and the inability of nurses to carry out certain critical functions.\n\nConsequently, the duo organized a five-day training on \u2018Nursing Care Saves Lives,\u2019 with participants drawn from the nursing profession across the country in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking at the opening of the training, Smile Train Programme Manager, West Africa, Victoria Awazie stressed that the training was critical to ensure that nurses were abreast with global best practices in providing care to patients.\n\nShe further disclosed that 84 nurses from the six geopolitical zones were physically in attendance, while over 200 joined the training online out of over 400 that registered.\n\n\u201cIt is a way of equipping our nurses to be abreast with the right knowledge on how to deal with their patients, considering the psychological emotions that patients have.\n\n\u201cSometimes patients don\u2019t die at the surgical bed, but after the surgery as a result of complications. So, we are training the nurses to be more equipped to know what to do when such issues arise, especially when the doctors are not available\u201d, Awazie noted.\n\nOn her part, immediate past president, National Association of Nigerian Pediatric Nurses, Comrade Lawal-Aiyedun Olubunmi who raised concerns over the government\u2019s poor investment in health, stressed that adequate health budgetary allocation, timely release of funds, and training of nurses to undertake critical surgical interventions and emergency care, would help save more lives from preventable deaths.\n\nOlubunmi who doubles as a member NSOANP committee maintained that there could never be successful surgical intervention care without quality nursing care, as nurses were always available even when other health care professionals, especially doctors, were not.\n\nShe said: \u201cIt is critical for nurses to have this knowledge and capacity to provide safe and quality surgical services in the country more so, nurses are the largest health care team and what is left for us to do with the number is to build their competency and confidence to be able to give quality care.\n\n\u201cI want to plead with the government; the issue of inadequate healthcare professionals where one nurse will take care of 30 to 40 patients is exhaustive, and it\u2019s not giving us desired results.\n\n\u201cOur patients are dying, and we don\u2019t want that. We want our government to be committed and invest right from the national to the state and local government to prioritize surgical anesthesia nursing intervention in this country.\u201d\n\nA critical care nurse with Defence Intelligence College, Morayo Eboh, lamented that nurses were usually forced to improvise while rendering services to patients, due to inadequate equipment that would help provide quality care to patients.\n\n\u201cIf medications or equipment are not available, there is little or more the nurses can do within their capacity. Sometimes we tend to improvise.\u201d",

          "text": "The Taliban have offered a pledge of reconciliation, vowing no revenge against opponents and to respect women\u2019s rights in a \u201cdifferent\u201d rule of Afghanistan from two decades ago.\n\nThe announcements came on Tuesday night shortly after the return to Afghanistan of their co-founder, crowning the group\u2019s astonishing comeback after being ousted by a US-led invasion in 2001.\n\nWith huge concerns globally about the Taliban\u2019s brutal human rights record \u2014 and tens of thousands of Afghans still trying to flee the country \u2014 they held their first press conference from Kabul.\n\n\u201cAll those in the opposite side are pardoned from A to Z,\u201d Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told foreign and local reporters, revealing his identity for the first time.\n\n\u201cWe will not seek revenge.\u201d\n\nMujahid said the new regime would be \u201cpositively different\u201d from their 1996-2001 stint, which was infamous for deaths by stoning, girls being banned from school, and women from working in contact with men.\n\n\u201cIf the question is based on ideology and beliefs, there is no difference\u2026 but if we calculate it based on experience, maturity, and insight, no doubt there are many differences,\u201d Mujahid told reporters.\n\nHe also said they were \u201ccommitted to letting women work in accordance with the principles of Islam\u201d, without offering specifics.\n\nA spokesman for the group in Doha, Suhail Shaheen, told Britain\u2019s Sky News that women would not be required to wear the all-covering burqa, but he did not say what attire would be acceptable.\n\nDesperation\n\nNevertheless, Afghans and foreigners continued to flee the country, with the United States and other nations stepping up evacuation airlifts from Kabul.\n\nDesperate scenes from the airport at the start of the week have created searing images of Afghans terrified of the Taliban, and a diminished United States unable to protect them.\n\nSome footage showed hundreds of people running alongside a US Air Force plane as it rolled down the runway, with some clinging to the side of it.\n\nOne person was later found dead in the wheel well of the plane.\n\n\u201cBefore the aircrew could offload the cargo, the aircraft was surrounded by hundreds of Afghan civilians,\u201d US Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said, explaining the events.\n\n\u201cFaced with a rapidly deteriorating security situation around the aircraft, the C-17 crew decided to depart the airfield as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nCrowds also built outside embassies in Kabul on Wednesday on rumours that governments were offering asylum.\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Council announced on Tuesday it would hold a special session on Afghanistan next week to address the \u201cserious human rights concerns\u201d under the Taliban.\n\nUS President Joe Biden\u2019s administration gave a non-committal response to the Taliban\u2019s pledges of tolerance.\n\n\u201cIf the Taliban says they are going to respect the rights of their citizens, we will be looking for them to uphold that statement and make good on that statement,\u201d State Department spokesman Ned Price said.\n\nRussia and China have quickly signalled their willingness to work with the Taliban.\n\nRussia said Tuesday that the Taliban\u2019s initial assurances had been a \u201cpositive signal\u201d and the militants were behaving in a \u201ccivilised manner\u201d.\n\nTriumphant Return\n\nMullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the co-founder and deputy leader of the Taliban, arrived back in Afghanistan on Tuesday night.\n\nHe chose to touch down in the country\u2019s second-biggest city Kandahar \u2014 the Taliban\u2019s spiritual birthplace and capital during their first time in power.\n\nHe arrived from Qatar, where he has spent months leading talks with the United States and then Afghan peace negotiators.\n\nFootage released by pro-Taliban media showed crowds gathering around Baradar at the airport, pumping their fists in the air and chanting in celebration.\n\nBut for those fearing reprisals from the Taliban, the emotions were opposite.\n\n\u201cSometimes I stand in front of the window and I think about how I got here and how I\u2019m lucky that I\u2019m not in Afghanistan now,\u201d Afghan human rights researcher Mohammad Ehsan Saadat, who fled his home country with his family, told AFP in Canada.\n\nIn Kabul, some shops have reopened and traffic is on the streets, but schools remain closed and tensions are still high.\n\n\u201cThe fear is there,\u201d said a shopkeeper who asked not to be named after reopening his store.\n\nAFP",

The proceedings, which will be held in public, will start from 9:00 am local time (and GMT), the statement added.\n\nThe case file arrived on the desk of the city\u2019s military prosecutors in April.\n\nCompaore and 12 others face charges of harming state security, complicity in murder, and complicity in the concealment of corpses.\n\nAmong those accused alongside Compaore is General Gilbert Diendere, Compaore\u2019s former right-hand man and a former head of the elite Presidential Security Regiment (RSP) at the time of the coup.\n\nDiendere is already serving a 20-year sentence in Burkina Faso for masterminding a plot in 2015 against the West African country\u2019s transitional government.\n\nIt is he who is believed to have headed the unit that killed Sankara.\n\nSeveral other members of the presidential guard at that time will also join them in the dock.\n\nBut 34 years after the events in question some of those originally accused have already died, according to lawyers for the plaintiffs in the case.\n\nSankara took power in a coup in 1983 but was killed on October 15, 1987, when he was 37, in a putsch led by Compaore.\n\nCompaore was himself ousted in 2014 by a popular uprising after 27 years in power.\n\nHe has always denied ordering Sankara\u2019s murder. But even mentioning Sankara\u2019s name was taboo in Burkina Faso under his rule.\n\nHowever, the case was reopened in 2015 with the installation of a transitional government, and a warrant was issued for Compaore\u2019s arrest in March 2016.\n\nNow 70, Compaore currently lives in Ivory Coast, where he fled after being ousted and where he has since taken citizenship. Unless he chooses to present himself for trial, he will be judged in absentia.\n\n-AFP",

          "text": "Thousands of Afghan refugees will be resettled in the UK after the Taliban seized control of Kabul, the UK government has promised.\n\nThe new scheme will see up to 20,000 Afghans offered a route to set up home in the UK in the coming years.\n\nIn the first year, 5,000 refugees will be eligible \u2013 with women, girls and others in need having priority.\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel urged other countries to help, writing in the Daily Telegraph \u201cwe cannot do this alone\u201d.\n\nHowever, opposition parties have criticised the settlement scheme for not going far enough.\n\nThe new plan is on top of the existing scheme for interpreters and other staff who worked for the UK.\n\nSome 5,000 Afghans and family members are expected to benefit from that policy.\n\nParliament has been recalled and Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to open a debate in the House of Commons about the situation in Afghanistan from 09:30 BST on Wednesday.\n\nDowning Street said Mr Johnson spoke to US President Joe Biden on Tuesday evening about the evacuation of Kabul.\n\nThe leaders \u201cresolved to continue working closely together on this in the days and weeks ahead to allow as many people as possible to leave the country\u201d, a spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister stressed the importance of not losing the gains made in Afghanistan over the last 20 years, of protecting ourselves against any emerging threat from terrorism, and of continuing to support the people of Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nBBC Analysis\n\nMinisters have been rushing to put this scheme together in response to the situation in Afghanistan, with the final details signed off on Tuesday.\n\nThe scheme will prioritise those most in need \u2013 with the government highlighting women and girls and minority groups.\n\nInformation on how to apply is expected soon.\n\nThe scheme is loosely based on the one introduced during the Syrian war, which also saw 20,000 move to the UK from 2014 to 2021.\n\nBut ministers acknowledge the practicalities of getting people out of Afghanistan will be considerably more complicated because of the extent of Taliban control.\n\nGovernment insiders don\u2019t know the extent to which the new regime will allow people to flee if they so choose.\n\nThere will be funding for the resettlement programme \u2013 and the government will work with local councils and devolved governments on where to house Afghans who come to the UK.\n\nAnnouncing the new Afghan Citizens\u2019 Resettlement Scheme, Mr Johnson said: \u201cWe owe a debt of gratitude to all those who have worked with us to make Afghanistan a better place over the last twenty years.\n\n\u201cMany of them, particularly women, are now in urgent need of our help. I am proud that the UK has been able to put in place this route to help them and their families live safely in the UK.\u201d\n\nMs Patel wrote in the Telegraph that she wanted to ensure the UK was doing \u201ceverything possible to provide support to the most vulnerable fleeing Afghanistan so they can start a new life in safety in the UK\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cThe UK is also doing all it can to encourage other countries to help. Not only do we want to lead by example, we cannot do this alone.\u201d\n\nThe government emphasised the new scheme would \u201cnot compromise on national security\u201d and has promised all those arriving will have to pass \u201cstrict security checks\u201d.\n\n\u2018Not enough\u2019\n\nAmong those to criticise the scheme was Tory MP Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the Defence Select Committee, who told the Daily Mirror it was a \u201cwoefully inadequate response\u201d, citing the government capping numbers at 5,000 for the first year when \u201cthe threat is at its greatest\u201d.\n\nShadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds welcomed the government putting a scheme in place but said there needed to be a \u201cmore urgent plan of action\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis proposal does not meet the scale of the challenge,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Lib Dems foreign affairs spokeswoman Layla Moran said that \u201c20,000 should be the starting point of this scheme, not the target\u201d.\n\nAnd Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader in Westminster, tweeted that the scheme didn\u2019t \u201cgo anywhere near far or fast enough\u201d and the target should be at least 35,000 to 40,000 Afghan refugees.\n\nA separate route for Afghan nationals to resettle in the UK, the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP), already offers the chance to live in the UK to Afghan staff who worked for the UK government in frontline roles.\n\nSome 5,000 staff \u2013 including interpreters \u2013 and their families will come to the UK via that scheme this year. Nearly 2,000 have arrived since 22 June.\n\nOn Tuesday night an RAF plane carrying British nationals and Afghans landed at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire from Kabul, Afghanistan\u2019s capital.\n\nThe Foreign Office has advised all remaining UK nationals to leave the country.\n\nVice Adm Sir Ben Key, who is running the UK\u2019s evacuation programme in Afghanistan, said it was \u201coperating at full pace\u201d but the changing political situation meant it couldn\u2019t \u201cafford to pause and wait\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe will go for as long as it takes us to either meet the demand, or when the security situation means that we\u2019re no longer operating with consent,\u201d he added.\n\nAmong those trying to flee Taliban rule is a former employee of the British Council in Afghanistan, who fears he may face retaliation for working on behalf of the UK.\n\nThe man \u2013 whom the BBC is not naming to protect his safety \u2013 told BBC Radio 4\u2019s The World At One he had applied to a government relocation scheme more than a month ago, but had yet to be accepted.\n\n\u201cTalibans are going around our home, going everywhere and I have already received some notifications, some warnings from them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI have cried a lot. I do not cry because I lost my salary or my other things, but I cry for my family. I have three daughters and one wife and I have no one else to support them.\n\n\u201cIf I die, who will be there to support them?\u201d\n\nBBC",

          "text": "President of African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), Prof. Benedict Oramah, has disclosed that the bank will supply a total of 40 million doses of Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine to Nigeria between now and 2022.\n\nThis is just as about 699,760 COVID-19 vaccine doses donated by the United Kingdom (UK) have been received at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.\n\nOramah, who made this known on Tuesday, while making a presentation on some of the bank\u2019s projects to Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, at the State House, Abuja, stated that the bank was investing in trade and health infrastructure, and also involved in the procurement and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to African countries including Nigeria, to enable the continent achieve herd immunity.\n\nThe bank is also planning to establish National Quality Assurance Centres in parts of the country in order to support and upgrade export of commodities from Nigeria, Oramah added.\n\nHe declared that there is an arrangement under the Afreximbank facility to deliver 40 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines to Nigeria before the end of 2022.\n\nAccording to him, the bank was committed to ensuring the continent achieves herd immunity by vaccinating about 60 per cent of Africa\u2019s population against the disease.\n\nHe said Afreximbank plan to invest in critical sectors of the Nigerian economy, including health, citing plans to build a world class tertiary hospital and health park in Abuja.\n\nThe bank CEO reiterated that the 500-bed state-of-the-art hospital would be developed in collaboration with Kings College Hospital in the UK, and other partners.\n\nResponding after the bank\u2019s presentation, Osinbajo commended the African Export-Import Bank for its efforts in stimulating and developing African trade, including its many engagements in Nigeria.\n\nHe expressed satisfaction with the work done by the bank and the interest shown in areas such as health infrastructure, trade facilitation and tourism, among others.\n\nReferring to the proposed establishment of quality assurance centres across the country, the Vice President said it was important because, \u201cone of the problems we have had with our exports is really this problem of quality assurance and making sure that we have the facilities to test our export products and get all of our agencies working together. I am sure that you have SON, NAFDAC, and all of our agencies working with you on this project.\u201d\n\nWhile thanking the bank for its support, Osinbajo noted that the federal government\u2019s programmes in Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) sector, particularly in the Shared Facility Initiative under the National MSMEs Clinic, are important and deserving of AFREXIM\u2019s backing.\n\nAccording to him, the initiative which is implemented in collaboration with state governments and aimed at developing manufacturing clusters across the country, could be enhanced through partnership with the bank.\n\nAlso, about 699,760 COVID-19 vaccine doses donated by the UK have been received at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja.\n\nA statement by the British High Commission in Nigeria, on Tuesday, revealed that Nigeria unveiled 699,760 doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 vaccines donated by the UK via the COVAX facility and flown into Abuja on Monday night.\n\nThe vaccines were unveiled at a cold storage unit near the Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport, with the Acting British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Gill Atkinson, joining the Executive Director of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, Dr. Faisal Shuaib, and the World Health Organisation Country Representative to Nigeria, Dr. Walter Kazadi Mulombo for the unveiling, alongside other dignitaries.\n\nThe vaccines delivered to Nigeria were part of the three million doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine that the UK has donated to 11 countries across Africa to help the fight against COVID-19.\n\nThis included the 119, 200 doses sent to Zambia and the 51,840 sent to Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on 13 August; the 119,040 doses sent to Malawi on 14 August, the 140,160 doses sent to Senegal on 15 August, the 299,680 doses sent to Egypt on 16 August, and the 299,520 doses that will be delivered to Uganda today, August 18.\n\nAccording to the statement, the shipments of the UK-donated doses were part of a broader pledge to share 100 million vaccines with the rest of the world, of which 80 per cent would be through COVAX.\n\nThe UK has continued to play a global role in promoting an effective roll-out of the vaccine, including being one of the largest COVAX donors and through its engagement with the Nigerian-led response.\n\nIn Nigeria, the UK has restructured its health and human development programming to support the country\u2019s response and continued to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak across all nine pillars of the government\u2019s incident action plans, through the UK Health Security agency, formerly the Public Health England (PHE) and FCDO\u2019s Lafiya health programme in selected states, as well as direct technical engagement at federal level.\n\nSpeaking on the donation, the Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab said: \u201cThree million doses of UK-donated vaccines are now arriving in 11 countries across Africa, including Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda, to help the fight against COVID-19. This is the first batch of 80 million being donated via COVAX \u2013 because we know no one is safe until everyone is safe.\u201d\n\nThe Acting British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Gill Atkinson said, \u201cThe UK was one of the first countries to back COVAX with \u00a3548 million. We have consistently pushed for a global effort that helps every country receive the vaccine against Covid-19. I am so pleased to see Nigeria receive 699,760 doses, donated by the UK, in their second batch of the vaccine through COVAX.\n\n\u201cThis is the first tranche of the 1,299,760 doses expected to be donated by the UK through COVAX. Only by vaccinating more people around the world can we bring an end to the global coronavirus pandemic.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, speaking on Arise News on Tuesday, Shuaib confirmed the receipt of the vaccines from the UK.\n\nHe urged those who had taken the first dose of the vaccines not to mix them or take a different brand, assuring that the jabs will eventually reach all those interested in taking them.\n\n\u201cIt also very instructive that just last night, we got just over 700,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine donation from the UK Government.\n\n\u201cAnd this will be an opportunity for us to actually give those Nigerians who had taken the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine their second doses, and we\u2019re expecting additional doses from the COVAX facility, namely AstraZeneca and then Pfizer vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe Pfizer vaccine amounts to about 3.5 million doses. We\u2019re going to be getting the Johnson and Johnson vaccine in the course of the next few months, terminating right around Q1 of 2022. Overall, we figure that we\u2019ll be able to get close to 45 million doses of the different vaccines, and we\u2019ll be able to give protection against the COVID-19 virus,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe described the problem of access to COVID-19 vaccine as a global challenge, noting that rich nations had been hoarding large quantities of the vaccines for their populations, sometimes, close to 10 times what they actually require.\n\nShuaib stated that with the federal government engagements with countries such as the United Kingdom, United States and other countries, they had started releasing some of the vaccines that they hoarded.\n\nAccording to him, with the 40 million J&J jabs being expected, Nigeria would be able to adequately vaccinate a sizeable part of its population, expressing joy that all of the vaccines being accessed by Nigeria are able to confer protection from severe disease, hospitalisation and death due to the Delta variant of the virus.\n\nAccording to him, by Thursday, Lagos would be able to start vaccinations, saying the delay was caused by a thorough process of labelling and barcoding the vaccines so that they can be traced to the health facilities for accountability.\n\nHe pointed out that most of the states that have airports would be receiving their vaccines starting yesterday, while those that have no usable airport will have to go using road transport.\n\n\u201cSo, all those people who have had their first doses are going to be covered, it is not a challenge for them. And by no means should they be trying to mix and match. What the data suggests is that you should not be mixing your AstraZeneca with your Moderna. So if you take your AstraZeneca, please wait.\n\n\u201cWe have AstraZeneca vaccines more than enough coming in the pipeline. For those that will be taking the second dose and even for those who want to start with the first dose and complete with a second dose of AstraZeneca, we\u2019re going to get enough vaccines.\n\n\u201cFor those who have taken the moderna vaccine, they should also take the moderna vaccine as the second dose as the Nigerian government is not recommending mixing and matching,\u201d he stated.\n\nDeji Elumoye, Michael Olugbode, Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Dike Onwuamaeze in Abuja",
