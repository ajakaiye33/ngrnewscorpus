          "title": "2023: RCCG\u2019ll face moral crisis over Osinbajo, says Dele Momodu",
          "text": "Ovation Magazine boss, Dele Momodu, has warned the Redeemed Christian Church of God, saying it might face moral crisis if it supports Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo and the Presidential ambition he\u2019s allegedly nursing.\n\nThe PUNCH had earlier reported that the RCCG, headed by Pastor Enoch Adeboye, had created the Office of Directorate of Politics and Governance to engage members willing to be involved in politics and \u201cmobilise support for them when required\u201d.\n\nThe announcement led to speculations that the Church is gearing to mobilise support for the alleged Presidential ambition of Osinbajo who is one of its pastors.\n\nReacting, RCCG Head of Media and Public Relations, Pastor Olaitan Olubiyi, who spoke to Saturday PUNCH, said the newly created Office has nothing to do with the Vice-President or any person who may have political ambition in 2023.\n\nHe said the Office was to sensitise members towards active politics as Christians cannot continue to stay off politics.\n\nHowever, Dele Momodu, in a post, titled, \u2018My Kobo Advice To The Redeemed Christian Church Of God(RCCG),\u2019 warned leaders of the Church, saying the easiest way to create trouble in Nigeria today is to attempt to mix religion with politics.\n\nHe said, \u201cNaturally, I feel that I owe it a duty to tell our Church leaders, and our Church in general, the Gospel truth and nothing but the absolute truth. In the light of my relationship with the RCCG, this duty is even more imperative and compelling. I believe the leaders of the RCCG have laboured so hard to build one of the most formidable churches in the world. Nothing must be done to inadvertently cause a cataclysmic storm in the House of God. And the easiest way to create trouble in Nigeria today is any attempt to mix religion with politics. It goes beyond lighting the blue touch paper. It is like combining some highly combustible ingredients together in a chemical laboratory. It is not just that the effect may not be too pleasant, it is that the result and consequences will be catastrophic. God forbid.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I read the memo establishing a political arm of our Church, I realised this was nothing but an invitation to Armageddon, if true. For that reason, at first, I assumed the memo was a joke, a fake document that was merely meant to stir the hornets\u2019 nest, so I did not pay too much attention to it. However, when it started flying in from every direction to my phones, I knew someone had touched the tiger by the tail. I started working the phones to speak to a few contacts who should know about it and be able to confirm the veracity or otherwise of the document. The outcome was a resounding yes, the document had emanated from the Church and was acquiesced to by the upper echelons.\n\n\u201cI asked for what the motive(s) could have been, and the general conspiracy theory was that our church was setting up an extensive network for the obvious Presidential ambition of the current Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, although couched in terms which ostensibly suggested that the Church wished to support all of its congregation who wished to contest the next general elections and made their aspirations known to the newly formed Church department. Personally, that theory didn\u2019t jell with me. To the best of my knowledge, Professor Osinbajo is not the only member of the church contesting the Presidential election. And it was not the church that nominated him as running mate to President Muhammadu Buhari. He got the job primarily because of his closeness to his former Principal, then Governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and also because of his admirable credentials, ability and capacity. His religion was necessarily a factor because a Northern Moslem must perforce pick a Southern Christian as his running mate in the current Nigerian clime. That was the only reason religion came into it, I believe. It had nothing to do with the fact that he is a senior pastor of the RCCG.\n\n\u201cEven if the Vice President has now decided to bear his own father\u2019s name by dropping that of his avuncular godfather, the church will still face a moral crisis if it wishes to jump on the bandwagon by drumming up support for Professor Osinbajo on religious grounds alone for many reasons, some of which I will now highlight.\u201d\n\nDele Momodu reminded the RCCG that Osinbajo is not the only member of the Church who might have an ambition for the Presidency. According to him, he\u2019s also a member of the RCCG with his ambition for the 2023 Presidency already public.\n\nThis is as he pointed out that Senator Remi Tinubu is a member of the Church who is married to Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, a Muslim that has declared his ambition for the 2023 Presidency.\n\nHe said, \u201cAlthough Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu is a Muslim, his dear beloved wife, Senator Oluremi Tinubu is a staunch member of the Redeemed Christian Church of God and one of the leading lights of the Church. Asiwaju, her husband, is a frontline Presidential aspirant on the platform of APC, just like his godson, the Vice President. Even if the RCCG has a preference in Professor Osinbajo, mainly because of his status in the Church and his current position in Government, I expect the RCCG to \u201cpretend\u201d a little and behave as if it is not so. Not to do that would be tantamount to picking a child out of one\u2019s children and say, \u201cthis is my favourite!\u201d It is simply not right or proper for the RCCG to demonstrate such blatant and flagrant partisanship.\n\n\u201cAs if that is not a tough cookie to handle, there is the fact that that there is a third contender, yours truly, Dele Momodu, who\u2019s also a member of the RCCG and the youngest of the contending Church aspirants so far. I\u2019m also the only member of the RCCG aspiring on the platform of PDP, as far as I know. Would the Church then ask its congregation to vote for one party over the other merely because it has decided to support one candidate in preference to the other regardless of the strong points one may have over the other? What a conundrum and crisis this portends for the Church and its unity and peace.\n\n\u201cThe church cannot even afford to ostracise any aspirant on the basis of religious persuasion or denomination. It is the job of the church to seek out and promote the best candidates and then pray for them and galvanise support for them perhaps clandestinely.\n\n\u201cI also imagine that there is some degree of unconstitutionality to this attempt by the RCCG to descend into the political arena. Nigeria is a secular state as the constitution provides. To suggest that one candidate is the preferred candidate of a particular church or religious group and is being effectively sponsored by that church will breach not just the morality and ethos of the Church but also the deeply enshrined principles and ground norm of our constitution, which are embedded and engraved for good reason.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, there are no guarantees that being a church Pastor or otherwise would make you a competent and truthfully honest leader. The church is too massive and extremely influential to reduce itself to such a level of myopia. Since what most Nigerians desire today is good and accountable leadership, our Churches should smartly work towards identifying the best materials in different political parties and support us spiritually and materially from the humongous resources it has pleased God to bless them with.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, it is my belief that our churches should avoid anything that could further escalate the huge religious and socio-political conflagration already ravaging our long-suffering nation. Just imagine what would happen if other church denominations or other religions decide to support their own members only. It would be palpable anarchy in the making. Nigeria will then end up with a Babel of voices and a cacophony of noises which would not augur well for the wellbeing of us all, but only cause misery and upheaval.\n\n\u201cI sincerely hope and pray that our Church, the RCCG, will douse this unnecessary fire and recant and retrace its steps before it is too late.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Mike Msuaan, Conveners of (CCSPSND) and made available to journalists in Abuja, accused the groups of working with enemies of the country to undermine the efforts of the Federal government and the security agencies in the war against insurgency and banditry.\n\n\u201cWe have read with dismay the statement signed by one Dr Aliyu Bello and Ambassador Jude Uchenna of the Peace and Conflict Resolution initiative and Alliance for Justice and Peace in their reaction to the unfortunate killing of sixty-six vigilantes, in Kebbi State by armed bandits. This group clearly made unsubstantiated claims against the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and even personalities that will feel must be addressed to put the records straight.\n\n\u201cThe Conference of Civil Society for Peace, Security and National Development (CCSPSND) vehemently condemns the publication as baseless and done in very bad faith. The tone and personal attack on individual offices as shown in the publication amply indicated a group of people on a poisonous mission against the common good of our beloved country. It is either the conveners of the groups lacked the understanding of the workings of the intelligence agencies and architecture in the country or they are blinded by the mere peanuts promised to them by their faceless sponsors.\n\n\u201cThe gains made in the war against terror in the northeast, northwest and secessionists\u2019 elements in the southeast and southwest should tell every Nigerian that the security forces are working together and for the overall good of the country\u201d, the statement noted.\n\nThe statement further explained that the decisive successes achieved in the war so far are a result of strings of credible intelligence efforts provided to the fighting forces on land and in the air insisting that the accuracy with which the airstrikes and clearance missions are carried out only suggests sophistication in intelligence gathering by the DIA and other intelligence agencies.\n\nThe CCSPSND said it was sad that the group would allege that, the DIA is manned by loyalists of former service chiefs, noting that the current set-up of the DIA is made up of very patriotic and determined military officers who have been part of the war against insurgency and banditry in the country and are versed with the tactics to combat the terrorists and bandits.\n\n\u201cThe current leadership of the DIA who was the CMI left indelible marks in the North East theatre of operations. Under his watch, there were a massive decimation of Boko Haram terrorists, their informants, collaborators and logistics suppliers. The records are there and open for anyone to see. They are therefore not new to the war and have not been appointed into the intelligence unit as a mark of loyalty to any former service chief.\n\n\u201cAll the current service chiefs and others holding key appointments in the military were critical parts of the previous military leadership. It is therefore strange why the DIA was singled out for the campaign of calumny by those seeking to benefit from changes in the leadership, the CCSPSND maintained.\n\n\u201cWe are shocked to read a very demonic conspiracy concocted by enemies of Nigeria whose logic is not just imbecilic but kindergarten and devilish in all ramifications.\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate cowardly attack on members of Vigilante groups in Zuru area in Kebbi state remains condemnable. We have confidence in the ability of the military and other security agencies to bring the perpetrators to book\u201d, the CCSPSND added.\n\nIt further called on Nigerians to discountenance the allegations against the military and continue to cooperate with security forces to further destroy these elements of disunity adding that Mr President knows the output of the intelligence agencies, particularly the DIA and will certainly disregard this group who do not mean well for our nation but rather to serve their selfish interest.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Ugochukwu Alaribe, UMUAHIA\n\nChairman, Geometric Power Limited, Aba, Prof. Barth Nnaji, indulge has said that the company will not use estimated billings on electricity consumers, but would ensure that all consumers have metres.\n\nNnaji who disclosed this at the Geometric Plant in Aba, however, added that where there are no metres, bills will be calculated on the benchmark issued by the National Electricity Regulatory Commission, NERC, until the consumers are provided with metres.\n\nHe assured that Geometric Power is committed to providing reliable and quality electricity at regulated prices to its customers in the Aba ring-fenced area covering nine council areas in Abia State.\n\nNnaji explained that Geometric power Limited, is the only power distribution company, Disco, in the country with its own power plant with 141MW capacity and licensed to produce 181MW.\n\nHe also disclosed that the company has a new power firm known as Aba Power which is the 12th Disco in Nigeria with new power plants built in Ogbor Hill, Factory Road, Osisioma Ngwa and Port Harcourt Road areas of Aba.\n\nIn his words; \u201cIt is our goal to ensure that consumers are metered. But where there are no meters, our bills will be within the benchmark set by the regulatory authorities, the National Electricity Regulatory Commission, NERC, until the consumers in question are provided with meters.\n\n\u201cAba people have suffered much because of lack of regular power supply. So our core mission is to partner with all relevant stakeholders to end this development in all our areas of coverage, which are the 9 local councils that make up Abia South for now. In the next 4 to 6 months, Geometric Power will come fully on stream and these areas of coverage will begin to enjoy an uninterrupted power supply.\n\n\u201cBut as time goes on, we hope to expand our operations to cover other areas of the state, and also connect to the national grid. Our field workers will ensure a prompt response to distress calls from consumers in the event of any faulty or malfunctioning devices. We are ready to change the narrative in the power generating and distribution chain in Aba and environs.\n\n\u201cGeometric Power Limited will provide reliable and quality electricity. We have taken over from the EEDC. We are now in charge of the Aba ring-fenced area. A new power company was created, it is called Aba Power, it is the 12th Disco in Nigeria. We have built power stations in Aba; Ogbor Hill, Factory road, Osisioma Ngwa and Port Harcourt road. We can only get the real Japan of Africa in Aba when we get quality electricity. Geometric Power is built with 141MW, and we are licensed to produce 181MW.\n\n\u201cSouth East gets less than 300MW from the national grid. Lagos takes ab0ut 1,000MW out of the 3,000MW generated in the country. Geometric Power already has 141MW built. When you divide the national generation for the South East by 5, Abia State gets around 60MW, but Geometric Power has provided 141MW for Aba ringed fenced area. The Company will run on a 27-kilometre gas pipeline from Owaza to the power plant at Aba. The turbines are built with Boeing 747 engines. Aba will be the first city to have reliable and quality electricity in Nigeria.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn his remarks, Managing Director, Distribution, Aba Power, Patrick Umeh, disclosed that the company is privately owned and has no excuse not to perform its obligation to customers.\n\nHe pledged that there will be a change in service delivery as the company will help to revive moribund businesses in the Aba ring-fenced area and relieve the financial burden on customers.\n\nEmphasizing that the company has a policy of relating with its customers as partners, the Chief Security Officer of the company, Air Commodore Maduabuchi Orji- Ude,rtd, tasked consumers to protect power facilities from vandals and reported suspected criminals to security agents.",

Some time ago, when the country was on lockdown in 2020 due to the pandemic, we started seeing the rise in money lenders\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause there was lockdown due to the pandemic, people needed small easy loan which is understandable. But over a period of time, people started complaining about the malpractices of the lenders, so we started tracking it.\u201d\n\nAccording to Irukera, the interest rate charged by online financial institutions appear to violate the ethics of how lending is done.\n\nHe explained: \u201cThe key two things that were subject of concern were what seems to be the naming and shaming violation of people\u2019s privacy with respect to how these lenders recover their loans.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecondly, the interest rate seems to be a violation of the ethics on how lending is done.

          "title": "2023: On the consultation trail with Asiwaju Bola Tinubu",
          "text": "WHAT a fitting and appropriate way for As\u00edw\u00e1j\u00fa Bola Ahmed Tinubu to end the South-west leg of his consultations and engagements with traditional rulers and political stakeholders across the country on his 2023 presidential aspiration. After going round the South-west geopolitical zone meeting and interfacing with prominent royal fathers from Ogun State to Oyo, Osun, Ekiti and Ondo State, the All Progressives Congress National Leader ended it all at the residence of the leader of pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, Chief Reuben Fasoranti, in Akure, Ondo State capital, on Friday, March 4, 2022.\n\nProminent leaders including former Minister of Finance and presidential candidate of the defunct AD/APP alliance, Chief Olu Falae, Afenifere Secretary-General, Bashorun Seinde Arogbofa, prominent lawyer, Dr. Tunji Abayomi, Senator Dayo Adeyeye and Mr. Kole Olumolu were on hand to receive Asiwaju at Fasoranti\u2019s residence. Speaking on the occasion, As\u00edw\u00e1j\u00fa Tinubu said the decision to conclude the consultations in Papa\u2019s house was deliberate, explaining that he wanted Baba Fasoranti\u2019s blessing and prayers to cap the all-important tour. \u201cWhen I started the consultation visits to the South-west, I resolved I must end it here in the residence of our father, Baba Fasoranti, because I know that his prayers and blessing are valuable and will urge me on,\u201d he said.\n\nThe prayers came in torrents. Chief Fasoranti endorsed Asiwaju\u2019s aspiration, while also praying that the political journey would be a successful endeavour. Chief Falae who stated that As\u00edw\u00e1j\u00fa had paid his dues, demonstrated character and competence and fought along with others for the democracy we now enjoy in the country also endorsed him for the presidency. Those were the kind of words of encouragement and endorsement that had trailed Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s train as he continued his consultations and engagements with prominent leaders and traditional rulers across the country.\n\nBefore berthing at Pa Fasoranti\u2019s house, Asiwaju had met and dialogued with traditional rulers in Ekiti and Ondo States. Last week Thursday March 3 in Ekiti, he first engaged with over 30 traditional rulers gathered at the Council Chambers led by the Chairman of the state\u2019s Council of Traditional Rulers, the Onisan of Isan-Ekiti, Oba Ayodele Adejuwon. From there he proceeded to the Palace of Ewi of Ado-Ekiti, Oba Rufus Adeyemo Adejugbe, where some first class traditional rulers had already assembled. A different format was adopted the next day for the Ondo State consultations. Asiwaju met the traditional rulers at the headquarters of each of the three senatorial districts in the state as pre-arranged for him by Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. Those from Ondo South Senatorial District converged on Okitipupa where Oba Fredrick Obateru Akinruntan, the Olugbo of Ugbo Kingdom in Ilaje Local Government Area of the state, was waiting with the numerous royal fathers from the senatorial zone. The consultation train moved from there to Owo where top traditional rulers from Ondo North Senatorial District gathered at the Palace of Olowo of Owo, Oba Ajibade Gbadegesin Ogunoye. It was later the turn of Ondo Central where royal fathers including the Osemawe of Ondo, Oba Adesimbo Victor Kiladejo, gathered at the Palace of Deji of Akure, Oba Aladetoyinbo Ogunlade Aladelusi.\n\nAlthough they tend to be insulated from partisan politics, traditional rulers enjoy the respect and reverence of their people and wield considerable political influence. Asiwaju took the decision to parley with these royal fathers to underscore two important points. One, to underline the significance of the royal fathers as critical stakeholders in the country\u2019s democratic project and two, to demonstrate the high esteem in which he holds them.\n\nThe APC leader had begun the South-west tour on Saturday February 12 with a visit to traditional rulers in Ogun. It was a hugely successful trip during which he visited the four paramount rulers in the state. There is a need to give a quick overview of where the Asiwaju train touched in the state and the royal fathers he deliberated with. The first port of call was the Palace of Awujale and Paramount ruler of Ijebuland where he met with the legendary Oba (Dr) Sikiru Kayode Adetona. Asiwaju first addressed the mammoth crowd gathered at the palace including some other traditional rulers and chiefs in Ijebuland and some top indigenes of the area before entering into a close-door meeting with the highly-revered monarch, who like the APC leader, had contributed immensely to the struggle for termination of military rule and entrenchment of democracy in Nigeria.\n\nFrom there, Asiwaju and his entourage moved to Abeokuta, precisely the Palace of Alake of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Aremu Gbadebo, where he first held court with the monarch in his inner chambers, an expansive and well ventilated living room, before both of them retired to the hall downstairs where, unbeknownst to Asiwaju, an enthusiastic multitude of other Obas, chiefs and top Abeokuta indigenes had gathered. Asiwaju spent more time in each of the places he visited than he anticipated. The monarchs and their chiefs were obviously bent on maximizing the opportunity of interacting with the APC leader. For instance, he arrived at Ake\u2019s Palace around 4pm that Saturday and by 6.30pm discussions were still ongoing, after which he later headed for the Palace of Olu of Ilaro and Paramount ruler of Yewaland, Oba Kehinde Olugbenle, a distance of over two hours. He spent over three hours in Ilaro, arriving back in Lagos at midnight.The next day, Sunday February 13, was devoted to the Akarigbo and Paramount Ruler of Remoland, Oba Babatunde Ajayi.\n\nI have taken the time to enumerate Asiwaju\u2019s itinerary and meetings with the traditional rulers he has met thus far in order to highlight how intensive and inclusive the consultations have been. It is also noteworthy that in Oyo and Osun states, Asiwaju had also met with Alaafin of Oyo, Iku Baba Yeye, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi; Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi Ojaja 11; Owa-Obokun of Ijesaland, Oba Adekunle Aromolaran, and Ataoja of Osogbo, Oba Jimoh Olanipekun Oyetunji.\n\nIn these places, Asiwaju\u2019s message to the paramount rulers and their chiefs was succinct: he told them he had come to inform and consult with them on his decision to contest for the presidency and to seek their prayers and blessings, which they generously gave.\n\nThis is how he put the message for instance at the Palace of Akarigbo, who is presently the Chairman, Ogun Council of Obas and Chiefs: \u201cI am here to let you know Kabiyesi that I want to contest to become the president of this country. And equally, to also inform Kabiyesi that I have earlier gone to the Presidential Villa to inform the president, because I know we have a president and there can only be one president at a time who must be accorded his full respect as the President and Commander-in-Chief and the leader of our party. I went to him and informed him that I would like to step into his shoes without stepping on his toes. I did that and he said \u2018go ahead, we are in a democracy\u2019\u201d.\n\nIndeed, after first visiting the Presidential Villa, Abuja to inform President Buhari of his aspiration, Asiwaju had launched into ta series of consultations and meetings on the matter of 2023 presidency. In Abuja, he met with some Northern leaders led by former Liaison Officer to former President Shehu Shagari, Alhaji Tanko Yakassai. Later, he proceeded to Kano and Katsina states where he conferred with Governors Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and Aminu Bello Masari. Among those he also met with were Zamfara State Governor Bello Mutawalle, Niger State Governor Abubakar Sani-Bello and former military president, General Ibrahim Babangida. Asiwaju also met with some stakeholders abroad during his recent trip to the United Kingdom. Among those he engaged with in London are members of the APC UK chapter and Nigerians in the Diaspora.\n\nThere are, however, a few remarkable things about these consultations, particularly the meetings with the traditional rulers. One, I must point out that Asiwaju was not just meeting these illustrious traditional rulers just because he is in the presidential race. He has always maintained a cordial and harmonious relationship with them over the years.\n\nSuch is the nature of his relationship with the monachs that with his visit to the Olu of Ilaro, Oba Olugbenle, for instance, he unwittingly made history. The royal father had disclosed openly to those gathered to receive Asiwaju that the APC leader had written his name in gold, becoming the first presidential aspirant/candidate to have ever visited the people in their ancestral town.\n\nThe consultation visits have been tasking and demanding but obviously fulfilling to both Asiwaju and his hosts. In the course of the tours, Asiwaju travelled extensively by air and road while also addressing his hosts at length in various areas. Everywhere he went, it was evident that Asiwaju was no unknown visitor. Beyond politics, he had established years-long relationships with the royal fathers and communal leaders and this was widely acknowledged. Another common feature of the visits virtually everywhere was that prominent indigenes and ordinary citizens converged on the palaces to welcome and cheery the aspirant demonstrating that they are one with their traditional rulers on the issue. At every point Asiwaju reiterated his physical and mental capacity to rule stressing that an administration he heads will have no excuse for failure. He equally made references to his track record in the private sector as treasurer of Mobil before his venture into politics, his active role in the pro-democracy struggle that ushered this political dispensation, the foundation his administration laid for the fiscal emancipation of Lagos between 1999 and 2007 as well as the ongoing modernization of the state, his contribution to winning back stolen electoral mandates in Edo, Ondo, Ekiti and Osun states after the flawed 2007 elections and his input towards the victory of the APC in the 2015 and 2019 presidential elections.\n\nAsiwaju made it clear that if all the assault on his person and character is to deter Asiwaju from the race or distract him, they are mistaken. For he has put his leg on the throttle and there is no going back on his 2023 aspiration. Indeed, in response to this mudslinging and attempts to impugn his character, he spoke about the allegory of wrestling with the pig at the residence of the new Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Lekan Balogun, in Ibadan, Oyo State two weeks ago. Paraphrasing a Greek philosopher whose book he read, he said \u201cif you want to wrestle with the pig, you must be ready to roll in the mud and deal with the poo poo,\u201d he stated that he was ready to get dirtied in the process. \u201cAll that it requires is that afterwards you wash up and become clean again,\u201d he added.",

          "title": "APC Crisis: Caretaker committe awaits outcome of Buhari\u2019s London meeting",
          "text": "Top leaders, governors and members of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) are eagerly awaiting the outcome of the London consultations between President Muhammadu Buhari and some of his close allies on the leadership crisis rocking the party.\n\nApart from the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), other key functionaries of the government in London, according to reports yesterday, were the Minister of Education Mallam Adamu Adamu, the Minister of Aviation Senator Hadi Sirika and a close ally, Farouk Adamu Aliyu.\n\nThe Chairman of the CECPC and governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, was also in London. He left the United Arab Emirates where he went for medical treatment last week for London on Thursday.\n\nIt was learnt that Buhari may soon break the ice in the APC by issuing a clear-cut directive.\n\nBuni, sources said, is highly optimistic that he would return to office as Chairman of the CECPC upon his return to Nigeria latest Monday.\n\nHis confidence was said to be buoyed by the letter of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to APC CECPC warning against violating the laws and Electoral Act 2022. INEC said in the letter that it recognises Buni as the party\u2019s chairman and that it must be given 21 -day notice for it to recognise a new leadership.\n\nIt was not clear last night what Buhari and his key allies have agreed as the way forward for the party. Nonetheless, party chiefs who spoke with THE NATION yesterday in Abuja said they would abide by whatever decision Buhari as the leader of the party comes up with.\n\nA top source said: \u201cAs it stands now in APC, President Buhari holds the ace. Both Buni\u2019s camp and the group backing Governor Abubakar Sani Bello, who on Monday announced himself as acting chairman of the CECPC on the directive of the Presdent, are awaiting the outcome of the London meeting.\n\n\u201cWhatever is the directive of the President, all leaders, governors and Caretaker Committee members will comply.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that there is anxiety in both camps because Buhari\u2019s position will determine the way forward for the APC.\u201d\n\nA Buni loyalist said: \u201cHe has completed his medicals. He will return this weekend and resume duties as the National Chairman of APC.\n\n\u201cGovernors loyal to Buni are busy coordinating a reception for him to prove that he is still the chairman of APC.\u201d\n\nKaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State broke the news of the purported removal of Buni on Wednesday, citing certain actions and inactions of the CECPC Chairman which he said constituted a hindrance to the March 26th convention.\n\nOne of such is a court injunction obtained by a party member to stop the convention until his grievances were addressed.\n\nEl-Rufai, who said Buni was aware and neither informed the party nor did anything on it, said efforts had commenced now to vacate the injunction which he described as \u201ca weapon of mass destruction\u201d, planned to use to scuttle the convention.\n\nHe said the fate of caretaker secretary James Akpanudoedehe had been decided after he refused to take instruction from acting Chairman Bello who took over on Monday.\n\nEl-Rufai, who spoke on a Channels Television programme, said he had the authority of Chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF) Kebbi State Governor Atiku Bagudu to explain the action that led to the appointment of Niger State Governor Abubakar Sani Bello as acting chairman of APC.\n\nHe said 19 of the 23 governors elected on the ticket of the party were on same page on the mission to prevent the party from collapsing. He did not name the four governors that are not with them.\n\nEl-Rufai said: \u201cWe got a wind of a court process wherein an order had been gotten directing that the convention should not be held until the determination of the case. And it was unfortunate that our lawyer engaged by Buni-led committee agreed with this in court. If this remains, how can the convention be done?\n\n\u201cWe got signals that there were some elements in the party that were bent on scuttling the proposed March 26 convention.\n\n\u201cAnd if we miss that date, the following Saturday will be Ramadan, and that means we would not be able to have convention until after Ramadan. That means we would have lost another month according to INEC\u2019s timetable.\n\n\u201cBased on this, we met with the President to discuss a number of issues with him like zoning formulae, which the President signed off on.\u201d\n\nAPC defies INEC, vows to go ahead with March 26 convention\n\nEarlier yesterday, the party\u2019s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) vowed to press ahead with arrangements for its March 26 National Convention, brushing aside the demand for a 21-day notice of intention by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nBut the party appeared to have soft-pedaled on the removal of Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni as CECPC Chairman with a party spokesman saying Buni remained in office.\n\nHowever, INEC is not about to waive its insistence on the 21-day notice from the party.\n\nThe Nation gathered yesterday that the commission might boycott the APC convention unless the party complied with the provisions of the law.\n\nThe opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) took time out to mock the APC over the controversy generated by its convention.\n\nIt said INEC\u2019s rejection of a new APC leadership was an indication that the ruling party lacked the legitimacy and statutory requisites to participate in next year\u2019s elections.\n\nSpokesperson for the CECPC and the APC National Youth Leader, Ismail Ahmed, told reporters yesterday in Abuja that INEC got it all wrong in demanding that the party should give a fresh 21-day notice for the March 26th national convention.\n\nAhmed, a lawyer, said the notice issued by the party originally fixing February 26 for the convention was sufficient to meet the relevant legal requirement and that what was now required for the new date of March 26 was simply a notice of an adjustment and not a fresh 21-day notice.\n\nHe said: \u201dConvention will hold on the 26th of March. I am not only a youth leader or internal spokesperson, I am also a lawyer. And we had served a notice to INEC for the 26th of February earlier. We served that notice on the 5th of February and that was the required 21 days.\n\n\u201cIf you are going to make any adjustment to that date, all you need is a letter, making an adjustment to the date. You don\u2019t need another 21 days. And that letter was written about two weeks ago when we realised that we couldn\u2019t hold it on the 26th of February.\n\n\u201cThe moment the CECPC agreed on the 26th of March, that letter was written to INEC, INEC has accepted that letter. So that is long gone; it is not an issue.\n\n\u201cThe issue of the date of convention is not in question, not in INEC, not certainly with us. That is settled. It is sacrosanct: that 26th of March and we have complied with all the rules and we have notified INEC as appropriately expected of us to do. So that\u2019s no longer an issue.\u201d\n\nOn the status of the embattled chairman of the CECPC, Ahmed said Governor Buni remained the chairman of the party and that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello of Niger State has always been functioning in an acting capacity whenever the chairman is not available.\n\nHis words: \u201cSince the inception of this CECPC on June 25, 2020, whenever the chairman is not around and Governor Sani Bello is around, he acts as chairman. It has always been the case that has never changed. It has always been the case.\n\n\u201cAnd now we have a convention on the 26th of March, the chairman wrote a letter and transmitted his power to go for medical treatment.\n\n\u201cThese are two emergencies. He has a medical emergency that cannot wait for convention. We have a convention that cannot wait for him to be healthy, so one has to leave for other.\n\n\u201cThe Chairman left, transmitted a letter, Governor Sani Bello has been acting appropriately. What is the problem? Why is it difficult for people to simply understand that?\n\n\u201cI just simply don\u2019t understand why people are making this an issue. So Governor Bello is acting with the full authority of the caretaker committee and with the full authority of the stakeholders, and leaders of the party, and with the full consent and knowledge of Governor Mai-Mala Buni.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear and very simple. If anybody has any issues with any of our decisions, you can take it to court. For now we\u2019re doing it with the full authority and backing of the law. So there is no ambiguity in this. Absolutely none.\u201d\n\nAhmed also spoke on the APC zonal congresses earlier scheduled for today across the six geopolitical zones.\n\nHe said the congresses would now take place simultaneously with the National Convention.\n\nHe described March 26 as sacrosanct for the party as arrangements are in top gear for the conduct of a hitch-free convention.\n\nHe said: \u201cI was tasked with the responsibility for Media and Publicity; Prof. Tahir Mamman will be overseeing the Legal Department, Hon. Stella Okotete and Senator Yusuf Abubakar Yusuf will be overseeing Organizing Department, and then Dr James Lalu and Chief David Lyon will oversee the Finance Department and former Senate President, Ken Nnamani and Senator Abba Ali will be overseeing the Policy, Strategy and Research Department.\u201d\n\nHe was however silent on the role of Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, the committee\u2019s National Secretary, in the convention preparations.\n\n\u201cWe just talked about the members of the committee; we didn\u2019t talk about either Secretary or Chairman. They have their responsibilities cut out for them anyway. The other members are the ones that were all told to come and handle specific departments.\u201d\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission had snubbed a March 8, 2022 letter from Governor Bello inviting it to an emergency NEC meeting of the party.\n\nIt said: \u201dPlease refer to your letter Ref.APC/NHDQ/INEC/019/022/32,dated 8th March 2022.\n\n\u201cThe commission draws your attention to the fact that the notice for the meeting was not signed by the national chairman and national secretary of the CECPC.\n\n\u201cThis is contrary to the provision of the Article 1.1.3 of the commission\u2019s Regulations and Guidelines for Political Party Operations (2018).\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the APC is reminded of the provision in Section 82(1) of the Electoral Act 2022, which requires \u2018at least 21 days\u2019 notice of any convention, congress, conference, or meeting convened for the purpose of \u2018merger\u2019.\n\n\u201cAnd electing members of its executive committees, other governing bodies or nominating candidates for any elective office.\n\n\u201cWhile hoping these issues are noted for compliance, please accept the assurance of the commission\u2019s warm regards.\u201d\n\nINEC may boycott APC\u2019s March 26 Convention\n\nThere were indications yesterday that INEC might not send its personnel to monitor the APC convention or even recognise the outcome of the convention unless it complies with the provisions of the Electoral Act.\n\nThe commission wants a 21-day notice from the party as stipulated by the law.\n\nIt said in a letter to the party that it could not attend the emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of APC slated for next week because it did not comply with relevant laws and that the party could only remove the National Chairman of Caretaker /Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Governor Mai Mala Buni, and other officers after a 21-day notice to the Commission.\n\nA Director in the Commission who didn\u2019t want to be mentioned told The Nation that the INEC letter \u201dis very clear. They (APC) should give INEC a 21-day notice. Their legal officer should guide them properly.\u201d\n\nAccording to the source, the 2022 Electoral Act has strict guidelines for the 2023 general elections, which the Commission is determined to enforce.\n\nINEC wrong to reject APC\u2019s letter, says lawyer\n\nA Niger Delta-based lawyer, Somina Johnbull, yesterday faulted INEC\u2019s rejection of the APC invitation to its forthcoming NEC meeting on the grounds that it was not signed by the party\u2019s National Chairman and Secretary.\n\nHe said: \u201cWith the greatest respect, INEC\u2019s response is incorrect and was made without regard to the current state of the law.\n\n\u201cSection 82(1) of the Electoral Act requires political parties to notify INEC when it intends to hold any congress, convention, conference or meeting for the purpose of \u2018merger\u2019, electing members of the executive committees, other governing bodies of the political party and nomination of candidates.\n\n\u201cINEC is not to be notified of the meeting of a political party where the business is not for merger or election of members of the executive committee or nomination of party.\n\n\u201cINEC does not require to be notified of a meeting by a political party to discuss preparations for convention or congress as long as that meeting is not held to elect members of its executive committee.\u201d\n\nJohnbull insisted that INEC\u2019s reference to its guidelines could not override the magisterial provisions of a statute, citing Jegede v INEC.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor whatsoever it is worth, what is the effect of the failure to even notify INEC or for INEC to be present?\n\n\u201cSection 82(5) of the Electoral Act provides that failure by a political party to notify INEC of its convention, congress or meeting cannot nullify the validity of such meeting, convention or congress.\u201d\n\nGrave danger ahead for APC\n\nAnother lawyer, Monday Onyekachi, warned that the APC could be courting trouble if it failed to give a 21-day notice to INEC before removing its CECPC chairman and other officers.\n\nOnyekachi, a former Vice Chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association, advised the ruling party to adhere to the provisions of the law and said: \u201cDon\u2019t they have what their law says about the removal of the chairman?\n\n\u201cWho removed him? Because there is an organ that removes a chairman of a party. Was it the organ that removed him? Was there any time the organ met and removed Buni?\n\n\u201cThe implication is that they have to remove him properly. If they don\u2019t remove him properly, INEC will still recognise Buni as chairman. There would be an implication if there is no proper removal.\n\n\u201cThey cannot be behaving like lawless people now. I am not interested in who becomes what. I am only subservient to the law. What does the law say about the removal of a chairman and have they complied with it?. Don\u2019t they have legal advisers?\n\nMatawalle cautions APC governors over party crisis\n\nZamfara State Governor Bello Matawalle yesterday cautioned his fellow APC governors against unguarded statements over the party\u2019s crisis.\n\nMatawalle said this in a statement through Mr Zailani Bappa, his Special Adviser on Public Enlightenment, Media and Communications, in Gusau that it was not right for the governors to \u201cwash our dirty linens in the media, especially at this critical time of the party\u2019s transformation as we move towards a decisive period in 2023.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI believe that each of us has been trying his best in his way to move the interest of our great party forward. However, we all disagree to agree. That is the beauty of democracy. There is no point in promoting disharmony among ourselves after disagreements are settled.\n\n\u201cIt is not wise to drag the name of His Excellency, Mr President into taking sides on issues that are ordinarily a normal political misunderstanding common to every collection of interests.\n\n\u201cNow, more than ever before, the party needs the strength and unity to face the challenges ahead as we move towards the critical period of elections of which the party must maintain its supremacy at all levels.\u201d\n\nMatawalle expressed reservation over the statement issued by Gov. Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo state in which he criticised some governors for their actions and said those who were not okay with the party should quit.\n\nSanction those colluding with Buni to scuttle convention \u2013 Lukman\n\nThe immediate-past Director-General of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), Dr Salihu Lukman yesterday called for disciplinary action against APC governors he claimed were working with Buni to scuttle the March 26th national convention.\n\nLukman, in a statement entitled \u201cAPC and Surrogate Politics of Timid Leaders\u201d named Buni\u2019s collaborators as Governors Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, Hope Uzodinma of Imo State, and Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State.\n\n\u201cThere are other party leaders, including Senator Uzor Kalu, who have actively supported His Excellency Mai Mala to undermine the decision to organise the National Convention of the party.\n\n\u201cThe March 17, 2022 APC NEC should initiate processes of a disciplinary hearing in line with provisions of the APC Constitution to sanction all these leaders if found guilty,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former PGF boss advised the party stakeholders to be constantly vigilant as the national convention draws nearer, warning that the \u201cdays leading to the March 26 national convention could sound the death knell for the party or give it an exhilarating breath of fresh air.\n\n\u201cEvents in APC require constant vigilance by all committed party members and leaders. Without a doubt, the days ahead, leading to March 26, 2022 National Convention, will define both the survival, the democratic orientation and the quality of leaders of the party.\n\n\u201cWhether APC will produce both party leaders and candidates for the 2023 elections who can justify the trust reposed in them depends a lot on how all the current leadership challenges facing the party is resolved.\u201d\n\nPDP mocks as INEC rejects leadership change in APC\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday mocked the APC over INEC\u2019s rejection of moves by the ruling party to drop its CECPC Chairman, Governor Mai Mala Buni.\n\nThe PDP described the rejection as an indication that the APC lacked the legitimacy and statutory requisites to participate in the 2023 general elections.\n\nSpokesman for the PDP, Debo Ologunagba, said: \u201cThis decision by INEC is therefore another unmistaken \u2018red flag\u2019 to intending aspirants on the platform of the APC in the 2023 general elections that the APC has become defunct and cannot validly, legally and constitutionally field candidates in the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cOur party draws attention to the grave import of INEC\u2019s letter to the APC, dated March 9, 2022 to the effect that APC\u2019s NEC meeting scheduled for Thursday March 17, 2022 will not be recognised by the Commission due to invalid notice; a development that will invalidate any decision reached at such meeting.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, INEC\u2019s reference to the failure of the APC to give the required 21-day notice for its National Convention confirms the invalidity and unconstitutionality of any National Convention conducted by the APC\u2019s illegal Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).\n\n\u201cAs it stands today, regardless of the boldface escapist excuses, the Sword of Damocles hangs precariously on the status of the contraption called CECPC and the APC itself. This signals an existential threat to the soulless, precipice-bound bunch of pretenders masquerading as a political party.\n\n\u201cThe PDP had earlier informed Nigerians, especially intending aspirants on the platform of the APC that the APC became legally non-operational when in December 8, 2020 it dissolved its National, State as well as Local Government structures and handed its affairs over to an illegal body.\u201d\n\nAPC Chairmanship: Northern group backs Al-Makura\n\nMore confusion may be brewing over the national chairmanship seat of the APC as the Northern Progressive Youths (ANPY) yesterday rejected the purported Presidential endorsement of any chairmanship candidate, insisting that Tanko Al-Makura must not be shut out of the contest.\n\nThe group\u2019s Director, Gender and Governance Ms Amina Wakawa, addressing reporters in Abuja, said Al-Makura represented the right mix of accomplished leadership qualities that would not only add value to the APC but would also facilitate and sustain and build on the successes recorded by the party so far.\n\nShe explained that the northern youths decided to support Al-Makura because of his contribution during the historic merger of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), All Nigeria People\u2019s Party (ANPP) and Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN).\n\nShe said that Al-Makura was the only former governor elected on CPC\u2019s platform, and who had contributed greatly to the successes of President Muhammadu Buhari in the 2015 general elections, which ended the 16 years of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) leadership.\n\nWakawa said that the emergence of Al-Makura as APC national chairman would be a reward for loyalty, hard work and competence, and ensure justice, equity and fairness.",
          "summary": "He will return this weekend and resume duties as the National Chairman of APC.\nThe Nation gathered yesterday that the commission might boycott the APC convention unless the party complied with the provisions of the law.\n\u201cThe moment the CECPC agreed on the 26th of March, that letter was written to INEC, INEC has accepted that letter.\nA Director in the Commission who didn\u2019t want to be mentioned told The Nation that the INEC letter \u201dis very clear.\nWakawa said that the emergence of Al-Makura as APC national chairman would be a reward for loyalty, hard work and competence, and ensure justice, equity and fairness.",

          "text": "Evans\u2019 accomplice sentenced to five years imprisonment for illegal sales of firearms\n\nJustice Oluwatoyin Taiwo of an Ikeja Special Offences Court yesterday sentenced Udeme Upong, one of the co-defendants standing trial alongside a kidnap kingpin, Chukwudimeme Onwuamadike, also known as Evans, to five years imprisonment for illegal sales of firearms.\n\nUpong and Evans, Joseph Ikenna Emeka and Chiemeka Arinze are charged before Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo of an Ikeja Special Offences Court on a seven-count charge of murder, attempted murder, conspiracy to kidnap and selling of firearms.\n\nThey were alleged to have attempted the kidnapping of Vincent Obianodo, Chairman of the Young Shall Grow Motors.\n\nHowever, at resumed proceedings yesterday, Upong, through his counsel, Mr. A. B. Josiah, informed the court of his intention to change his plea of \u2018not guilty\u2019 to \u2018guilty\u2019.\n\nSubsequently, Justice Taiwo ordered the prosecution to review the fact of the case.\n\nReviewing the facts of the case, the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP), Dr Babajide Martins, who led the prosecution team, informed the court that Upong, who hailed from Itan-ikoronumu village in Ika LGA of Akwa Ibom State as at time of arrest, admitted to being involved in the matter, having met the first defendant.\n\nHe said the convict admitted to selling 2-AK 47 guns and 270 arms of ammunition to Evans sometime in 2008 contrary to Section 29(2) of the Fire Arms Act F28, 2004 and punishable under Section 27(b)(III).\n\nDr Martins said the convict claimed he got the weapon from his village where they usually used it for inter-communal crises.\n\nHe said that they agreed to N400,000 for the two ammunition but the defendant paid him N200,000.\n\nDr Martin\u2019s told the court that the defendant\u2019s statement had been admitted in evidence.\n\nRead Also: BREAKING: Court convicts kidnap kingpin Evans, two others\n\nHe told the court that the defendant was charged under Firearm Act Section 92 and punishable under Section B.\n\n\u201cUnder the said law, the offence attracts maximum of five years imprisonment.\n\n\u201cWe are not aware of any of his previous convictions,\u201d he stressed.\n\nHe urged the court to convict the defendant accordingly.\n\nSubsequently, Justice Taiwo found him guilty as charged and convicted the defendant for the offence of illegal sales of fire arms.\n\nIn his allocutus, the defendant\u2019s lawyer appealed to the court to consider his change of plea as a remorseful act and for not wasting the time of the court and taxpayers\u2019 money.\n\nHe also urged the court to consider the fact that the defendant has been in detention since July 6, 2017, which is almost the length of his sentence.\n\nJosiah further appealed to the court to temper justice with mercy and give the defendant a lenient sentence as a first offender who had not been convicted before.\n\nIn his judgment, Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo sentenced the defendant to five years imprisonment which reads from the date of his remand in custody of Kirikiri Correctional Service on July 6, 2017.\n\nLast month, Evans was jailed for life in one of the charges filed against him and others before Justice Hakeem Oshodi.\n\nEvans still has about two more related cases of kidnapping against him before Justice Taiwo and another two before Justice Adedayo Akintoye of Lagos High Court now sitting at Tafawa Balewa Square.",

          "title": "Treat fuel scarcity as national emergency-NLC advises FG",
          "text": "From Adanna Nnamani, Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) has called on the federal government to treat the current fuel scarcity in the country as a national emergency and immediately arrest the situation.\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nThe Congress in a statement signed by its President, Ayuba Wabba on Friday, warned that there is a limit to which the people can endure the current hardship occasioned by the scarcity of refined petroleum products.\n\nThe congress further advised the government to make judicious use of the bumper harvest of petro-dollars to fix the nation\u2019s oil refineries\n\nIt reiterated its stance that local refining of petroleum is the answer to fuel subsidy challenges the government is complaining about.\n\nThe statement read in parts, \u201cIt is with great pain, sadness and alarm that the Nigeria Labour Congress observes the continued acute scarcity of petroleum products at different filling stations in the country. A crisis that started with the supply of sub-standard Premium Motor Oil (PMS) has now degenerated into a persisting scarcity of not only PMS but also other petroleum products such as Diesel and Aviation Fuel. It is deeply disturbing that motorists, keke operators, bike riders and other users of petrol products now spend incredibly long hours at filling stations before being serviced or sent away empty-handed. This is indeed a daylight premiere of unending episodes of nightmare.\n\n\u201cCurrently, a litre of aviation fuel sells as high as N580 while a litre of diesel goes as high as N625. In many parts of the country, a litre of PMS goes as high as N220. The socio-economic strain of both the scarcity and the high cost of petroleum products on ordinary Nigerians and manufacturing firms is best imagined. In many parts of Nigeria, manufacturing has ground to a halt. The current hemorrhage induced by the prevailing scarcity of petroleum products has very grave concomitant effects on the already perilous unemployment and security situation in our country.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cConsequent on the foregoing, the Nigeria Labour Congress cautions that there is an extent to which the people can endure the current hardship occasioned by the scarcity of refined petroleum products. There is a limit the people can stomach prevailing disruptions caused by petrol scarcity especially increased fares and associated dislocations in land, air, rail and water transportation and indeed hiccups in the manufacturing sector all linked to the current scarcity of refined petroleum products in the country.\n\n\u201cThis scarcity of refined petroleum products in our country must be treated as a national emergency. A stitch in time might still save nine!At the root of the current pain being faced by millions of Nigerians all over the country is the monstrously defective policy of nearly one hundred percent importation of refined petroleum products. Nigeria is about the only OPEC country trapped in the quagmire of complete dependence on foreign refineries for products it has capacity to produce locally. This is a most unfortunate commentary on our sovereignty.\u201d\n\nNLC lamented that the persisting scarcity of refined petroleum products has unleashed a tsunami of very dire economic realities including exorbitant airfare, cancellation of scheduled flights, destruction of thousands of automobile engines by adulterated fuel and wastage of productive hours.\n\n\u201cAs clearly captured in the Nigerian Workers\u2019 Charter of Demands, the only way out of this energy impasse is for the Federal Government to take very seriously the local refining of petroleum in Nigeria. We had severally identified the complete rehabilitation of our public refineries and the building of new refineries, both public and private, including modular refineries as the only sustainable panacea out of this national embarrassment and vulnerability in the security of our energy sector.\n\n\u201cWith the current surge in the price of crude oil, we urge the Federal Government to make judicious use of the bumper harvest of petro-dollars to fix our oil refineries. We must re-think Nigeria\u2019s hydrocarbon as a strategic asset for sustainable wealth creation and development.\n\n\u201cWe must now ditch the over-laboured gospel of deregulation which has been proved to be mere moniker for incessant increase in the price of petrol. The fact that NNPC cannot keep to its promise of 24-hour supply of petrol in advertised gas stations shows that the petrol importation policy has failed completely. Despite the claims that Diesel and Aviation fuel had been deregulated based on the import model, the products are still scarce and expensive proving that deregulation is not the answer to the crisis in our downstream oil sub-sector. Now is the time to go back to the basics. Fix our local Refineries! Build new Refineries!!

          "title": "Buni May Return as APC Caretaker Chair, Emergency NEC Meeting Not Recognised",
          "text": "\n\n*With 21-day notice required, meeting to replace chairman before convention out of time\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nThe crisis rocking the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) escalated yesterday with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) rejecting a letter inviting it to the emergency National Executive Committee meeting of the party scheduled for March 17 in Abuja where Governor Abubakar Sani Bello\u2019s appointment as caretaker chairman and other vital changes in the party are scheduled for ratification.\n\n\n\nINEC said the letter was not signed by the ousted National Chairman and National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State and John Akpanudoedehe, respectively, thus, truncating the planned NEC meeting, and ultimately, a threat to the National Convention scheduled for March 26.\n\n\n\nBy implication, Sani Bello\u2019s leadership of APC is not known to INEC.\n\nAs a result, sources said some concerned stakeholders of the party reached out to President Muhammadu Buhari, who ordered Buni\u2019s removal, to forgive and allow him return as caretaker chairman, so that the March 26 National Convention date would be actualised, and save the party from ruin.\n\nAnother source told THISDAY that Buni would be heading to London tomorrow to meet with the President \u201cand sort out all issues about his return as Chairman.\u201d\n\n\n\nWith the 21-day notice required for NEC meeting, in which changes to the leadership of a party will be effected, the planned emergency NEC meeting of the Sani Bello team is effectively out of time. The National Convention would have taken place and new National Working Committee members in place.\n\nFollowing the ouster of Buni, as the CECPC chairman last Tuesday and the appointment of Sani Bello, the Niger State Governor (upon resumption) transmitted a letter dated 8th March, 2022, informing INEC about the planned emergency NEC meeting.\n\n\n\nSani Bello introduced himself in the letter as acting Chairman while Professor Tahir Mamman was introduced as the acting Secretary of the party.\n\nBello and Professor Mamman were said to have signed the letter notifying the Commission about CECPC decision to hold the emergency NEC meeting and invited INEC to come and monitor it.\n\nBut the Commission, in a reply addressed to the \u201cAPC CECPC Chairman\u201d dated March 9, 2022, drew the party\u2019s attention to some lacuna in the invitation letter.\n\nINEC said the letter of invitation did not carry the signature of Buni and Akpanudoedehe, whom by implication, the Commission is saying, remains the officers of the party known to it.\n\n\n\nThe INEC letter titled, \u201cRe: Invitation to the Emergency Meeting of the National Executive Committee\u201d, dated March 9, 2022, was signed by the Secretary to the Commission, Mrs Rose Omoa Oriaran-Anthony.\n\nIt reads: \u201cPlease refer to your letter Ref.APC/NHDQ/INEC/019/022/32, dated 8th March 2022. The Commission draws your attention to the fact that the notice for the meeting was not signed by the National Chairman and National Secretary of the CECPC contrary to the provision of the Article 1.1.3 of the Commission\u2019s Regulations and Guidelines for Political Party Operations (2018).\n\n\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the APC is reminded of the provision in Section 82 (1) of the Electoral Act 2022, which requires \u2018at least 21 days\u2019 notice of any convention, congress, conference, or meeting convened for the purpose of \u2018merger\u2019 and electing members of its executive committees, other governing bodies or nominating candidates for any elective office.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile hoping these issues are noted for compliance, please accept the assurance of the Commission\u2019s warm regards.\u201d\n\nBy implication, the stipulated 21-day notice to INEC for the commission to monitor the planned emergency NEC meeting had not been complied with.\n\nFor INEC to monitor the emergency NEC meeting, the APC letter notifying it ought to have been written earlier than March 8.\n\n\n\nOne of the stakeholders pushing for Buni\u2019s return told THISDAY last night that \u201ctwo weeks is not too much to give Buni, so that the mess he created can be cleared by him. This is our best option, otherwise, the party will crumble.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere is no point keeping Sani Bello as caretaker Committee Chairman. It is obviously illegal and INEC has clearly stated this. We are hopeful about getting a positive result from the President.\u201d\n\nThe source further confirmed that Buni, who is in Dubai on medicals, would return to Abuja tomorrow and most likely resume as caretaker chairman on Monday.\n\nSani Bello Denies Buni\u2019s Letter\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Bello has denied knowledge of a letter purportedly written by Buni, asking him to take control of APC\u2019s affairs, while he proceeds to Dubai for medicals.\n\nThe letter dated February 28, requesting a leave of absence, signed by Buni and addressed to Bello, copying the CECPC members and INEC, surfaced last Thursday.\n\nBut while fielding questions from journalists after the APC\u2019s CECPC meeting late on Thursday, the Niger governor denied knowledge of the letter.\n\n\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d he said.\n\nSani Bello added that he had been in charge of the committee \u201cfor a while.\u201d\n\nAlso yesterday, INEC denied receiving Buni\u2019s letter, saying it would have responded if it was in receipt of any letter written to indicate that Buni actually handed over the leadership of the party to Bello.\n\nINEC National Commissioner of Voter Education and Publicity, Mr. Festus Okoye said: \u201cThe Commission has formal ways of communicating with political parties. The Commission is a public trust and any political party or individual that is interested in any communication by the Commission or to the Commission can apply for a Certified True Copy (CTC) of the document.\n\n\u201cIf the Commission is in receipt of such a document it will issue a CTC and will also respond if such a communication does not exist.\u201d\n\n\u2018APC Not Going Back on National Convention\u2019\n\nDespite the threats from INEC, the APC National Youth Leader and acting spokesperson, Ismael Ahmed said yesterday that the party would not change the date of its National Convention planned for March 26.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m not only a youth leader or internal spokesperson, I\u2019m also a lawyer and we have served a notice to INEC for the 26th of February earlier. We served that notice on February 5 and that covered the required 21 days.\u201d\n\nAhmed added that while Buni remained substantive Caretaker Chairman, Sani Bello was only acting.\n\nHe said: \u201cSince the inception of this CECPC on June 25, 2020 whenever the chairman is not around and Governor Sani Bello is around, he acts on behalf of the acting Chairman. It has always been the case that has never changed. It has always been the case.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd now the chairman wrote a letter and transmitted, for his leave to go for medical treatment. These are two emergencies. He has a medical emergency that cannot wait for convention. We have a convention that cannot wait for him to be healthy. So, one has to leave for another. The Chairman left, transmitted a letter, Governor Bello has been acting appropriately. What is the problem? Why is it difficult for people to simply understand that? \u201c\n\nHe stated that Bello was acting with the full authority of the caretaker committee, stakeholders, leaders of the party, and with the full consent of Buni.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear and very simple. If anybody has any issues with any of our decisions, you can take it to court. For now we\u2019re doing it with the full authority and backing of the law. So, there is no ambiguity in this. Absolutely none,\u201d Ahmed said.\n\nPDP: APC Lacks Legitimacy to Participate in 2023 Elections\n\nThe main opposition, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has said the non-recognition of the activities of the APC by INEC further confirms its position that the APC lacks the legitimacy and statutory requisites to participate in the 2023 general election.\n\nThe PDP stated that INEC\u2019s decision further authenticates its stand that \u201cthe APC is a Special Purpose Vehicle in liquidation, preparatory to winding up; that cannot legally produce candidates for the elections.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis was contained in a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThis decision by INEC is, therefore, another unmistaken \u2018red flag\u2019 to intending aspirants on the platform of the APC in the 2023 general elections that the APC has become defunct and cannot validly, legally and constitutionally field candidates in the 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nKemi Olaitan in Ibadan\n\nThe new Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Mohood Olalekan Balogun Alliwo, Alli Okunmade II, who was installed as the 42nd monarch on the revered tool yesterday at the historic Mapo Hall, has pledged not to let Ibadan down during his reign.\n\n\n\nThe monarch, who was presented with his staff of office by Governor Seyi Makinde, amid singing and drumming at a well-attended ceremony, thanked the people of Ibadan for supporting him to ascend the throne after 36 years as the Mogaji of Ali Iwo.\n\n\n\nShortly before the presentation of the staff of office, former Governor Rashidi Ladoja, who is the Osi Olubadan, led other high chiefs to pay homage to the new monarch.\n\n\n\nThey all took turns to prostrate before the king.\n\nAlso, Moshood Ayanyemi, Atookowagbowo led other Ibadan drummers to welcome the guests and well-wishers to the occasion in a traditional way.\n\n\n\nVice President Osinbajo, who spoke on behalf of President Muhammadu Buhari, congratulated the new monarch and the people of Ibadanland and said with the amiable credentials, experience and exposure of the new Olubadan, \u201cthere is no doubt about his ability to discharge his responsibilities in collaboration with other constituted authorities to make Oyo State and Nigeria at large better.\u201d\n\n\n\nOsinbajo, who traced the political history of the ancient city, extolled the virtues of Ibadan as a city of many firsts, disclosing that whoever is to ascend the throne of the Olubadan must climb 23 chieftaincy steps, a feat which makes the Olubadan succession plan unique in the whole of Yorubaland.\n\n\n\nMakinde, in his speech, declared that the event was a victory for Ibadanland and a restoration of the dignity of its exemplary traditional chieftaincy system.\n\n\n\nHe congratulated the new Olubadan, whom he described as a man of many parts, expressing the confidence that Ibadan would grow in leaps and bounds under his reign while charging the Olubadan-in-Council to, as custodians of the cultures and ethos of Ibadanland, protect the sanctity of its chieftaincy system and not allow politicians interfere with it.\n\n\n\nAccording to the governor, the Ibadan traditional system is a time-tested and long-lasting chieftaincy system that has remained a worthy example in chieftaincy succession across the globe.\n\n\n\nHe also urged the new Olubadan to remain steadfast as the gatekeeper of Ibadan traditional system, adding that if at any point an amendment becomes necessary to the traditional system, such should be self-proposed by the Olubadan-in-Council and not be left to the whims of politicians.\n\n\n\nMakinde said: \u201cI want to restate that even though we politicians will come and go, sometimes, to satisfy our political whims, we may make decisions that do not protect our traditional systems.\n\n\u201cThis is why the custodians of our culture must always take a stand against us tinkering with age-old traditional systems.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur elders, the members of the various councils, the chiefs, our traditional fathers, they are the gatekeepers and they must remain steadfast in their roles. Remember, no politician can destroy any system without the cooperation of some members of these systems.\n\n\n\n\u201cTherefore, I want to use this opportunity to ask that Kabiyesi and the Olubadan-in-Council work to ensure that the laws having to do with the ascension to the throne of Olubadan remain sacrosanct.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Olubadan-in-Council should remain self-regulated without any external interference from the political class.\n\n\u201cWe rejoice with the sons and daughters of Ibadanland, both at home and in the diaspora. The massive crowd gathered here today, speaks to the importance of this occasion.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe governor maintained that the new monarch has distinguished himself as an excellent professional and has contributed and would continue to contribute to the development of Ibadanland and Oyo State at large, having served both in private and public service.\n\n\n\nHe added that he was assured that Oba Balogun was in a good position to defend the sanctity and tradition of Ibadan people and move Ibadanland forward.\n\n\n\nThe governor wished His Imperial Majesty, a long, peaceful and successful reign, praying that the land of Ibadan will experience unequalled development and tranquility during Kabiyesi\u2019s reign.\n\nProminent Nigerians, especially sons and daughters of Ibadanland; politicians, captains of industries, and a flock of tourists and stakeholders \u2013 home and abroad, graced the occasion.\n\n\n\nAside Osinbajo, other dignitaries were former Vice-President Abubakar and governors of Ekiti, Ogun and Kano, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, Prince Dapo Abiodun, Dr. Abdullahi Ganduje, respectively.\n\n\n\nAmong the traditional rulers in attendance were the Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Ogunwusi; Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III; Sultan of Sokoto, His Eminence, Alhaji Abubakar Sa\u2019ad; Emir of Kano, His Eminence, Alhaji Ado Bayero and the Etsu Nupe, Dr. Yahaya Abubakar.\n\n\n\nMajor roads in Ibadan were closed while markets were shut in honour of Oba Balogun while the installation lasted.\n\nMany associations, in different colorful outfits, were seen within and outside the Mapo Hall premises \u2014 venue of the event, dancing to the indigenous Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 music of Ibadanland.\n\n\n\nThe 42nd Olubadan of Ibadanland was ushered into the venue at exactly 11.50am, after which all the traditional chiefs, Mogajis, religious leaders, leaders of various associations in Ibadanland paid homage to Oba Balogun.\n\nOba Balogun, who is from Ali Iwo Family, became the Mogaji of his family in 1986 and the death of Oba Saliu Adetunji on January 2, 2022 paved the way for his emergence as the new Olubadan.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "US to Partner Nigeria to Stop Gas Flaring By Conversion to Ammonia",
          "text": "\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s energy transition agenda, in line with global direction received a boost on Thursday at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston, Texas, as the United States\u2019 Government indicated interest in a bi-lateral partnership that would see the conversion of the enormous gas resources currently being flared to ammonia.\n\n\n\nAmmonia has the potential of being a huge revenue earner for the country especially as the European Union, in pursuit of the net zero-emission programme, has unveiled its long-anticipated plans to make importers and non-EU manufacturers pay for the carbon emissions associated with the goods and materials they sell in the EU, thus impacting on vessels powered by fossils fuels entering EU territory.\n\n\n\nSince running such vessels during that tax regime will not be economically viable, there is the need to redesign engines of such vessels; and attention is already being focused on ammonia as an alternative fuel source, to replace heating oil and other fossil fuels. The resort to ammonia is because it is not just cleaner, but a cheaper source of energy.\n\n\n\nInvariably, it means there would no longer be an easy and attractive market for heating oil, one of the most highly sought-after products in the configuration of Nigeria\u2019s refineries. The adoption of the Carbon Border Tax by the EU has the potential of hurting the Nigerian economy which is largely serviced with proceeds from its hydrocarbon potentials. This would compound the challenge already posed by the vigorous pursuit of the zero-emission plan by the developed countries, due to the reduced earnings from Nigeria\u2019s refinery configured products such as heating oil (i.e. LPFO, HPFO).\n\n\n\nThe Paris Agreement and the United Nation\u2019s Framework Convention on Climate Change seeks to limit the development of oil and gas projects in the pursuit of more environment friendly energy options \u2013 from fossil fuels to green and renewable energy \u2013 in the next two decades. This poses enough threat to the country\u2019s major revenue stream, which is why sustaining current revenue drivers and considering other viable options became the major thrust of discussions by Nigeria at the conference.\n\n\n\nThe energy transition agenda therefore became the centre of focus for the Nigerian delegation, led by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Silva and which included the Chief Executive of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, Engr. Gbenga Komolafe and the Board Secretary and Legal Adviser to the NUPRC, Barrister Olayemi Anyanechi. The team continued to drive conversations around energy transition in a multi-track approach at the various meetings held with top officials of the global energy circuit.\n\n\n\nIt argued that instead of a complete abandonment of further development of hydro-carbon infrastructure and phasing out fossil fuel use within the stipulated period, a multi-track approach where gas would be adopted as transition energy source would be fair and just to be pursued, as that was more practicable and sustainable, particularly in respect of developing countries.\n\n\n\nSilva explained that Nigeria already has a transition plan which is predicated on a multi-track approach to developing energy resources. One of those is a focused development of the country\u2019s gas resources during which period a diversified economy would be built around technology and other energy sources. That, he stressed, would help a great deal in boosting the country\u2019s revenue levels and sustaining its economy.\n\n\n\nDiscussions on the subject were taken from different perspectives, including zeroing-in on gas potentials and the implication of continued gas flaring and reinjection. The effect of flaring on the environment and health of the people of oil-bearing communities was specifically highlighted as the team explored concrete ways of ending the menace.\n\n\n\nThe point of convergence is the responsible monetization of Nigerian\u2019s gas resources which the American counterparts were in agreement. The US team appreciated the multifaceted approach to curtail emissions proposed by the Nigerian government and made suggestions on innovative ways to develop stranded gas resources in a more responsible manner, some of which include the use of Blue Hydrogen which is obtained when natural gas is split into hydrogen and CO2 either by Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) or Auto Thermal Reforming (ATR). However, the CO2 is captured and stored, which in return mitigates the harsh impact on the environment.\n\nThis the US team suggested would be a good way for Nigeria to utilize its abundant Natural gas resources of over 200 trillion cubic feet (TCF).\n\n\n\nDuring one of the several meetings which involved the US Secretary of State for Energy, Jennifer M. Granholm, and a second which involved Honourable Harry Kamian, Assistant Secretary of State for the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Energy Resources, the United States Government showed interest in collaborating with the Nigerian government to develop the country\u2019s gas resources, recognising that Africa may indeed need to be given separate recognition, as long as development of natural gas hastens the net-zero emissions target of the Federal Government of Nigeria and the world at large.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. DOE promised to support Nigeria with development partners to put through the framework for the development of its gas resources\n\nRiding on the optimism of the meeting with the U.S. Secretary of State for Energy, the the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) team met with Brendan Kelly of the U.S. Department of Commerce and Puneet Sharma of CyanNH3 to discuss extensive methane abatement opportunities in Nigeria, in partnership with the United States government, especially in the area of conversion of gas to ammonia, for use either as fertiliser or for export.\n\n\n\nThe team highlighted the fact that the proposed EU Carbon Border Tax would put severe financial pressure on the use of LPFO and HPFO by vessels and provide a renewed impetus for producers around the world to accelerate efforts to slash their carbon footprints, thus creating a massive opportunity for the use of ammonia as the fuel of choice.\n\n\n\nIn response, the US team promised to collaborate with the Nigerian government by funding a study to evaluate the viability of making Nigeria an Ammonia net export nation from the 218 flare sites which flare an average of 0.7 Billion cubic feet (BCF) of gas daily, with skid mounted innovative ammonia production equipment\u2019s and other virtual pipeline development devices.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the US Department of State and Department of Trade agreed to collaborate with Nigeria by working together with development partners to fund a study to mature these initiatives into full gas commercialization and convert the waste into a source of federation revenue generation, while eliminating the environmental degradation.\n\nFinally, the successful take off of the project will not only open another massive revenue stream for the country but would tackle the challenges of environmental pollution and the resultant health challenges visited on the people of oil producing communities, as a result of gas flaring. In essence, the success of ongoing discussions with the U.S. government and proposed development partners will not only arrest environmental degradation and guarantee the health of the people, it also has the potential to generate much needed foreign exchange for the country.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, who made the disclosure during a virtual meeting of African finance ministers and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said: \u201cWe are cleaning up our subsidies. We had a setback, we were to remove fuel subsidy by July this year but there was a lot of push back from the polity. We have elections coming and also because of the hardship that companies and citizens went through during the COVID-19 pandemic, we just felt that the time was not right, so we pulled back on that.\u201cBut we have been able to quietly implement subsidy removal in the electricity sector and as it is, as we speak, we don\u2019t have subsidies in the electricity sector. We did that overtime by carefully adjusting the prices at some levels while holding the lower levels down.\u201dSpeaking further during the meeting with the theme: \u201cThe Political Economy of Fiscal Reforms in Africa,\u201d Ahmed noted that the current high price of crude oil had further increased petrol subsidy burden on the federal government.According to her, although the government had a setback in its plan to have subsidies on petrol removed by July this year, it would work with the National Assembly to have it removed in phases.\u201cFuel subsidy is a huge problem for us. It has thrown up our deficits too much higher than we planned. What is happening now with the global oil prices is also going to worsen matters but the current review that we are doing is to hold the subsidy at the level in which we planned.\u201cWe are currently doing a budget amendment to accommodate incremental subsidy (removal) as a result of the reversal of the decision and we want to cap it at that. \u201cHopefully, the parliament will agree with us and we are able to continue with our plan for subsidy (removal) otherwise the way things are going we will not be able to predict where we will be,\u201d she said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

In any case, this Promissory Note must be submitted to the Central Bank of Nigeria for payment at least two (2) working days before the Maturity Date,\u201d one of the documents read.\n\n\n\nHowever, the apex bank in a letter to some banks said the promissory notes \u201care not admissible or registrable on the scrip-less securities settlement system.\u201d\n\n\n\nA letter dated November 19, 2021, signed by CBN\u2019s Director of Banking Service, Josephine Ajala and addressed to one of the financial institutions, Keystone Bank, read, \u201cWe are in receipt of two letters dated November 17, 2021, from your office, requesting for dematerialization of various FGN promissory notes for Prince Orji Nwafor-Orizu totalling $1,219,440:00 and Barrister Olaitan Bello totalling $215,195:00.\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease be informed that we are unable to accede to your request because currently, Foreign Currency Denominated Promissory Notes are not admissible or registrable on the scrip-less securities settlement system (54) and as such, only Promissory Notes issued in Naira are registered and dematerialized on 54.\u201d\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nSaharaReporters had in a series of reports exposed wide-ranging legitimacy issues, including non-execution of agreed contracts and backdoor deals raised against the indebtedness from various quarters.\n\n\n\nOne of the beneficiaries is Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards, who was indicted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\n\n\nDocuments seen by SaharaReporters showed that Edwards did not represent the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON) as claimed.\n\n\n\nA letter dated August 1, 2018, by former EFCC Chairman, Ibrahim Magu, to the Ministry of Justice/Attorney General Office, indicted him of an attempt to defraud the Nigerian government.\n\n\n\nIt said, \u201cThe suspects had filed applications in court to be joined as one of the judgement creditors during the garnishee proceedings and the applications were refused by the Federal High Court. The judge in a ruling delivered on the 27th of June 2016 frowned on Dr Ted Edward for brandishing a judgment purportedly delivered by the Federal Capital Territory on 30th October, 2015 and in fact, took a swipe at it.\n\n\n\n\u201cBy the Motion Ex parte filed on the 30th of March, 2015, the judgement creditors applied for a Garnishee Order Nisi which was granted on 1st April, 2015 and fixed the return date for 16th April for the Garnishee to show cause why the Order Nisi should not be made absolute.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Honorable Judge in his ruling stated unequivocally that let me state right away that the substantive matter was commenced by me until I entered judgement on the 3rd of December, 2013. I have searched my records up to the date I entered judgement. I could not find the name of Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards as representing the judgement creditors even for one day nor did I find any process filed by his law firm. How then was that judgement prosecuted?\n\n\n\n\u201cAnother point to highlight is the fact that according to the purported letter of engagement being bandied by Dr Ted Edwards, he was engaged on September 15, 2011, long before the matter was filed in court quoting the exact judgment sum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat this throws up is the fact that the said letter of engagement was done after 3rd December, 2013 and backdated to make it look as if the suspect had been engaged before the case started. There is no evidence to prove that the suspect did any work in relation to the recovery process.\n\n\n\n\u201cA careful look at the memorandum of settlement Dr Ted Iseghohi Edwards and Hon Odunayo Ategbero betrays the conspiracy and an attempt to defraud the Federal Government by the suspects.\n\n\n\n\u201cPending Actions; Invitation and/or Arrest of the suspect, Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards with a view of confronting him with all the issues raised in the evaluation above. Tracing and filing interim forfeiture order on any property or asset acquired with proceeds of fraud by Dr. Ted Iseghahi Edwards.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that despite the report, Malami persuaded Buhari to approve $159 million as legal fees to Edward.\n\n\n\nThey also directed the DMO and the Ministry of Finance to release the promissory notes to Edwards and others so that they could take their shares, a source had said.\n\n\n\n\u201cEdward was the Secretary-General of ALGON when the Paris Club refund case FHC/ABJ/CS/130/2013 was done by Joe Agi (SAN) and his colleagues before Justice Ademola. It is clear that he was not the lawyer to ALGON and this much ALGON has said in writing to Malami and the Chief of Staff, Gambari,\u201d the source had told SaharaReporters.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe EFCC in its report to Malami and (Ibrahim) Gambari also established that Ted Edwards did not represent ALGON and that Ted Edward in his own handwriting admitted that Joe Agi was the lead counsel for ALGON. He went to one Judge, Baba Yusuf and procured a judgement that he was the lawyer to ALGON in the Paris Club refund case.\n\n\n\n\u201cYet, Malami who knows this is recommending that Ted Edwards be paid $159,000,000 as fees from ALGON instead of the actual lawyer. Will this not amount to double payment whenever Mr Joe Agi demands to be paid? From my investigation, Mr Joe Agi, ALGON and the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum have all gone back to court to challenge the payment of the $418 million including that of Edward through promissory notes.\n\n\n\n\u201cShould Malami not take a second look at the suit and see if really there is any fraud as being widely alleged? Instead, he and the Chief of Staff tricked the President and subsequently directed the Debt Management Office and the Finance Office to release the promissory notes to Edward and others so that they can take their shares.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe total sum of $418 million promissory note suggested by Malami to be paid is just a tip of the iceberg of what is coming unless he is stopped. Nigeria will become bankrupt before President Buhari leaves office. The anti-corruption war of Buhari has been effectively clipped by Malami and Gambari using their powerful offices to trick the President who really trusted them.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll (that is) needed to be done is to allow independent people to go through the whole cases concocted on the advice of Malami and the truth will be seen and Nigeria saved of all these massive stealing.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy is Malami not challenging any of these court judgements? If I may ask; in most of all these claims, the EFCC had investigated, taken statements and established that none of the contracts was executed. The report was submitted to Malami and former Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun by Magu-led EFCC suggested the arrest and interrogation of Ted Edward and one Prince Nicolas Ukachukwu but he and Gambari suppressed the report.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe same man suggested to be arrested is who Malami said should be given $159,000,000. ALGON had written several letters to him and (Kayode) Fayemi, who is the Chairman of Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum that all the jobs executed by Edwards and others were fake, not executed. Yet Malami in the face of this clear case of fraud tricked the President in a memo and said judgement was given against them.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe also negotiated the debt to 50 percent and convinced the President to pay to avoid more damages. It\u2019s high time President Buhari save his anti-corruption war by causing a thorough investigation of his appointees involved in this massive fraud.\u201d\n\n\n\nOthers who stand to benefit if the money is paid include Ned Nwoko, who is laying claim to $142,028,941 via a consent judgment he obtained from the Federal High Court in Abuja in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/148/2017.\n\n\n\nThree beneficiaries laying claim to $143,463,577.76 via a judgment of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court in the suit marked FCT/HC/CV/2129/2014 are: Riok Nigeria Ltd, Orji Nwafor Orizu, and Olaitan Bello.\n\n\n\nFrom the total money, Riok Nigeria Limited has a share of $142,028,941.95 (about 54 billion), Mr Nwafor is entitled to $1,219,440.45 and Mr Bello has a share of $215,159.36.\n\n\n\nA firm, Panic Alert Security System Limited, owned by George Uboh, is also laying claim to $47,831,920 based on another \u201cconsent judgment\u201d it obtained in suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/123/2018, which was filed as recently as 2018.",

There is no evidence to prove that the suspect did any work in relation to the recovery process.\n\n\n\n\u201cA careful look at the memorandum of settlement Dr Ted Iseghohi Edwards and Hon Odunayo Ategbero betrays the conspiracy and an attempt to defraud the Federal Government by the suspects.\n\n\n\n\u201cPending Actions; Invitation and/or Arrest of the suspect, Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards with a view of confronting him with all the issues raised in the evaluation above. Tracing and filing interim forfeiture order on any property or asset acquired with proceeds of fraud by Dr. Ted Iseghahi Edwards.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that despite the report, Malami persuaded Buhari to approve $159 million as legal fees to Edward.\n\n\n\nThey also directed the DMO and the Ministry of Finance to release the promissory notes to Edwards and others so that they could take their shares, a source had said.\n\n\n\n\u201cEdward was the Secretary-General of ALGON when the Paris Club refund case FHC/ABJ/CS/130/2013 was done by Joe Agi (SAN) and his colleagues before Justice Ademola. It is clear that he was not the lawyer to ALGON and this much ALGON has said in writing to Malami and the Chief of Staff, Gambari,\u201d the source had told SaharaReporters.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe EFCC in its report to Malami and (Ibrahim) Gambari also established that Ted Edwards did not represent ALGON and that Ted Edward in his own handwriting admitted that Joe Agi was the lead counsel for ALGON. He went to one Judge, Baba Yusuf and procured a judgement that he was the lawyer to ALGON in the Paris Club refund case.\n\n\n\n\u201cYet, Malami who knows this is recommending that Ted Edwards be paid $159,000,000 as fees from ALGON instead of the actual lawyer. Will this not amount to double payment whenever Mr Joe Agi demands to be paid? From my investigation, Mr Joe Agi, ALGON and the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum have all gone back to court to challenge the payment of the $418 million including that of Edward through promissory notes.\n\n\n\n\u201cShould Malami not take a second look at the suit and see if really there is any fraud as being widely alleged? Instead, he and the Chief of Staff tricked the President and subsequently directed the Debt Management Office and the Finance Office to release the promissory notes to Edward and others so that they can take their shares.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe total sum of $418 million promissory note suggested by Malami to be paid is just a tip of the iceberg of what is coming unless he is stopped. Nigeria will become bankrupt before President Buhari leaves office. The anti-corruption war of Buhari has been effectively clipped by Malami and Gambari using their powerful offices to trick the President who really trusted them.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll (that is) needed to be done is to allow independent people to go through the whole cases concocted on the advice of Malami and the truth will be seen and Nigeria saved of all these massive stealing.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy is Malami not challenging any of these court judgements? If I may ask; in most of all these claims, the EFCC had investigated, taken statements and established that none of the contracts was executed. The report was submitted to Malami and former Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun by Magu-led EFCC suggested the arrest and interrogation of Ted Edward and one Prince Nicolas Ukachukwu but he and Gambari suppressed the report.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe same man suggested to be arrested is who Malami said should be given $159,000,000. ALGON had written several letters to him and (Kayode) Fayemi, who is the Chairman of Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum that all the jobs executed by Edwards and others were fake, not executed. Yet Malami in the face of this clear case of fraud tricked the President in a memo and said judgement was given against them.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe also negotiated the debt to 50 percent and convinced the President to pay to avoid more damages. It\u2019s high time President Buhari save his anti-corruption war by causing a thorough investigation of his appointees involved in this massive fraud.\u201d\n\n\n\nOthers who stand to benefit if the money is paid include Ned Nwoko, who is laying claim to $142,028,941 via a consent judgment he obtained from the Federal High Court in Abuja in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/148/2017.\n\n\n\nThree beneficiaries laying claim to $143,463,577.76 via a judgment of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court in the suit marked FCT/HC/CV/2129/2014 are: Riok Nigeria Ltd, Orji Nwafor Orizu, and Olaitan Bello.\n\n\n\nFrom the total money, Riok Nigeria Limited has a share of $142,028,941.95 (about 54 billion), Mr Nwafor is entitled to $1,219,440.45 and Mr Bello has a share of $215,159.36.\n\n\n\nA firm, Panic Alert Security System Limited, owned by George Uboh, is also laying claim to $47,831,920 based on another \u201cconsent judgment\u201d it obtained in suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/123/2018, which was filed as recently as 2018.",

          "text": "The federal government, on Friday, raided the offices of \u201cillegal\u201d digital loan companies operating in Ikeja, Lagos over alleged consumer rights abuse.\n\nThe operation was led by the Federal Competition Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) in conjunction with the\n\nIndependent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), the National Information Technology Development Agency(NITDA) and the Nigeria Police Force (NPF).\n\nThe affected companies are GoCash, OKash, EasyCredit, Kashkash, Speedy Choice, Easy Moni, and Sokoloan.\n\nSpeaking with journalists, Babatunde Irukera, FCCPC executive vice chairman, said the raid was in response to customers\u2019 complaints of malpractices by the financial institutions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said customers had accused the financial institutions of violating their privacy in their debt recovery drive.\n\nHe said the agency had begun investigations into the allegations since 2020.\n\n\u201cThis information started quite a while ago. Some time ago, when the country was on lockdown in 2020 due to the pandemic, we started seeing the rise in money lenders,\u201d Irukera said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBecause there was lockdown due to the pandemic, people needed small easy loan which is understandable. But over a period of time, people started complaining about the malpractices of the lenders, so we started tracking it.\n\n\u201cTowards the end of last year, we gathered quite a lot of information. We started working with some other key agencies and the FCCPC led the meeting where we all agreed there would be a joint effort to look into these businesses.\u201d\n\nIrukera said the cause of concern was the naming and shaming of borrowers and violation of their privacy with respect to how the loans are recovered.\n\n\u201cSecondly the interest factor seems to be a violation of the ethics on how lending is done. So those were the two things that we set out to look for,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIrukera said the agency has been monitoring the activities of the firms for several months, adding that it was difficult to identify their operational base.\n\nHe said investigations revealed that the loan firms were neither Nigerian companies nor registered in the country.\n\n\u201cWe found out that most of these companies operate from the same place. We also found out that many of them are actually operated by the same person,\u201d the FCCPC boss said.\n\n\u201cThey are not Nigerian companies, they don\u2019t have an address in Nigeria and they are not registered in Nigeria with the Corporate Affairs Commission and they do not have any licence to do their business.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHighlighting steps taken by the commission, Irukare said the FCCPC obtained a court warrant to proceed with a \u201csearch and seizure\u201d.\n\nHe said the commission had written to global app companies, asking them to shut down the loan companies\u2019 apps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn addition to what you are seeing here today, the FCCPC has also issued multiple orders today,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cTwo of them are going to vendors: Apple and Google stores where some of these apps are available. We have asked them to shut these companies\u2019 apps down so that people will not be victimised anymore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSecondly, some of them (the orders) have gone to the banks, asking them to freeze the accounts used by these people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI must add though that not all money lenders are operating illegally and that is why it has been taking time for us to track these people.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that the people we are proceeding against today are the only ones, but these are where we have information now and we want to start with them.\u201d\n\nThe FCCPC chief said the commission would restrain the business of those that are found wanting and freeze their accounts.\n\nHe advised the public not to do any business with them.",

          "text": "Over the past month, at least 2 of Nigeria\u2019s largest commercial banks have announced reduced limits on international transactions using naira debit cards to $20 (around \u20a610,000) per month.\n\nThis comes as a longstanding scarcity of foreign exchange continues to bite Africa\u2019s largest economy and biggest oil exporter, despite the recent surge in global energy prices.\n\nNigerians can use their naira-denominated debit cards to pay for transactions billed in US dollars online. For every purchase, debits are made directly from their naira accounts at current exchange rates.\n\nBefore now, customers could spend up to $100 (\u20a650,000) on web transactions using their naira cards but that limit has been cut by Zenith Bank PLC and United Bank for Africa (UBA), per emails sent to customers and seen by TechCabal\n\n\u201cThe monthly card international spend limit for web transactions has been reviewed from $100 to $20,\u201d Zenith said, adding that the review is \u201cin response to today\u2019s economic realities.\u201d\n\nThat statement came about two weeks after UBA told its customers the same in February, with the reviewed naira card limits for international transactions taking effect March 1.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe banks have also suspended the use of naira cards for international Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cash withdrawals and POS transactions, meaning cardholders cannot perform cash withdrawals and payments via those channels outside the country.\n\n\u201cIf you have higher International spend requirements, simply visit any of our branches and request for a foreign currency debit or prepaid card, which are available in US Dollar, Pounds, and Euro variants,\u201d Zenith Bank added.\n\n\u201cRemember you can use your UBA Dollar, Pounds or Euro Card for international POS, ATM, and web transactions,\u201d UBA\u2019s mail read. \u201cIf you do not have one and would like to subscribe, please visit a branch close to you.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, Nigerians have reacted with displeasure on social media against the new limits as they restrict their ability to pay for international transactions like Netflix subscriptions, ads on Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms.\n\n$20/month spending limit on @UBAGroup cards???

          "text": "\u201cHoly f*ck.\u201d\n\nThat was what Beeple tweeted when \u201cEverydays: The First 5,000 Days\u201d, his non-fungible Token (NFT) art and the first purely digital work of art ever offered by a major auction house, was bought for $69 million at Christie\u2019s in March last year. This event didn\u2019t only make Beeple the third richest artist in the world, it ushered in the beginning of a new era for the art world.\n\nWhile Beeple\u2019s was the most expensive JPEG NFT format, profile-pic NFT (PPF)\u2014NFTs that depict a portrait that can be used as a social media avatar\u2014also hit some record-breaking milestones. For example, Crypto Punk NFTs that were given out for free in 2017 at launch started trading for prices between $480,000 and $1.25 million in January 2021 and, by the end of the year, they wouldn\u2019t go for anything less than $4 million.\n\nThough NFT has been around since 2014, 2021 was the pivotal year for this \u201cnovelty and strange\u201d technology. It was the year it broke into the mainstream, disrupting the art world and waltzing its way into the hearts of almost every aspect of pop culture, from music to film to sports and literature.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile all of this was happening, a crop of young and curious African minds have also started to develop an appetite and build an NFT ecosystem on the continent. Although it felt\u2014still feels\u2014like a myth to the broader population, more people had started buying into it. Jacon Osinachi was well on his way to becoming the foremost NFT artist on the continent and, arguably, the world. Anthony Azekwoh would soon create and sell his first NFT \u201cThe Red Man\u201d, one of the most popular NFT pieces out of Africa. Zimbabwean Nyasha Warambwa\u2019s \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again\u201d, a digital art of late African-American entertainment and sports stars\u2014DMX, Kobe Bryant, Aaliyah, Chadwick Boseman, Tupac Shakur, and Nipsey Hussle\u2014would soon be picked up and displayed on a billboard in New York\u2019s Times Square.\n\nSomewhere in Abuja, Nigeria, is Peace Ojemeh 24, a Nigerian product designer and an Open Source advocate, who, like everybody else, is trying to understand the \u201cinsanity\u201d around this technology, the reason anybody would spend millions of dollars on something intangible\u2014something they might never touch physically.\n\nWhile Ojemeh was still making sense of this, the original copy of \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d, a viral photo meme of a girl smirking as a fire roared behind her, sold for $500,000 (180 ETH at the time).\n\n\u201cReading about Disaster girl, a meme I casually use in my WhatsApp chats with friends, selling for such a ridiculous amount of dollars, was an awakening. I just knew I had to get in on NFTs,\u201d Ojemeh told TechCabal.\n\nBut judging from Ojemeh\u2019s journey, this could have been all talk. That wasn\u2019t the first time Ojemeh would get excited about crypto and its related ventures. In 2017 and 2018, she had planned to buy her first ethereum (ETH) but ended up not going through with it.\n\nWhen she finally did something in the space, it was a disaster. She bought edcoin, a crypto token from a Nigerian blockchain company Edmark. She even convinced her mother and uncle to invest in it but a few months after, while ETH ballooned into over $1,000, Edcoin started dropping in value.\n\nBy 2020, it was obvious edcoin wasn\u2019t going anywhere so she began to think of how to flip this seemingly bad investment into a lucrative one. She withdrew her investment from edcoin into ETH and then into e-gold and some other coins that yielded positives. This experience exposed her to the slippery world of crypto and the learnings from it shaped how she approaches crypto today.\n\nFounding Haze Monkey Society\n\nSo instead of going right into NFTs after the \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d news, Ojemeh decided to learn about the industry, and invested in some NFTs to have access to their communities to understand how they function and are being managed. By the time she gathered enough knowledge, she reached out to her friend Alabo Briggs, 22, a blockchain engineer, about building their own NFT collection. Briggs was on board with the idea but advised that they start small by first minting a single NFT then flying from there. But Ojemeh\u2019s ambition was bigger than that; she wanted to build a strong NFTs community like Crypto Punk and Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) had built, and she wanted to hit the ground running.\n\nSo, in August, while Pablo Stanley, a product designer and doodler, was launching Robotos, a 10,000-robot NFT collection, and selling out, Ojemeh and Briggs started building a collection of stoned monkeys they would call Haze Monkey Society.\n\nHaze Monkey Society was launched as a collection of 4,200 NFTs focused on building a no-code platform aimed at empowering NFT creators and artists and making an environmental impact in Africa.\n\n\u201cBecause we didn\u2019t want to reinvent the wheel, we needed to associate ourselves with a successful project while not being a complete replica. So with the success of BAYC, we chose to identify as monkeys,\u201d said Ojemeh. \u201cHaze indicates the weed-smoking culture among creatives. It\u2019s also an inspiration behind our unique number: 420.\u201d\n\nHaze Monkey has unique and rich storytelling built into each of its NFTs.\n\nA thoughtful roadmap\n\nOne of the things that determines the success of an NFT project is its community. And what makes a community thrive is the utilities, the benefits, that come from holding such NFT. Ojemeh and Briggs know this, and that\u2019s why they spent a lot of time deliberating on their roadmap.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to just sell NFTs, we are keen on finding a way to provide value to Haze Monkey\u2019s holders,\u201d said Ojemeh, who also consults for the United Nations, the International Telecommunication Union, and the African Union on a project that exposes technology as a career path to girls across African countries.\n\nBesides access to an exclusive social community, there are 3 major benefits on Haze Monkey\u2019s roadmap. One of them is the no-code platform which Ojemeh said was born out of creating an environment where people don\u2019t need deep tech knowledge to harness the blockchain technology.\n\nThe next one is the animation series about Haze Monkey\u2019s unique stories where holders and community members will be characters. Lastly, the duo, having been born and bred in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, where petroleum exploration in the area continues to pollute their water and atmosphere, decided to include something personal to them: they want to plant 100 trees somewhere in Africa for every single NFT minted.\n\nA learning curve that led to a new direction\n\nAbout 10 days before Haze Monkey NFTs would start its public minting in February, the team launched a countdown campaign and daily Twitter space discussion, where the community would come together, ask questions, calculate the societal impact of the project and, most importantly, the fortune it promises.\n\nThe minting calendar had been set; the public minting price was set at 0.08 ETH at a maximum of 4 NFTs per address and the presale price for those who had been whitelisted after performing some tasks or winning giveaways was pegged at 0.06 ETH at a maximum of 2 NFTs.\n\nIn one of those Twitter Spaces, a community member with a monkey avatar and a Mexican accent asked what would happen if the collection did not sell out within the opening week. For a few seconds, there was silence and one could tell he\u2019d ask an unexpected question. It was obvious the team hadn\u2019t considered this.\n\n\u201cWell, the plan is to sell out, but in a situation where we don\u2019t the community will decide what to do,\u201d answered Ashlei, one of the US-based community managers who was moderating the space.\n\nBefore the countdown campaign started, Haze Monkey had gathered over 5,000 organic social followers and over 6,000 Discord community members from across the globe. The project had also been listed and verified on 7 of the largest NFT platforms\u2014NFT Calendar, NFT Drop, NFT Evening, Coin Market Cap, Rarity, Next Drop, NFT Genie, and Rarity Sniper.\n\nWith this increasing traction at zero marketing budget, the possibility of not selling out was out of the question. But Haze Monkey did about 20%. Among other factors, this could be attributed to the recent scare of stolen NFTs issues on OpenSea, the biggest NFT marketplace in the world.\n\nHowever, the slow movement couldn\u2019t deter the team as they\u2019ve quickly started looking for new strategies. They are currently iterating their roadmap to suite the new reality and as a result, the community decided to reduce the amount of of Haze Monkey in circulation.\n\n\u201cAs a request from the community, our genesis collection was cut down to 1,242 with a vision of releasing the rest over time,\u201d Ojemeh told TechCabal.\n\nShe also mentioned that the community had initially agreed to cap volume at 1, 000, but because of how significant 420 is to the project and its weed-cultured monkeys, the number 1,242 was chosen.\n\nHaze Monkey is now a collection of 1,242 NFTs.\n\nThough built by Africans in Africa, Haze Monkey has already positioned itself as a global brand. In its Discord group, the project has about 5 different channels for people who can\u2019t speak English. Its team members are also from across the world.\n\nThough there are African women in the NFT scene minting and selling their own NFT, there\u2019s none building a collection of NFT at the scale that Ojemeh and her team are doing.\n\nOjemeh believes that as they continue to build on the genesis collection and iterate their roadmap to benefit their community, there\u2019s nothing stopping Haze Monkey from becoming one of the most valuable NFTs in the $80 billion industry \u2014 and that their \u201choly f*ck\u201d moment will soon come.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Helium Health assembled a star founding team",
          "text": "Finding co-founders and hiring employees in the early days of a startup is integral to its survival and growth. Nigerian healthtech startup, Helium Health, navigated this challenge in its early days by putting together a team of first employees that got the job done.\n\nHelium Health was co-founded by Adegoke Olubisi, Dimeji Sofowora, and Tito Ovia in 2016 to use technology to provide better healthcare services for Africans. Today, it optimises medical records by storing them electronically; and provides a payment system and healthcare financing solution for clinics, and a telemedicine feature. In 2020, Helium Health raised $10 million in Series A funding to expand its offering across African countries. Last November, it expanded to the MENA region when it acquired a Qatar-headquartered and UAE-based doctor booking platform, Meddy.\n\nTo understand the role having a star team plays in a startup\u2019s early days, Daniel Adeyemi, Senior Reporter at TechCabal, spoke with Tito Ovia, co\u2013founder and current Head of Public Sector Growth at Helium Health, on the fifth episode of Building From Ground Up, Season 2, by the UK-Nigeria Tech Hub.\n\nOvia was named a Forbes 30 under 30 recipient and a winner of the Future Africa Award for Disruption for her work on African healthcare through Helium Health. When Ovia is not fixing healthcare in Africa, she is occupied with the Feminist Coalition, a globally-acclaimed women\u2019s rights advocacy group promoting equality for women in the Nigerian society with a core focus on education, financial freedom, and representation in public office.\n\nFinding co-founders\n\nOvia\u2019s childhood dream was to provide healthcare services across Africa, but that dream did not materialise until she quit her job at the Lagos State AIDS Control Agency. Ovia, at the time, was trying to figure out what to do next in the healthcare space. She also wanted to leave the country. A friend of hers, who attended law school with her co-founder, Demiji, told her about a small group of people trying to build a tech and healthcare company, but none of the co-founders were in the healthcare space. The friend advised Ovia to have a talk with them because they needed directions and would need the help of someone like her.\n\nSo, Ovia met with Goke and Dimeji for the first time for a chat intended to last an hour but stretched to 7 hours. During the conversation, it was clear that they were all connected by a similar drive and interest. \u201cWe connected on a deeper level of wanting to be able to provide value and fix our country,\u201d Ovia said.\n\nConvincing your first set of customers\n\nOvia said that it was challenging to convince people, that they knew what they were doing. When they tried to get their first 10\u201315 customers, they were required to present other people that could vouch for them.\n\nOvia said that another challenge Helium Health faced in its early days was identifying the strength of each of its team members and only assigning related tasks to them. \u201cIf you are a small team of 5, everybody does everything. It was a scramble, and all hands were on deck to get things done.\u201d\n\nWhen Ovia was asked about how she managed conflict and managing relationships with her co-founders, she explained that she likes good conflict and doesn\u2019t see it as a horrible thing because it means that \u201cnobody is a sheep\u2014it means everybody is thinking and invested in the growth of the organisation\u201d. \u201d\n\nShe sees conflict as a pitch: \u201cIf you can\u2019t convince co-founders on a particular direction, how do you want to convince the outside world, your investors, and board?\u201d\n\nOvia also noted that she and her co-founders take management and leadership courses and have mediators who step in during their conflicts. She also revealed they have advisors and neutral parties who are invested in the growth of the company and provide their opinions on important issues.\n\nWhat makes good co-founders?\n\nOvia believes trust is one of the things that makes a good co-founder. \u201cI have to be able to close my eyes and believe that you are not going to throw me off a cliff.\u201d This should be coupled with openness, she noted.\n\nOvia believes it is important that co-founders be at the right place in their lives. \u201cWhat this means is that, if you decide to be a high growth startup, everybody must have the time and bandwidth to build it,\u201d she said. This is because she explained, personal responsibilities might stop some people from committing to such gruelling work. \u201cSometimes, you have a co-founder slacking because they have other priorities in their life.\u201d\n\nShe also believes co-founders must have similar values. \u201cEverybody has to be able to align on how and where they want to end up.\u201d Ovia doesn\u2019t believe there is an ideal number of co-founders but also does not believe in gathering people just for the sake of it.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t believe that every entrepreneur needs a co-founder. Although, she believes every founder needs a strong executive team: a chief financial officer (CFO), chief operating officer (COO), and chief technical officer (CTO) \u201cThis is because, if anything goes wrong, the strong executive team that you\u2019ve built can do the heavy lifting.\u201d\n\nThis is important, she explains because building in a startup\u2019s early days is a lonely process. \u201cThere are so many trials and tribulations that we\u2019ve gone through at Helium Health that I\u2019m so grateful I\u2019ve had co-founders to cry to when it feels like everything is over.\u201d\n\nOvia recalled that in Helium Health\u2019s early days, they couldn\u2019t even afford to schedule a meeting with the kind of talent that they have now. \u201cThen, it was just an idea, a couple of hospitals, and we were not sure if we would make it past the year.\u201d So, Helium Health had to forgo talent and opt for talent that were fresh out of the university and had a few years\u2019 of experience.\n\n\u201cWe targeted dreamers, people who are committed to the idea and who believe that someday the startup would be big. We sold the promise of a tomorrow to our early staff. Some people didn\u2019t buy it, some people did.\u201d\n\nBut as they grew, post-Series A, they needed people with more advanced skills\u2014chief product officer (CPO), head of HR, head of finance, and CFO\u2014so, they started selling good working conditions: early closing time, working from home, and employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) to their employees. \u201cBy doing that, we were able to attract the sort of amazing talent we have now.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ovia didn\u2019t find looking for a technical co-founder difficult because Helium Health\u2019s CEO was a technical person, she advised them to get an executive or senior manager on board instead of a technical co-founder. \u201cWhen you see that there is a working relationship between you and the person, you can then bring them on board as a co-founder.\u201d She advised against rushing into a co-founder relationship because it is like a marriage.\n\nWatch the full conversation here:\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nRecently, my mental health has taken some heavy hits, and this week has been extremely stressful for me. Enough about me, though. What comes to mind when you hear the term \u201cmental health\u201d? A mad person?\n\nSide bar: It\u2019s encouraging to see how people are coming forward to test for mental illnesses and accept treatment. While this is still a long way off in Africa, it\u2019s certain we\u2019re getting there. So, thanks to the Internet for bringing it to light!\n\nBack to the matter. Is mental health only related to mental illnesses? Is it limited to schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, anxiety, eating disorder, depression, insomnia, alcohol and substance abuse, and other similar conditions?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s your answer: Mental health encompasses more than just mental illnesses. It is related to how a person feels, thinks, and acts.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) describes it as a state of well-being in which an individual recognises his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and can contribute to his or her community.\n\nThis means that someone may have good mental health, no mental illness or be somewhere in between. This refers to the mental health spectrum.\n\nFor instance, Ayo, a 27-year-old graduate, may not exhibit any signs of mental illness but is unemployed, with a negative attitude toward himself and his relationships, or may not have a strong sense of purpose. Can you say Ayo is mentally healthy? Of course not!\n\nHaving good mental health and no mental illness is at the top of the spectrum, while having poor mental health and a mental illness is at the bottom. While the people who are somewhere in the middle may have good mental health but a mental illness, they may also have poor mental health but no mental illness.\n\nConsequently, we must all strive to be at the top of the mental health spectrum which begins with prioritising your mental health as much as you do your physical and sexual health.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nThe Nigeria Data Protection Bureau\n\nAntler East Africa\u2019s oversubscribed fund\n\nThe Nigeria Data Protection Bureau\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know that the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (CFRN) 1999 guarantees Nigerian citizens the fundamental right to privacy?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis means that under Section 37 of the CFRN, citizens have the right to privacy in their homes, correspondence, phone conversations, and telegraphic communications.\n\nThe Constitution, however, does not define \u201cprivacy\u201d or contain detailed privacy provisions. So, it is unclear how far Nigerian codified law protects data privacy.\n\nBut, personal data is becoming increasingly valuable, and it is constantly sought after by nefarious individuals who intend to exploit it to the detriment of the data subjects.\n\nThe current state of our laws demonstrates the need for Nigeria to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for data protection, don\u2019t you think?\n\nThis, among other reasons, could be why the Nigerian government announced that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved the establishment of a new agency, the Nigeria Data Protection Bureau (NDPB), to focus on data protection and privacy in the country.\n\nOgheneruemu, a non-practising lawyer and Techpoint Africa Reporter, provided us with additional information about this new data protection enforcing body. What effect will this new agency have on your privacy rights?\n\nCheck it out here: Nigeria has a new data protection enforcing body; here\u2019s why you should care\n\nAntler East Africa\u2019s oversubscribed fund\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntler East Africa, a venture capital firm based in Nairobi, has closed a $13.5 million fund to invest in early-stage tech startups in an oversubscribed round.\n\nInitially, the VC intended to raise $10 million but ended up with $13.5 million. Do the math: they received an additional $3.5 million.\n\nThe round\u2019s limited partners include Baillie Gifford, Canica, and other institutional investors like the International Finance Corporation.\n\nAntler East Africa launched in August 2019, two years after Antler \u2013 its parent company \u2013 was founded by Magnus Grimeland. Every year, the VC firm employs a full venture building model with two cohorts.\n\nThe company uses a hybrid model acting as both a venture builder and a venture capital firm. From its $300 million fund, the firm has invested in over 250 companies ranging from pre-seed to Series C.\n\nSo far, five cohorts of 153 founders have graduated from the accelerator programs, and the firm has made 14 investments. AIfluence, Marketforce-subsidiary Digiduka, Honeycoin, Uncover Skincare, Try Cooked, and Vybe are some examples.\n\nAntler East Africa\u2019s new fund will allow it to invest in founders who want to build their startups from the ground up and already formed teams that require capital to scale.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nUnderstanding others\u2019 feelings: what is empathy and why do we need it?.

          "title": "Nigeria has a new data protection enforcing body; here\u2019s why you should care",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February 2022, the Nigerian government announced that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved a new agency, the Nigeria Data Protection Bureau (NDPB)\n\nThe statement was signed by Uwa Suleiman, Media Aide to the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami.\n\nAccording to Suleiman, the NDPB was established in line with global best practices and would focus on data protection and privacy for the country.\n\nAmong other things, the statement credits the introduction of the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) and the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) with creating more awareness about data protection and resulting in the \u201cdatafication\u201d of the Nigerian economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough we are not sure of the specifics of the agency\u2019s duties, Suleiman says the NDPB will consolidate the gains of the NDPR and support the process for the development of a primary legislation for data protection and privacy.\n\nFor now, we can say with certainty that Vincent Olatunji will head the NDPB as National Commissioner/CEO.\n\nOlatunji served as the Acting DG of the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) until October 2016 before handing over to Pantami, nine months after his appointment.\n\nDoes Nigeria have a new Data Protection Authority?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe short answer to this is no.\n\nThe long answer, which requires some explaining, is maybe.\n\nWhen NITDA introduced the NDPR, the agency handed itself some oversight functions, effectively becoming Nigeria\u2019s default Data Protection Authority (DPA).\n\nBut what are DPAs? According to the European Commission, \u201cDPAs are independent public authorities that supervise, through investigative and corrective powers, the application of the data protection law. They provide expert advice on data protection issues and handle complaints lodged against violations of the General Data Protection Regulation and the relevant national laws.\u201d\n\nSo think of a DPA as a bodyguard to ensure your data rights are protected, and companies don\u2019t get away with anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nigeria\u2019s case, this would apply to the NDPR\n\nHowever, unlike Europe and other countries \u2014 including some countries in Africa \u2014 NITDA did not create a separate entity to act as a DPA. A scenario that some have argued goes beyond the powers assigned in the NITDA Act.\n\nEssentially, one could argue that NITDA appointing itself DPA is unlawful or, in legal terms, void.\n\nThe NITDA Act empowers the Agency to \u201cdevelop guidelines for electronic governance and monitor the use of electronic data interchange and other forms of electronic communication transactions as an alternative to paper-based methods in government, commerce, education, the private and public sectors, labour, and other fields, where the use of electronic communication may improve the exchange of data and information.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the NITDA Act does not appear to give the Agency the power to issue the NDPR in itself. But that\u2019s a discussion for another day.\n\nGoing by this new development, though, it appears that four years into the NDPR\u2019s regime, we might be getting a DPA in the true sense of the word. Let\u2019s not get too far ahead of ourselves, though, because there\u2019s still the pesky problem of an establishing law.\n\nIn most countries, DPAs are created through a governing law or regulation. A presidential approval does not a DPA make, but this is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, for which we are cautiously optimistic.\n\nFor now, however, our earlier answers are still valid. Until NITDA or the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy confirms whether the NDPB is a DPA, we can only speculate.\n\nOlumide Babalola, Managing Partner at Olumide Babalola LP, believes that \u201cThe statement is silent on what form the Bureau would take. It reportedly currently shares an office with the National Information Technology Development Agency (\u2018NITDA\u2019).\n\n\u201cHence, as things stand, the Bureau is no more than a department under NITDA as it currently has no separate identity, not even a website where information on its operations can be accessed.\u201d\n\nWhat happens to the Data Protection Bill?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Suleiman\u2019s statement, the NDPB would \u201csupport the process for the development of a primary legislation for data protection and privacy.\u201d\n\nThe race to a dedicated data protection and privacy law has taken several turns. Filled with false starts, the closest Nigeria has come to a law passed by the National Assembly was in 2018 with the Nigeria Data Protection Bill 2018. Although both houses passed it in 2019, President Buhari withheld his assent.\n\nThe most successful attempt remains the NDPR, a guideline at best.\n\nThe Data Protection Bill 2020 (PDF) is currently before the National Assembly, but nothing much has been heard since a stakeholder session held in September 2020.\n\nThe Bill provides a much more robust approach to data protection, providing for more categories of data than the NDPR, which appears to deal more with electronic data. It also creates a Data Protection Commission, which should act as Nigeria\u2019s DPA.\n\nInterestingly, there are rumours that the Bill has been abandoned, and the federal government is seeking a consultant to draft a new one.\n\nWhat this means\n\nBusiness as usual for now.\n\nAlthough the uncertainty surrounding the NDPR and NITDA\u2019s power to appoint itself DPA are still dark areas, it\u2019s the best we\u2019ve got for now.\n\nThe introduction of the NDPB raises a little wave of dust over Nigeria\u2019s data protection and privacy crate. It raises questions that cannot be adequately answered until we see appropriate legislation or more guidelines and perhaps a \u201cdedicated website.\u201d\n\nWhat follows should make for interesting times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you miss Apple\u2019s first event of the year? I did, but I saw a recap and the best way to describe my reaction is mind blown \ud83e\udd2f.\n\nThe event had some boring announcements, like the new iPhone colours and the underwhelmingly designed iPhone SE. To be fair, the SE comes with an impressive spec upgrade, but the design is a total replica of the 2020 SE.\n\nMy guess is that Apple wants you to buy their more high-end products rather than their budget (a $430 phone is not a budget phone ) products. So if you cannot afford the flagships, you should be able to buy the SE. Keyword being should.\n\nThe mind-blowing part of the event for me was when the Mac Studio was announced. A machine the size of a bowl of nkwobi, but with beastly specs. It runs on Apple\u2019s new chip \u2014 M1 Ultra \u2014 eight times faster than last year\u2019s M1 Max.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has a 20 core CPU, up to 8 terabytes of solid-state drive (SSD), and 128 gigabytes of unified memory or RAM. While the specs sound incredible, how it handles third-party software will decide its power.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nThe creation of Ozi with no-code tools\n\nOkHi\u2019s $1.5m raise\n\n$1.5m pre-seed by Yep!\n\nBuilding a startup with no-code tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross section of Ozi team. L-R: Israel Akpan, Co-founder and COO; Azeez Adejumo, Co-founder and CEO; Olukayaode Amusu, CMO. Source: Supplied.\n\nTwo University of Lagos (UNILAG) graduates \u2014 Adejumo Azeez and Israel Akpan \u2014 are building a tech startup without writing one line of code.\n\nHow did it begin? After spending months looking for a developer to build their product, the duo resorted to no-code tools. They found exciting products that didn\u2019t require any coding expertise. But even a startup built with no-code tools still has challenges.\n\nTheir startup, Ozi, can be described as a Communications as a Service product that Azeez and Akpan started in the university. But as their clientele grew in number and quality, privacy concerns they didn\u2019t consider rose, and they lost a considerable amount of clients.\n\nOzi provides chatbots and helps send bulk messages on WhatsApp. Although other platforms like SMS and email can be leveraged, the startup is doubling down on WhatsApp for several reasons. One of them is open rates.\n\nThe startup has recently closed a $10,000 angel round and has increased its user-base from 100 to 10,000\n\nOne thing I find interesting about Ozi is the different iterations and the challenges the founders have gone through in putting a startup together with no-code tools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you have a startup idea and have zero coding skills, you should read Ogheneruemu\u2019s conversation with Azeez and Akpan: How no-code tools helped two UNILAG graduates build omni-channel messaging platform, Ozi\n\nSmart addressing with OkHi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can find your home address easily on Google Maps, you are one of the very few Africans with a verifiable address. Getting packages delivered to your doorsteps would be hassle-free \u2014 for the most part.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re like me and your house doesn\u2019t even have a number, then we\u2019re among the 400 million Africans who do not have verifiable addresses. This makes getting deliveries or even opening bank accounts hard.\n\nInterestingly, OkHi, a smart-addressing startup, wants to solve this problem. The startup was built by Timbo Drayson when he noticed Google Maps doesn\u2019t work perfectly in Africa. In 2014, he launched the address verification startup in Kenya, verifying over 300,000 addresses so far.\n\nOkHi expanded into Nigeria after a $1.5 million seed and a partnership with Interswitch. Yesterday, it also announced another $1.5 million seed extension from investors, including Flutterwave Founder, Olugbenga Agboola and Interswitch.\n\nOkHi had a conversation with Chimgozorim, and they discussed how the startup is providing address verification services for businesses, including eCommerce and ride-hailing startups. Please read it here: After verifying over 300,000 addresses in Kenya, OkHi secures $1.5 million to expand across Nigeria\n\nA $1.5m pre-seed by Yep!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoS user\n\nYep! is another neobank out of Africa but with an interesting mission. The fintech startup isn\u2019t just offering financial services to the digitally savvy but to every African without an Internet connection.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Yep!\u2019s Co-founder, Olaoluwa Awojoodu, said, \u201cWe want to bank the guys in Lagos as well as bank the guys in a village at Ikot Ekpene.\u201d\n\nHow? Yep! isn\u2019t Awojoodu\u2019s first rodeo in the finance world. He is the Founder of E-Settlement, a holding company for different financial entities; its agent banking platform, PayCentre Africa, has over 5 million customers.\n\nYep! will leverage this massive customer base to bring the underbanked among them into the \u201cdigital fold.\u201d\n\nExplaining, Awojoodu said, \u201cnot just the guys that are digitally enabled, but even the guys that are off the digital channels, we are going to bring everybody into the digital environment using both digital tools and agent networks.\u201d\n\nYep! has raised a $1.5 million pre-seed in a round led by Greenhouse Capital. While other fintechs, for example, OPay, have a similar model, its competitive advantage lies in how easily it can provide credit facilities for its agents.\n\nThe pre-seed fund will go into doubling its agent network to over 200,000 by the end of 2022.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nWhat Happens When a Child Gets COVID?

          "title": "I started as a receptionist \u2013 Zain Asher, CNN anchor",
          "text": "Zain Asher is a business and personal finance correspondent for CNN, where she appears across platforms covering the latest news on money and the economy. In this interview with IFEOMA OKEKE-KORIEOCHA, she advised women on how they can excel in journalism. She also spoke on how she built a successful career for herself. Excerpts:\n\nCould you please, tell us how your journey in journalism has been and how you have excelled in your career?\n\nI haven\u2019t always excelled to be honest and really want young people in Nigeria to understand that success is not a straight line. There are always bumps along the way. There are always roadblocks and traffic lights on the way. I started off as a receptionist. That was my first job out of university. I was a receptionist for almost four years.\n\nI am not saying there is anything wrong with being a receptionist but I did not want to remain a receptionist. I wanted to move up within this production company but that never happened, no matter how many times I asked for promotion, it never happened. If you are not meant to be doing a job, it is better that you find out sooner than later so that you can make the appropriate changes.\n\nSo, when I realised the job was not for me and the promotion was never going to happen, I sat down and asked myself what I wanted to do and what I really loved and that for me was journalism. I studied journalism in Grad school. It was hard for me to get a job when I graduated. So, I decided to try my luck with this production company. When that did not work, I went back to journalism. And I really worked hard.\n\nI am a resourceful person. When I resigned, I got my roommate at the time to film me with a camera around California, basically pretending to be a reporter. I put together packages and visual stories, hoping that I could send it to a TV station and they would hire me. I didn\u2019t have much experience then though but I had studied enough for what it took to put together an honest story and I could do it. So, I sent this to a station in the New York area. They agreed to bring me on an interview. I went to New York, did the interview and even when I didn\u2019t have any experience, they were impressed that I had the tenacity and the drive to put together this tape myself, teach myself how to put together those stories and how to do stand-ups. So, they gave me a job on the spot.\n\nRead also: \u2018Why housing schemes crash in Nigeria\u2019\n\nThere are so many lessons in that for young people because I could have easily told myself that I didn\u2019t have any experience, so it would be difficult to get a job at the station. But you don\u2019t know unless you try. So my message is for people to just try.\n\nAnother piece of advice in journalism is, \u2018Have a specialty.\u2019 Find something that you can offer that few people can also offer. I got my start from Business Journalism. I studied Business news. I largely taught myself and that really helped me because I had something to offer besides just being a general assignment reporter.\n\nThere is this perception that journalism takes a lot of time, as people consistently have to break stories and stay on them. So, it\u2019s difficult for a married woman to thrive in this field. What is your take on this?\n\nIn Nigeria I have heard a lot of stories among female journalists about how hard it is to break into leadership roles. Someone told me that in press conferences, they are not taken seriously; that rising through the ranks to be managers is difficult here. I am personally very lucky because at CNN I have been given a lot of opportunities. I became an anchor after joining the company for about a year and half; which is unheard of.\n\nDuring the International Women\u2019s Week, the whole point is \u2018Breaking the Bias.\u2019 This is what everyone is talking about. But I think that we need to see more women supporting women. Women who have managed to rise to the ranks, especially entrepreneurs; I love the idea of seeing more of those women take younger women under their wings to show them how they did it.\n\nThe entrepreneurial spirit is one thing that Nigeria has to offer the world. It is so amazing here. The talent and motivation among male and female entrepreneurs is amazing. Everyone knows Mo Abudu, she has done really well for herself. But I hope to see more female entrepreneurs in the media space. And I want to see more people who have managed to achieve a lot in the media space helping other women do the same.\n\nWould you wish for your child to follow in this pathway of yours?\n\nI want my children to be happy and to do what they love to do. As a mother, my job is to expose my children as much as possible to everything, even though they are very young so they can pick what they are going to fall in love with. Because there is no point forcing a child to do what a child doesn\u2019t love; nobody wins in this particular situation. I am a journalist and I have done very well. My brother is an actor and he is doing very well. If my mother had forced him to become a doctor, it would not have worked out. It worked out because my mother was very supportive of our dreams and because I grew up in that kind of household, I am going to do the same for my children.\n\nWhat motivates you to keep going on?\n\nI am a spiritual person and I believe in God and I also believe that as someone who has been blessed so much, I have the responsibility to bless others. People reach out to me and if somebody has taken the time to track me down and find my email address and ask me for help and advice especially, I will do what I can. I think I have done that for a lot of people. That is what motivates me to keep going; knowing that I am here to share information but really to serve and that is what keeps me going.\n\nHow is it like being in an interracial marriage?\n\nIt is normal. It is the same as being in any other marriage. Obviously there are some challenges to it. After George Floyd, race really became a vocal point of discussion in the country. I think that was a great awakening in the United States because people really began to see that there were big race issues that we needed to wake up to address. I did notice that a lot of corporations and a lot of companies began to take racial representations and diversity much more seriously. Companies started dedicating a certain percentage of their space to black-owned businesses. It became that much important to lift up black owned businesses and black owned brands. In terms of my marriage to my husband, I assure you that the marriage is perfectly normal.\n\nWere your parents in full support of your marriage?\n\nMy father passed on when I was young, so I just grew up with my mum. My mother was one hundred percent supportive. My mum loves my husband. My mother and my husband talk all the time. They have a really good relationship. My mother just saw that I was happy. My father died when I was five and my mother was about 36 years old. She never remarried, so it has been quite lonely for her. So, when she saw that I had met a man that I was in love with and really happy to be with, she supported us.\n\nRead also: Interview: Maintain a different account for your business \u2014 Kosi Ofodile\n\nYou wrote a new book. What is the book about?\n\nThe book is titled \u2018Where the Children Take Us.\u2019 This is about my mum\u2019s resilience and courage. It is really a celebration of her because in September 1988, my mother got a phone call and she didn\u2019t really know who the person was when she answered the phone. But the voice on the other end said to her that her husband and son were involved in a car crash and one of them was dead but they do not know which one. My mum went all the way to Nigeria not knowing if she was going to bury her husband or her son. My father and my brother were on a road trip in Nigeria during the car crash. So she got that phone call and it really shattered the family because it was so much pain and heart break.\n\nSo, the book is really about how this woman who was a single mother, widow and immigrant in the UK managed to raise four children who succeeded every possible expectation. I work at CNN, my brother is an actor, my sister is a doctor and my other brother is a successful entrepreneur. So, people are going to ask how she did it and they always ask. This book explains how she did it. The people who are going through hard times can draw some inspiration from it.",

          "text": "Q: The military is involved in several operations across the country? What will be a fair assessment of the results achieved so far?\n\nA: Depending on who you ask, the answers may be different.\n\nFirst, I share in the unbearable pain of those who have lost family members and friends due to activities of criminals and terrorists. I have also felt the heartbeat of the thousands rescued; joy on the faces of the free.\n\nThis makes the goal of our military operations across the country so important \u2013 Every member of Nigeria\u2019s 50 million families must be safe from external and internal aggression.\n\nThe recent report from the 2022 global terrorism index reveals a decline in the prevalence of terrorism in Nigeria. Based on our assessment, the military is using all within its capacity and capabilities to achieve this goal.\n\nIn all, let us never forget that security is not a destination, it is a journey, and we are on the right path.\n\nQ: What are the biggest obstacles to ending the war on terrorism?\n\nA: There are several perspectives; especially on the debate on which should be prioritized \u2013 kinetic or the non-kinetic approach.\n\nOne thing that most stakeholders agree on is that the high rate of population growth has been a double edged sword. Ordinarily, higher population means there is a larger talent pool for economic growth activities; but this larger talent pool has also led to a significant growth in the number of those who are being lured to use their energies negatively.\n\nRead also: Over 1,000 Boko Haram fighters surrender to troops in Northeast\n\nQ: What role will fake news play in the fight against terrorism in 2022?\n\nA: Terrorists and terrorism thrive on publicity. In 2022, many news consumers may even find it more difficult to differentiate between true and fake security stories.\n\nFor instance, a while ago, we intercepted communication from a criminal gang who were part of an incident. This criminal gang was highly dissatisfied that the incident was not reported in the press. Terrorism thrives on the promotion of fear; especially the continuous coverage of terror incidents.\n\nMore than ever before, it has become necessary for journalists not to unintentionally align with the strategy of the terrorists.\n\nIt is not the military alone that is fighting terrorism; it is the country; so the solution should not be limited to only the military. Citizens also can also assist by sharing information before incidents happen.\n\nQ: We are gradually getting to the end of the first quarter of 2022, how you will rate the performance of the army with regards to national security\n\nA: Military operations have improved this year because of the tough choices and decisions the President and commander in chief of the Armed Forces made in the last 12 months; especially regarding defense related investments.\n\nHowever, national security and defense should not be the responsibility of only the military.\n\nResearch has proven that the military line of operation is less than 20% of what is required to achieve complete peace.\n\nFor instance, the military is sometimes called when there are cult related threats and attacks; but let us not forget that the causes and sources of cultism should also be identified. It is an all of society approach that is required to achieve peace in our nation.\n\nRead also: 5 things that stand out from National Security summit report\n\nQ: What are the new strategies in place to improve operational synergy among the Army, Navy and Air Force?cv\n\nA: Synergy is presently at its highest. There is no time in recent history that it has been better than this. Every day, we raise our standards.\n\nPresident Reagan once said, \u201cThe greatest leader is not necessarily the one who does the greatest things. He is the one that gets the people to do the greatest things.\u201d\n\nGetting people to do the greatest things is what the Chief of Defense Staff, Gen. Lucky Irabor has done differently.",

          "text": "The recent surge in the prices of diesel in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s largest economy, has led to a fresh spike in food prices, dashing hopes of returning to a more stable market condition.\n\nThe price of Automotive Gas Oil, popularly known as diesel, has soared by almost 170 percent in one year to N620-650 per litre from N220-N240 in March last year.\n\nThe surge in the price of diesel, which has been deregulated, followed the rally in global oil prices, buoyed by the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Brent, the global oil benchmark, sold for $113 per barrel at the time of writing this report.\n\n\u201cDiesel prices are surging and with this, we are going to see another fresh spike in food prices,\u201d said Victor Iyama, national president of the Federation of Agricultural Commodity Association of Nigeria (FACAN).\n\n\u201cJust in the last two weeks, we paid N350, 000 to transport our commodities from Kano to Lagos, and yesterday we had to pay N550,000 for the same truck and distance because of the surge in diesel price,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have no choice but to transfer the extra cost to the consumers,\u201d he added.\n\nIn Africa\u2019s biggest oil-producing country, food producers and retailers are now facing intense pressure from rising energy costs as they have to spend more on diesel to power their factories and on logistics.\n\nRead also: Nigeria should expect food scarcity by June \u2013 Dangote\n\nFood prices spike in Nigeria\n\nFood prices have been making a rapid climb in Africa\u2019s most populous country since August 2019 when the country shut its borders from neighbouring countries and continued unabated owing to supply chain disruptions induced by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cSadly, food prices are surging again when we are trying to build back from the pandemic impacts,\u201d said Tola Faseru, former national president of Cashew Association of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSince diesel prices started surging, the cost of food transportation has doubled and this has already started affecting commodity prices,\u201d Faseru said.\n\n\u201cA ton of cashew sold for N440,000 when the season started in February is now being sold for N600,000 and this is because of logistics,\u201d he added.\n\nInflation in Africa\u2019s biggest economy declined marginally in January 2022 to 15.60 percent from 15.63 percent recorded in December 2021, but the food index rose by 17.13 percent in January 2022 compared to 20.57 percent in January 2021.\n\nThe inflationary pressure has reduced consumers\u2019 disposable income, making basic needs elude Nigerians.\n\nThe limited purchasing power of Nigerians puts basic food commodities out of the reach of many, especially the country\u2019s over 23.2 million unemployed people. This could indicate a famine threat.\n\n\u201cThings are just getting hard daily for Nigerians and the government is not doing anything about it,\u201d said Obiora Madu, CEO and president of Multimix Group.\n\n\u201cLogistics is already a big challenge in Nigeria and now with the surge in diesel prices, it has further compounded the problem. Transporting fresh vegetables now with cold chains will be almost impossible,\u201d Madu said.\n\nBusinessDay survey of Mile 12 Market shows that 50kg of local parboiled rice which was sold for N24,000 last week now sells for N27,000 while a 50kg pack of foreign parboiled rice now goes for N33,000 from 28,000 sold a week ago.\n\nA big basket of fresh tomatoes now sells for N16,000 as against N12,000 sold two weeks ago, while a small basket sells for N8,000 as against N4,500 sold two weeks ago.\n\nA 25-litre measure of vegetable oil sold N27,500 last week now sells for N33, 500 while a 25-litre measure of palm oil is sold for N19,000.\n\n\u201cThe recent increase in diesel prices is responsible for the current spike in food prices. The cost of transporting the food items from where they are produced to the markets have almost doubled,\u201d said Muhammed Abdul, general secretary, Arewa Perishable FoodStuff Market Association, Mile 12 in a telephone response to questions.\n\n\u201cLast two weeks we transported a bag of potatoes from Jos to Lagos for N2,500 now it is N5,000. The truck drivers are saying it\u2019s because of the high cost of diesel,\u201d he added.",

          "title": "INTERVIEW WITH PROFESSOR ABHUERE ON 2023 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND THE WAY FORWARD FOR EDO STATE. \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nCan you tell us about yourself?\n\nOnce again, thank you. Welcome to my world. I\u2019m Professor John Abhuere currently professor of development and management. I retired, as many persons know, as director of NYSC after which I went into writing, management consultancy and lately into academics. I set up a foundation which is called Centre for Child Care and Youth development where we try to put some of the ideas we believe in into practice. We have an office in Abuja and the headquarters in Uromi. It is for that reason I\u2019m in Benin City, Edo state to see how the one in Uromi is faring.\n\nProfessor you are welcome to this interview. There are some burning issues we want you to vent your ideas on. First, it is about power rotation or zoning which ever one it is called in the political sphere of Nigeria bearing in mind the upcoming 2023 general elections. What do you have to say about power rotation in Nigeria?\n\nI\u2019m happy you raised this issue if you\u2019ve been following my writing, I\u2019m a sincere advocate of zoning and power rotation as a basis of making reasonable progress in this country, as a basis of having stability in this country, as a basis of promoting participating democracy of all citizens of this country. But for you to know why we are really passionate about zoning you, first of all know the evolution of democracy how it came about, the development so far within the democratic world e.t.c. If you remember or cast your mind back to the relevant literature we were told that democracy started in the Greek city state and the idea really was that every person should have an opportunity to participate in the development or political process of the community so that every person should gather in a community or square for them to take decision on issues that affect them but the city-states were small and people were few. So it wasn\u2019t really possible as the world continues to develop to congregate in one place. We have a situation where in the 5bc to 17th or 18th century. Lets take that big gap, you find America coming up reviewing the whole thing to have a representative democracy as opposed to monarchy which means what they are working against is the advent of dictatorship. So everyone that has been very democratic wants as much as possible, people\u2019s representation. So you find America came up with a novelty approach very different from what the Greek had about representative democracy where you will have your own representative in government making laws on your behalf.\n\nMany parts of the world have seen this variance of democracy today but the point I\u2019m trying to say is that democracy has never been static. It has been expanding, changing in definition or scope. One thing has however remained the need for people to participate. The more the better. I should correct a thing. Even when people like Abraham Lincoln defined democracy as a government of the people, by the people and for the people something of that nature. You, find out that not everyone in America was given the chance to participate. Blacks and slaves initially were not allowed to participate. Even in Greece when it started, it were the citizens that were allowed to vote.\n\nYou find out democracy as a system is where people have been struggling to participate. It took some time for the black man in America to vote. Also it took time for the woman in America and many part of the world to vote. So if you apply this theoretical background in Nigeria we find out that the British helped in establishing the kind of democracy we have with Nigerians participating in bringing it about. But you find from the beginning the democratic space was dominated by a few people the big tribe. If you look at it, again because the minority group wanted a place to participate, it saw them struggling. All this talk on Niger-delta has been there also, the tiv movement.\n\nThey were all about attempt to participate in the democratic space. We find a situation where Nigeria was moving and we began to see the need to balance up. That was why during the military administration then, take back to when Tafawa Balewa was the prime minister Nnamdi Azikiwe was the governor general, the power was being tried to balance up. Then in the military, somebody from the North trying to balance up being the head of government then Chief of staff position to South. We now came to 1993 election, the best ever conducted election that was annulled by the then military administration. Then between 1993 and 1999 there were series of conflict in this country until the same military that created the problem sat and handover. But they made sure the two most popular political parties presidential candidates end up being presented to the people from the same zone. That is why we have Abiola vs Falashe and Abiola eventually won. That alone, trying to zone the political process to the West brought enormous stability to the Yorubas to be brought to the fold and we achieve some reasonable level of development.\n\nNow, if you look at the arithmetic, we have a section of the country with evidence that for a long time they\u2019ve not been allowed to participate seriously at the highest political level in the country and that region continue to boil and what affects one region affects the other and you cannot rule that one out. Power, in a multi- cultural country like Nigeria, you cannot afford to say politics or power must go to the highest winner, no it has to be divided, it has to be zoned so that every region will have a fraction of it. In fact, the whole process of the winner takes all is wrong as power has to be proportional to the vote you won in an election. That\u2019s a matter for another day.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that if we really want stability, cooperation, development and also collective responsibility of every person to the development and promotion of national unity in this country, zoning is the answer, it is the solution to minority neglect whether at the state level or not. It is about proper power-sharing and assurance that once upon a time it will come down to your turn in many states including ours. If you don\u2019t zone power there are some minority groups that will never smell power and they belong to the same country. So do you think they will be happy?\n\nSo my own commitment to the idea of zoning or rotation of power is that it is imbibed, it is what democracy is all out to achieve. Without people trying to recognize it, if you exclude any group from power, democracy itself is being threatened. This is my submission. We may really need to sit down. This is the year we really need to think about it. 2022 is the year that will bring about 2023. So my appeal is that the people and political parties need to sit down and zone presidential candidate to the South-East. I say it again they should zone their presidential ticket to the South-East because every zone in this country has presidential material and when you really look at it again it is unfair. Injustice is the beginning of conflict in any society. A group that feels unjustly treated will always seek a way out to seek for justice. If from 1960 the great Zik can be regarded, in modern times, as the father of Nigeria nationalism, he didn\u2019t cling to political executive power. We had Ironsi he stayed in power briefly and when you look at the history of this country, if you talk about those who made their own selfless contribution to the building of this country the Ibo people come first. We can not afford to exclude them from the political process and expect peace. We can never have it.\n\nThis is not to say that there will be no competition. There will still be competition. The only thing is that it\u2019s limited to a zone such that one person will come and if somebody comes from the southeast as the president another person comes from the North or anywhere, the country will be better off. Development will have trust. These have all been destroyed because of present system of saying a dominant group must take power. It doesn\u2019t work out that way and I think I\u2019m saying this in the interest of national unity, national development and in the interest of peace in this country that is where zoning and rotation of power comes in.\n\nSo you are in variably asking that it should be entrenched in the Constitution?\n\nYeah, it is not there as a chapter but the idea of zoning is there. We are told that the federal government and the state government should ensure, in the appointment of people to offices, that the different geographical zones are represented. That is the federal character. So when you have it in structure, why is there no application in the political arena? So it is there. So the concept of citizens, participation is very germane to the success of any democratic process otherwise it\u2019s not democracy.\n\nAlright, let us look at the call by some state governors for clamp down on illegal refineries. Wike of Rivers State has been very vocal on this area asking for it to be closed down, what is your take on this sir?\n\nWell, I have looked at what people are saying on this issue. We have to be very careful. Before you embark on the pursuit of certain policies, you have to look at the context (circumstances) that led to certain things. First of all, let me clear the fact that I don\u2019t support any form of illegality. That is the point. We need to know what we are trying to do. This is an oil rich country that has consistently imported refined products into this country. We export crude oil out. There are assumptions here. How will we say we don\u2019t have the technical know-how to refine? That is why we send crude oil out or we lack the resources to do so. That is financial capital. It is very evident government has given out licences that were not utilized which means it is expensive to do or it could be an ideological reason also for saying it is cheaper to export crude oil and to import refined products. All these reasons did not allow us to have what I will call meeting the supply and demand of the country. The meaning is that there is a huge gap to be filled in economics of development. The moment there is a demand, there will be supply. It is natural. What we are having in Nigeria is a gap that allow the growth of illegal refineries but the question you have to ask yourself is in an economy that there is hopeless unemployment, is it the correct thing to actually be closing so-called refineries. The wrong impression is given you know.\n\nThat reminds me of the illicit gin of those days. They say the gin produce in sapele is raw. No, the point is this we need to produce to have more employment, we need to produce to have more to consume at home. We give the false impression that we cannot actually produce oil but we have seen from all memos that during the Biafra war, families were producing petroleum from their backyard. So the technology is there. What I expect us to do is this rather than clamping them down, it is to invite them to a meeting, take census, give them conditions and study what can be done.\n\nI think the government promised modular refineries, where are they? So we are crying in this country that we lack technical know how, we lack the capacity and we are seeing a group. Whether they like it or not am more interested in trying to know something about the quality. Is the product they are coming out with useable and how could government tax them and tap them into the economic mainstream. These are the issues I think Governor Wike and co should sit down also with the federal government and see that these people have it. Do we actually need to carry out over \u2013 regimented regulation of the sector? No! If this people really have the technology and it is as simple and they can produce, it will be better for the country to tap into it and help them improve their system, empower them if our borders were well-manned, smuggling itself will go down, the market for illegal refineries will not be there. We have to, first of all, do our home work. I know that people are burning some of their houses. They are being driven underground and I\u2019m saying the more you do this one, the more they go underground, so they become more dangerous. I don\u2019t see or encourage sabotage but I do think that they have some technology, some knowledge, you know, to sell and that the best thing is for the government to tap unto the existing technology to see what can be done to improve the sector.\n\nProfessor thank you so much for dwelling on the usefulness of bringing operators of illegal refineries together. That is harmonise, rather than destroying them or chasing them out of existence. We want to look at another issue very important in Nigeria. The youths. The number is increasing and they have challenges. The country is blessed with a lot of human resources among them are youths. As it is today, how do you perceive the Nigerian youth vis a vis the prospect of the country?\n\nWell this is a very important question. In my book the \u201cPower of Youth\u201d I try to explain why we must invest in the youth. Let\u2019s take a simple theoretical perspective of the youth. They can be defined as an idealistic human being who aspires for the best of a society and the meaning of this is that the youth can easily be bought into something that is good and could also easily rebel when what you have told them is the standard is being deviated from. Almost every protest we\u2019ve had take this nature. They are idealistic and they now express disappointment.\n\nAnother aspect is that youths can actually be always educated to be positive. In other words, we have two aspects or sides of the youth; positive side and the negative side. Negative side is when you don\u2019t give them opportunity to create or participate, to beat their own knowledge e.t.c. and the positive comes out when you create opportunities. So you find out that the easiest ways to really mobilize youths are through education, employment. Education which can\u2019t come from the family could come from the government, also the school. But you must find them employment to engage themselves because as they say the idle man is the devil\u2019s workshop. The youths also need empowerment in the direction the society wants to go.\n\nThis means creating opportunities. Take for instance, government can\u2019t do it alone. We do know that. Look at Nollywood, opportunities it has created for young people. So if government can even, in each of the states, build three or four stadia for people to learn how to play tennis, golf, cricket and engage in other sports it is already empowering them. So coming back now, what I\u2019m trying to say is that unless there\u2019s a deliberate policy to improve the youth in nation-building activities in a very creative way, many of them will be doomed.\n\nOkay now, the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) is a very good example of what you can do with young people and how best to utilize young people. They are there serving under the sun and in the rain also because they have been made to behave that way. They see the benefit towards it.\n\nSo in 2022, we are looking at 2023 facing the role of young people in election most especially, members of NYSC who go to serve as officials during elections. Many have been recruited as thugs. Many recruited for bad purposes by the elite. So the first thing is to focus on each party to ensure that in 2022 the mind of the youths should be addressed to play more positive roles. They should be addressed to support the party they feel will win. What even stops the youths supporting one party heavily in order to secure some positions within that party and see if and when the candidate wins, the candidate will be friendly with youth-beneficial programs.\n\nI\u2019m trying to say that the zoning system I mentioned before, if the youth can be made to see the benefit of it, if the youth can made to see that democracy pays also if the youth are made to participate in campaign against corruption during election and development program that can make society grow like promotion of positive value and discipline in the society, it will be better off.\n\nThere is no doubt at all government must be ready to spend or to invest much more in the youth than they are presently doing and you cannot ask somebody that is hungry to go to the moon when there is nothing on ground. If you don\u2019t provide employment, for example, the temptation of the youth falling for anything available is very, very high. They can be recruited into banditry, terrorism, fraud because at that particular time what is available to them is better than what they have which becomes more attractive and if you have bothered to know what happens in terrorist camp you will know that they spend so much money in trying to win their heart.\n\nIt takes real ideological conviction or faithful belief when you go throw a missile and die that there\u2019s heaven waiting for you, which is a kind of brain-washing. I\u2019m not saying that the Nigerian youth should be so brainwashed, I\u2019m saying if you give employment to the Nigerian youth and proper empowerment to do certain things like we are talking about illegal refineries, you call them together and give proper supervision to the youth. If done, this year they will be better even in 2023 especially during the conduct of the general election.\n\nSir, we have to digress a little from the issues of youths to the intervention of state in the economic process of the Nigerian state. What do you have to say about it?\n\nNigeria, in my view, is a victim of wrong ideological position. You see, the state during Obasanjo\u2019s administration, people will tell you the government has no business with the states, marketing. The government investment in business failed all over. It lost a foundation.\n\nThe state was formed for two primary purpose. Firstly, to give you protection. Secondly, security of life and property, then to create an atmosphere for you to realize your objective in life in terms of welfare. Now when you take it from that position you find out that the state, even from the beginning, was supposed to sit people down to say okay let\u2019s surrender these powers to one strong person that will ensure that they will be free trade, security and others.\n\nAlso, let somebody tell me the state that has developed in this world without government intervention. America is a very good model because it sat down and say look we want to form a country and if you look at the first hundred years of America, even till this moment, America government laid the foundation of railway, telecommunication, city-building and others. So now, the meaning of this is that if there is infrastructure, you just have to make sure that this is a community. There is water, there is electricity, there are good roads and when these are already done, individuals can come and tap into this and ensure the development of that community.\n\nWe cannot in a way run state determination. However, what happened was that around the 1970s, because the argument of whether the state should intervene or not was there when Adams Smith said the wealth of nation is dependent on the free trade across borders. He was projecting an ideological position and if you look at the literature of that period too you will find people who opposed to Adams Smith\u2019s thesis saying that it was wrong and that the state has a role to play and you cannot afford open all your borders to free trade. We see it today. America still controls its borders. Now in the 1970\u2019s, especially Margaret Thatcher in England stated that her father has always been a conservative all her life. She had groceries, her economic outlook contrilled by a private person she never ever liked, so she came up with the idea that it\u2019s very wrong for the economic activities to be in government hand and that government is too inefficient. Now Reagan came up in America supported the idea of free trade and they were able to buy the press and use the western press to support the idea that free market-base approach is really worth it.\n\nTake Nigeria, where are the private men the rich men? Count them they are there and even the rich private men, they got the money from the government in the first instance. So we really have not got the capital base to say we should do our things ourselves at this level. When government gave licenses for, at least, I think 11 and later 20 refineries, did Nigeria have the capital to establish? No they didn\u2019t and those licenses were there so we have to have the capital.\n\nSecondly, historically, when you tell the state not to participate, who will do the infrastructure development that bring, about other development. Thirdly, if you take the census of private people who had invested and loss compare it to the government own is inconsequential. Everyday people invest and loose their own capital. They are not told not to invest again, or why not sit down say why did government firms fail in Nigeria. I have personally looked at it I found out that the reason is politics you set up a multi-million or multi-billion naira enterprise instead of you to go out to look for the best hand whether it\u2019s in Jerusalem to help you run it you say no it must be an Esan man that Esan man doesn\u2019t have it, or it must be a Kanuri person who doesn\u2019t have it, no thinking of competence or about the investment being made. It doesn\u2019t work that way.\n\nThe person has to know it. That\u2019s why me, I\u2019m very crazy about capacity- building. If you don\u2019t have it you don\u2019t have it. Okay take a pen write with your left hand if you will be able to write with it. You won\u2019t be able but the person who can will take the pen and write with the left hand. Capacity building is there. That was the secret of Awolowo, that\u2019s the secret of America, that\u2019s the secret of China.\n\nWhat are we talking about here. We had a kind of ideological mis-step especially in the 1980\u2019s when Babaginda came into power. He started experimenting market economy, it just didn\u2019t work out so why don\u2019t we have the courage. When this administration came, I wrote. Then Obey Ezekwesili suggested government shouldn\u2019t set up a national airways I said government should set it up even if that can give job to three people alone, it is enough but we will keep on developing ourselves. Eight years almost gone. We\u2019ve not been able to establish one whereas nothing stops a local government from investing or having a small refinery or from conquering the bush and making a huge agricultural land and engage competent youths to work.\n\nThe train has come now. What stop the state government from constructing a railway from Benin City to Uromi, Benin City to warri, Benin City to Asaba then you see the ease of movement of goods and services. We have killed the best instrument or regulated the instrument we had in development by saying the state has no role to play. The state\u2019s major role is development. It has a duty to lead development. This doesn\u2019t mean that it should not allow private sector.\n\nThe China that is developed today there are companies that are government- owned operated under the private sector skills. Take one Kobo in China and see if you will not be executed, you will! For financial crimes they send messages to your family for you to commit suicide and if you fail they execute you.\n\nThese are issues we should really think about, what should we do and this is the message whether the federal or state government, it must be prepared to invest in the infrastructure development of this country and as much as possible in areas they think are critical to economic survival and development of this country, that\u2019s number one.\n\nTwo, we need a system where the economy is free and open to both the private sector and the government, in other words, to all that are willing and capable without any hindrance. In other words, if Mr. A is capable of going into this office let him do it, if the government has the capability let it go and do it. Absence of such arrangements or understanding is what is killing the economy.\n\nThree, development should be seeing as a deliberate act to enhance the wealth of an individual and the community he lives. So if my community is so far away and there is no lucky person that is rich, my community should be develop, the local government should ensure development. We can\u2019t fold the hands of the state government and expect development to come.\n\nThe private sector all over the world has no business other than trying to make profit for itself. In economics, when you teach you say they create value. What value are they creating. Value that enhances their personality. That is why America talks about individualism which is about you having a right to produce and get the whole world to yourself. Throw it back to the ocean it doesn\u2019t matter anymore because it\u2019s your own. We are now saying yes you can create all these things let the state also create it\u2019s own. If you like, you may decide to throw this away whereas the state will like its own production given to the human being.\n\nSo what I\u2019m trying to say by my constant preaching on state intervention is that the state should wake up to its responsibility, first and foremost, in protecting people and producing condition for them to develop. You don\u2019t run away from your responsibility under the pretense of one ideological reasoning. So when you say the state shouldn\u2019t, they are all deceiving themselves. We are saying time has come if we say, vote you for a position, if you know unemployment of 20% this year you should allow it go down to 5% and you can\u2019t do anything without investing in the country. So the truth is that the state has a responsibility.\n\nLong before the internet do you know how much America invested in the development of internet. So what it means is the state must not go to sleep with the pretense that it has no business. That idea is just the imagination of some people in Europe who have no idea on how societies in Africa are run. True, we are so poor that the real instrument we have is the state. Yet the government is to bring about the centre of activities and raise money to carry out projects. We need to sit down and look for competent hands, the right hand. There\u2019s nothing stopping the government from investing. For instance, what is it doing in NNPC, is it not a public establishment, why are they carrying our mineral exploration? So government should be asked to do the needful for us.\n\nYou have exhaustively dealt with the issue of state intervention. Lastly sir, we also want you to give a piece or two advice to the Edo state government in its effort to redefine governance and introduce reforms into the state civil service?\n\nI will say this one without any bias. Every person knows me and my development approach of Obaseki. This explains why I wrote and supported him during the election. One thing visible you can\u2019t take from him is that he has a kind of architectural taste, the new buildings. Like the John Odigie Oyegun Civil Service Academy building, it\u2019s a very beautiful piece of work. But then as for the reforms in the civil service, we need to be very careful when we are talking about reforms. What I think we need is general agenda where people say, okay thirty years time, non of us will be around but we know an agenda has been set towards which every person will be walking to and the reform that I will want is a reform that is based on capacity-building that will be about the skills of the civil and public servant to enable him deliver.\n\nTwo, to actually create a sense of pride. What I want call \u2018ideological orientation\u2019 of the average Edolite such that they see themselves as belonging to the same entity. I remember in the days of Bendel, we were Bendelites, There was that pride whether you are in Warri, Asaba. When it comes to sport we were always winning, so we need to create that sense of pride and loyalty to Edo state by it\u2019s citizens.\n\nThen three, the environment of work needs to be made conducive you know because, why I\u2019m always suspicious of reform is that it is always a disguise way of down-sizing. We may down-size the houses but it has many implications. It could create disaffection within the family, it could make sure that people, who hitherto were supportive, are alienated and it could lead to no result, no gainful result. If you enhance the environment in which an individual works, you enhance his skills, knowledge, competence and you promote his sense of fulfillment in terms of pride and belonging.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that for me, the little I have seen, I like his development approach, his strategies that try to reach every corners of the state but this reform is easy, it easier to say reform than to actually get the benefit of reform for a number of reasons; cultural resistance, lack of funds to do the right thing, lack of the vision and ability to carry out or drive it. These are issues but result can be achieved, like I said, through capacity-building (training the individual.).\n\nWhen we can now train dog to catch thief, to catch criminals then you can think of what human beings can do if given decent training, training is it, Like I usually say if you don\u2019t know how to write with your left hand you have to be trained on how to write with your left, if you are right hand person that is my basic example. So you have to train.\n\nThen the condition in which you work if it is not conducive you can\u2019t produce any change. The tools to work are very, very critical. If the tools are not there you cannot perform magic. This is the thing. Then, my advice infrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure. the aim should be that each community in Edo-State should have at least water, should have electricity, should have roads. How this is going to be done is a subject for another day. If he consults me I will tell him what should be done because that\u2019s my area of interest, I wish the state luck and a prosperous 2022.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nTHE stage is gradually set for the ultimate senatorial slot for 2023 general election as Ehia Olu Akhabue stages pragmatic stake for Edo Central Senatorial District.\n\nThe uniqueness of his ideas for equitable representation, his seminal thoughts on prodigious community development, his forthrightnesss in articulation of our collective aspiration and the tellingly magnificent road map for actualising it is more than enough to endear the humane people of Esanland to his vision.\n\nHis experiences, spanning over two decades in management of human and industries, home and abroad signposted him as the \u2018primus inter pares\u2019 and clearly a shining star in the political wilderness of the Nigerian State.\n\nInterestingly, history has been magnanimous with the Esan people, having endowed them with the best and brightest as demonstrated by the likes of Chief Anthony Enahoro, Ambrose Alli, Chief Tony Anenih, Christopher Abebe, Comrade Elijah Okougbo of blessed memory and many more.\n\nWithout a doubt, his senatorial aspiration has changed the dynamics of the political superstructure of Edo Central Senatorial District where in recent past, our sons and daughters have been hoisting themselves up for political offices without integrity, required principles and solid agenda for viable and enduring community development.\n\nFor Akhabue, he has resolved to pursue and prosecute the objectives contained in his evergreen Manifesto of Service which is critically built on four fundamental pillars, namely; provision of Water Supply In Edo Central Senatorial District, Formidable Security Architecture to meet the challenges posed by criminal elements, Investment in manpower development/Skills Acquisition, lastly, linking Rural Communities to Urban Centres thereby promoting rural \u2013 urban Integration.\n\nMany of the rural communities in Edo Central have no good roads, infact, they are such in a terrible state of disrepair that farmers face serious difficulties in getting their produce out of the communities to market places in urban areas. The implication of this is that the communities are almost cut off from cities. Akhabue\u2019s mission in the Senate is clear on this, which includes but not limited to ensuring that many roads across Esanland are rehabilitated and reconstructed with the allocations for the constituency projects across board.\n\nIn the past, part of the drawbacks have been that meagre resources allocated for projects are not equitably and fairly distributed in all the five local government areas and this has somewhat created apathy and mistrust between the electorate and the politicians. That is part of what Engr Akhabue is out to restructure to the utmost benefits of everyone in Esanland. Once that is done, in addition to the water project, the people would have achieved a reasonable level of rural \u2013 urban fusion.\n\nInterestingly, Engr Akhabue thorough study of every inch of Esanland has laid bare the factors militating against rural growth and peace and stability as there can\u2019t be peace in the midst of chaos and poverty. He has mapped out development strategies for the district to be better managed as soon as he\u2019s elected into the Senate, using data to aggregate the numbers of households, streets, communities and the cities put together, comprehensively.\n\nThis is where Engr Akhabue\u2019s mandate is a collective one and truly altruistic. Having used data for several organisations to improve community planning and delivery of public and private services, as well as help measure progress toward Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) elsewhere, domesticating same for our people in Esanland has become his primary objective as we progress gradually towards 2023 general election. And for Esan people \u2013 baring our history \u2013 can\u2019t ask for less.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "An Abuja Federal High Court has issued an order to commence committal proceedings against the Managing Director of the Assets Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON), Ahmed Lawal over alleged seizure of NICON Insurance Ltd\u2019s assets.\n\nThe court on Friday granted permission to Jimoh Ibrahim and three of his companies to commence committal proceedings against three principal officers of the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) for allegedly flouting the court\u2019s earlier orders.\n\nThe affected principal officers are the Managing Director, Lawal and two Executive Directors \u2013 Eberechukwu Uneze and Aminu Ismail.\n\nJustice Okon Abang who delivered the ruling said in view of the allegations by Ibrahim and his companies that AMCON and other defendants in a suit pending before the court, flouted orders earlier made, the applicant were entitled to leave to commence committal proceedings against the alleged contemnors.\n\nJustice Abang, in the ruling an ex-parte motion by Ibrahim and his three companies, ordered that Form 48 (notice of consequences of disobedience to order of court) and Form 49 (notice to show cause why an order for committal to prison should not be made pursuant to Section 72 of the Sheriffs and Civil Process Act and Order 9 Rule 13 of the Judgments Enforcement Rules) be issued and served on the three identified principal officers of AMCON.\n\nThe judge issued the orders after listening to lawyer to Ibrahim and his three companies, Victor Ogbonna, who claimed that despite giving undertakings to obey orders made by the court in the pending suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/760/2021 filed by his clients, AMCON flouted the orders by taking steps capable of undermining the subject of the pending suit.\n\nThe companies suing with Ibrahim are \u2013 NICON Investment Limited, NICON Insurance Limited and NICON Reinsurance Corporation Plc.\n\nA copy of the enrolled order of the ruling, sighted in Abuja on Friday reads: \u201cThe court having considered the allegations that the 1st to 12th defendants (in the pending suit \u2013 FHC/ABJ/CS/760/2021) have flouted the undertakings freely, voluntarily given by their counsel on 16/8/2021 that the defendants will not take steps to undermine the subject matter of the plaintiffs\u2019 suit and the said undertakings reaffirmed by their counsel in court in the proceedings of 9/3/2022.\n\n\u201cThe court having also considered that, based on the said undertakings freely given by the defendants\u2019 counsel and binding on the defendants, this court on 16/8/2021 made an order restraining the defendants from taking steps to flout order made in the plaintiffs favour pending hearing and determination of the suit.\n\n\u201cThe having considered that the said undertaking was made by consent of the defendants and is not appealable except with leave of court.\n\n\u201cThe court having also considered that it is alleged that the defendants violated the court\u2019s order and the alleged violations are as mentioned in the body of the ruling delivered in the open court today the 11th of March, 2022.\n\n\u201cThe court having considered that it is legally impossible to cite AMCON, as an institution, for contempt where it is alleged that it has flouted court\u2019s order, that it is the natural persons, the principal officers, the prime movers, the alter ego, the directing minds that take decisions for AMCON.\n\n\u201cAnd the court having considered, where AMCON is alleged to have flouted court\u2019s order, it is the natural persons that take decisions for it that should be cited for contempt.\n\n\u201cThe court having considered that, in exercise of its disciplinary jurisdiction under its inherent powers as preserved under Section 6(6)A&B of 1999 Constitution (as amended), it is deserving to grant leave to enable the Plaintiffs commence committal proceedings against the principal officers of AMCON that take decisions for AMCON, as the court cannot grant an order in vain and a subsisting order of court is uncompromising binding on parties and must be obeyed unless set aside.\n\n\u201cAnd the having delivered its ruling in the open court and its reasoning and conclusions are as contained in the body of the ruling.\n\n\u201cIt is hereby ordered as follows:\n\n*That leave is hereby granted to the plaintiffs to commence

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government has shut down the operations of Easy Moni, EasyCredit, Okash and other online loan issuing banks, noting that they are illegal.\n\nOthers affected are GoCash, Kashkash and Speedy Choice.\n\nThe Federal Competition Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC), in collaboration with the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), National Information Technology Development Agency, and the Nigerian Police Force, on Friday, raided the offices of the financial institutions operating on Opebi Road, Ikeja, Lagos.\n\nThe raid, the FCCPC said, was in response to customers\u2019 complaints of malpractices by the financial institutions.\n\nSpeaking during the raid, Babatunde Irukera, Chief Executive Officer, FCCPC, noted that customers had accused the financial institutions of violating their privacy in their debt recovery drive.\n\n\u201cThis information started quite a while ago. Some time ago, when the country was on lockdown in 2020 due to the pandemic, we started seeing the rise in money lenders,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBecause there was lockdown due to the pandemic, people needed small easy loan which is understandable. But over a period of time, people started complaining about the malpractices of the lenders, so we started tracking it\u201d\n\n\u201cTowards the end of last year, we gathered quite a lot of information. We started working with some other key agencies and the FCCPC led the meeting where we all agreed there would be a joint effort to look into these businesses.\u201d\n\nIrukera explained that the interest rate charged by online financial institutions appear to violate the ethics of how lending is done.\n\n\u201cThe key two things that were subject of concern were what seems to be the naming and shaming violation of people\u2019s privacy with respect to how these lenders recover their loans,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the interest rate seems to be a violation of the ethics on how lending is done. So, those were the two things that we set out to look for.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, we started an investigation trying to determine the location of these firms. That has been a very difficult thing. We did that for several months and some of them have moved from one place to the another and we have been visiting these places for months.\n\n\u201cWe found out that most of these companies operate from the same place. We also found out that many of them are actually operated by the same person. They are not Nigerian companies, they don\u2019t have an address in Nigeria and they are not registered in Nigeria with the Corporate Affairs Commission and they do not have any licence to do their business\u201d\n\nIrukera said the agency had written to global app companies asking them to suspend the operations of the online banks.\n\nHe said, \u201cEssentially, what they have is an app, and so we started gathering more information about them. We engaged the public and the people who had been their victims. They gave us more information\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we got more information we had enough evidence to convince the court to issue a warrant for us to proceed with an investigation into a search and seizure. And sometime last month, a court issued a warrant and between then and now, we were preparing a sting operation which is what you are seeing here today. The reason for this is because we wanted to be sure we are hitting at the place we could get many of them.\u201d\n\nHe explained, \u201cIn addition to what you are seeing here today, the FCCPC has also issued multiple orders today. Two of them are going to vendors: Apple and Google stores where some of these apps are available. We have asked them to shut these companies\u2019 apps down so that people will not be victimised anymore. Secondly, some of them (the orders) have gone to the bank, asking them to freeze the accounts used by these people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI must add though that not all money lenders are operating illegally and that is why it has been taking time for us to track these people.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t also mean that the people we are proceeding against today are the only ones, no. We want to start with them. We also understand that they are between five and seven companies operating at the same location.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "In what has been termed a major push for breaking the gender bias in Nigeria, leading financial institution, Fidelity Bank Plc, in partnership with media entrepreneur-Linda Ikeji- celebrated the 2022 International Women\u2019s Day (IWD) with an impressive networking event specifically for women to inspire one another, discuss pertinent challenges they face as well as proffer solutions on breaking the gender biases prevalent in the country.\n\nThe high-profile event, held at the Civic Centre, Lagos on Tuesday, 8 March 2022, featured several notable personalities including former World Bank Vice President and keynote speaker at the event, Dr. Oby Ezekwesili; billionaire businesswoman and philanthropist, Apostle Folorunso Alakija; MD/CEO, Practoil Ltd, Hajia Bola Shagaya; award-winning author, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie; Iya Oge of Lagos, Opral Benson; Country Director, Empretec Nigeria Foundation, Onari Duke; Executive Vice Chairman, H. Pierson, Eileen Shaiyen; oil magnate and lawyer, Mrs. Uju Ifejika; seasoned actress and journalist, Dame Taiwo Ajayi-Lycett; Former Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Senator Florence Ita-Giwa; Fashion and Style Connoisseur, Nkiru Anumudu; amongst a host of eminent ladies from across the country.\n\nAside from celebrating Nigerian women\u2019s achievements in various industries and drawing attention to the issue of gender inequality, the event also served as a platform for the Bank to officially launch HerFidelity, its niche proposition for female customers. The proposition boasts of exciting features such as capacity development initiatives, access to finance, recognition and networking events, health and wellness programmes, etc, all designed to speak to the yearnings of women.\n\nWelcoming guests to the event, the chief host and Managing Director/CEO, Fidelity Bank Plc, Mrs. Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe said, \u201cDespite the challenges women face, we continue to play a significant role in driving the economic, social and cultural development of our communities. Indeed, a recent PwC Nigeria report indicated that 41 percent of micro-businesses in Nigeria are run by women, with over 23 million female entrepreneurs operating in this segment. This exemplifies not only our drive as women but the immense value we bring to the table. Just imagine what we could achieve if the girl child is given the opportunity she deserves, encouraged to go to school and is judged by her competence and not by her complements! The possibilities are endless.\u201d\n\nDuring the very engaging evening, Mrs. Onyeali-Ikpe made several Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) donations to women-led businesses on behalf of the bank, further demonstrating the bank\u2019s unwavering commitment towards improving the well-being of women across the country. Speaking on the donations, she said, \u201cOne of the pillars of HerFidelity is Capacity Building. Therefore we are sponsoring five female-led enterprises today with a total sum of 5 million naira for training female apprentices.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we are supporting Dream Catchers Academy for Girls\u2014a free educational and performing arts academy for orphaned and underserved girls\u2014 with the sum of 10 million naira for an IT centre at the academy as well as one year of coding training for the girls. We believe this will go a long way to assist the young ladies who need a helping hand while enhancing their knowledge in the areas of technology.\u201d\n\nIn her keynote speech, Dr. Ezekwesili, highlighted the importance of joining forces to fight gender discrimination and inequality ravaging the country, emphasising that, \u201cThe power of collaboration and cooperation is key as implicit bias is not something you can fight alone. It requires a coalition effort. You must build your own coalition. At every point in life, a woman must understand that she will face a major challenge because of the conditioning that society has given to itself. Therefore, build coalitions. We have the numbers and we must let the numbers work for us.\u201d\n\nShe also encouraged forward-thinking organisations to be deliberate about gathering relevant baseline data and eliminating barriers to the career growth of women.\n\nFidelity Bank is a full-fledged commercial bank operating in Nigeria with about six million customers who are serviced across its 250 business offices and digital banking channels. In 2021, the bank was recognised as the \u201cFastest Growing Bank\u201d and \u201cMSME & Entrepreneurship Financing Bank of the Year\u201d at the 2021 BusinessDay Banks and Other Financial Institutions (BAFI) Awards",

          "text": "The Nigerian Patriotic Quest (NPQ) has said the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor Godwin Emefiele is qualified to contest for the presidency in 2023, adding that attempts to intimidate him out of the race won\u2019t work.\n\nCo-ordinator of NPQ, Ahmed Ja\u2019Usman Tijani, in a statement, said nobody has the right to denigrate their democratic privilege to support any person or candidate of their choice, especially as Emefiele, by all standards, is very qualified for the position.\n\nHe said \u201cThis statement is in response to the upsurge of negative articles in the media with the intention of discouraging our candidate and demonising his supporters. Most of these contributions are an amalgam of baseless insinuations and innuendos against Godwin Emefiele.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, for the further enlightenment of the naysayers, that is, if they have not been blinkered by their biases against our candidate; the upswell of support for Emefiele are borne out of his solid achievements in his previous professional engagements and also as the CBN Governor.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe added that never in the history of central banking in Nigeria has a CBN governor frontally taken on the various challenges of the Nigerian economy: cutting across agriculture, industries, forex management, monetary policies, fighting the COVID 19 pandemic etcetera.\n\n\u201cIn the area of boosting food security, we witnessed well thought out policies aimed at increasing access to funding by the generality of our farmers, who hitherto were locked out from the major financial institutions.\n\n\u201cThe flagship of these policies is the Anchor Borrowers Programme, which has noticeably boosted local output in rice, sugar, wheat, cotton, cassava, maize etcetera, and helped in conserving our scarce foreign exchange.\n\n\u201cIn the area of employment generation, the investments in agriculture and industries have heavily impacted opportunities for direct and indirect employment within the economy running into millions of jobs.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe economic importance of these interventions are further highlighted by the sub 10% interest rates charged across board, coupled with requisite moratoria on repayments.\n\n\u201cUnder Godwin Emefiele, despite the diverse unforseen economic shocks that bedeviled the economy: ranging from the drastic drop in the price of crude oil for years, the Covid 19 pandemic and consequent economic lockdown; the CBN deftly managed the nation\u2019s balance of payments, boosted forex inflows and exponentially increased the forex reserves overtime with various incentives to encourage diaspora and export proceed remittances.\n\n\u201cThese are the qualities that have inspired a large number of people and organisations to selflessly deploy their own resources in advocating for the candidacy of Emefiele as a suitable presidential candidate come 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cWe believe that at this time of great economic challenges in the life of our nation, there is no better candidate than Emefiele, to steer the economic ship of this nation to calmer waters. He has seen it all and battled with very intimidating economic hurdles in the past seven years or so, with outstanding equanimity and desterity.\n\n\u201cInspite of these qualities and achievements, some analysts in the media are fixated with justifying why Emefiele should not run.\n\nWhat are they afraid of? Or could it be a case of the hand of Esau and the voice of Jacob? Only time will tell.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhy should they cherry pick who to run down amongst the gamut of potential/declared presidential candidates parading the national space today?\n\nThe illogical arguments against the candidacy of Godwin Emefiele has reinvigorated our campaign for him to be part of the answer to the presidential question come 2023.\n\nIn order to give their postulations some semblance of objectivity and authority, some of the writers sometimes claim that their findings are based on \u201cenquiries in government and banking circles.\u201d\n\nThese claims are mostly unsubstantiated and, we dare say, products of their fertile imaginations.\n\nUntil those who have the advantage of access to organs of mass communication respect the wishes and desires of ordinary Nigerians, then the Nigeria of our dreams may become more difficult or impossible to attain.\n\nSome contributors try to be clever by half by highlighting some of Emefiele\u2019s indisputable achievements, possibly as a way of hoodwinking the unwary.",

          "title": "Putin threatens Europe with bioweapons. Can he be stopped?",
          "text": "By Umair Haque\n\nToday,(Friday) something remarkable happened. Even in the context of this war. Something chilling. Russia called a meeting of the UN Security Council \u2014 on the obviously false pretext that there had been Western bioweapons labs in Ukraine. And then things got even eerier.\n\nIts Ambassador to the UN began to speak in sinister and ominous terms. He said: \u201cWe call upon you to think about a very real biological danger to the people in European countries, which can result from an uncontrolled spread of bio agents from Ukraine. And if there is a such a scenario then all Europe will be covered.\n\n\u201cThe risk of this is very real given the interests of the radical nationalist groups in Ukraine are showing towards the work with dangerous pathogens conducted together with the ministry of defence of the United States.\u201d\n\nSee what just happened there? Russia just threatened Europe with bioweapons. All of it.\n\nIt was a veiled threat, yes. But it was a threat nonetheless. The kind of clumsy veiled threat that mafias make. \u201cNice house. It\u2019d sure be a shame if something happened to it.\u201d \u201cGee, I don\u2019t know. I heard fire burns down shops that don\u2019t pay up.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019d be a shame if these bioweapons spilled and hit you. How terrible that\u2019d be.\u201d\n\nSo let\u2019s summarize. Russia used the UN Security Council to issue a veiled threat of bioweapons against all of Europe. Bioweapons are weapons of mass destruction. They are the most extreme weapons of mass destruction \u2014 regarded as even more forbidden and destructive than nuclear weapons.\n\nThese threats are made in what you should by now understand is the Russian style \u2014 the gaslighting style. This is your fault. You did this. It\u2019d be a shame if something happened to you. In this case, the purported bioweapons labs were Western ones, American ones. The pretext and justification has been created therefore, to use them. A false flag has been raised. These are your weapons, not ours. Who can say which way birds and bats will fly? Which direction a virus speeds away in?\n\nWhat a shame! Not our fault. We didn\u2019t do this. You did.\n\nPause and take that in. Because this is not what economists call \u201ccheap talk.\u201d When Russia issues these threats, it usually means it\u2019s prepared to follow through. Think of how it invaded Ukraine \u2014 to the shock of many Ukrainians. When Russia creates these pretexts, they are a signal that an attack is coming. The pretext itself is costly to create. In the case of the invasion, the pretext was that Ukraine was overrun with neo-Nazis, and needed to be pacified and liberated. That pretext then had to be sold to Russians and to China, among others. In this case, the pretext has been costly, too. Russia had to convene a UN Security Council meeting to issue the threat. Russia doesn\u2019t often create justifications and pretexts unless it plans to act on them. Again, think of recent history. Ukraine was neo-Nazi. The pregnant woman was a crisis actor. The maternity hospital had never been used. The lies justify the attacks.\n\nThe threat to Europe is very, very real. Putin just threatened it with weapons of mass destruction.\n\nLet\u2019s put all this in context. What\u2019s really happening here? Putin seems to still be escalating. In fact, he is now escalating in dramatic fashion. By the hour and day. Putin may be desperate \u2014 but he\u2019s not backing down, he\u2019s doubling down.\n\nLet\u2019s count the escalations, how many doubling downs there have been. First, the invasion. Then, the bombing of civilians in humanitarian corridors. Then the bombing of civilian targets, like maternity hospitals \u2014 an odious and obvious war crime. And now he\u2019s threatening Europe with weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThat is a major, major escalation. It is about as severe an escalation as you can get, precisely because it reaches into the heights of the most forbidden weapons humanity has \u2014 chemical and biological weapons.\n\nThe question then is this: why is Putin escalating? The story one camp in the West is telling goes like this: Putin is desperate, and he has \u201cno choice.\u201d But is that really true? Using forbidden weapons of mass destruction is a choice. It\u2019s just a nightmarish one.\n\nThis is a moment which requires clarity of thinking. These are simple logical relationships. Escalation is a clear sign that deterrence, by definition, has not worked. Putin is escalating because he is not deterred. Therefore our approach of deterrence is not stopping him. He is escalating, and escalation is the opposite of deterrence.\n\nPutin appears to be willing to go to the edge and beyond. Of serious and horrific war. Nuclear war, biological war, chemical war. War of mass destruction. Places in Ukraine are already at the point of mass destruction \u2014 Mariupol, where people have no water or heat, for example.\n\nPutin appears to be willing to go to the edge and beyond. Of serious and horrific war. Nuclear war, biological war, chemical war. War of mass destruction. Places in Ukraine are already at the point of mass destruction \u2014 Mariupol, where people have no water or heat, for example.\n\nNow. Why is Putin not deterred?\n\nOur reigning narrative in the West when it comes to this war so far is not quite right. I\u2019m sorry to have to say it. But we have to face the facts if we have any hope of preventing all-out destruction. So, again, these are facts. They are not my opinion.\n\nPutin\u2019s support in Russia has increased recently. More people in Russia back his war now than they did a week ago. In other words, he is enjoying a groundswell of support \u2014 even if Western media only covers the protestors and the crackdowns, the social reality is different.\n\nMaking things worse, China is taking his side openly now. Read Chinese state media. They openly now support Russia\u2019s false flag of Western biolabs \u2014 that too is an escalation, the first time that China has openly supported one of Putin\u2019s Big Lies. They are openly calling this a war of Western aggression. Chinese state media matter, because they are effectively a window into what China\u2019s upper echelons of its ruling party think. They are how those upper echelons control discourse and thinking in China. So those upper echelons are openly taking Russia\u2019s side now.\n\nAgain, this is different from the way Western media portrays it \u2014 but the truth is that while Western media is doing a great job of covering the war, they are not doing a very good one of analysing it. Let me put that to you another way.\n\nWhose side is China on? It should be obvious \u2014 even though if I ask you, many of you will reply with \u201cOurs!\u201d Wrong. Guess who\u2019s still buying copious amounts of Russian oil, gas, coal, nickel, iron, steel, wheat, grains? China is. It isn\u2019t going to take our side. That\u2019s because it already hasn\u2019t. It is already on Russia\u2019s side. If China was going to sanction Russia, it would have already happened by now. That it hasn\u2019t happened \u2014 we\u2019re now two weeks into this war\u2014 while China is now openly supporting Russia politically, culturally, financially, and economically tells us something. China is not on our side. China is no longer even on the fence \u2014 it\u2019s repeating Russian propaganda on its national media. This isn\u2019t my opinion, this is fact. Westerners need to understand this clearly and see the implication.\n\nPut those two facts together. Putin\u2019s support is growing internally \u2014 and his allies are choosing his side. What does all that tell you?\n\nThe West\u2019s strategy has been to hope for the opposite. That internal dissension would weaken Putin and bring him down. Large scale social unrest would be sowed by sanctions, and Putin\u2019s own elites would turn on him as they lost their money and access to Western goods. None of this has happened. Precisely the opposite has. Putin is seeing a groundswell of nationalistic support. His elites are powerless to stop him, as good analysts of Russia have pointed out from the beginning, because Putin controls them, they don\u2019t control him, since he can allocate Russia\u2019s state owned enterprises however he likes, not to mention throw them in jail.\n\nThe West was also hoping that Putin\u2019s allies would distance themselves from him \u2014 notably China. That is because China is Russia\u2019s largest purchaser of electricity, oil, coal, gas, and so forth, most or all its resources, after the EU. But don\u2019t fall for the spin \u2014 while Xi and his upper echelons might say the situation\u2019s \u201cdisconcerting\u201d or \u201cregrettable,\u201d that\u2019s what they say to us, in the West. To China\u2019s own masses, they are backing Russia\u2019s disinformation, that the war is one of Western aggression, even to the point of repeating the bizarre lies about biolabs. And they are still going right on and purchasing Russian resources like nothing whatsoever has changed. They have no plan and no interest in cutting how much they buy from Russia.\n\nAnd that is very, very significant. Because though we might have sanctioned Russia, the simple fact is that Putin has plenty of money coming in from China, not to mention the rest of the world, from Africa to Asia, to keep his war machine humming.\n\nThat is why Putin is not deterred. He may be desperate, in some vague sense. But not in a real one. In the sense that he\u2019s running out resources, like tanks, guns, bombs, missiles, soldiers, money to buy them with, exports to finance the money with. He is not desperate even in the sociocultural sense, embattled, trying to sell a war that the people don\u2019t back.\n\nOur strategy is not working. In the West it is easy to think that forcing the Moscow Stock Exchange to close and Chanel and McDonald\u2019s pulling out of Russia is a big deal. That isn\u2019t quite true. Do you know how long most countries have had stock markets at all? Maybe twenty or thirty years. Access to Western goods? Most countries in the world still don\u2019t have Chanel boutiques and so on. McDonald\u2019s only went global maybe twenty years ago.\n\nDo you see my point a little? We think to ourselves, a little too glibly, \u201cWe\u2019ve got them over a barrel! Life can\u2019t go on without stock markets and McDonald\u2019s and Chanel!\u201d But most of humanity has never had those things \u2014 and still doesn\u2019t. And yet life goes on. Countries can function without these things, and most do.\n\nLet me make that message even sharper. Do you know when the Moscow Exchange \u2014 the one that Westerners now think proudly is shut down, so it\u2019s a major win \u2014 was founded? In 2011. Russia got on without it. Maybe you begin to see my point.\n\nIt\u2019s a harsh one, and it\u2019s going to make many people uncomfortable. I\u2019m sorry about that. But it has to be said. Our strategy is not working. Sanctions are not going to stop Putin\u2019s war machine. Countries can exist without the things we\u2019ve yanked away from Russia, or forced to close, from stock markets to fast fashion to luxury brands \u2014 and most do. That doesn\u2019t prevent them from making war or conducting genocide one bit.\n\nOur strategy is not even working on the level of shrinking Russian support for Putin\u2019s war to any significant degree. He\u2019s enjoying more support over time, because, of course, that\u2019s what wars do. And as we force unemployment on Russians, what\u2019s going to happen? Hey, you poor desperate broke guy \u2014 why don\u2019t you join my army, huh?\n\nOur strategy is not working. It\u2019s not even going to work. Because, as I\u2019ve pointed out to you, Russia is earning more than enough from China to Africa to Asia to keep the war machine going.\n\nIt\u2019s true that over time our strategy might weaken Putin. But time is something we don\u2019t have. Russia is openly threatening to use weapons of mass destruction on all of Europe at the UN Security Council today. It has created a justification and pretext for their use, which means an attack is coming soon, whether its chemical weapons used to clear Kyiv, or something even more horrific, like refugees infected with bioweapons to deliberately create havoc in Poland, within NATO\u2019s borders. And since Russia has already disowned using them, it can shrug and say, \u201cSorry, NATO. What a shame! What a disaster. Too bad \u2014 those were your bioweapons.\u201d\n\nYou see how serious a situation we are in now.\n\nThis is the situation. We have a nation armed with weapons of mass destruction, led by a dictator who wants to create a neofascist empire that stretches into the heart of Europe. He is openly threatening to use those weapons, and he\u2019s used them before, in Syria, which is a good guide to what\u2019s unfolding in Ukraine. Ukraine\u2019s brave President has already warned that Putin will \u201cmarch to the gates of Berlin\u201d if he\u2019s allowed to.\n\nPutin\u2019s escalating because our strategy is not working. Our strategy is made by Western technocrats who have used such economic warfare on poor countries \u2014 Venezuela, Iran, most of South America, much of Africa. If you don\u2019t do what we want, we cut you off from our global economy. You don\u2019t get access to funds, goods, money, finance, credit, stuff.\n\nIt works on poor countries because they\u2019re poor. They have no choice. They meekly submit, usually, because the alternative is literally starving to death.\n\nBut Russia is not such a country. It will grow poorer, correct. But it will stay relatively healthy by selling its abundant natural resources to a world from China to Africa to Asia. And that world has no special sympathy for us in the West. It isn\u2019t going to join us in sanctioning Russia because we\u2019ve abused that world, too. It needs Russia\u2019s resources desperately precisely because we\u2019re the ones who\u2019ve stopped it from developing by exploiting it basically the level of slave labour, paying it as little as possible for its labour and goods, for so long. We played ourselves.\n\nRussia is not a poor and powerless country. Our strategy of sanctions and economic warfare was designed to bring poor countries low. But they were already on their knees. Making them crawl wasn\u2019t hard. Russia isn\u2019t like that. It\u2019s not going to be significantly weakened by our approach \u2014 at least not enough to stop making war. It is a relatively well off country with abundant resources which the world is only too happy to buy. Believe me when I tell you the rest of the world would rather eat Russian grain and have a full belly than lift a finger to be friends with the West that openly holds it in contempt and starve.\n\nWe are in a difficult place now.\n\nPutin isn\u2019t reaching breaking point because there isn\u2019t one for him. Russia wants a global confrontation, a world war, a neofascist empire \u2014 and its escalating to the point of openly threatening weapons of mass destruction on the free world\n\nPutin is openly threatening to use weapons of mass destruction on Europe, while the world watches, horrified. Our strategy is increasingly in disarray \u2014 we increase sanctions everyday, and hope for the breaking point, but it never comes, precisely because there isn\u2019t one. Russia isn\u2019t a poor, powerless nation. We are dealing with it the wrong way.\n\nSo what should we do? There is going to be a confrontation, my friends. That\u2019s not what any of us want. Putin\u2019s \u201cbrain,\u201d Dugin, has already said so, eagerly awaiting it \u2014 he openly talks now about a \u201cglobal confrontation.\u201d That means a world war.\n\nYou don\u2019t threaten Europe with weapons of mass destruction for nothing. Plan a careful campaign of destabilisation from Trump to Brexit for nothing. Putin is confident for a reason. He knows he can make war for a very, very long time to come. He thinks of us as weak and degenerate and easily corrupted, because we accepted his gifts of blood money and oligarchy without a second thought. And now we are making another mistake. We are not making him stand down. That is the only way out of this mess.\n\nPutin isn\u2019t reaching breaking point because there isn\u2019t one for him. Russia wants a global confrontation, a world war, a neofascist empire \u2014 and its escalating to the point of openly threatening weapons of mass destruction on the free world.\n\nEuphoria\u2019s a disorienting thing. We had better wake up from the euphoria of the last few weeks \u2014 the sudden rush of unity \u2014 now. Our situations looks like this. Putin isn\u2019t backing down. China\u2019s on his side. The world isn\u2019t on ours. He\u2019s confident because he is still in a very, very strong position. Financially, economically, socially, culturally, politically.\n\nAnd so we are going to have to do much better, fast, if we want to stop him.\n\n*Umair Haque is the Director of the London-based Havas Media Lab and heads Bubblegeneration, a strategy lab that helps discover strategic innovation.",

          "text": "After so much uncertainty about the club\u2019s fate, Chelsea FC fans can rest easy as Roman Abramovich has reportedly struck a deal with the UK Government to sell the club.\n\nAccording to The Daily Telegraph, the Russian oligarch was finally able to get through to Parliament and will get to offload the club amid the many sanctions imposed to him over the last two weeks.\n\nAbramovich has been signalled as one of the many Russian oligarchs with ties to president Vladimir Putin.\n\nThis report confirmed that Abramovich instructed The Raine Group \u2013 the merchant bank who is currently overseeing the sale \u2013 to keep the process going and finding an ideal buyer in order to complete the takeover.\n\nThis report added that Abramovich and Raine representatives had a long meeting with the government that got them to agree on a different usage of the funds raised by the sale.\n\nThe potential buyer also has to agree to these terms, this deal will need authorisation from Prime Minister Boris Johnson himself.\n\nIt is still unclear what the funds will beused for but chances are that the money collected from this sale will go to aid for all Unrainian families affected by the Russian invasion to their country.\n\nThere is a set deadline for next week\u2019s Tuesday as Abramovich is widely expecting the potential buyer to come forward and complete a quick sale.\n\nAccording to various reports, there are three American.based consortiums that are leading the way in the attempt to buy the London club.\n\nThere is an alleged \u00a32 billion offer from the Todd Boehly-led group and another \u00a32.5 billion offer that doesn\u2019t have a disclosed buyer. Raine already confirmed they will be waiting to hear a proper offer for the club from now until the Tuesday dealine so anything can happen from now until then.\n\nIn Ireland, Conor McGregor already made his offer but it\u2019s far below what the other candidates have. If the UFC legend wants to buy Chelsea, he will have to upgrade his current offer of \u00a31.5 billion.\n\nIt is believed that an acceptable offer would be of around \u00a33 billion in order to consider it properly.\n\nHowever, the club\u2019s dire situation could push them to accept a lower offer than that.",

          "text": "The Champions League is known to be the pinnacle of professional football leagues in the European continent. It could almost be mistaken for a World Cup for clubs due to the numerous nationalities that are involved.\n\nHowever, scoring a hat trick is not an easy task in the UCL. Players like Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi currently tie the record for most hat tricks in the competition with 8 apiece. However, there are some players who find it difficult to perform such a feat.\n\nWe take at the players with most Champions League goals without a single hat trick.\n\n5. David Trezeguet (29 Champions League goals)\n\nDavid Trezeguet is considered one of the best strikers of his generation. His brilliance at Juventus earned him the nickname Re David, which means King David in Italian.\n\nTrezeguet is ranked fourth on the all-time list of Juventus goalscorers with 171 goals for a span of 10 seasons (2000\u20132010). He scored 25 UCL goals for Juventus and his highest tally came in the 2001-02 season, where he scored eight goals.\n\nThat season, he was the highest goal scorer in Serie A (24 goals) and was also the recipient of the Serie A Player of the Year.\n\nDuring the Frenchman\u2019s stay in Monaco from 1995\u20132000, he scored the fastest-ever goal in terms of velocity against Manchester United in 1998. He scored four UCL goals for Monaco and a total of 62 goals. Trezeguet came so close to scoring a hat-trick on various occasions and scored seven braces in the UCL.\n\n4. Patrick Kluivert (29 Champions League goals)\n\nPatrick Kluivert is among the few players to play in the Premier League, La Liga, Serie A and Ligue 1. He is known for scoring the winning goal for Ajax at the 1994-95 UCL final against AC Milan in the 85th minute.\n\nLater that year, Kluivert finished fifth in the Ballon d\u2019Or rankings and was the top scorer for his side with 18 goals as they went on to win the league title.\n\nKluivert had quite a short time in AC Milan before moving to Barcelona where he continued to display his brilliance, scoring a total of 122 goals in 257 appearances. The only title Kluivert won with the latter is the La Liga title.\n\nThe Dutchman netted 29 goals in the UCL and scored four UCL braces in his entire career.\n\n3. Arjen Robben (31 Champions League goals)\n\nArjen Robben is one of the greatest and most decorated wingers of his generation.

          "title": "INEC letter: Bello's CECPC makes u-turn, says Buni still in charge -",
          "text": "The Governor Abdullahi Sani Bello-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) has made a U-Turn moments after a leaked letter from the Independent National Electoral Commission had subtly rejected the invitation to the emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee of the party.\n\nThe Bello-led CECPC had on Wednesday, 8 March written to the electoral body inviting it to the emergency NEC meeting of the party. The INEC in its reply stated clearly that the fact that the notice for the meeting was not signed by the National Chairman and National Secretary of the CECPC, runs contrary to the provision of the Article 1.1.3 of the Commission\u2019s Regulations and Guidelines for Political Party Operations (2014).\n\nAddressing the media at the Buhari House National Secretariat of the party on Friday in Abuja, the Spokesman of the CECPC, Ismaeel Ahmed, said, \u201cSomebody asked, what is the position of Governor Mai Mala Buni in the party, I think it\u2019s pretty simple. I don\u2019t know why this is a complicated process for a lot of people not to understand. Since the inception of this CECPC on June 25, 2020, whenever the chairman is not around and Governor Sani Bello is around, he acts on behalf of all as the Chairman.\n\n\u201cIt has always been the case that has never changed. It has always been the case. Now, we have a Convention on March 26. The chairman wrote a letter and transmitted power to Governor Bello to enable him go for medical treatment. Those are two emergencies. He has a medical emergency, that cannot wait for Convention. We have a Convention that cannot wait for him to be healthy.\n\n\u201cSo, one has to leave for the other, whichever, he has transmitted a letter and Governor Sani Bello has been acting appropriately. Why is it so difficult for people to understand that? Why is it so difficult for people to simply understand? I cannot understand why people are making this allegation.\n\n\u201cSo, Governor Sani Bello is acting the full authority of the Caretaker Committee and with the full authority of the stakeholders and with the full consent of Governor Mai Mala Buni. It is very clear and simple. If anybody has issues with any of our decisions, he can head to court. For now, we are doing it with the full backing of the law. So, there is no ambiguity on this, absolutely none.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of Senator John James Akpanudodehe, what is the position because I spelt others out the other members of the committee, but I didn\u2019t say anything about other people as well, we just talked about members of the committee. I didn\u2019t talk about their positions, whether secretary or chairman, since they have their responsibilities spelt out for them.\n\n\u201cThe other members are the ones told to come back to handle specific departments and that is what we are doing. At the full course of time, once all these are over, I will be able to brief you. But for now, these are the responsibilities of every member.\n\n\u201cAs part of efforts towards the hitch-free conduct of the March 26th National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) stepped up preparations this week.\n\n\u201cConvened a meeting chaired by the Acting Chairman and Governor of Niger State, H.E. Abubakar Sani Bello, where strategies were adopted to fast-track the process towards conducting a National Convention;\n\n\u201c35 State chairmen of the APC and that of the FCT were sworn-in and mandated to work towards ensuring unity and harmony in their states. They were also charged to mobilise the members and the people to enable the party win future elections;\n\n\u201cReceived and deliberated on the report of the Committee on zoning. After exhaustively deliberating on the report, it was approved and the zoning formula was made public. The zoning formula was well-received by members of the party and all Nigerians;\n\n\u201cAssigned schedules of specific responsibilities to each members of the Caretaker Committee aligned to the existing Directorates at the Party\u2019s headquarters. The purpose is to ensure speedy execution of the various activities leading to the National Convention on March 26, 2022. The exercise has the additional benefit of ensuring synergy between the leadership of the party and the Directorates.\n\n\u201cDeliberated on and disagreed with the Federal High Court in its judgement on the status of the Governor of Ebonyi state over his sound decision to leave the PDP and join the APC along with the majority of members of the State House Assembly; CECPC regards the judgement as a travesty of justice and stand with the Governor and Ebonyi state legislators on appealing to a higher court;\n\n\u201cStreamlined and expanded the leadership of the various sub committees for the conduct of National Convention by bringing in more Governors and Ministers of the Federal Republic to spearhead the process. This has obviously fostered and deepened sense of belonging, inclusiveness and reflect the mosaic nature of the membership of the party;\n\n\u201cReviewed and strengthened the membership of the National Convention Subcommittees by making them compact and lighter. The subcommittees earlier composed were unnecessarily unwieldy and comprised excessive number of members, a situation that can reduce their efficiency;\n\n\u201cThe CECPC committee chaired by His Excellency the Governor of Niger State has issued a notice for a meeting of the National Executive Committee of the party on March 17, 2022. As usual, a number of important issues will be discussed at the meeting.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, reacting to questions from journalists, Ismaeel Ahmed disclosed that the previously scheduled Zonal Congresses will now be part of the National Convention. He assured that the March 26th National Convention was on course and sacrosanct.",

          "title": "US to Partner Nigeria to Stop Gas Flaring By Conversion to Ammonia",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s energy transition agenda, in line with global direction received a boost on Thursday at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston, Texas, as the United States\u2019 Government indicated interest in a bi-lateral partnership that would see the conversion of the enormous gas resources currently being flared to ammonia.\n\nAmmonia has the potential of being a huge revenue earner for the country especially as the European Union, in pursuit of the net zero-emission programme, has unveiled its long-anticipated plans to make importers and non-EU manufacturers pay for the carbon emissions associated with the goods and materials they sell in the EU, thus impacting on vessels powered by fossils fuels entering EU territory.\n\nSince running such vessels during that tax regime will not be economically viable, there is the need to redesign engines of such vessels; and attention is already being focused on ammonia as an alternative fuel source, to replace heating oil and other fossil fuels. The resort to ammonia is because it is not just cleaner, but a cheaper source of energy.\n\nInvariably, it means there would no longer be an easy and attractive market for heating oil, one of the most highly sought-after products in the configuration of Nigeria\u2019s refineries. The adoption of the Carbon Border Tax by the EU has the potential of hurting the Nigerian economy which is largely serviced with proceeds from its hydrocarbon potentials. This would compound the challenge already posed by the vigorous pursuit of the zero-emission plan by the developed countries, due to the reduced earnings from Nigeria\u2019s refinery configured products such as heating oil (i.e. LPFO, HPFO).\n\nThe Paris Agreement and the United Nation\u2019s Framework Convention on Climate Change seeks to limit the development of oil and gas projects in the pursuit of more environment friendly energy options \u2013 from fossil fuels to green and renewable energy \u2013 in the next two decades. This poses enough threat to the country\u2019s major revenue stream, which is why sustaining current revenue drivers and considering other viable options became the major thrust of discussions by Nigeria at the conference.\n\nThe energy transition agenda therefore became the centre of focus for the Nigerian delegation, led by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Silva and which included the Chief Executive of the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, Engr. Gbenga Komolafe and the Board Secretary and Legal Adviser to the NUPRC, Barrister Olayemi Anyanechi. The team continued to drive conversations around energy transition in a multi-track approach at the various meetings held with top officials of the global energy circuit.\n\nIt argued that instead of a complete abandonment of further development of hydro-carbon infrastructure and phasing out fossil fuel use within the stipulated period, a multi-track approach where gas would be adopted as transition energy source would be fair and just to be pursued, as that was more practicable and sustainable, particularly in respect of developing countries.\n\nSilva explained that Nigeria already has a transition plan which is predicated on a multi-track approach to developing energy resources. One of those is a focused development of the country\u2019s gas resources during which period a diversified economy would be built around technology and other energy sources. That, he stressed, would help a great deal in boosting the country\u2019s revenue levels and sustaining its economy.\n\nDiscussions on the subject were taken from different perspectives, including zeroing-in on gas potentials and the implication of continued gas flaring and reinjection. The effect of flaring on the environment and health of the people of oil-bearing communities was specifically highlighted as the team explored concrete ways of ending the menace.\n\nThe point of convergence is the responsible monetization of Nigerian\u2019s gas resources which the American counterparts were in agreement. The US team appreciated the multifaceted approach to curtail emissions proposed by the Nigerian government and made suggestions on innovative ways to develop stranded gas resources in a more responsible manner, some of which include the use of Blue Hydrogen which is obtained when natural gas is split into hydrogen and CO2 either by Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) or Auto Thermal Reforming (ATR). However, the CO2 is captured and stored, which in return mitigates the harsh impact on the environment.\n\nThis the US team suggested would be a good way for Nigeria to utilize its abundant Natural gas resources of over 200 trillion cubic feet (TCF).\n\nDuring one of the several meetings which involved the US Secretary of State for Energy, Jennifer M. Granholm, and a second which involved Honourable Harry Kamian, Assistant Secretary of State for the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Energy Resources, the United States Government showed interest in collaborating with the Nigerian government to develop the country\u2019s gas resources, recognising that Africa may indeed need to be given separate recognition, as long as development of natural gas hastens the net-zero emissions target of the Federal Government of Nigeria and the world at large.\n\nFurthermore, the U.S. DOE promised to support Nigeria with development partners to put through the framework for the development of its gas resources\n\nRiding on the optimism of the meeting with the U.S. Secretary of State for Energy, the the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) team met with Brendan Kelly of the U.S. Department of Commerce and Puneet Sharma of CyanNH3 to discuss extensive methane abatement opportunities in Nigeria, in partnership with the United States government, especially in the area of conversion of gas to ammonia, for use either as fertiliser or for export.\n\nThe team highlighted the fact that the proposed EU Carbon Border Tax would put severe financial pressure on the use of LPFO and HPFO by vessels and provide a renewed impetus for producers around the world to accelerate efforts to slash their carbon footprints, thus creating a massive opportunity for the use of ammonia as the fuel of choice.\n\nIn response, the US team promised to collaborate with the Nigerian government by funding a study to evaluate the viability of making Nigeria an Ammonia net export nation from the 218 flare sites which flare an average of 0.7 Billion cubic feet (BCF) of gas daily, with skid mounted innovative ammonia production equipment\u2019s and other virtual pipeline development devices.\n\nMoreover, the US Department of State and Department of Trade agreed to collaborate with Nigeria by working together with development partners to fund a study to mature these initiatives into full gas commercialization and convert the waste into a source of federation revenue generation, while eliminating the environmental degradation.\n\nFinally, the successful take off of the project will not only open another massive revenue stream for the country but would tackle the challenges of environmental pollution and the resultant health challenges visited on the people of oil producing communities, as a result of gas flaring. In essence, the success of ongoing discussions with the U.S. government and proposed development partners will not only arrest environmental degradation and guarantee the health of the people, it also has the potential to generate much needed foreign exchange for the country.\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja",

          "title": "Nigeria: Buni May Return as APC Caretaker Chair, Emergency NEC Meeting Not Recognised \u2013 Arise News",
          "text": "The crisis rocking the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) escalated day with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) rejecting a letter inviting it to the emergency National Executive Committee meeting of the party scheduled for March 17 in Abuja where Governor Abubakar Sani Bello\u2019s appointment as caretaker chairman and other vital changes in the party are scheduled for ratification.\n\nINEC said the letter was not signed by the ousted National Chairman and National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State and John Akpanudoedehe, respectively, thus, truncating the planned NEC meeting, and ultimately, a threat to the National Convention scheduled for March 26.\n\nBy implication, Sani Bello\u2019s leadership of APC is not known to INEC.\n\nAs a result, sources said some concerned stakeholders of the party reached out to President Muhammadu Buhari, who ordered Buni\u2019s removal, to forgive and allow him return as caretaker chairman, so that the March 26 National Convention date would be actualised, and save the party from ruin.\n\nAnother source told THISDAY that Buni would be heading to London tomorrow to meet with the President \u201cand sort out all issues about his return as Chairman.\u201d\n\nWith the 21-day notice required for NEC meeting, in which changes to the leadership of a party will be effected, the planned emergency NEC meeting of the Sani Bello team is effectively out of time. The National Convention would have taken place and new National Working Committee members in place.\n\nFollowing the ouster of Buni, as the CECPC chairman last Tuesday and the appointment of Sani Bello, the Niger State Governor (upon resumption) transmitted a letter dated 8th March, 2022, informing INEC about the planned emergency NEC meeting.\n\nSani Bello introduced himself in the letter as acting Chairman while Professor Tahir Mamman was introduced as the acting Secretary of the party.\n\nBello and Professor Mamman were said to have signed the letter notifying the Commission about CECPC decision to hold the emergency NEC meeting and invited INEC to come and monitor it.\n\nBut the Commission, in a reply addressed to the \u201cAPC CECPC Chairman\u201d dated March 9, 2022, drew the party\u2019s attention to some lacuna in the invitation letter.\n\nINEC said the letter of invitation did not carry the signature of Buni and Akpanudoedehe, whom by implication, the Commission is saying, remains the officers of the party known to it.\n\nThe INEC letter titled, \u201cRe: Invitation to the Emergency Meeting of the National Executive Committee\u201d, dated March 9, 2022, was signed by the Secretary to the Commission, Mrs Rose Omoa Oriaran-Anthony.\n\nIt reads: \u201cPlease refer to your letter Ref.APC/NHDQ/INEC/019/022/32, dated 8th March 2022. The Commission draws your attention to the fact that the notice for the meeting was not signed by the National Chairman and National Secretary of the CECPC contrary to the provision of the Article 1.1.3 of the Commission\u2019s Regulations and Guidelines for Political Party Operations (2018).\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the APC is reminded of the provision in Section 82 (1) of the Electoral Act 2022, which requires \u2018at least 21 days\u2019 notice of any convention, congress, conference, or meeting convened for the purpose of \u2018merger\u2019 and electing members of its executive committees, other governing bodies or nominating candidates for any elective office.\n\n\u201cWhile hoping these issues are noted for compliance, please accept the assurance of the Commission\u2019s warm regards.\u201d\n\nBy implication, the stipulated 21-day notice to INEC for the commission to monitor the planned emergency NEC meeting had not been complied with.\n\nFor INEC to monitor the emergency NEC meeting, the APC letter notifying it ought to have been written earlier than March 8.\n\nOne of the stakeholders pushing for Buni\u2019s return told THISDAY last night that \u201ctwo weeks is not too much to give Buni, so that the mess he created can be cleared by him. This is our best option, otherwise, the party will crumble.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere is no point keeping Sani Bello as caretaker Committee Chairman. It is obviously illegal and INEC has clearly stated this. We are hopeful about getting a positive result from the President.\u201d\n\nThe source further confirmed that Buni, who is in Dubai on medicals, would return to Abuja tomorrow and most likely resume as caretaker chairman on Monday.\n\nSani Bello Denies Buni\u2019s Letter\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Bello has denied knowledge of a letter purportedly written by Buni, asking him to take control of APC\u2019s affairs, while he proceeds to Dubai for medicals.\n\nThe letter dated February 28, requesting a leave of absence, signed by Buni and addressed to Bello, copying the CECPC members and INEC, surfaced last Thursday.\n\nBut while fielding questions from journalists after the APC\u2019s CECPC meeting late on Thursday, the Niger governor denied knowledge of the letter.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen it,\u201d he said.\n\nSani Bello added that he had been in charge of the committee \u201cfor a while.\u201d\n\nAlso yesterday, INEC denied receiving Buni\u2019s letter, saying it would have responded if it was in receipt of any letter written to indicate that Buni actually handed over the leadership of the party to Bello.\n\nINEC National Commissioner of Voter Education and Publicity, Mr. Festus Okoye said: \u201cThe Commission has formal ways of communicating with political parties. The Commission is a public trust and any political party or individual that is interested in any communication by the Commission or to the Commission can apply for a Certified True Copy (CTC) of the document.\n\n\u201cIf the Commission is in receipt of such a document it will issue a CTC and will also respond if such a communication does not exist.\u201d\n\n\u2018APC Not Going Back on National Convention\u2019\n\nDespite the threats from INEC, the APC National Youth Leader and acting spokesperson, Ismael Ahmed said yesterday that the party would not change the date of its National Convention planned for March 26.\n\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m not only a youth leader or internal spokesperson, I\u2019m also a lawyer and we have served a notice to INEC for the 26th of February earlier. We served that notice on February 5 and that covered the required 21 days.\u201d\n\nAhmed added that while Buni remained substantive Caretaker Chairman, Sani Bello was only acting.\n\nHe said: \u201cSince the inception of this CECPC on June 25, 2020 whenever the chairman is not around and Governor Sani Bello is around, he acts on behalf of the acting Chairman. It has always been the case that has never changed. It has always been the case.\n\n\u201cAnd now the chairman wrote a letter and transmitted, for his leave to go for medical treatment. These are two emergencies. He has a medical emergency that cannot wait for convention. We have a convention that cannot wait for him to be healthy. So, one has to leave for another. The Chairman left, transmitted a letter, Governor Bello has been acting appropriately. What is the problem? Why is it difficult for people to simply understand that? \u201c\n\nHe stated that Bello was acting with the full authority of the caretaker committee, stakeholders, leaders of the party, and with the full consent of Buni.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear and very simple. If anybody has any issues with any of our decisions, you can take it to court. For now we\u2019re doing it with the full authority and backing of the law. So, there is no ambiguity in this. Absolutely none,\u201d Ahmed said.\n\nPDP: APC Lacks Legitimacy to Participate in 2023 Elections\n\nThe main opposition, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has said the non-recognition of the activities of the APC by INEC further confirms its position that the APC lacks the legitimacy and statutory requisites to participate in the 2023 general election.\n\nThe PDP stated that INEC\u2019s decision further authenticates its stand that \u201cthe APC is a Special Purpose Vehicle in liquidation, preparatory to winding up; that cannot legally produce candidates for the elections.\u201d\n\nThis was contained in a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThis decision by INEC is, therefore, another unmistaken \u2018red flag\u2019 to intending aspirants on the platform of the APC in the 2023 general elections that the APC has become defunct and cannot validly, legally and constitutionally field candidates in the 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja",

          "text": "Russian forces appear to have made progress from north-east Ukraine in their slow fight to reach the capital Kyiv, while tanks and artillery pounded places already under siege with shelling so heavy it prevented residents of one city from burying the growing number of dead.\n\nIn Mariupol, unceasing barrages have thwarted repeated attempts to bring in food and water and to evacuate trapped civilians.\n\nThe city\u2019s death toll has passed 1,500 in 12 days of attack, the mayor\u2019s office said, and a strike on a maternity hospital in the city of 446,000 this week killed three people.\n\nContinued shelling forced crews to stop digging trenches for mass graves, so the \u201cdead aren\u2019t even being buried\u201d, the mayor said.\n\nRussian forces have hit more than a dozen hospitals since they invaded Ukraine on February 24, according to the World Health Organisation.\n\nBeznosenko, said several hundred patients were in the facility during the attack but no one was killed.The invading Russian forces have struggled far more than expected against determined Ukrainian fighters, but Moscow\u2019s stronger military threatens to grind down the defending forces, despite a flow of weapons and other assistance from the West for Ukraine\u2019s westward-looking, democratically elected government.The conflict has already sent 2.5 million people fleeing the country. Thousands of soldiers on both sides are believed to have been killed along with many Ukrainian civilians.The Kremlin\u2019s forces appeared to be trying to regroup and regain momentum after encountering heavy losses and tough resistance over the past two weeks.They were blockading Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, even as efforts have been made to create new humanitarian corridors around it and other urban centres so aid can get in and residents can get out.Ukraine\u2019s emergency services reported on Saturday that the bodies of two women, a man and two children had been pulled from an apartment building struck by shelling in the city.The Russians also stepped up attacks on Mykolaiv, 290 miles south of Kyiv, in an attempt to encircle the city.In a multi-front attack on the capital, the Russians\u2019 push from the north east appeared to be advancing, a US officials said. Combat units were moved up from the rear as the forces advanced to within 20 miles of Kyiv.New commercial satellite images appeared to capture artillery firing on residential areas that stood between the Russians and the capital. The images from Maxar Technologies showed muzzle flashes and smoke from big guns, as well as impact craters and burning homes in the town of Moschun, 20 miles from Kyiv, the company said.On the economic and political front, the US and its allies moved to further isolate and sanction the Kremlin. President Joe Biden announced the US will dramatically downgrade its trade status with Russia and ban imports of Russian seafood, alcohol and diamonds.The move to revoke Russia\u2019s \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d status was taken in co-ordination with the European Union and the G7.\u201cThe free world is coming together to confront Putin,\u201d Mr Biden said.With the invasion in its 16th day, Russian President Vladimir Putin said there had been \u201ccertain positive developments\u201d in talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators, but gave no details.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared on video to encourage his people to keep fighting.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to say how many days we will still need to free our land, but it is possible to say that we will do it,\u201d he said from Kyiv.American defence officials said Russian pilots are averaging 200 sorties a day, compared with five to 10 for Ukrainian forces, which are focusing more on surface-to-air missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and drones to take out Russian aircraft.The US also said Russia has launched nearly 810 missiles into Ukraine.Until recently, Russia\u2019s troops had made their biggest advances on cities in the east and south while struggling in the north and around Kyiv. They also have started targeting areas in western Ukraine, where large numbers of refugees have fled.Russia said on Friday that it had used high-precision long-range weapons to put military air fields in the western cities of Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk \u201cout of action\u201d. The attack on Lutsk killed four Ukrainian servicemen, the mayor said.Russian air strikes also for the first time targeted Dnipro, a major industrial hub in the east and Ukraine\u2019s fourth-largest city, with about a million people. One person was killed, Ukrainian officials said.The United Nations political chief said the international organisation had received credible reports that Russian forces were using cluster bombs in populated areas.International law prohibits the use of the bombs, which scatter smaller explosives over a wide area, in cities and towns.",

Gen. Buba Marwa (rtd) to produce him before the panel to explain his role in the case of missing persons.\n\nAbba Kyari is facing prosecution in the United States for alleged involved with Ramon Abbas, commonly known as Internet fraudster, Hushpuppi, and another case in Nigeria involving drug trafficking.\n\nIn the latest battle, a Representative of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) at the panel, John Aikpokpo Martins, while presiding over the panel on behalf of the Chairman, Justice Suleiman Galadima (rtd), made the order that Abba Kyari should be presented before the panel on the 22nd of March, 2022, to explain his role\n\nMartins noted that the presence of Abba Kyari before the panel is very necessary owing to the fact a witness of the petitioner had earlier testified that Abba Kyari allegedly promised to reach out to him in respect of the missing persons, and till date nothing was heard about them.\n\nAlso the panel also ordered the new Commandant of the IGP-IRT, Tunde Disu to do the needful to ensure that Abba Kyari whom he succeeded in office is produced before the panel on the aforesaid date.\n\nThe above orders were made in respect of three persons who were allegedly arrested and detained by the IGP-IRT detention facility and till date, their whereabouts is still unknown. The trio are Yakubu Danjuma, Ibrahim Daniel and Choji Dung.\n\nThe order of the panel followed information from Panel\u2019s counsel, Halilu Adamu that Abba Kyari is in the custody of the NDLEA and Police Counsel James Idachaba told the panel that the Police can no longer produce Kyari since he is no longer in Police custody, having been suspended.\n\nIt would be recalled that the panel had on the 8th of March, 2022 ordered the office of the Inspector General of Police to unfailingly produce the aforementioned three victims before it.\n\nBefore the panel\u2019s order, a Federal High Court, FCT sitting in Gudu had ordered for the release of the mentioned persons but till date the order was not carried out.\n\nEarlier in the proceedings at the panel, lead counsel for the Police, James Idachaba informed the panel that he personally made some efforts to produce the case file in respect of the matter from the IGP-IRT Office.\n\nAccording to him he went to the Office of the Force Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and that till date, he is yet to get details of the whereabouts of the three persons in question.\n\nHe went further to say that the disbandment of IRT somehow affected their search for the three victims, adding that all the officers of the defunct IRT have been transferred to different Police Commands.\n\nHe, however, promised to do the necessary things within his powers to ensure that documents and information about the missing persons are supplied to the panel.\n\nThe families of the missing persons in a petition had alleged that their breadwinners were arrested and detained in 2019 by the Police and nothing has been heard about them till date.\n\nThe matter was adjourned to 22nd of March, 2022.",
