          "title": "Buhari\u2019s visit: Police warn troublemakers, MASSOB seeks Kanu\u2019s release",
          "text": "AS the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) visits Imo State today (Thursday), the police have warned troublemakers to stay away from the state or risk the wrath of security operatives.\n\nThis was as the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra surprisingly issued a sit-at-home order in Imo and four other southeastern states in an apparent disapproval of the President\u2019s visit.\n\nThe state Police Public Relations Officer, Mike Abattam, who spoke with The PUNCH in a telephone interview on Wednesday, specifically cautioned that its operatives and those of other sister agencies would be on the ground to deal with mischief makers during and after the President\u2019s visit.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe security arrangements are perfect; the arrangements are maximum. As usual, we prepared to secure lives and property of the people of the state. We have informed troublemakers to vacate the state because we will deal ruthlessly with anybody who disturbs the peace of the state tomorrow (today) and going forward.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, there was uncertainty over the sit-at-home declared by the Indigenous People of Biafra.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, IPOB, in declaring a sit-at-home protest in the South-East against Buhari\u2019s visit to Imo State, warned leaders and every Igbo citizen to stay away from any ceremony organised by the State Governor, Hope Uzodimma, to welcome Buhari.\n\nThe pro-Biafra group\u2019s Director of State, Chika Edoziem, announced the protest in a Radio Biafra Broadcast monitored by one of our correspondents.\n\nHe said, \u201cBuhari is not welcome to Imo on Thursday, September 9, 2021.\u201d\n\nHe said there would be \u201ctotal lockdown of Biafraland\u201d tomorrow.\n\nEdoziem warned that severe consequences would await Igbo leaders, including traditional rulers, Ohanaeze Ndigbo leaders, women and youth groups, who dared came to welcome the President during the visit.\n\nBut later, there was a statement purportedly issued by IPOB\u2019s Head of Directorate of State, Chike Edoziem, where the pro-Biafra group dismissed claims that it ordered sit-at-home in Imo and other parts of South-East.\n\nBuhari\u2019s visit to Igboland proves he is father of the nation \u2013 Ohanaeze\n\nBut the President-general of the Igbo apex socio-cultural group, Prof. George Obiozor, said President Buhari\u2019s visit to the Imo State was an indication that he remained the father of the nation.\n\nIn a statement issued on Wednesday through the National Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze, Chief Alex Ogbonnia, he (Obiozor) described a purported report in some social media credited to \u201cone Chief Chidi Ibeh, acclaimed President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo General Assembly\u201d, that the Ohanaeze Ndigbo was at odds with the planned visit of the President as wicked and unimaginable, adding that \u201cnothing can be more dishonest than this.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy this visit, the President has proven, beyond doubts, that he is the father of the nation. We are persuaded that this landmark visit to the South-East of Nigeria by Mr. President is critical and a turning point in the Igbo political history,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nS\u2019East\u2019ll profit from President\u2019s visit \u2013 Imo\n\nMeanwhile, the Imo State Government said Buhari visit to Imo State would advance the socio-economic well-being of the people of the state and the South-East at large.\n\nThe state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, who briefed journalists on Wednesday, stressed, \u201cThe visit of Mr. President will profit the people of the state and will advance the socio-economic well-being of the people, state and the entire geopolitical zone.\u201d\n\nHe further said Buhari would use the visit to inaugurate four projects in the state; Naze-Ihagwa\u2013Nekede-Obinze Road, balloon technology driven tunnel project, Egbeada Bypass and Government House ultra-modern executive council chambers.\n\nDemand Kanu\u2019s release, MASSOB tells S\u2019East leaders\n\nIn a related development, the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra charged Igbo leaders to take advantage of the President\u2019s visit to Imo to redeem themselves by demanding the release of IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu, from detention.\n\nIt said that the demand became imperative because of the inhumane treatment and torture the IPOB leader had been subjected to at the DSS \u201cdetention cage\u201d because of Ndigbo.\n\nThis was contained in a statement on Wednesday by the pro-Biafra group titled, \u2018Demand Mazi Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s release now\u2019, by its National Director of Information, Samuel Edeson.\n\nMASSOB urged the Igbo political leaders to use the Buhari\u2019s visit to revive the lost confidence and hope Ndigbo had in them by telling Buhari that Ndigbo were not being treated as citizens.\n\nI took risks by joining APC, says Okorocha\n\nSpeaking, a former governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, recalled how he took a political risk by agreeing to be part of the formation of the All Progressives Congress.\n\nOkorocha said he joined the APC at the risk of winning a re-election, stating that those who chastised him were the people enjoying the benefits of his political risk.\n\nThis was contained in a statement by his media aide, Sam Onwuemeodo, welcoming the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to the state.\n\n.Copyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Milland Dikio (retd.).\n\nThe Chairman of SCC, Nature Dumale, who said this in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, on Wednesday, described those behind the calumny campaign as merchants of violence profiting from endless crisis in the region.\n\nDumale said such individuals were angry that Dikio\u2019s visions, programmes and projects would end their crisis empire, as they were designed to entrench peace, sustainably empower ex-agitators and ensure the development of the region.\n\n\u201cEnemies of the amnesty programme want our boys to return to the creeks because many of them will not survive except there is crisis in the region. They want crisis to continue. Their children are overseas, studying in the best universities but they want us to continue to protest.\n\n\u201cWe want to let the Federal Government know that there are people in this Niger Delta region, who survive only by instigating crisis and troubles.

It would amount to no justice for a single officer to be prosecuted in an offense that was committed by a team of police officers.\n\n\u201cSecondly, we are asking that the commissioner of police, Andrew Amiengheme, visit the family and condole with them. The DPO of \u2018B\u2019 Ewet Housing has questions to answer. Kubiat aunty put a call across to him, yet he failed to act on the situation.\n\n\u201cAlso Odiko Macdon should be removed as the Public Relations Officer because the public has lost confidence in him.\n\n\u201cWhat does he want to achieve by lying against the dead? A case of a boy who struggled to graduate, only son to the parents just murdered by the police? Even this morning, he went to Comfort FM to still tell lies. I don\u2019t know how Macdon will be relating with members of the public who don\u2019t trust him.\n\n\u201cHe was talking about armed robbery that never existed. The only time when this country will be a better country will be when public officers are held accountable.\u201d\n\nHe lamented that the police officers after torturing him to death made efforts to conceal the murder adding that the call that the victim put cross to the Aunty saved the situation.\n\nAccording to him, \u201d Kubiat was able to call the aunty immediately he was arrested. If not for that call we would have been treating an issue of a missing person because after murdering him the police made efforts to conceal the murder.\n\n\u201cThey dumped him in the mortuary as an unidentified corpse and refused to tell his family. What they have in their register was Kubiat Bassey whereas the person they killed was Kubiat Isaac Akpan. But I must tell you that they knew what they were doing.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking at the press conference, Mmanti Umoh the Coordinator of Youth Alive Foundation called for discreet and open investigation into the arrest as well as series of events which followed the arrest up to his death.\n\nUmoh added that deliberate steps and reforms should be taken to tackle police violence on members of the public.\n\n\u201cWe can take steps and make reforms to combat police violence within our law enforcement by placing common sense limits on police use of force. We pray that God grants the governor wisdom, understanding and the political will to do what is right,\u201d she said.",

          "title": "FEC approves deployment of 5G network",
          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Executive Council presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the National Policy on Fifth Generation 5G Networks for Nigeria\u2019s digital economy immediate effect.\n\nMinister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Ibrahim Pantami, said the approval came following the presentation of the implementation of the National Policy to the council.\n\nBriefing State House Correspondents, the minister said the policy discusses the benefits to be attained through the deployment of 5G in Nigeria and in any part of the world which includes lower latency, larger capacity, and higher data rate.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThese are the three major benefits of fifth generation. And in a simple language, we can say it will open many opportunities economically, academically, educationally and even in health sector. And it will also support our security institutions, particularly in areas where they need high quality services. So, these are some of the benefits to be anticipated when fifth generation or 5G is deployed in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Minister explained why the deployment was delayed till now. He said: \u201cPrior to that, as you all know, in 2020, there was a time that we started working, and we started the fifth generation trials. And there was a complaint from citizens about the relationship between 5G and COVID-19. Because our government is responsible one, we put everything on hold. We engage more stakeholders.\n\n\u201cWe spend almost 18 months working on that. And we also waited for the resolution and verdict of the two most important organisations globally when it comes to the deployment of telecommunications facilities. These are firstly International Telecommunications Union (ITU), which is an arm of the United Nations, and also World Health Organisation (WHO), which is another arm of the United Nations. Both of them confirm that there is no adverse health effects of 5G and it has not been proven to be harmful to our health.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, even its frequency and radiation is even lower than that of 4G, and it is lower than the televisions and microwave we have at home. So, they have already issued that. And they explain about its safety, and also they advise nations on the regulations and the standards to be used in the course of the deployment. And this is something that Nigerian Communications Commission has been directed to ensure that all the standards, regulations are complied with.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, you will all recall that in order to create awareness and sensitise our citizens, Nigerian Communications Commission has been reaching out to citizens through local languages to tell them the advantages of 5G and where we need it. Even the deployment is in phases, we can only start with major cities in Nigeria, where there is need for very high quality broadband. So, only few places will start to benefit from it. And we do hope that the plan will come up immediately. From now to 2025, we will be able to ensure that significant towns and cities in the country will also benefit from 5G.\u201d\n\nPantami said before the presentation of the memo to council, they met with different stakeholders at least five to six stages were they made contributions and recommendations.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe were in the National Assembly for public hearing, in which stakeholders were invited. We did the trials of 5G on 29 November 2019, in Abuja. And we conducted the same trial in five other cities in the country. And this is to show to us that government has engaged citizens and at the same time allowed experts and other stakeholders to make recommendations, suggestions, and even constructive criticism, where necessary in order to ensure a successful deliberation before the deployment.\n\n\u201cAnd finally, the National Frequency Management Council, which is the statutory Council in which I happen to be the chair will release the spectrum of 5G to the Nigerian Communications Commission in bulk when the conditions of deployment are met so that the Nigerian Communications Commission on behalf of the federal government of Nigeria will release the spectrum to the mobile network operators for the deployment of 5G.\n\n\u201cWith the approval of this national policy on fifth generation, or 5G, NCC has been directed to start working immediately to come up with regulatory instrument that will ensure its safety, and many more. Our government gives more priority and preference to the health and security of our citizens as contained in the Constitution of Nigeria 1999 as amended under Section 14, Subsection 2 Article B. \u201cSo, that is why our subsidiary legislation is going to be developed to ensure that 5G will only be useful in Nigeria, and we cannot allow it to be harmful in any place.\u201dThe minister recalled that the 5G network has been deployed in the US, in the UK, in Switzerland, in Germany, and many European countries.\n\nPantami said: \u201cIt has also been developed in the Republic of Korea and China. And it has also been deployed in Africa, especially South Africa and Lesotho. And there are other countries that are also working in the same pace we have been, like Kenya, Uganda, Morocco and Egypt. All of them are just at the last stage of the deployment of 5G and I congratulate Nigerians for getting the memo approved by the Federal Executive Council. And I do hope that we will soon benefit from 5G to get high quality broadband.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Pantami, has disclosed that the nation\u2019s security agencies requested for the shut down of telecommunications activities in Zamfara to curtailed banditry activities.\n\nFielding questions from State House correspondents at the presidential villa, Abuja on Wednesday, said the measure did not originate from his ministry.\n\nHe said the federal government did not object to the request.\n\nOn whether the shut down will be extended to Katsina, Kaduna and other bandit-infested states, he said responding to such a question will jeopardized security information.\n\nPantami, however, explained that government is willing to sacrifice economic gains in the telecom sector for security benefits.\n\nHe appealed to Nigerians to show understanding to the measure and support the efforts of the security agencies.\n\nHe said: \u201cI will begin by responding to my friend, the first questioner, about shutting down telecommunications facilities in some parts of Northwest of Nigeria. Prior to responding to the question, I want to clarify to all of us that the Constitution of Nigeria, 1999, Section 14, Subsection 2, under Article B, has expounded to us that the primary responsibility of government is the security and welfare of its citizens.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding the priority of security makes the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR) to always make sure that our priority number one is security because this is what the Constitution says and any action to be taken, as long as it will support security institutions to achieve and deliver their responsibilities, government is willing to do that for them.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, security issues cannot be discussed in public like this. Most importantly, I am not in the better position to justify the shutting down of telecommunications because of security.\n\n\u201cI am aware of the shutting down, but the request is not from us. Rather, the request is from the security institutions, in which they asked for that as part of their strategy.\n\n\u201cBecause of this, government allowed them to go ahead and even that one, the reason for doing that I may be aware of some, but I\u2019m sorry to say it\u2019s not for public discussion.\n\n\u201cWhat I only plead with all of us, as lay men, we shall try to give our security institutions the support they need in order to deliver on their mandate.\n\n\u201cSecurity issues today are not only for the security institutions alone, but there is a role that each and every citizen can play in order to make their work more successful.\n\n\u201cSo, I plead with the media to support our security institutions and let us give them the benefit of doubt; when they come up with a strategy, let us not unnecessarily criticise it, except we allow them to begin and see.\n\n\u201cParticularly, they could have information at their disposal that you and I do not have and if you lack information, you will not be able to do justice in your deliberation. It is only when there is sufficient information at your disposal, then you can argue. But if you don\u2019t have it, even if you partake in any debate, you will finally discover that you have made a very wrong decision. So, it is because of this.\n\n\u201cThis is originally a request from Zamfara State government, in which they have requested the federal government to support them and Mr. President, as we always know that his priority is security and he always listens to complaints and new strategies on how to handle. So, he is very much aware.\n\n\u201cIt is a trial. Let us support them and based on the information we have been reading and hearing through the media that tremendous successes have been recorded so far.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to support them to make sure that our country is secured and this is going to be good for all of us.\n\nAsked whether any compensation package would be made available to service providers who would lose money as a result of the shutdown, Pantami responded: \u201cSecondly, on the issue of shutting down the telecommunications facilities, as I said yesterday during an event in which some of your colleagues were there, that in the Digital Economy sector, we agreed that we can compromise the economic benefit of the sector, as long as that compromise will bring an end to insecurity.\n\n\u201cInvestors in the sector invested because of profit, but they understand the priority of our government, then when security and economic benefits are going to be attained simultaneously, then definitely, we are going to pursue both of them.\n\n\u201cBut if only one can be attained by compromising the other one, we agree to compromise the economy benefit of our sector, in order to support security institutions to deliver their mandate, because as long as there is no security, even the economy will not thrive.\n\n\u201cSo, because of this we agreed, we came up with so many policies. Those policies can reduce the growth of our sector, we know, but we know they will support security of the country.\u201d\n\nIn his remark at the briefing, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu announced that FEC also approved the National Policy of Food and Nutrition.\n\nHe also said FEC also approved the consultancy for the design and construction of the second runway of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja for N500 million.\n\nGarba explained: \u201cThe council today ratified, approved the policy on food and nutrition for the country and following the approval, which is forming the basis of a national multi-sectoral plan for action for food and nutrition.\n\n\u201cThere will be, going forward, a budget line for food and nutrition in all MDAs and hopefully in the three tiers of government in the country.\n\n\u201cAnother approval is for the Attorney General to proceed with the process of ratifying promotional framework for Occupational Safety and Health convention.\n\n\u201cThis is about promoting preventive health, preventive safety and health care in workplaces in the country.\n\n\u201cSo, the government of Nigeria has begun the process of ratifying domesticating and applying this major resolution decision by the International Labour Organization which was passed in 2006.\n\n\u201cNigeria of course, had voted and supported it. So, we are now going to ratify that.\n\n\u201cOne other thing that also you need to know which minister is not here is the approval for a N1.2 billion Naira contract for the emergency rehabilitation of the Nasarawa Water Supply Scheme.\n\n\u201cFloods in the year 2000 had destroyed Nasarawa township, destroyed the waterworks and as a result, pipe borne water is unavailable to the communities. And the whole water intake has been destroyed.

We can believe him,\u201d Uyilawa said when he featured on a television program monitored in Lagos, yesterday.\n\nThe strike which began on August 2 has grounded the nation\u2019s health sector even as the Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU) and the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) had threatened to join in solidarity\n\nHowever, labour lawyer, Rosemary Danesi, has admonished government not to allow the strike to linger.\n\n\u201cWhen we have an agreement, we should strive to respect it. Both parties sticking to their extreme positions will not help, they should make haste and resolve things. Human lives are involved here. I don\u2019t support Federal Government sacking the minister of labour as NARD has demanded, but we should do the right thing.\n\n\u201cIf the government is owing them, they should pay. I think most of our politicians do not use our health facilities; maybe that is why they are not bothered, but the lives of the masses is at stake. Government should honor the agreement reached with labor Unions,\u201d she implored.\n\nJOESU President, Biobelemoye Josiah, has blamed the Federal Government for the industrial action, claiming it had always reneged on agreements.\n\n\u201cWe are patient dogs, a caregiver should be cared for. You can\u2019t give what you don\u2019t have. We expect the Federal Government to respect agreement we reached. We had an agreement on 30th September 2017, that agreement was supposed to be implemented within five weeks but it was not.\n\n\u201cGovernment failed to honour agreements because they feel they have a red card as a bad referee. We\u2019re not deterred by the \u2018No work no pay\u2019 threat.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen the insensitivity and unwillingness to the right thing on the part of government is becoming unbecoming, what else do the masses expect JOHESU to do? Let Nigerians ask the minister of health and minister of labour in particular questions and hold them accountable.\u201d\n\nJOHESU had on August 2, issued a 15-day ultimatum to the Federal Government, threatening to embark on an industrial action if its demands were not meant.\n\nThis came barely a week after the NMA and its affiliates also handed down a 21-day ultimatum to declare an industrial action if government failed to resolve all issues contained in the various agreements signed with the doctors.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

ECOWAS said on Tuesday it was concerned transitional authorities there had not made sufficient progress toward organising elections next February as promised.\n\nPRISONER RELEASES\n\nGuinea\u2019s coup leader, Mamady Doumbouya, a former French legionnaire, has pledged to install a unified, transitional government but has not said when or how that will happen.\n\nIn an apparent gesture to Conde\u2019s civilian opponents, at least 80 political prisoners detained by the president were released on Tuesday evening, many of whom had campaigned against his constitutional change.\n\nDoumbouya also met the heads of Guinea\u2019s various military branches for the first time on Tuesday, hoping to unify the country\u2019s armed forces under the junta\u2019s command.\n\nGuinea\u2019s main opposition leader, Cellou Dalein Diallo, who finished runner-up to Conde in three successive elections, told Reuters on Tuesday he would be open to participating in a transition back to constitutional governance.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday evening, Conde\u2019s party said it \u201cnoted the advent of new authorities at the head of the country\u201d and called for the president\u2019s swift and unconditional release.\n\nSince the putsch, life in the streets of Conakry appears to have returned to normal, with some military checkpoints removed.\n\nFears that the power struggle could hinder Guinea\u2019s production of bauxite, a mineral used to make aluminium, have begun to ease. The country\u2019s largest foreign operators say they have continued to operate without interruption.\n\nAluminium hit a fresh 10-year high on Monday after news broke of unrest in Guinea, which holds the world\u2019s largest bauxite reserves.

          "text": "The Department of State Services (DSS) has told the Federal High Court, Abuja that some criminal elements, \u2018one chance\u2019, have stolen its case file.\n\nThe DSS said the case file contained the fundamental rights enforcement suit filed by the 12 associates of Yoruba nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo (aka) Sunday Igboho.\n\nWhen the matter was called on Wednesday, the counsel to DSS, Mr Idowu Awo, said the file, which contained the court processes served on the DSS by the aides, was stolen from a member of the service legal team.\n\nAwo said the \u2018one-chance\u2019 thieves snatched the case file from his colleague, who unknowingly boarded their vehicle.\n\nThe 12 associates of Igboho instituted the rights enforcement suit against the DSS for parading them in the media as common criminals.\n\nIn the suit, the aides are seeking a declaration of court that their detention beyond 48 hours and their media parade without a court conviction constituted a breach on their fundamental rights.\n\nThey are also seeking an order of perpetual injunction restraining the DSS from interfering with their personal liberty and freedom of expression.\n\nThe associates also prayed the court to order the DSS to pay them N100 million for aggravated and exemplary damages, for what they described as a serial breach of their constitutional rights.\n\nThe counsel to the 12, Mr Timilehin Odunwo, told newsmen that his clients were also asking for an order restraining the DSS from any further harassment.\n\nThe judge, Justice Obiora Egwuatu, however, ruled that the case file be returned to the registry for reassignment to a regular court.\n\nEgwuatu said since the court\u2019s annual vacation was almost over, he would not have time to hear and determine the matter as a vacation judge.\n\nOperatives of the DSS had on July 1 raided Igboho\u2019s residence in Ibadan, Oyo State and arrested 12 of his supporters.\n\nThey were subsequently moved to the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) where they were detained.\n\nSubsequently, the detainees, through their lawyer, Mr Pelumi Olajengbesi, filed an application asking the court to inquire into the circumstances constituting the grounds of their arrest and detention since July 2.\n\nOlajengbesi further asked the court that where it deemed fit, his clients should be admitted to bail.\n\nRuling on the application on August 4, Justice Egwuatu admitted all the applicants to bail.

          "text": "Within four years, Wave has gone from a spinoff from Asia and Africa-focused cheap remittance company, Sendwave, to a mobile money service provider worth $1.7 billion; the latest unicorn startup in Africa and the first in the French-speaking region.\n\nThe billion-dollar valuation comes after it raised $200 million in a Series A round led by payments giant Stripe; Sequoia Heritage, a private investment fund and unit of Sequoia; Founders Fund; and Ribbit Capital, with participation from other existing investors.\n\nNo other startup operating in Africa has raised as much in a Series A. OPay\u2019s recent $400 million raise is the region\u2019s largest venture round, followed by Interswitch\u2019s $200 million investment from Visa and Flutterwave\u2019s $170 million fundraise. All were Series C rounds.\n\nTaking on incumbents\n\nSenegal is one of Africa\u2019s fastest-growing mobile money markets, according to a 2020 GSMA report.\n\nIn 2015, the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), the common central bank of eight French-speaking countries in the region (including Senegal), allowed nonbanks to operate mobile money in its member states. Mobile money adoption has expanded since then, driven by early telecom entrants that had the requisite infrastructure and user base (mobile networks and subscribers) to establish the service.\n\nOrange is Senegal\u2019s largest mobile operator and controls around 50% of the telecom market share with nearly 8 million mobile users, twice as many as runner-up Free, which has 4.4 million subscribers. Expresso Telecom, a unit of the UAE\u2019s Expresso Telecom Group Limited, holds 22% of the market share, with over 3 million subscribers.\n\nAll three telecom firms provide mobile money services under the Orange Money, Free Money, and E-Money brands respectively, and along with banks, dominate the digital financial services space. Other third-party providers like fintech have had to make do with small market shares while competing with incumbents.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut Wave, a product created by two Americans (Drew Durbin and Lincoln Quirk) to lower the cost of mobile money transactions, piloted in 2016 and officially launched in Senegal a year later, entered the market with a 70% cheaper service.\n\nWave offers free deposits and withdrawals via its mobile application and applies a fixed transaction fee of just 1% for money transfers between individuals. Unlike its competitors, Wave passes additional fees on bill payments from users on to businesses. For users without a smartphone, it provides a free QR-card to transact with agents, who are able to open accounts, receive deposits, and execute withdrawals.\n\nAccording to co-founder Drew Durbin, Wave is building a mobile money service that is \u201cradically affordable\u201d. The startup has had to build its own infrastructure, including agent and consumer applications, an agent network, and QR cards in order to provide its super cheap service.\n\nWave\u2019s co-founders, Drew Durbin (left) and Lincoln Quirk.\n\nThe startup\u2019s low-cost transaction service has helped it take on incumbents, eat into their market share, and turn the entire mobile money industry on its head.\n\nWave\u2019s strategy has managed to shake Orange in particular. To match the ultra-competitive offer that the startup has operated with since May 2020, the telecoms company was forced to lower its prices as well, bringing down bill payment fees to 1% from June 1.\n\nPressure on the network operator also saw it stop users in Senegal from purchasing Orange airtime via Wave\u2019s mobile application, a move that\u2019s been described as anti-competitive by the fintech company and resulted in a dispute currently in the hands of the country\u2019s telecoms regulator.\n\nWave\u2019s branch in Dakar \u2013 which is led by IT veteran Coura S\u00e8ne \u2013 claims to be the largest mobile money player in Senegal with over half of the country\u2019s adults, between four and five million people, making up its several million monthly active users. The Wave app has more than 5 million downloads on Google PlayStore. As reported by TechCrunch, the startup processes billions of dollars in annual volume and has partnerships with UBA and Ecobank for its Senegal operations.\n\nHaving previously raised just $13.8 million since its creation, Wave was able to attract the landmark Series A funding from investors to expand its disruptive business model, which has seen it become one of the most-used mobile money services in Senegal and achieved unicorn status \u2013 startups valued at or above $1 billion \u2013 as a fintech in Africa.\n\nOther African unicorns include fintech startups OPay, Flutterwave, Interswitch, Fawry as well as e-commerce giant Jumia.\n\nWith the fresh investment, Wave plans to deepen its presence in Senegal and Ivory Coast, a country it expanded into recently and is currently running communication campaigns to raise awareness. The startup also intends to grow its 800-man team across product, engineering, and business, as well as expand into other markets it considers regulatory-friendly, like Uganda and Mali.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "With Awabah, Tunji Andrews wants to make pensions as popular as banking",
          "text": "Between November and December 2020, Tunji Andrews co-piloted a project to help informal workers save for the future. Those efforts culminated in the January rollout of Awabah, a digital platform that provides micro pension access to self-employed Nigerians and informal workers.\n\n\u201cMany people in Nigeria and Africa do day-to-day financial transactions in markets but don\u2019t have access to the benefits that the formal financial system offers,\u201d Andrews told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cSo when I wanted to get into the fintech space, it had to be something that would drive financial inclusion on a very strong basis.\u201d\n\nA flexible, \u20a6500 plan\n\nCo-founded with Tina Ajishebiyawo and Gboyega Olatunde, Awabah Nigeria automates micro-pensions and target-savings for self-employed Nigerians and workers in the informal economy. An understanding of the unique characteristics of its target market has been key to Awabah\u2019s operations and ensuring last-mile delivery.\n\nLower-income members of the informal economy can be difficult to capture and most engage in local cooperatives and market associations. Awabah has leaned heavily on town hall meetings to reach these people in large numbers, introducing its product via group presentations and one-on-one sessions.\n\nAfter onboarding them, the company uses either its web platform or a network of local banking agents to continue taking collections from, educating, and further engaging with contributors.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIncome levels vary in the informal sector. Thus, Andrews explains that contributors with as little as \u20a6500 can start a micro-pensions account. Subsequent amounts contributed are based on an individual\u2019s capacity.\n\nContributions are also flexible. Taking into account the irregular cash flow of informal workers, they can be made daily, weekly, monthly, or even quarterly, similar to local savings groups (popularly known as Ajo or Esusu).\n\nDue to the constant need for cash flow in the informal sector, users have the option of withdrawing up to 40% of their savings at any point after the initial 3 months of contributions. Whenever someone deposits \u20a61,000, for instance, \u20a6600 is locked in the retirement account while the rest goes into the customer\u2019s mobile wallet as contingent savings.\n\n\u201cThey always come and ask for their 40% after the first three months as a way of testing the product, and we make sure that they get it as quickly as possible,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cOnce they get their money back and see alerts every time they put in their \u20a6500, they\u2019re able to test the system.\u201d\n\nAwabah has achieved impressive results within months of operation, having onboarded more than 5,000 customers so far. It makes money primarily by earning a commission on every contribution made.\n\nAwabah Nigeria Co-founder, Tunji Andrews.\n\nExtending pensions to the informal economy\n\nIn Nigeria, a good number of elderly parents are financially dependent on their children \u2013 partly because societal norms deem it necessary for children to care for aging parents; and also because there is an evident lack of working systems for retirement savings.\n\nEven where pension schemes are available, they often only cover people who are formally employed. Nigeria has a large informal workforce and about 88% of the entire labour force without pensions is from the informal economy. The result? A large group of citizens becomes financially vulnerable as they get older.\n\nWorse still is that relatively young Nigerians currently dominate the labour force and the lack of retirement savings means they are susceptible to living below the poverty line in their old age.\n\nNigeria\u2019s National Pension Commission (PenCom) has a target of growing the country\u2019s pension coverage to 30% of the entire labour force \u2013 formal and informal \u2013 by 2024. As of the first quarter of this year, the figure stood at 12%.\n\nA provision in the Pension Reform Act of 2014 ushered in a new micro-pension plan, effectively opening the door for the informal economy to participate in the national Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS). Awabah\u2019s operation is backed by this provision.\n\nThe micro pension scheme was formally introduced in 2019 but is yet to gain traction. Thus, Andrews has made it his and Awabah\u2019s mission to make the services available to those in the informal sector and whose employers are not legally required to deduct and remit pension.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard about the new micro pension scheme two years ago, I was excited as I had been thinking about pensions. But there weren\u2019t a lot of conversations and awareness about it. So for me, it was a no-brainer,\u201d he said.\n\nExpanding Awabah\n\nAwabah is less than a year old and has had to deal with manpower and logistics challenges. Still, Andrews has big ambitions.\n\nGoing forward, the startup plans to leverage the penetration of mobile phones in Nigeria to reach even a wider audience, starting with the planned launch of a USSD option.\n\nThrough a shortcode, existing and potential customers will be able to learn about and sign up to Awabah, as well as get financial literacy lessons in local languages. For those who have smartphones, Awabah will engage them via WhatsApp.\n\nThe Awabah team.\n\nThe startup raised $200,000 from early-stage angel investors ODBA and Co Ventures and Correlation Capital in July, which helped it expand into Ibadan. Awabah also recently gained acceptance into the Techstars London accelerator programme, where it will get some funding.\n\nAndrews reveals that a new fundraising round is in the works, which will help fund a larger expansion. Over the next few months, the startup has plans to enter into five more Nigerian cities. It is also mulling an expansion into Ghana.\n\n\u201cThe bigger goal is to create a larger awareness of micro pensions in Africa,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cWe want pensions to be popular as banking and insurance are.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Awabah has partnerships with three Pension Fund Administrators, including Leadway Pensure, which holds the PenCom license under which it operates; a microfinance bank via which it provides mobile wallets; as well as two agent banking networks.\n\nAndrews aims to expand the list of partner organisations and, in the long term, plans to push conversations with Nigeria\u2019s pensions regulator on the possibility of issuing micro pension licenses for small players like Awabah.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, we have a one-size-fits-all pension license, unlike Ghana where there\u2019s a three-tier system,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cThe lack of micro pension licenses can be a drawback as we believe we are best positioned to drive the product. But it\u2019s still very early days.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmeka was eight years old when he dropped out of primary school. He couldn\u2019t read and write at the time, and his environment was not conducive for learning.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in primary school, I used to think I wasn\u2019t cut out for school. And the fact that I was living in the village didn\u2019t help matters. My classmates would tease me, which would discourage and make me sad,\u201d he recounts.\n\nAccording to African Library Project (ALP), a non-profit organisation that builds libraries in rural Africa, 22% (30 million) of Africa\u2019s primary-aged children were not enrolled in school in 2019.\n\nThe ALP also says that 48 million youth aged 15 to 24 are illiterate, while more than 1 in 3 adults cannot read. This translates to 182 million adults who are unable to read and write.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer Statista, 66.8% of Africans aged 15 and above could read, write, and understand a simple statement in 2019. With an 80% literacy rate, Southern Africa ranked highest, with Northern, Eastern, and Central Africa recording rates above 70%. In West Africa, however, only 51% of adults could read or write.\n\nEmeka believed he wasn\u2019t cut out for school because he could neither read nor write. Something which could easily have been attributed to dyslexia, a learning disability.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that a developmental delay, such as a literacy delay, is not the same as a developmental disability.\n\nDistinguishing development delays from developmental disabilities\n\nA developmental delay simply means that a child is behind on some developmental milestones; it does not indicate a specific health problem.\n\nDevelopmental delays can occur in cognition, communication, behaviour, socialisation or emotional functioning, and motor abilities. That children have any of these delays doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t match their peers.\n\nTherefore, according to Healthline \u2014 an American website that provides medical information and health advice \u2014 early intervention and treatment can help a child achieve normal development as they mature. A delay indicates that the child\u2019s learning problems will be corrected if given enough time.\n\nA developmental disability, on the other hand, is a neurological disorder with long-term outcomes. And the World Health Organization (WHO) states that most disabilities have three dimensions: impairment, activity limitation, and participation limits.\n\nWhen there\u2019s an overlap\n\nStudies have shown that determining whether a child has a developmental delay or a disability can be difficult because a delay can be an early sign of a learning disability, which is not the same as a physical disability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, most professionals can\u2019t detect learning disabilities until a child is old enough to show deficits in courses like math, reading, and spelling.\n\nDespite Emeka\u2019s literacy delay, he could have improved significantly in a better school environment, with supportive parents and early intervention using tech tools. But he only began to make some progress when he was 20 years old after he arrived in Lagos State.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t start to learn how to read and write until I came to Lagos about four years ago. You know, I was surprised to see children as young as seven read and write. That prompted me to buy a smartphone,\u201d he recalls.\n\nWhen mobile phones play a part in literacy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Borgen Project, an organisation in the United States focused on improving poverty through online and community presence, reported that mobile phones help thousands of people in developing countries learn to read.\n\nFor emphasis, a different study by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) reveals that hundreds of thousands of Africans use mobile technology for texting.\n\nAccording to a World Bank report, illiteracy in Africa is caused in part by a lack of books. It states that this situation is amplified by Africa\u2019s rapidly growing student population, resulting in textbook-to-pupil ratios of 1:11 for reading and 1:13 for arithmetic in some countries.\n\nHowever, mobile phones can help solve this problem. Before the widespread use of mobile phone technology, Africa\u2019s adult literacy rate (pdf) stood at 52%; by 2008, the literacy rate had risen to 63%.\n\nWith a smartphone, Emeka\u2019s ability to read and write improved while using Google Voice, Google Translate, and Predictive Text before he could start writing and reading. It also helped that he had supportive friends.\n\nBesides the tools Emeka used, there are many options to choose from.\n\nThree tech tools to improve literacy\n\n1. Read Along\n\nFormerly Bolo, Read Along is a free Google-developed language-learning app for children launched on March 7, 2019, to help children have fun while learning to read.\n\nRead Along includes an in-app reading companion that coaches children by listening to them while they read aloud, offering assistance when they get stuck, and awarding stars when they succeed.\n\nIt works best for children who already have a basic understanding of the English alphabet.\n\n2. Rewordify\n\nCreated by Illinois-based high school special education teacher, Neil Goldman, Rewordify allows you to copy and paste any text. It also replaces difficult words with simpler ones.\n\nDepending on the settings, those simplified words can replace the original ones, be seen with a mouse click, or displayed next to the difficult words. It appears to be very sophisticated, and the precision of the simplified word choices is exceptional. Unlike some other websites, Rewordify does not just display word definitions.\n\nFurthermore, teachers can use the site to create various learning activities based on the text that students can complete.\n\n3. Newsela\n\nNewsela is an Instructional Content Platform that brings together engaging, accessible content with integrated assessments and insights to supercharge reading engagement and learning in every subject. Content on Newsela covers topics students care about that connect to the core curriculum and align with standards.\n\nThis app and website, designed for pupils just learning to read and write, does a great job of combining how to read and write engagingly. Letter sounds are taught in small groups and include audio and physical cues for learning \u2014 students will hear the sounds and trace the letters with their fingers or a stylus.\n\nIt includes a spelling game and sends weekly update emails to parents and teachers.\n\nThese and other tech tools have revealed the importance of technology on literacy as these tools are available to everyone, regardless of age.\n\nLiteracy is crucial in social and economic development. It expands knowledge, and a literate person is more likely to understand and adjust to society. Increased literacy in youth and adults has the power to change Africa.\n\nTherefore, access to technology, the Internet, mobile phones, and tech tools are critical to closing the gap between increased illiteracy rates and the challenges in the way.",

          "text": "\u201cI came up with the Akiddie idea because I felt my niece deserved better, more representative stories, and that idea still drives what we do today, only that it\u2019s no longer for just my niece, it\u2019s for every child around the world and their right to having content that affirms them.\u201d \u2014 Dominic Onyekachi, CEO of Nigerian media startup, Akiddie.\n\nThe last time we covered Akiddie, we detailed how the startup was creating the most extensive collection of African children\u2019s stories, to give children powerful and culturally relevant stories. In the past year, the startup has been scaling to cater to minority kids across the globe.\n\nUntil recently, most children\u2019s literature from popular culture has mainly featured Western civilisations, and there was a distinct lack of diversity. These authors even proffer that children\u2019s literature had mostly featured white males as the main attraction.\n\nOnyekachi discovered the true extent of this when he visited his niece.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDominic Onyekachi (Co-founder and CEO, Akiddie). Source: Supplied\n\n\u201cNot only were the stories there white and foreign, which I felt wasn\u2019t representative of her, but the themes were also outdated and probably outright sexist. For example, they emphasised marriage as the ultimate achievement for women.\u201d He told Techpoint Africa in 2020.\n\nAs Onyekachi would later discover, this problem was not unique to his niece or even Africans.\n\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison Cooperative Children\u2019s Book Center (CCBC) reveals that compared to 2019, books written by authors of colour increased by 3% from 25.9% to 26.8% in 2020.\n\nHowever, the CCBC reveals that children\u2019s books about racially diverse characters increased by just 1% to 30% in 2020.\n\nA 2019 survey in the UK also reveals that just 10% of children\u2019s literature published that year had a minority character. Though the survey\u2019s methodology did not paint a complete picture, it, at least, showed that despite recent improvements, there\u2019s still much room for growth.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource; Supplied\n\nIn Donna Norton\u2019s 2010 book, Through the Eyes of a Child: An Introduction to Children\u2019s Literature, she argues that children\u2019s literature helps them appreciate their and other people\u2019s cultural heritage and helps them develop emotional intelligence and creativity.\n\nThe predominant feature of Western stories and the relative dearth of minority stories has made the result somewhat lopsided.\n\nLily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, President of America\u2019s National Education Association (NEA), believes that \u201cdiverse literature helps children see themselves as the hero of the story.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn August 2020, just one month after an interview with Techpoint Africa, Akiddie got featured on CNN, and what followed caused him to rethink the company\u2019s business model.\n\n\u201cWe got a lot of emails after our CNN feature asking for us to replicate the model we created for African children for other minorities. On further research, we discovered that the main reason why there wasn\u2019t a lot of minority children\u2019s content was that it was difficult to monetise,\u201d he says.\n\nAfter running through the numerous possibilities, Onyekachi realised that pivoting was a no-brainer.\n\nFrom library to creator platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Moonseeker, by Nigerian actor, fashion consultant and on-air multimedia personality, Denola Grey. Source: Supplied\n\nOnyekachi reveals that instead of collecting children\u2019s stories and maintaining a subscription library, Akiddie is currently a digital content marketplace that allows creators to upload and sell their children\u2019s content either one-off or get them to subscribe to their channel on Akiddie.\n\n\u201cWe now offer content in text, audio, and video formats. They range from audiovisual learning aids covering the entire primary school curriculum to videos that teach etiquette and DIY skills to entertaining stories.\n\n\u201cI came up with this idea because I felt my niece deserved better, more representative stories, and that idea still drives what we do today, only that it\u2019s no longer for just my niece, it\u2019s for every child around the world and their right to having content that affirms them,\u201d he says.\n\nBesides minority children, Onyekachi believes this new model will cater favourably to minority content creators across the globe.\n\nHe argues that aggregating platforms like YouTube Kids pay on ad revenue. To earn a significant amount of money, the content has to appeal to the mainstream/majority of people. For him, representative content from minorities can\u2019t scale because they can\u2019t get the numbers that mainstream content gets.\n\n\u201cFor instance, a story about the Three Little Pigs on YouTube can garner millions of views because it appeals to their majority audience, while a story about Sango or an African folktale would struggle to crack a million views.\u201d\n\nWhile Onyekachi\u2019s assertion seems to be true, with the right backing, there have been a few exceptions in popular culture.\n\nPixar\u2019s 2017 animated movie, Coco, celebrated D\u00eda de los Muertos (the Day of the Dead), a holiday marked widely by Mexicans worldwide in honour of departed loved ones. Interestingly, it grossed $57.8 million in Mexico, and $807 million worldwide, topping China\u2019s and the US\u2019 box office for three straight weeks.\n\nWhile a great deal of research went into Coco\u2019s story, very few minority content creators have the backing of an uber studio like Pixar, and a content marketplace like Akiddie\u2019s might help them reach interested global audiences.\n\nOnyekachi believes that the average minority community anywhere globally has a strong cultural affinity and that parents would pay a premium for content that affirms their culture/religion.\n\nHe states that since the average minority content creator will not get an audience of 10 million on YouTube, Akiddie is helping them sell directly to their community.\n\nUnofficial reports from 2002 claimed that 15 million Nigerians lived in the diaspora, but the country\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs (now Ministry of Interior) put that number at 20 million.\n\nInterestingly, the Lebanese government has stated that there are more Lebanese in the diaspora (15.4 million as of 2018) than in Lebanon (6 million).\n\nFor Onyekachi, Akiddie will aggregate these fragmented communities across the globe, making a huge market share for the creator. The platform also makes it easier to monetise.\n\n\u201cFor example, the average income from one million views on YouTube is about $4,000 (can be a lot higher depending on the creator). A minority creator would struggle to crack one million views on YouTube selling to his community. Still, he can make $4,000 on Akiddie if he/she can convince 1,000 members of his community to buy a $5.30 content or pay a $5.30 subscription to access his/her channel on Akiddie.\u201d\n\nHowever, aggregating communities from ethnically diverse countries like Nigeria with 371 tribes might not be so straightforward. For instance, will an Urhobo family be interested in content from a Tiv creator or vice versa?\n\nAkiddie currently supports payouts to creators in the USA, Canada, UK, France, India, Australia, and Nigeria, and the CEO says monetisation can start in six hours. The company also states that it processes payments worldwide and produces its top-of-the-line content.\n\n\u201cWe also allow for creators to collaborate on a project and share payouts based on pre-agreed ratios. We are currently the only platform that supports content distribution in text, audio, and video,\u201d Onyekachi states proudly.\n\nThe company takes 25% of all revenue generated from the content on the platform to cover creator processing fees, payment processing fees, and content hosting and distribution.\n\nThe company already boasts creators like Yodabox (entire primary school curriculum as video lectures), Bino and Fino (Nigeria\u2019s biggest YouTube animation show), and D\u00e9nola Grey, a fashion consultant, actor, writer, and on-air multimedia personality.\n\nTo learn more about how to become a content creator on Akiddie, click here.\n\nWhat happens from here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnyeckachi is optimistic that Akiddie\u2019s opportunities following this pivot are enormous.\n\n\u201cThis route means Akiddie can also be a vital learning aide, as demonstrated by the fact that you can currently subscribe to Yodabox on Akiddie and have access to all primary school subjects and topics in the form of richly animated videos.\u201d\n\nHe also believes it helps the team come up with innovative monetisation strategies.\n\n\u201cFrom a storefront that allows instant merchandising to a platform that crowdfunds creators in return for a share in their revenues when they start monetising on Akiddie to a content marketplace that allows you to buy the entire rights to content,\u201d he muses excitedly.\n\nWhile Akiddie wants to back minority creators, stellar outings like Coco, and Moana (which features Pacific Islanders), and Disney\u2019s recent partnership with Kugali media to animate Iwaju, show there are opportunities for content creators to go mainstream with relatable minority characters.\n\nWithout revealing too many details, Onyekachi says the company is working on strategic partnerships to make this happen.",

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest , a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nAfrica\u2019s Blockchain Bitmama\n\nWave\u2019s $1.7b valuation\n\nVahlid combating online scam\n\nMeet Africa\u2019s Blockchain Bitmama, Ruth Iselema\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRuth Iselema, Founder of Bitmama\n\nIt is often said that challenges can be opportunities in disguise. Clich\u00e9s like these resonate more when people live them out. And Ruth Iselema, Founder of Bitmama, a crypto exchange platform, lived it out.\n\nI mean, how does a trained pharmacist enthusiastic about computers and entrepreneurship delve into the Blockchain space, get scammed of \u20a6250,000 while trading Bitcoin, and then build a prominent crypto exchange platform some years later?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaking bold moves. With the backing of supportive parents and having interacted with Blockchain communities on WhatsApp and Telegram, Iselema was convinced about her idea. And in 2018, she left the city of Port Harcourt for Lagos to be in the spaces where Blockchain was gaining ground.\n\nOur Chief Servant, M\u00fay\u00ecw\u00e1, had a sit-down with her, and she talked about everything, from the struggles of building a business to hiring, scaling, and much more.\n\nRead the article here or watch the video here.\n\nSenegal-based, fintech, Wave, becomes a Unicorn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWave Senegal. Source: TechCrunch\n\nWhat happened? Well, the Unicorn wave didn\u2019t bypass the Francophone African region. US-founded, Senegal-based mobile money provider, Wave, raised $200 million in its just-concluded Series A round bringing its current valuation to $1.7 billion and making it Francophone Africa\u2019s first Unicorn.\n\nThis round \u2014 which saw participation from previous investors, Partech Africa and Sam Altman, Y Combinator\u2019s ex-CEO \u2014 was led by Sequoia Heritage, Founders Fund, early-stage VC firm, Ribbit Capital, and global fintech platform, Stripe.\n\nSome background gist. Founded as Sendwave in 2014 by two Americans, Drew Durbin and Lincoln Quirk, the mobile money provider, Wave, kicked off operations as a medium for making payments from Europe and North America to African and Asian countries. In 2020, Sendwave was acquired by global fintech giant, WorldRemit, for ~$500 million, cash and stock inclusive.\n\nA tug of mobile money war. For Durbin and Quirk, the mission had always been to lower the cost of mobile money transactions in Africa, and Wave, which was already in the works while they ran Sendwave, launched in Senegal in 2018. Following Sendwave\u2019s acquisition, the duo fully focused on the mobile money provider.\n\nThey broke into the market, charging a 1% fee for deposits and transfers and instant refunds in cases of problems with transfers. In June 2021, Orange, a leading telecom and mobile money provider in Senegal, responded to the competition by blocking the purchase of Orange phone credits on Wave. Currently, the dispute has been taken up by Senegal\u2019s telecom regulator.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresent in two African countries, Wave boasts of a user base nearing 5 million in Senegal, and it plans to mirror this growth in Ivory Coast, where it put down its roots in April 2021.\n\nFun fact. This Series A makes Wave Africa\u2019s sixth Unicorn, sharing the pedestal with Jumia, Fawtry, OPay, Flutterwave, and Interswitch.\n\nVahlid is looking to combat scams in the online retail marketplaces\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVahlid\u2019s Adedayo Gbede (CEO) and Olusola Agbele (COO)\n\nIf we called for people to come forward and recount their bad experiences shopping online, we\u2019d run out of time to hear all the sad tales buyers and sellers would narrate.\n\nMarketplace heartache. The problem of online scams and fraud in the eCommerce marketplace is a global malady, and a Juniper research report reveals that it is projected to cost online retailers across the world a whopping $20 billion in 2021 alone. This problem is what Vahlid, a Nigerian escrow service startup, is looking to solve.\n\nWhat they do.

We have to build institutions to build human capacity to explore and exploit our national resources.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThat is why we carefully selected the people who will now select those to run the institutions for us. I pray that our people now realize that there are certain things that we don\u2019t play politics with.

          "text": "The Conference of 57 Local Governments and Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs) in Lagos State has requested an equal sharing formula with the state in the proposed Value Added Tax (VAT) bill now before the state House of Assembly.\n\nThe Secretary of the Conference 57 and Chairman of Odi-Olowo/Ojuwoye LCDA, Abdulrasak Ajala, made the request at a one-day public hearing on the bill organised by the Lagos Assembly on Wednesday.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the title of the bill is \u201cA Bill for a Law to impose and charge Value Added Tax (VAT) on certain foods and services, provided for the administration of the tax and for related matters.\u201d\n\nMr Ajala explained that for the councils to pursue meaningful development, they required a better sharing formula for its members in the proposed VAT law.\n\nThe conference 57 secretary said they were requesting for a 50-50 sharing formula, contrary to the 75-25 proposed in the bill in favour of the state government.\n\nBeing the closest to the grassroots, Mr Ajala explained that the councils, who also host the companies, should benefit from a better share than the 25 per cent in the bill.\n\nThe council chairman commended the 9th Assembly for the bill, as well as the synergy between the Executive and the Legislature.\n\n\u201cOn the distribution of revenue, you will agree with me, Value Added Tax is on consumption and production, and all these economic activities are domiciled in our respective communities.\n\n\u201cIn addition, local governments, being the closest to the grassroots, need more revenues given the enormity of the responsibilities the Constitution confers on us.\n\n\u201cHence, the 25 per cent in the bill is grossly inadequate for local governments to execute all the promises we made to our people; and of course all our electoral promises.\n\n\u201cThis is the reason we are making a passionate appeal, on behalf of Conference 57, that we should raise the bar higher, from 25 per cent to 50 per cent,\u201d Mr Ajala said.\n\nContributing, Michael Ade, representing the Lagos Tax Justice and Governance, commended the Lagos Assembly and the state government for having the political will at a time like this.\n\nAlso commenting, the state\u2019s Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Moyosere Onigbanjo (SAN), declared that the judgment on the VAT law was not valid only in Rivers State, but any state in the country stood to benefit from the judgment.\n\nMr Onigbanjo noted that the National Assembly does not have powers on VAT, which was what brought them to where they are today.\n\nEarlier, the Chairman, House Committee on Finance, Rotimi Olowo, insisted that it would make no sense if all monies accruable to Lagos state was taken by the Federal Government.\n\nMr Olowo argued that given the pressures on the state governments in terms of infrastructure development, the proposed law on VAT in the state would bring about holistic development of the state.\n\nIn his address of welcome, the Speaker of the Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, assured participants at the public hearing that their contributions were as vital as the bill and would be included in the proposed bill before its passage.\n\nMr Obasa, represented by the Deputy Speaker, AbdulWasiu Eshilokun, noted that their contributions would be looked into so they could come up with an all inclusive VAT law for the state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n(NAN)",

          "text": "The federal government has disclosed that the shutdown of telecommunication activities in Zamfara State over banditry was done at the request of the nation\u2019s security agencies.\n\nThe Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, disclosed this to State House correspondents after the federal executive council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the presidential villa, Abuja on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to him, the measure did not originate from his ministry,\n\nexplaining that when the security agencies proposed it as an effective way to curtail the bandits, the federal government did not object to it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe further explained that government was willing to sacrifice economic gains in the telecom sector for security benefits.\n\nHe appealed to Nigerians to show understanding of the measure and support the efforts of the security agencies.\n\nHe said, \u201cI want to clarify to all of us that the Constitution of Nigeria, 1999, Section 14, Subsection 2, under Article B, has expounded to us that the primary responsibility of government is the security and welfare of its citizens.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding the priority of security makes the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR) always make sure that our priority number one is security because this is what the Constitution says and any action to be taken, as long as it will support security institutions to achieve and deliver their responsibilities, the government is willing to do that for them.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, security issues cannot be discussed in public like this. Most importantly, I am not in a better position to justify the shutting down of telecommunications because of security. I am aware of the shutting down, but the request is not from us. Rather, the request is from the security institutions, in which they asked for that as part of their strategy.\n\n\u201cBecause of this, the government allowed them to go ahead and even that one, the reason for doing that I may be aware of some, but I\u2019m sorry to say it\u2019s not for public discussion. What I only plead with all of us, as laymen, we shall try to give our security institutions the support they need todeliver on their mandate.\n\n\u201cSecurity issues today are not only for the security institutions alone, but there is a role that each and every citizen can play in order to make their work more successful. So, I plead with the media to support our security institutions and let us give them the benefit of doubt; when they come up with a strategy, let us not unnecessarily criticise it, except we allow them to begin and see.\n\n\u201cParticularly, they could have information at their disposal that you and I do not have and if you lack information, you will not be able to do justice in your deliberation. It is only when there is sufficient information at your disposal, then you can argue, but if you don\u2019t have it, even if you partake in any debate, you will finally discover that you have made a very wrong decision.\n\n\u201cSo, it is because of this. This is originally a request from Zamfara State government, in which they have requested the federal government to support them and Mr. President, as we always know that his priority is security and he always listens to complaints and new strategies on how to handle so he is very much aware.\n\n\u201cIt is a trial, let us support them and based on the information we have been reading and hearing through the media that tremendous successes have been recorded so far.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to support them to make sure that our country is secured and this is going to be good for all of us,\u201d Pantami stated.",

It\u2019s therefore pertinent that we take care of our environment, so that we can spend less on our health care system.\n\n\u201cThere is connectivity between man-animals-plants and their shared environment; therefore we must protect our environment and prevent disasters and ill health by avoiding constant and long-term exposure to polluted air,\u201d the Commissioner warned.\n\nGeneral Manager, LASEPA, Dr. Dolapo Fasawe recalled that, Lagos State, in accordance with the 1996 Paris agreement on international treaty on climate change, has taken the bull by the horn by establishing six air quality monitoring stations, data gathering on air pollution to establish causes and sources of pollution and the development of Lagos State Clean Air Action Plan 2021-2025 (LA-CAAP 2021-2025).\n\n\u201cAs a government, we are more determined to systematically tackle environmental menace and combat global warming, climate change and importantly secure the health of our people and the environment as a whole. To drive home our zero tolerance on air pollution, manufacturing companies, particularly, within residential areas must provide detailed environmental management policy, action and clean-up plans with bias for staff safety and consideration for host communities,\u201d she said.\n\n.",

The Centre for Gender, an organ of the University wrote the letter of complaint on behalf of the lady. So, the Centre was the complaint and members of the Centre were also invited by the University Investigative Panel as witnesses.\n\n\u201cI appeared once before the Investigative Panel and also once before the Joint Senate and Council Disciplinary Panel which was the trial proper.\n\n\u201cI have been in the department since 2006, 15 years ago \u2013 and no previous case of harassment against me. I have not also received a query at all since I started my career.\u201d\n\nMy right was violated \u2013 Embattled lecturer\n\nMosobolaje also explained that he was dismissed despite the alleged absence of evidence of sexual harassment against him.\n\n\u201cThe decision is a violation of my fundamental rights as enshrined in the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and therefore a travesty of justice.\n\n\u201cJust an instance, the report of the Joint Senate and Council Disciplinary Panel submitted that there was no evidence of harassment in the audio being the charge against me but went ahead to find me guilty on an account that I was not charged (lecturer-student relationship) which is not included in the list of misconduct in the University Code of Conduct,\u201d he added.\n\nNo cross-examination, lecturer alleges\n\nThe English lecturer said the panel did not tell him the claims and evidence made against him by the said student, adding that the transcript of the conversation with the complainant on the telephone was not also made available to him.\n\nAnother complaint made was that in the report of the Joint Senate and Council Panel, the student reportedly submitted that the interaction between her and the lecturer did not affect her grades.\n\nHe said, \u201cMy accuser did not appear before the Investigative Panel.\n\n\u201cThe Panel took evidence from her via a phone conversation. The lawyer on the Panel rejected the move as being inadmissible in law.\n\n\u201cThe Panel did not tell me what my accuser levelled against me. The Panel did not know the accuser nor the person speaking at the other end of the call.\n\n\u201cMore than the above. My accuser did not appear before the trial proper. So, there was no cross-examination.\u201d",

          "text": "Barely one week after some 73 students and their teachers were abducted from Government Day Secondary School Kaya in Maradun local government area of Zamfara state, there is mounting fear and confusion among parents and relations over the fate of the abductees.\n\nThe captors, according to one of the parents who pleaded anonymity, demanded N750 million ransom for the release of the children when they spoke to the bandits last week Wednesday.\n\nThe parent, in an interview with Blueprint in Gusau, Wednesday, confirmed that the bandits spoke with them last week on the telephone.\n\nHowever, their worry, he said, stemmed from the fact that the telecom shutdown by the National Communications Commission (NCC) at the instance of the state government was making it difficult for them to reach their wards, thus fuelling the fear that they could be killed by their captors.\n\n\u201cThe bandits said they are demanding the sum of N750 million from us before they could free our children and we don\u2019t have such money,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring the conversation, the source said, the gunmen threatened to kill the abductees if the community failed to raise the demanded ransom.\n\nThe source further said: \u201cWe spoke with them two days before the NCC disconnected the mobile phone network in the state following security challenges facing the state, and now we don\u2019t know the fate of our children. They threatened to kill our children if we failed to meet up with the price (ransom) they placed on the children\u2019s release.\u201d\n\nThe parents called on both the federal and Zamfara state governments to do the needful as quickly as possible to ensure the rescue of their children unharmed.\n\nEconomic activities crippled\n\nIn a related development, the shutdown of telecom sites across the state is beginning to take its toll on the people and their means of livelihood.\n\nSpeaking to Blueprint in an interview, a bank customer identified as Sulaiman Salisu, described the situation as \u2018seriously alarming.\u2019\n\nSalisu said he spent two days consecutively trying to withdraw some money to cater for his family but was unsuccessful owing to what he called lack of cyber network in all the commercial banks in Gusau, the state capital.\n\n\u201cAs I am speaking to you now, I have spent two days trying to withdraw some money to cater for my family problem and pay for my medical bill but failed,\u201d he said.\n\nBlueprint reports that the development followed the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) directive to the commercial banks in the state to shut down their cyber network in compliance with the federal government\u2019s decision of tackling security challenges facing the state.\n\nSalisu appealed to the federal government and the apex bank to look into their predicament and salvage them from the current socio-economic instability by restoring network to the banks for residents to have access to their money.\n\n\u201cYes, we know there is security challenge which we must tackle. However, I am of the view that in doing this we must not be made to pay so huge a sacrifice. Let government do something around this, I beg of them. You know what it means when you can\u2019t access your fund,\u201d Maimuna, another customer pleaded.\n\nFurther measures\n\nApart from the telecom shutdown, Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle also ordered the closure of all weekly markets, banned all forms of petrol black markets as well as imposed restriction of movement of vehicles from 8pm to 6am across the state.\n\nSimilar measures were taken by Sokoto, Katsina, Kaduna and Niger states. Blueprint visited some commercial banks in Gusau Wednesday and sighted the customers sitting redundantly in anticipation of the return of cyber network to have access to their money.\n\nViolators arrested\n\nAlso, over 100 people who violated the executive orders regarding the recent security measures in the state have been arrested.\n\nSecretary of the Task Force on Security Matters, Abdul Haruna, disclosed this in an interview with journalists in Gusau Wednesday.\n\nHe also said five cows belonging to a military officer were recovered.\n\nHaruna said two vehicles loaded with food items and other essential commodities, suspected to be heading to the bandits\u2019 camps were intercepted.\n\n\u201cHowever, the drivers of the two vehicles could not defend themselves hence they were arrested,\u201d he added.\n\nHaruna said Lalan, Mayanchi, Lamba Bakura and Colony junctions have all been closed indefinitely.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe closed these junctions because since markets have been closed indefinitely, the bandits have no other means than to be getting their foodstuffs and other essential commodities from the junctions.\u201d\n\n20 abducted in Sokoto community\n\nSimilarly, bandits suspected to be fleeing Nigerian Air Force attacks in the Bakura \u2013 Talata Mafara axis of Zamfara state Tuesday stormed Dange Shuni local government area of Sokoto state and kidnapped at least 20 residents.\n\nThe residents told BBC Hausa as monitored by Premium Times that communities in the area were witnessing influx of bandits recently.\n\nSokoto state Commissioner for Security Affairs, Garba Moyi, confirmed the development but said the state government was on top of the situation.\n\nHe said bandits from Zamfara had been moving into Sokoto but were not kidnapping people as being reported because they were only looking for escape routes.\n\nMoyi confirmed that sometimes the bandits attacked residents to instill fear or steal food while on the run.\n\nAn unnamed local said: \u201cEven yesterday (Tuesday) the bandits running away from bombs in Zamfara attacked a village called Fajanbi and abducted nine people.\n\n\u201cAnother person taken from another village escaped and told us that abductees from the area were more than 20 in the kidnappers\u2019 den.\u201d\n\nLockdown working \u2013 Dosara\n\nBut the Zamfara state Commissioner for Information Ibrahim Dosara has said the military offensive against the bandits in the state was yielding the right results since the telecom shutdown.\n\nAddressing journalists in Gusau, the commissioner said security operatives now found it very easy to deal with the bandits in their enclaves within the forests.\n\n\u201cZamfara State Government in efforts to ensure the crashing of the bandits has requested for the closing down of all networks in the state and this has been effective. The security officials are finding it very easy to deal with the bandits in their enclaves in the forests,\u201d the commissioner said.",

          "text": "West Africa\u2019s main regional bloc has suspended Guinea\u2019s membership, days after a military coup that removed President Alpha Conde.\n\nDuring an extraordinary virtual summit on Wednesday, leaders from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) demanded a return to the constitutional order and the immediate release of Conde, who was arrested by special forces led by Lieutenant Colonel Mamady Doumbouya on Sunday.\n\nThe ECOWAS leaders also agreed to send a high-level mission to Guinea as soon as Thursday.\n\n\u201cAt the end of that mission, ECOWAS should be able to re-examine its position,\u201d Alpha Barry, Burkina Faso\u2019s foreign minister, told reporters in Ouagadougou after the meeting.\n\nThe bloc\u2019s decision comes after the coup sparked broad diplomatic condemnation, but was also met jubilation in some parts of the capital, Conakry, where residents turned out on the streets to applaud passing soldiers.\n\nThe 83-year-old became the first democratically elected president in 2010 and was re-elected in 2015. But last year, Conde pushed through a constitutional change to allow himself to run for a third term, a move his opponents said was illegal. Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara also won a third term last year after changing his country\u2019s constitution.\n\nECOWAS was criticised at the time by activists for remaining silent about Conde and Ouattara\u2019s third-term bids.\n\nElsewhere in the region, Mali\u2019s military staged coups in August 2020 and then again in May this year. ECOWAS condemned the coups and temporarily imposed sanctions. It said on Tuesday it was concerned that Mali\u2019s transitional government had not made sufficient progress towards organising elections next February as promised.\n\nReporting from Conakry, Al Jazeera\u2019s Ahmed Idris said ECOWAS\u2019s decision to suspend Guinea was \u201ca protocol we have seen over and over again\u201d.\n\n\u201cSteps taken by ECOWAS, whenever there is an unconstitutional change in government \u2026 while the fear is such that unconstitutional change of government in West Africa could be a norm unless they take strategic steps and stern measures against people who organise coups to unconstitutionally unseat a democratically elected president",

Abdullahi Bode and the national secretary, Engr. Saleh Alhassan.\n\nThe briefing was attended by national stakeholders of the group with the theme, \u201cNational Cohesion As a Panacea For Peaceful Coexistence Between Farmers And Herders In Nigeria,\u201d and investiture of HRH Queen Mother, Amina Temitope Ajayi Mama Diaspora, as Miyatti Allah brand ambassador.\n\nAlhassan while speaking on behalf of the organisation, called on the National Assembly and President Muhammad Buhari to intervene and stop current attempt by some states governors to criminalise their means of economic livelihood of cattle rearing through the enactment of satanic and obnoxious laws \u2013 \u2018Anti-open Grazing Laws\u2019 targeted at Fulani Pastoralists.\n\nHe further called for proper funding of the National Commission for Nomadic Education and the expansion of its mandate.\n\n\u201cThis oppressive laws and hostile policies being enacted by state governors are fundamentally going against the Fulani Pastoralist culture, economic interest and constitutional rights.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that inter-state movement of pastoralists is analogous to inter-state commerce, which is an exclusive preserve of the legislative powers of the National Assembly under item 62 of the Exclusive Legislative List.\n\n\u201cTo this effect any action taken by any state Assembly that is in conflict with an above section of the 1999 Constitution as amended is null and void. These laws do not take into cognizance the sociology, economic, production system, climate variations and other push factors that are inherent in pastoralists movements across ecological zones.\n\n\u201cIt is common knowledge that Nigeria\u2019s mode of agricultural practice is still primitive all over the country are not consistent with global best practices, so why singling out the pastoralists who have been suffering from the cumulative years of neglect in terms of development from both federal and state governments,\u201d they added.\n\nIn similar a vein, the organisation called on the governor of Benue state, Samuel Ortom to offer an apology to the Fulani race for what it described as tissues of lies, propaganda profiling of the Fulani pastoralist and falsehood against them.\n\n\u201cOur organisation totally condemn the continuous extortion and profiling of the Fulani pastoralists by the Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue state and call on him to offer an apology to the Fulani race.\u201d\n\nThe organisation also called on the National Assembly to resuscitate and pass the Grazing Reserves Commission Bill and other Assembly and livestock management bills that were initiated by the previous National Assembly.\n\n\u201cOur Organisation totally condemn the vituperations of one Emir of Muri in Taraba state for the genocidal propaganda against Fulani Pastoralist and have since taken the necessary legal steps against the misguided local monarch and also written to the Taraba state Governor to immediately dethrone him.\n\n\u201cWe commend the courageous efforts of the federal government under the progressive leadership of President Mohammadu Buhari for listening to our consistent call to restore the existing grazing reserves and routes and create new ones, as it is the only sustainable solution to the farmers /herders conflicts in the country.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the security issues in Katsina and other north-west states, the organisation condemned the banned of interstate cattle movement in Katsina by Governor Aminu Bello Masari, describing him as a confused and unserious governor.\n\nThe body attributed the security challenge in Katsina, Zamfara, Kebbi and other northern states to failure of governance.\n\n\u201cGovernor Masari is confused and unserious. Most of the herders are from Katsina and the governor should have created ranches for herders to serve as a good example for other state governors to emulate instead of playing to the gallery by ban interstate movement of castles\n\nWhat is happening in Katsina, Zamfara, Kebbi and other northern states is the failure of governance because the governments failed to provide education for teeming youths, leading them to the bandit.\u201d",
          "summary": "Fulani socio-cultural group, Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore has described the anti-opening grazing law as satanic and a unanimous decision of southern governors to destroy pastoralists means of livelihood.\nMiyetti Allah group disclosed this in Masaka community, Abuja suburb on Monday at a press briefing, jointly delivered by its national president, Alh.\nHe further called for proper funding of the National Commission for Nomadic Education and the expansion of its mandate.\n\u201cThis oppressive laws and hostile policies being enacted by state governors are fundamentally going against the Fulani Pastoralist culture, economic interest and constitutional rights.\n\u201cTo this effect any action taken by any state Assembly that is in conflict with an above section of the 1999 Constitution as amended is null and void.",

That is the National Policy on Fifth Generation Networks for Nigeria\u2019s digital economy, the national policy on 5G,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat policy has been approved by the Federal Executive Council today. Furthermore, the policy discusses the benefits to be attained through the deployment of 5G in Nigeria and in any part of the world which includes lower latency, larger capacity, and higher data rate.\n\n\u201cThese are the three major benefits of the fifth-generation (network). In a simple language, we can say it will open many opportunities economically, academically, educationally and even in the health sector. It will also support our security institutions, particularly in areas where they need high-quality services.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Minister, the radiation from the 5G has proven to be lower than the 4G, televisions or microwaves, contrary to stories peddled on social media.\n\nREAD ALSO: Igboho\u2019s Aides Sue DSS, Seek N100m As Compensation\n\nThere have been concerns about the deployment of the 5G communications network, especially over its purported linkage with the COVID-19 outbreak. The claims have been repeatedly denied by authorities.\n\nOn May 19, the Senate asked the Federal Government to suspend plans to deploy the 5G network pending a six-month investigation into possible health risks associated with the technology.\n\nIn telecommunications, 5G is the fifth generation technology standard for broadband cellular networks, which cellular phone companies began deploying worldwide in 2019, and is the planned successor to the 4G networks which provide connectivity to most current cellphones.\n\nAway from the 5G network, the Minister also reacted to the security situation in the North-West.\n\nHe clarified that telecommunications shut down in Zamfara State did emanate from him but was at the request of security institutions to enhance strategies.\n\nAccording to Pantami, the government is willing to take any action including compromising economic benefits to render full support towards the security of the country.\n\nAlthough he declined to disclose if the same measure would extend to other states affected by banditry, he pleaded for greater support towards the security agencies to allow them to deliver on their mandate.\n\nMobile telephone networks were shut down in Zamfara State on Monday after authorities ordered a telecoms blackout to aid the armed forces in tackling banditry in the area.",

Mele Kyari, had at various times since the President\u2019s declaration of profit, attributed the turnaround to aggressive cost cutting, automation of the system and renegotiation of contracts downwards by about 30 per cent, among other tough measures.\n\nFurther highlights of the AFS revealed that while the Corporation\u2019s group financial position increased in total current assets by 18.7% compared to that of 2019, its total current liabilities increased by 11.4% within the same period.\n\nThe group\u2019s working capital remained below the line at N4.56trillion in 2020 as against N4.44trillion in 2019, the AFS further revealed.\n\nSimilarly, the Corporation\u2019s group revenue for the 2020 financial year stood at N3.718trillion as against N4.634trillion in 2019, a decrease that could be attributed to the decline in the production and price of crude oil due to the global impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThis is the third consecutive year that the NNPC is publishing its AFS, having done so for 2018 and 2019.",

The arrest of the suspects follows unrelenting efforts by the Police to ensure perpetrators of the dastardly act are arrested and made to face the wrath of the law.\n\nThe breakthrough that led to the arrest of the suspects began with the arrest of one Abubakar Mohammed a.k.a Buba \u2018m\u2019 23yrs, native of Gada Biyu in Daffo district, Bokkos LGA, Plateau State.\n\nBuba is one of the principal suspects in the kidnap operation.\n\nThe confession of the suspect which revealed how they abducted and murdered the nonagenarian, assisted the Police team in apprehending seven (7) other members of the gang \u2013 Ya\u2019u Saidu aka Ya\u2019u Kaban m\u2019 40yrs, from Kaban Village, Bokkos LGA, Plateau State, Titus Ezekiel 34yrs from from Horop, Bokkos LGA, Dauda Isah \u2018m\u2019 30yrs, from Horop, Sunday Ibrahim m\u2019 35yrs, Mushere tribe from Horop, Mangut Shumwar \u2018m\u2019 30yrs, from Horop, Henry Amos \u2018m\u2019 35yrs native of Horop, and Jethro Ngusen \u2018m\u2019 57yrs, native of Horop.\n\nInvestigations further revealed that it was Jethro Ngusen, the mastermind and convener of the gang, that instructed one of the gang members, Mangut Shumwar to kill Pa Dariye, because he feared that Pa Dariye might recognize the suspects since majority of them are from the same village with the deceased.\n\nJethro was also identified as the one who took custody of the ransom and later shared the proceeds of the crime amongst the gang members.\n\nSimilarly, the Police team arrested one Sadiq Abubakar \u2018m\u2019 31yrs old from Kogi State and one Peter Moses \u2018m\u2019 25yrs old from Kaduna State who abducted a 22yr-old lady to a location in Suleja.\n\nThe suspects held the young lady hostage, had repeated canal knowledge of the victim and extorted money from her parents as ransom before her release.\n\nInvestigations by the Police team show that the suspects, who are serial virtual kidnappers, usually meet their victims on social media platforms particularly, Facebook, and thereafter lure them to their criminal hideout before subjecting them to sexual molestation and further obtaining ransom from their families.\n\nThe Police operatives also intercepted three (3) suspects, Emmanuel Joel 42yrs, Ayuba Joel, 30yrs, Hassan Umar, 30yrs on 28th August, 2021, in possession of one AK49 rifle loaded with fourteen live ammunition and twenty-six (26) AK47 magazines, at a border town between Nasarawa and Taraba State.\n\nInvestigations by the Police team revealed that the suspects are criminal arms dealers who supply weapons to criminal elements in Nasarawa and Taraba States. Efforts are being intensified to arrest members of the gang currently at large.\n\nThe Inspector General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba, psc (+), fdc, NPM has assured that the Force is committed to working with law abiding citizens to secure the nation and reduce crimes to the barest minimum in the country. He advised users of the social media to remain circumspect and protect themselves from cyber crooks masquerading as online friends.\n\nAll the suspects will be charged to court on completion of investigations.",

But I believe that we still have to change the social aspect.\u201d\n\nWith some 100 million Catholics, Mexico is the largest predominantly Catholic country after Brazil. The Catholic Church opposes all forms of abortion procedures.\n\nHundreds of mostly poor Mexican women have been prosecuted for abortion, while at least several dozen remain jailed.\n\nTuesday\u2019s vote establishes a mandatory criteria for all judges in the country, making it no longer possible to prosecute any woman who has an abortion without violating the criteria of the court and the constitution, Zaldivar said.\n\nCoahuila\u2019s state government issued a statement saying the ruling would have retroactive effects and that any woman imprisoned for abortion should be released \u201cimmediately.\u201d\n\nA number of U.S. states have moved to restrict access to abortion, particularly Texas, which last week enacted a sweeping ban on the procedure after the first six weeks of pregnancy when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene.\n\nThe Mexican ruling may lead to U.S. women in states such as Texas deciding to travel south of the border to terminate their pregnancies.\n\nIn July, the state of Veracruz became just the fourth of Mexico\u2019s 32 regions to decriminalize abortion.\n\nMexico\u2019s leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has carefully avoided taking a stand on the matter, as he did again on Tuesday morning in the run-up to the ruling.\n\nWhen asked at a news conference for his opinion on abortion, he sidestepped the question, saying it was up to the court.\n\n\u201cDue my presidential office, I can\u2019t expose myself to wear and tear, so I have to look after myself, and this is quite a controversial issue,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring his winning 2018 election campaign, he forged an alliance with a small political party founded by Christian conservatives known for their strong opposition to abortion.\n\nBy contrast, Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, who was mayor of Mexico City when the capital legalized abortion in 2007, breaking new ground for the country, celebrated the court ruling on Twitter as a \u201cgreat day for the rights of women.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat advances there have been in progressive causes in our country!!!\u201d wrote Ebrard, one of the leading contenders to succeed Lopez Obrador when his six-year term ends in 2024. \u201cI\u2019m really delighted!!\u201d",

          "text": "West Africa\u2019s main regional bloc says it is concerned Mali\u2019s transitional government has not made sufficient progress towards organising elections early next year, as agreed after a military coup last year.\n\nIn a statement, the 15-nation Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) said on Tuesday that it remained \u201cworried by the lack of concrete action\u201d to prepare for the vote, which has been promised for February 2022 by coup leader and current interim President Colonel Assimi Goita.\n\nThe announcement came at the end of a three-day mission to Mali led by former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nMali\u2019s transition back to democracy following the August 2020 overthrow of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita is being closely watched in a region that has experienced four coups since last year, most recently in Guinea on Sunday.\n\nAfter the coup, Mali\u2019s military leaders agreed, under pressure from ECOWAS, to an 18-month transition, culminating in presidential and legislative elections in February 2022.\n\nThey had also agreed to set October 31 as a date for holding a constitutional referendum.\n\nBut various electoral deadlines, including the start of updates to voter rolls and the presentation of a new constitution, have not been met.\n\nThe transition was dealt a further setback in May when Goita, who led the initial coup, ordered the arrest of the interim president and then took over the role himself.\n\n\u201cThe mission recalled the importance of respecting the date of the announced elections in order to demonstrate the credibility of the transition process,\u201d said the ECOWAS statement, which was read out to journalists in Mali\u2019s capital, Bamako.\n\nMali\u2019s government has said it is conscious of its commitment to the electoral deadline, but some officials have also suggested it might not be respected.\n\n\u201cTechnically, the timeline is not feasible, unless things are done sloppily, resulting in the usual post-electoral crises,\u201d Bassirou Ben Doumbia, a political analyst, told the Reuters news agency.\n\nKeita\u2019s overthrow was largely precipitated by Mali\u2019s security crisis, which has seen fighters linked to al-Qaeda and the ISIL (ISIS) group extend their influence across the north and centre of the country.",

          "text": "Hundreds of thousands of Brazilians rallied across the country on Tuesday in support of far-right populist President Jair Bolsonaro and his embattled administration, while calling for the removal of Supreme Court justices.\n\nThe demonstrations, encouraged by Bolsonaro who then verbally antagonised the court in speeches at two separate rallies, will likely exacerbate a crisis between the executive and the judiciary that has escalated in recent months.\n\n\u201cEither the head of this power gets in line or this power can suffer what we do not want,\u201d the former army captain said at a demonstration in the capital Brasilia on Tuesday morning, in what was widely considered an unspecified threat against the court.\n\nIn recent months, the Supreme Court has authorised investigations into Bolsonaro and his allies for alleged attacks on Brazil\u2019s democratic institutions.\n\n\u201cThey release bandits [from prison] and arrest conservatives,\u201d hospital worker Carlos Alberto Juliao, 45, who attended a pro-Bolsonaro demonstration in Sao Paulo, said of the court.\n\nAmid growing scandals, rising inflation, high unemployment and one of the world\u2019s worst COVID-19 death tolls, Bolsonaro\u2019s approval ratings have sunk to record lows.\n\nElections are scheduled for October next year and opinion polls suggest Bolsonaro would lose by a wide margin against former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the left-wing Worker\u2019s Party if he decides to run.\n\nOther left-leaning or centre-right candidates, such as the former governor of the northeastern state of Ceara, Ciro Gomes, or current Sao Paulo governor Joao Doria, would also beat Bolsonaro in a second-round runoff, polls suggest.\n\nThe far-right leader has however hinted that he will refuse to accept defeat if Brazil\u2019s electronic voting system is not changed for paper ballots, a demand that was recently defeated in Congress.\n\nBolsonaro has insisted \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that the electronic system is vulnerable to fraud, a claim rejected by judicial experts and other experts, and which critics say is part of a plan to contest next year\u2019s election results.\n\n\u201cOnly God will take me out of Brasilia,\u201d he told a crowd of 114,000 supporters on Sao Paulo\u2019s Paulista Avenue on Tuesday afternoon, according to local military police estimates.\n\nThe rallies were attended by protesters wearing the canary and green colours of the Brazilian flag, with some carrying banners and placards calling for \u201cmilitary invention with Bolsonaro as president\u201d.\n\nBolsonaro himself is an outspoken advocate of Brazil\u2019s 1964-1985 military dictatorship, during which hundreds of political opponents of the regime were murdered and thousands more tortured.\n\nWith political tensions high in Brazil, fears of violent clashes similar to the riot that broke out at the United States Capitol on January 6 had been mounting in the run-up to the rallies.\n\nIn the end, however, unrest was mostly restricted to some Bolsonaro supporters trying to breach police barricades in the capital Brasilia before being driven back with pepper spray.\n\nTurnout, while not small, also was lower than had been expected in Sao Paulo and Brasilia.\n\nWhile the president may have gained a temporary boost after the demonstrations by re-energising his hardcore supporters, few analysts see his prospects of re-election improving.\n\n\u201cIn the end, what counts is reality. And the reality today is one of inflation, overpriced food and fuel, energy crisis and an increase in the population in poverty and social vulnerability,\u201d said Naue de Azevedo, a political scientist based in the Brazilian capital.",

          "text": "Teenager Leylah Fernandez produced another fearless performance to beat Elina Svitolina and set up a US Open semi-final with Aryna Sabalenka.\n\nCanada\u2019s Fernandez, who turned 19 on Monday, showed all of her devastating power to win a tense tie-break 6-3 3-6 7-6 (7-5) in New York.\n\nSvitolina, 26, had overturned a 5-2 deficit in the third but could not stop Fernandez\u2019s thrilling, powerful play.\n\nSecond seed Sabalenka dominated French Open winner Barbora Krejcikova 6-1 6-4.\n\nFernandez has beaten defending champion Naomi Osaka, 2016 winner Angelique Kerber and now Olympic bronze medallist Svitolina in her run to her first major semi-final.\n\nShe has shown remarkable composure in New York, backing up her easy power with a calmness and composure on court.\n\nAs Svitolina sent a return of serve long on match point, Fernandez fell to her knees and teared up as she was given a lengthy ovation by the fans on Arthur Ashe.\n\n\u201cI honestly have no idea what I\u2019m feeling right now. I was so nervous throughout the whole match,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was honoured to have a fight with Svitolina. I just told myself to go for every point. I\u2019m glad I did.\u201d\n\nFernandez is the youngest women to reach the US Open singles semi-finals since Maria Sharapova in 2005, getting there a day after her 19th birthday.\n\nThe teenagers have made a breakthrough in this year\u2019s US Open, with 18-year-olds Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alvaraz also reaching the fourth round along with Fernandez.\n\nFernandez has shown them that going one further, no matter the opponent, is possible. She has done it by trusting in her game and her big-hitting weapons, finishing with 42 winners against Svitolina.\n\nAs British tennis player Naomi Broady told BBC Radio 5 Live Sport: \u201cThis is not a flash in the pan. Fernandez has backed it up match after match.\u201d\n\nHer father, who coaches her, is an ex-professional footballer. As a child, Fernandez says she believed she could beat him in games of backyard football \u2013 and it is that self-confidence that has backed up her performances in New York.\n\nShe credited her dad, who is at home with her young sister, with giving her tactical support. Her lively support box is led by her fitness coach Duglas Cordero who constantly asked them to make more noise.\n\n\u201cMy dad told me so many things but today he told me to have fun,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHe said fight for every point and to not make the quarter-finals my last match and fight for my dream.\u201d\n\nFernandez started strongly against Svitolina, breaking for a 4-2 lead and smashing winners past her increasingly passive opponent.\n\nAn Olympic bronze medallist in Tokyo, Svitolina was slow to adjust her game, but she mixed defence with offence better in the third to finally break the Fernandez serve.\n\nBut Fernandez simply kept hitting and winning the long rallies, breaking back as Svitolina served for the set at 5-1, and creating four break points in the Ukrainian\u2019s next service game.\n\nThe scream that Svitolina let out when an ace out wide wrapped up the second set showed how frustrated she was, but she made the first dent in the third set.\n\nAgain, Fernandez hit her way out of trouble, choosing her shots carefully and outmanoeuvring Svitolina at the net. Three breaks of serve led to the Canadian serving for the match, but she appeared nervy for the first time, allowing Svitolina an opening.\n\nThe tie-break, however, felt like one-way traffic. Fernandez raced out to a 4-1 lead and the points that went against her were largely of her own making, rather than one last push from Svitolina.\n\nThe Ukrainian fought hard but she could not stem Fernandez\u2019s momentum, with the two sharing a hug and a brief word before Svitolina left the court.\n\nSvitolina is often tipped as a Grand Slam champion in waiting but she has reached just two major semi-finals at the French Open and Flushing Meadows in 2019.\n\nFernandez will now face Sabalenka, who is the highest seed remaining in the women\u2019s draw and has dominated her draw.\n\nThe Belarusian has been a consistently strong performer on the WTA Tour but had struggled at Grand Slams, before finally making her breakthrough at Wimbledon last month where she made the last four.\n\nThe match against Krejcikova, who stormed to her maiden Grand Slam singles title at Roland Garros earlier this year, promised much, but the Czech was hampered by either an injury or fatigue.\n\nSabalenka barely had to move out of first gear in the opening set, countering five double faults with 12 winners to sweep past Krejcikova.\n\nAlthough Krejcikova did rally towards the end of the second, Sabalenka was able to serve her way out of trouble, saving five of the six break points she faced to close out the match in one hour 28 minutes.",
