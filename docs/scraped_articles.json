          "text": "Aareonakakanfo of Yorubaland, Gani Adams, has threatened to place a curse on politicians infiltrating and frustrating the struggle for Yoruba nation.\n\nAdams said some prominent politicians in the South-West have infiltrated the struggle for the actualisation of the Yoruba nation.\n\nThe Aareonakakanfo was quoted as saying this at the weekly O\u2019odua Peoples Congress Stakeholders meeting, held at the Oodua House in Ikeja, Lagos, on Tuesday, according to a statement.\n\nHe pointed fingers at some prominent politicians, including someone he referred to as \u201cour senior brother in Lagos\u201d.\n\nAdams outburst is coming after the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, and other leaders of the All Progressives Congress in the South-West rejected calls for separation of Nigeria, saying that the country needs religious and ethnic unity to progress.\n\nHe accused the prominent politicians of betraying the Yoruba cause for \u201ctrue liberation\u201d.\n\nThe PUNCH gathered that there is an internal crisis among agitators for the Yoruba nation over allegation that one of their leaders have been bought over with a contract by the Federal Government.\n\nBut Adams said the disagreement between those agitating for the actualisation of the Yoruba nation is caused by \u201cagents that are being paid to frustrate the liberation movement\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is unfortunate that some people are determined to weaken the spirit of the agitators. Unfolding events in the last few weeks have shown that some prominent politicians have hijacked the struggle for the actualisation of O\u2019odua Repubic. It is an attempt to distract us from the true and original intention of the struggle. But I want to say it here that the struggle to seek a new nation is our legitimate rights that we are determined to live and die for and we wouldn\u2019t waiver in our beliefs and determination to liberate our race.\n\n\u201cAs the Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, I have put in close to three decades experience in the struggle and I know what it takes to win a struggle of this nature. So for those who had been infiltrating the struggle, I will curse them for seven days and if they fail to heed the warnings, I think they would have themselves to blame.\u201d\n\nIn the statement by Adams\u2019 media aide, Kehinde Aderemi, titled, \u2018Yoruba nation\u2019s struggle infiltrated by politicians- Gani Adams\u2019, the Yoruba generalissimo was also quoted as cursing those instigating crisis in Yoruba land.\n\n\u201cI will continue to curse them repeatedly for seven days because they deserve nothing but the wrath of God and that of the Yoruba ancestors,\u201d he added.",

Femi Gbajabiamila on Wednesday said the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has thrown up a challenge for Nigeria to be proactive in its social, health and economic affairs.\n\nHe said it has become incumbent on the leadership of the country to have a rethink on approach to nation-building, politics, commerce and economics in terms of engagement with the rest of the world.\n\nGbajabiamila\u2019s call was contained in his remarks at the public presentation of a book by the National Institute of Legislative and Democratic Studies, NILDS titled, \u201cA political economy of pandemics & consequences of COVID-19 for Nigeria\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO Yahaya Bello sends delegation to family of Ill-fated Airforce Plane pilot\n\nThe Speaker commended the Institute, saying the book be a guide to making of of polices going forward.\n\n\u201cThere will be a next time. The interconnectedness of global trade and our increased ability to traverse the world for leisure and enterprise guarantees that diseases that start in one part of the world cannot for too long be isolated there. This is our new reality, and we need to plan government in recognition of this.\n\n\u201dOne of the benefits of having survived a global pandemic is that we are freed to decide to redesign things to better reflect our best expectations and to meet the highest ambitions we have of ourselves. We have a lot of work to do for our country. And in the months ahead, we will have to ask and answer a lot of hard questions about where we go from here. Thanks to Prof. Abubakar Suleiman and his team from the National Institute for Legislative and Democratic Studies (NILDS), we have one more useful tool to guide our work and support our best efforts.\u201d\n\nIn his goodwill message, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan said the book is coming handy to assist in the legislative functions of the National Assembly.\n\n\u201dIn the thick of the pandemic, the National Assembly reconvened to consider and pass the revised 2020 budget and approve other financial measures of Mr. President. The National Assembly remained involved in governance processes not only in considering and approving executive proposals but more importantly in providing oversight. These and other efforts of the government are objectively assessed in this book and the analysis shows that despite numerous challenges and obstacles, the government and people of Nigeria responded to the pandemic with our characteristic resilience and resolve.\n\n\u201dIn particular, the response of the National Assembly to the pandemic was early and swift as shown in the numerous motions and resolutions of the Senate and House calling government\u2019s attention to COVID-19 and the need to take pre-emptive measures to limit the impact on the Nigerian economy and livelihoods\u201d, he said.\n\nIn his remarks earlier, the Director General of (NILDS), Prof. Suleiman Abubakar said that the book has far reaching recommendations on emergency preparedness.\n\n\u201dIt goes further to offer wide-ranging and far-reaching recommendations on emergency preparedness, areas of reform and strategies that could be adopted by the government to mitigate the effects of this and future emergencies. More than forty (40) experts contributed chapters in the compendium. These include academics and practitioners drawn from the National Assembly, NILDS, universities, research institutes and other institutions of higher learning, Federal Ministry of Health, Federal Ministry of Finance, National Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC), human rights activists, media and representatives of civil society organisations, among others\u201d, he said.\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Luminous Jannamike, Abuja\n\nThe Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC has urged National Youth Service Corps, NYSC members across the country to embrace whistle-blowing as a potent means of enlisting in the fight against economic and financial crimes, including corruption.\n\nThe Chairman of the EFCC, Mohammed Umar, made the call on Wednesday in an orientation lecture delivered simultaneously, on his behalf by Zonal Public Affairs Officers, to the Batch A, Stream 11 set of corps across the federation.\n\nRivers\n\nAt Nonwa Orientation Camp in Rivers State, the EFCC Chair observed that, with whistle-blowing, corps members would serve more useful purposes for the nation by exposing conducts that cast shadow on integrity, in their places of primary assignments.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe message of the EFCC to you all this morning is that you should become whistleblowers in any place where you find yourself by reporting acts that fail the simple test of integrity. So, we urge you, when you see something, to say something; and don\u2019t stop there, please do something\u201d.\n\nAs a practical way of performing the whistleblowing role, Bawa, represented by the Head, Public Affairs, Port Harcourt Zonal Office, Mr. Dele Oyewale, tasked corps members to join the EFCC/NYSC Community Development Group and use the platform to expose any corrupt acts noticed in their environment.\n\nIn the task of fighting cybercrimes, the EFCC\u2019s boss admonished corps members to serve as role models by shunning all forms of cybercrimes.\n\n\u201cThere is no shortcut to wealth and fame. The fact that the rate of unemployment is high should not be an excuse to resort to crime,\u201d he said.\n\nBenue\n\nAt the NYSC Orientation Camp, Wannune, Tarka Local Government Area, Benue State, Bawa, represented by Adeniran Adebayo Samuel, Head of Public Affairs, Makurdi Zonal Office, charged them to join hands with the Commission in its efforts to rid the society of economic and financial crimes.\n\n\u201cThe Commission realizes that enduring success in the fight against economic crime, including corruption can only be achieved when stakeholders embrace this important fight. One critical group of stakeholders is the youth,\u201d he said.\n\nKaduna\n\nIn Kaduna, the EFCC boss who spoke through the Kaduna Zonal Head, Mr. Harry Erin reiterated the importance of a collaborative approach to the fight against corruption, noting that \u201cthe success in the fight against economic and financial crimes, including corruption can only be achieved when all critical stakeholders, especially the youths embrace the fight\u201d.\n\nKwara\n\nAt the Kwara NYSC Orientation Camp in Yikpata, Edu Local Government Area of the State, Bawa, represented by Ayodele Babatunde Joseph, Head of Public Affairs, Ilorin Zonal Office, urged the youths not to be mere spectators in the anti-graft campaign, but foot soldiers of the fight by becoming change agents and help mould the minds of the younger ones in schools so that the fight against corruption, economic and financial crimes can be far-reaching.\n\n\u201cApart from the fact that they (youths) are considered as the leaders of tomorrow, most economic crimes, especially cybercrime are committed by young people. It, therefore, follows that young people must not be mere spectators in the anti-graft campaign. Rather, they should actually be the foot soldiers leading the mass rout of corruption and economic crimes out of our land,\u201d he said.\n\nEdo\n\nAlso, at the Orientation Camp, Okada, Edo State, Bawa, speaking through Williams Oseghale, Head, Public Affairs, Benin Zonal Office admonished the youths to embrace hard work and shun crime as the consequences are grave. \u201cYahoo-yahoo is not a sustainable way of life. It is painful when our operatives arrest as many as 50 yahoo-yahoo boys in a single raid. Add your voice to mine, because the fight against economic and financial crimes involves you and me; while I play my part, you will play yours,\u201d Bawa said.\n\nSimilar messages were presented to corps members at the Kubwa Orientation Camp, Abuja, and the NYSC Orientation Camp, Awgu, Enugu state where the EFCC boss was represented respectively, by Aisha Gambari and Ude Bethel of the Public Affairs Department.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

          "text": "Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State has stressed that devolution of powers is necessary to reduce the overburdens the federal government faces with many responsibilities it cannot efficiently handle.\n\nThe governor explained that the APC Committee on True Federalism which he headed, had identified legislative interventions that the National Assembly can more easily undertake to achieve a truly balanced, equitable and fair federal structure.\n\nSpeaking at the public hearing of the Senate Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution on Wednesday, Governor El-Rufai said, \u201cWe also drafted bills to alter the constitution and amend or repeal existing legislations to achieve the overall objective of true federalism.\u201d\n\nGovernor El-Rufai proposed 10 items that should be shared responsibilities between the state and federal governments.\n\nHe explained that the reality of the security situation today requires that Nigeria must strengthen its military and security agencies, adding that this includes decentralizing the police to enable the states to exercise effective control in securing their residents and communities.\n\nHe suggested the need to have federal, state and community police, with each granted sufficient powers to make them effective in securing the areas assigned to them and cooperating closely with each other.\n\nAccording to him, those expressing concerns about the ability of the states to bear the cost of policing should realize that apart from the payment of salaries by the federal government, saying that most of the operational and capital costs of the Nigeria Police are borne by state and local governments.\n\nThe governor argued that fear of abuse of State Police by sub-national governments is misplaced because a constitutional or statutory framework can be enacted to ensure federal intervention in cases of such abuses.\n\nHe noted that the constitution should be altered to remove the Police Service Commission because it is an unnecessary hinderance to effective policing in Nigeria.\n\nGovernor El-Rufai advised, \u201cThe power to hire and fire police officers should revert fully and totally to the Inspector General of Police, under the supervision of the National Police Council, as envisaged by the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe governor recommended that all mineral resources, including oil and gas and solid minerals, in the states should pay royalties and taxes to the Federation Account.\n\nHe noted that states already control land within their territories, courtesy of the Land Use Act, which is incorporated into the Constitution by reference.\n\nAccording to the governor, one of the reasons why mining has not quite taken off in the country is because of the dichotomy and total disconnect between the federal institution that issues licenses for mining and the state agencies that ultimately control not only the land and title thereto, but any approval to undertake any development on the land.\n\nThe governor also argued that states should be empowered to establish, staff and run their own judiciary up to appellate level.\n\nHe noted that it is an anomaly to have a National Judicial Council appointing high court judges for states, suggesting that this should be the responsibility of State Judicial Councils.\n\nHe said that the remit of the National Judicial Council should be limited to the federal high and appellate courts, saying that the constitutional amendment should clarify that the states can establish courts to exercise jurisdiction at first instance, or on appeal on matters for which the states can make laws.\n\nHe suggested that judges of State High Courts, Sharia Courts of Appeal and Customary Courts of Appeal should be nominated by the State Judicial Council, subject to confirmation by the House of Assembly.\n\nGov. el-Rufai further said that states should also be enabled to establish State Courts of Appeal, similar to what it used to have at the regional level under the 1963 Republican Constitution.\n\nHe stressed that the State Court of Appeal would entertain appeals from State High Courts, Customary and Sharia Courts of Appeal, on matters on which the State House of Assembly is empowered by the Constitution to make laws.\n\nHe noted that this arrangement would make the judicial processes faster, encourage competition, deepen their jurisprudence and restore citizens\u2019 trust, adding that it would reduce the burden on the Federal Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Nigeria.\n\nThe governor argued that each state should decide the model of democratic local government that best suits it because Nigeria is a federation of the 36 states and the Federal Government.\n\nHe observed that listing the 774 Local Governments in the Constitution and trying to establish for them direct relations with the Federal Government violates the spirit of federalism.\n\nHe suggested that each state should decide how many local governments it can efficiently run and fund for better governance and delivery of public goods.\n\nHe stated, \u201cEach state should decide what typology of local governance fits its historical, cultural and administrative circumstances, but the resulting framework must be democratic, with periodic elections at no longer than four year intervals.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that no state government should be allowed under any guise to take control of local government funds, and the Constitution should entrench safeguards and sanctions, including withholding state funds due from the Federation Account in the event of any reported diversions, impoundment or misappropriation.\n\nThe governor recalled that the APC Committee on True Federalism\u2019s recommendations are clear, not controversial and simply conform with common sense.\n\nHe said that Kaduna State is the first government to pay the national minimum wage approved in 2019, with consequential adjustments of up to 66% for most state civil servants.\n\nAccording to him, the proposed constitution amendment would enable the Federal Government to legislate a minimum wage for federal employees and those that reside and work in the FCT only.",

          "text": "No security without youth involvement, says Ooni\n\n\u2022 Sultan calls for implementation of previous resolutions\n\n\u2022 Insurgency, others pose serious threat to nation\u2019s security, Lawan, Gbajabiamila warn\n\n`By Udora Orizu\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday said the worsening insecurity in the country affects the citizens and the economy, challenging the foundation of nationhood and stands in the way of his administration in achieving its highest ambitions for Nigeria.\n\nHe made the remarks as other stakeholders expressed their views on the security situation of the country.\n\nBuhari stated this while delivering his remarks in Abuja at the opening of a Special Summit on National Security organised by the House of Representatives.\n\nThe summit, organized as part of the Green Chamber\u2019s response to the country\u2019s security challenges, was to provide a platform for discussions by security stakeholders and other Nigerians in order to make far-reaching recommendations to the Executive arm of government.\n\nThe President who was represented at the event by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr. Boss Mustapha, said the issue of insecurity, remains the responsibility of all Nigerians in and out of government, hence all hands should be on deck to address the challenges.\n\nWhile commending the initiative of the House in organising the summit, Buhari expressed optimism that the challenges will eventually be overcome.\n\nHe called on the Legislature to use the opportunity to pass more laws to enhance the operations of national security agencies.\n\nHe also urged participants to set aside ethnic, political, religious, and other considerations in the national interest to speak frankly on the security challenges and the solutions.\n\nBuhari said, \u201dThis summit could not have come a better time because only a few days ago, Nigeria lost the Chief of Army Staff and a host of other Senior Military Officers in a fatal plane crash involving Nigeria Airforce Asset. This is a painful loss to the nation, the military as an institution and to our efforts to strengthen the security architecture and capacity.\n\n\u201dIn different continents of the world, terrorism, political conflicts, racism and other forms of criminal activities continue to threaten economic development, peace and security. At the regional level; Africa these concerns subsist and continue to rage. Nigeria shares land borders with Benin, Cameron, Chad and Niger; and maritime boundaries with Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Sao Tome and Principe. The challenges that these international borders pose to our national security and interest are enormous. The instability in the Lake Chad region alone deserves close attention. I am certain that we shall overcome just as we have done many times throughout our history. However, success at this time requires that we set aside all other considerations and commit ourselves to a common endeavour in the national interest.\u201d\n\nIn his goodwill message, the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, lamented that Nigeria was currently at cross roads and its very essence of existence was under serious threat due to the activities of insurgents and bandits.\n\nHe urged both the Legislative and Executive arms of government to work more closely together by ensuring that recommendations from sessions such as the summit were implemented.\n\nLawan, who said the Armed Forces needed improved funding, told the session that the National Assembly was ready at all times to partner security agencies in addressing their operational challenges.\n\nLawan said, \u201dWhat started as insurgency in 2009 or so in the north western part of Yobe has now snowballed into full scale insurgency in the entire north east. What was not known to us in the north west is now today the home of banditry and kidnapping. The north central as we all know is not safe. It suffers the clashes between the herders and our farmers. And the recent introduction in the south east is another serious threat to the existence of this country. Where government institutions are targeted, our police and security agencies personnel are being killed on a daily basis.\n\n\u201dOur institutions, buildings are burnt. I believe that these are threats not only to those areas but the entire nation. And our armed forces are doing their best. I must commend our armed forces and other security agencies for doing so much with the little we are able to give them. The National Assembly has always been on the side of giving the kind of support, either legislative, or the kind of financial support that our armed forces and indeed all other security agencies require, even though we have our limits.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman of the National Assembly further opined that a functioning local government system helps in providing security for lives and property of people, with the traditional rulers playing key roles in ensuring security in their domains.\n\nHe also called for an end to ethnic profiling, saying that criminals should be named, shamed and dealt with.\n\n\u201dA criminal has only one name and that is criminal. No criminal should have comfort in his ethnic enclave. Whoever, where that person is, once he is a criminal, he is simply a criminal and must be dealt with in the appropriate manner regardless of where he or she is coming from,\u201d he added\n\nAligning with Lawan\u2019s statement, the Speaker of the House, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, in his keynote address noted that the country was under attack by insurgents, bandits, kidnappers, and other criminal elements.\n\nHe said it would be difficult for the country to attain the peace it desired for development to take place if the present security situation remained unresolved.\n\nThe Speaker while saying that previous and current approaches to addressing the challenges of insecurity have not yielded the desired results, called for a united and coordinated security approach to contain the menace.\n\nGbajabiamila commended President Buhari for supporting the summit, adding that the President had assured him that the recommendations of the summit would be given due attention and implementation.\n\nAlso speaking, the Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, said government at all levels should quit the talks on insecurity and get to work.\n\nHe advised the federal government to implement resolutions reached at previous forums rather than creating new summits.\n\nAbubakar said, \u201dNow things are really very bad and it\u2019s a fact. I\u2019m happy to hear that the two leaders of the National Assembly are saying that in public. Let\u2019s not deceive ourselves that things are alright, things are not alright and we know and we see it. For some of us we\u2019ve seen so much in our life. From the time I became Sultan till now, for 11 years plus, we have been having such gatherings to talk about Nigeria, national security, development and so on. We have talked and talked, we have talked at Northern Governors Forum level, talked at National level where I I happened to be the chairman of that body, we have talked and talked.\n\n\u201dIn the last few months we have had serious gatherings like this with the highest leadership of this country. Today we are here once again on the same issue of National Security. Enough of this talks, let\u2019s work, let\u2019s work the talk , the more we sit here and talk, the more time we waste in getting real actions . We know the problems. I will not say anything here that I have not said in the last 7 years. We know the problems and I thought we are coming for a closed door program with the leadership of the House of Representatives and other stakeholders. My own take on this summit is yes, it\u2019s important to sit and talk but it\u2019s more important to implement what we talked about. We can\u2019t just continue to talk and not implement.\u201d\n\nThe Sultan also chided politicians who say some things in the open and act differently behind closed doors.\n\nAccording to him, \u201dCertain things our leaders do, you say something in public and they clap for you, you go back to your comfort zone and throw everything away. That\u2019s why I say whatever you do God is seeing you, and as leaders God will ask us to account for the leadership he gave us here on earth and we must account for our deeds. I call on our leaders to fear God, do what\u2019s right, don\u2019t look at ethnic, religious or personal interest while you\u2019re carrying out your duties.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, opined that insecurity cannot be solved without youth involvement.\n\nHe accused the lawmakers of abandoning the youths at the grassroots while they enjoy their lives in the cities.\n\nHe said lawmakers should engage the youths rather than hold such meetings and repeating what has been said a lot of times.\n\nHe said, \u201dIt is very idiotic and stupid for us to be doing the same thing over and over again and expect a different result. We will continue to get the same results. Let us be very truthful and honest to ourselves in this country, we all know the problems. How well are we carrying along these people in that age bracket. But whenever we want to go for political posts and appointments, we go back to them. We know the good, the bad and the ugly in their category. As traditional rulers, they are the most active in our system. Let us tell ourselves the truth, they are hungry and they are angry. I repeat: they are hungry and they are very angry. All of us that are here, I will be very happy if anybody can raise up their hand and say \u2018I can go to my constituency, my local government area, and I can stay there in peace for one week.\u2019 Who can do it here? Including our gatekeepers, who can do it here? Including the Senate President, including the Speaker. But you left the traditional rulers; you left district heads, the baales to continue to stay there. And you are saying all will be well in this country.\n\n\u201dLet us change our style. You leave this age bracket. If there will be problems, you give them guns to start to move around. You will never see anybody above our age in our comfort zone here that is really ready to face the music. It is very important for all of us to know that we are not all safe; we are not safe at all. Let us engage a lot of youth organisations that are very relevant; that understand the local government administration and governance within every district and locality of this country. You have neglected that category completely. What is the essence of you being a politician that you cannot even move around freely? You cannot! Do you think only Abuja is Nigeria? Or Lagos? Thirty-six states of this country, people are there and you left them. You abandoned them. And you are making laws and administering. What are you administering? I do not know. So, let us talk to ourselves very seriously. On this note, I want to thank the organisers and I want to tell us that, enough of talking the talk, let us walk the talk.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Southern govs insist no land for invaders\n\n\u2022ACF maintains position on cattle restriction\n\n\u2022Buhari\u2019s opposition to southern govs, ill-advised, says Clark\n\n\u2022SANs allege ethnic bias\n\nBy Alex Enumah, Emma Addeh in Abuja, John Shiklam in Kaduna, George Okoh in Makurdi and James Sowole in Akure\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari is opposed to open grazing of cattle, the presidency said yesterday in an apparent effort to douse the rising critique of its statement on Monday, quoting the president as querying the legality of Southern governors\u2019 ban on open grazing.\n\nPresidential spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, while fielding questions on ARISE NEWS CHANNEL, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, said many people misconstrued Buhari\u2019s views on the Southern governors\u2019 resolutions at their May 11 meeting in Asaba, Delta State as an endorsement of open grazing.\n\nHours before the clarification from the presidency, the Monday statement had drawn flaks from the Southern governors; the Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere; and some senior lawyers.\n\nThe presidency statement by Shehu had questioned the legality of the Southern governors\u2019 resolutions, in which they, among others, banned open grazing of cattle in the South.\n\nThe statement quoted Buhari as dismissing the ban, while accusing the 17 Southern governors of not proffering any solution to the intractable farmer-herder conflicts, largely driven by open grazing of cattle.\n\nThe presidency announced Buhari\u2019s approval for ranching and revival of grazing reserves nationwide.\n\nBut the Chairman of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum and Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, yesterday fired back at the presidency, warning that no land in the South will be ceded to those he described \u201cas a band of invaders masquerading as herdsmen under any guise.\u201d\n\nThe Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) also maintained its earlier stance that the ban on open grazing was in the best interest of all Nigerians.\n\nBut Benue State Governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, yesterday kicked against the presidential decision to revive grazing reserves, saying that the reserves, created when Nigeria had a population of 50 million have since been taken over by airports, schools, roads, hospitals and other infrastructure.\n\nSome senior lawyers also faulted Buhari\u2019s opposition to the open grazing ban, alleging ethnic bias.\n\nHowever, in an effort to douse tension generated by his statement, Shehu told ARISE NEWS Channel that Buhari would want to see an end to the archaic practice of open grazing of cattle.\n\nHe added that the objective of the president and that of the governors fully align.\n\nHowever, he stated that the only difference between the positions of both parties is the approach to achieving the aim, adding that the president is insistent that it should be done in an organised manner.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe president wants to see an end to open grazing; he wants to see ranching; but he wants it in a way that\u2019s organised and he has a plan for it and the plan will take off in June.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, all the ongoing attacks on the president are from people who are in the mood for a public fight.\n\nHe said states that were able to meet the minimum requirements would be encouraged to embark on ranching, and expressed optimism that those opposed to ranching will change their minds when it becomes fully functional.\n\nShehu said the president viewed open grazing as old-fashioned and was looking forward to a replacement for the medieval practice.\n\nBut he reiterated that banning open grazing without an alternative is not a good approach to the issue.\n\nHe said the president was worried about the crisis generated by the matter, adding that the generalisation of every herder as criminals is not the right thing to do.\n\nWhile admitting that the ranks of the nomads had been infiltrated with people now bearing AK-47 rifles to kill and maim, Shehu called for calm as the issue won\u2019t be solved by public show of strength.\n\n\u201cLet us stop this shadow boxing. You just brought one or two people here who said things that nobody said from our own end. Did the president say he didn\u2019t support\u2026? He\u2019s opposed to the way the governors have chosen to do it,\u201d he said.\n\nOn state policing, Shehu said the president was initially concerned that governors who are unable to pay salaries to their workers want to give guns to police set up by them, adding that if it is what Nigerians want, the president would have no option but to support it.\n\n\u201cYou hire a policeman. Give him a gun and for one year, you don\u2019t pay salaries, like you are doing to your teachers, that\u2019s a problem,\u201d Shehu stated.\n\nBesides, he added that to implement state policing will require amending the 1999 Constitution, and Buhari has never rejected constitution amendments.\n\nOn restructuring, he stated that the All Progressives Congress (APC) wasn\u2019t against devolution of power, as that is the work of the legislature to do.\n\nHe also dismissed speculations that Buhari was interested in extending his tenure, saying that those raising doubts over whether or not elections will hold in 2023 are doing so because they are unelectable.\n\nShehu also said he was not aware of any shoot-on-sight order against Igbo, adding that the rumour is meant to provoke unnecessary public anger.\n\nSouthern Govs Insist No Land for Invaders\n\nThe Chairman of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum and Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, yesterday faulted Monday\u2019s presidential statement querying the legality of the governors\u2019 ban on open grazing.\n\nAkeredolu, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant, Special Duties and Strategies, Dr. Doyin Odebowale, said Shehu could not be representing the presidency with his positions on issues of national concern.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnyone who has been following the utterances of this man (Shehu), as well as his fellow travellers on the self-deluding, mendacious but potentially dangerous itinerary to anarchy cannot but conclude that he works, assiduously, for extraneous interests whose game plan stands at variance with the expectations of genuine lovers of peaceful coexistence among all the peoples whose ethnic extractions are indigenous to Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cShehu cannot continue to hide under some opaque, omnibus and dubious directives to create confusion in the polity.\n\n\u201cThe declaration that the recommendations of the Minister of Agriculture, Alhaji Sabo Nanono, a mere political appointee like Garba Shehu, are now the \u2018lasting solutions,\u2019 which eluded all the elected representatives of the people of the Southern part of the country, exposes this man as a pitiable messenger who does not seem to understand the limits of his relevance and charge.\n\n\u201cMr. Garba contends that \u2018their announcement is of questionable legality\u2019, referring to the 17 governors of the Southern states, but the decision of certain elements to take the ancestral lands of other people to settle their kinsmen, including the \u2018gun-wielding \u2018killer herdsmen\u2019 and their families, and provide \u2018veterinary clinics, water points for animals, and facilities for herders and their families, including schooling through these rehabilitated reserves\u2019 for which \u2018the federal government is making far-reaching and practical changes allowing for different communities to co-exist side-by-side\u2019, does not appear to him as a comprehensive plan for land grabbing, a precursor to internal colonialism.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu said Shehu wanted to revive forest reserves \u201cbut seems particularly uninterested in the current position of the same law that he and his cohorts often misinterpret to serve parochialism and greed.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernors no longer have powers over the lands in their territories. They must take instructions from appointees of the federal government on such matters,\u201d he stated.\n\nWhile noting the rights of all Nigerians to move freely in all parts of the country as guaranteed by the constitution, Akeredolu said it was clear that Shehu seemed to have issues understanding the difference between licentious criminality and qualified rights under the law.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is our duty to continually nudge him off his current state of cognitive dissonance. His pronouncement betrays dubiousness and mischief.\n\n\u201cMost traditional families in Nigeria have occupations. Pastoralism is not an exception. Any ethnic group still trapped in anachronism may be assisted to embrace modernity.\n\n\u201cDispossessing communities of their ancestral lands, encouraging denizens of the forests to overrun lands belonging to other people and forcing alien bands of migrants on the local populace to live \u2018side-by-side\u2019 with other communities cannot be for the purpose of animal husbandry.\n\n\u201cIt raises suspicion on a grand, deliberate, persistent and insidious design to use naked force to subjugate the real owners of the land. Mr. Garba Shehu is a major supporter of the current pervasive anarchy in the land.\n\n\u201cMay, we warn Mr. Garba Shehu and his cohorts to desist from hurling insults at the elected representatives of the people. He lacks the authority to make policy statements for the federal government, unless directed, expressly. His acts are clearly those of an agent provocateur.\n\n\u201cNo inch of the space delineated and known, currently, as South-west, and indeed the whole South, will be ceded to a band of invaders masquerading as herdsmen under any guise.\u201d\n\nOrtom Condemns Moves to Reopen Grazing Reserves\n\nBenue State Governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, has condemned the moves by the presidency to reopen grazing reserves.\n\nThe governor said in a statement by his Press Secretary, Mr. Terver Akase, that he read with concern a statement issued by Shehu in which he said the federal government would commence rehabilitation work on grazing reserves in the country next month.\n\n\u201cIt is now clear that there is a hidden agenda, which only the presidency knows. Otherwise, all the regions of the country have accepted the fact that open grazing of animals is no longer fashionable and should be banned to pave the way for ranching, yet, the government at the centre is insistent that grazing reserves/cattle routes must be created across the country,\u201d he stated.\n\nOrtom added that the Northern States Governors\u2019 Forum (NSGF) had on February 9 agreed that open grazing was no longer sustainable, in view of growing urbanisation and population of the country.\n\nHe accused the presidency of pushing for the continuation of open grazing and the return of cattle routes of the 1950s and 60s, adding that the presidency\u2019s endorsement of open grazing has emboldened armed herders who lay claim to all land in Nigeria as belonging to Fulani, hence their invasion of farming communities and killing of original landowners.\n\n\u201cAt present, the routes have been taken over by airports, roads, schools, hospitals, as well as markets, houses and other human activities,\u201d he added.\n\nACF Maintains Stand on Open Grazing Ban\n\nAlso reacting to the presidency\u2019s rejection of the ban on open grazing by the Southern governors, spokesman of the ACF, Mr. Emmanuel Yawe, said the Chairman of the forum, Chief Audu Ogbe, had earlier made the position of the forum known.\n\n\u201cOur stand on the issue was already made known by our Chairman, Audu Ogbe, in a statement he issued on May 17, 2021,\u201d he said while responding to THISDAY\u2019s inquiry.\n\nOgbe, in the statement, had said that the decision to ban open grazing was in the best interest of all Nigerians.\n\nHe said: \u201cACF does not see any reason to object to a decision taken in the best interest of all.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is that the crisis emanates from the belief by most herdsmen that they are free to enter any farm, eat up the crops, and rape or kill anyone raising objections. Nobody or society can accept that.\u201d\n\nAfenifere said the presidential statement opposing the ban on open grazing showed that Buhari\u2019s government was not organised.\n\nThe Secretary-General of Afenifere, Chief Sola Ebiseni, said reacting to Shehu\u2019s statement again would amount to dignifying him.\n\nHe said: \u201cHaving reacted to the statement of the Attorney-General, I consider it infra dignitatem to still countenance Garba Shehu whose statement, claiming the president\u2019s authority, on the same ban on open grazing does not only show how unorganised the Buhari government is, but also a vote of no confidence on the AGF, who should save the honour of his office and the legal profession by resigning pronto.\u201d\n\nSANs Knock Presidency, Allege Ethnic Bias\n\nSome senior lawyers have faulted the position of the presidency on the open grazing ban in the South.\n\nSome of them described the president\u2019s statement as parochial, sectional and one that is capable of further tearing the country apart.\n\nMr. John Baiyesea (SAN), who described the statement as part of the bizarre situation the country is dealing with, wondered if such could ever emanate from Buhari.\n\nAccording to him, such statements are often made under the cover of the presidency.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is doubtful if the president knows about such annoying statements, which seem to suggest that he has narrowed his office to the North. I don\u2019t believe that the president will personally support one ethnic group against another or wilfully diminish the scope of his authority. I don\u2019t think he will make himself so irrelevant as president of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe, however, stated that if the president\u2019s silence to such tribalistic and ethnic posturing of his appointees means acquiescence or approval, then the country is endangered.\n\n\u201cHow many times are they to be told (for them to understand), that freedom of movement guaranteed by the constitution is for human beings and not for cows, or animals?\n\n\u201cAs long as Fulani herdsmen stay within the law, their freedom of movement is guaranteed. But their cows do not enjoy the same constitutional rights or protections.\n\n\u201cExcept for the mischievous intentions of these government officials who are bent on dividing this country, it is too elementary that the constitutional system does not give the rights of people to animals,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, advised the federal government to be careful not to allow the horrors experienced in Rwanda and Burundi to happen in Nigeria.\n\nAlso speaking, Mr. Dayo Akinlaja (SAN), faulted the presidency, saying that the Southern governors acted within the ambit of the law.\n\nHe added: \u201cI do not agree with him for the simple reason that it is not in tandem with my previously expressed view that the governors were right in their decision to ban open grazing.\n\n\u201cIn a constitutional setting as ours, the issue may have to be referred to the judicial arm of government for resolution. Until that is done, the governors are at liberty to stick to their position.\u201d\n\nHuman rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), also faulted the presidency and advised the government to study the Grazing Reserves Act of 1964, which provides for the establishment and operation of grazing reserves in the North.\n\nHe said since there was a popular demand for the proscription of open grazing, efforts should be made to immediately establish ranches.\n\n\u201cIt smacks of brazen official impunity on the part of the presidency to have said that the ban on open grazing is of doubtful legality. Last Friday, the Federal High Court ruled that state governments have the power to enact anti-grazing laws,\u201d he stated.\n\nConstitutional lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), accused Malami of ill-advising the president against the stance of the Southern governors.\n\nHe challenged the federal government to sue the governors if it is convinced that their position is legally flawed\n\nHe said: \u201cPresident Buhari has obviously been ill-advised on the well thought out Southern governors\u2019 stance against open grazing by the attorney-general whose views were made known only two days ago. Buhari, with all humility, is quite wrong to say the Southern governors\u2019 stance is an act of questionable legality.\n\n\u201cIf the federal government feels strongly and sure about its puritanical, but legally flawed stance, I challenge the federal government to challenge the governors\u2019 resolutions by suing all the state governors of Nigeria, through the invocation of the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under section 232(1) of the 1999 Constitution\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "Some senior lawyers also faulted Buhari\u2019s opposition to the open grazing ban, alleging ethnic bias.\nShehu said the president viewed open grazing as old-fashioned and was looking forward to a replacement for the medieval practice.\nBut he reiterated that banning open grazing without an alternative is not a good approach to the issue.\nOgbe, in the statement, had said that the decision to ban open grazing was in the best interest of all Nigerians.\nHe said since there was a popular demand for the proscription of open grazing, efforts should be made to immediately establish ranches.",

General Ibrahim Attahiru, and 10 military officers and personnel.\n\nThe Kaduna aircraft crash, the third of such incident in the last three months involving NAF fleet, has raised concerns about the airworthiness of the aircraft the NAF has.\n\nThree NAF aircraft were involved in fatal crashes in Abuja, Borno and in Kaduna in the last three months, claiming the lives of a total of 21 personnel of the air force and the army.\n\nHowever, the air force, last week, inducted three newly procured JF-17 thunder aircraft into its inventory as part of activities to mark its 57th anniversary celebration and is expecting 12 Super Tucano fighter jets from the United State, which delivery is due by 2022.\n\nThere were also claims that of the four major Beechcraft planes in the force, notably, NAF 201, NAF 202, NAF 203 and NAF 204, two, NAF 201and NAF 203 had crashed in Abuja and Kaduna, remaining NAF 202 and NAF 204.\n\nThere have also been trending calls on the social media for the air force to ground the remaining two.\n\nBut the air force has insisted that the planes are in good conditions.\n\nThe air force, in a statement by its spokesman, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, said the committee, comprising serving and retired officers, would, among other terms of reference, analyse safety reports from operational and engineering units, conduct safety evaluation of NAF units and recommend measures to enhance safety of operations.\n\nThe committee is also to interact with unit operational and technical personnel for views, observations and contributions on safety measures.\n\nThe committee, chaired by the Deputy Theatre Commander, Operation Hadin Kai, Air Vice Marshal Abraham Adole, is expected to submit its report latest June 18.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, has constituted a committee of serving and retired senior officers to conduct a safety audit of all Nigerian Air Force (NAF) operational and engineering units.\n\n\u201cThe committee is to, among other terms of reference, analyse safety reports from operational and engineering units, conduct safety evaluation of NAF units and recommend measures to enhance safety of operations in the units.\n\n\u201cThe committee is also to interact with unit operational and technical personnel for views, observations and contributions on safety measures.

          "text": "\u2022CBN raises COVID-19 targeted credit facility to N400bn\n\n\u2022Mulls introduction of digital currency\n\nBy James Emejo\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday appealed to bandits and others involved in unlawful activities to drop their arms and embrace the central bank\u2019s Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme (ABP).\n\nHe also announced that the central bank has been encouraged to increase its COVID-19 Targeted Credit Facility to N400 billion from N300 billion.\n\nEmefiele, while addressing journalists after a two-day meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in Abuja, also reiterated that cyptocurrency currently has no place in the Nigerian financial system.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, the MPC resolved to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) otherwise known as interest rate at 11.5 per cent.\n\nThe MPC also voted to maintain the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR and left the Cash Reserve Ratio at 27.5 per cent and Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent.\n\nThe MPR is the rate at which the CBN lends to commercial banks and often determines the cost of borrowing in the economy.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, his appeal to criminals to embrace family is because there is a linkage between security and economic growth.\n\nResponding to a question, he said: \u201cIf you want an economy to grow, the level of insecurity must be low because if there is a high level of insecurity like what we see today, the economy will suffer.\u201d\n\nHe added that security agencies are doing their best to tackle insecurity.\n\n\u201cEfforts are now targeted at the south-eastern and north-eastern parts of the country. About three years ago, the federal government and the United States signed a pact that resulted in a government-to-government acquisition of military equipment.\n\n\u201cOut of which, we are expecting 12 fighter planes that would help us solve our insecurity. I am aware that six of them are coming to the country in the month of July and August.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, would like to appeal to our brothers, who decide that they want to live in bushes and forests, that they should please, begin to retreat, drop their arms and come and embrace the anchor borrowers\u2019 programme.\n\n\u201cIf they do so, it will help them; if they choose not to do so, they will be confronted by the security as this battle continues.\n\n\u201cI am optimistic before the end of the year that the security challenges confronting the country will substantially abate,\u201d he stated.\n\nEmefiele said the current targeted facility, which was unveiled to provide succour to households and SMEs amidst the harsh impact of the pandemic, \u201calmost the whole of N300 billion has now been disbursed.\u201d\n\nHe said the proposed increase would make more available to households and small businesses for them, \u201cto go back to business which will ultimately yield employment and also grow our economy.\u201d\n\nEmefiele stated that the idea of operating a digital currency will soon become a reality in the country, adding that the central bank has already set up its committee, which is working on the concept.\n\nEmefiele, who read the committee\u2019s communiqu\u00e9, said although the economy had successfully exited recession, the recovery was fragile given that the GDP of 0.51 per cent was still far below population growth rate.\n\nHe said the committee was therefore, of the view that, there was a need for monetary authorities to consolidate on all administrative measures taken not only to rein in inflation, but also on the actions so far taken to grow output.\n\nHe said in the committee\u2019s view, such measures should include boosting consumption and investments, as well as diversifying the base of the economy through FX restrictions for the importation of goods and food products that can be produced in Nigeria.\n\nThe MPC also urged the bank to continue to put in place measures that will boost export earnings.\n\nResponding to a question on the recent Q1 GDP figures, Emefiele said: \u201cI think it is important to say at the CBN we were not surprised. We were not surprised because Nigeria is one country that is peculiar for what I call a situation that is out of the ordinary. That is because Nigeria is one country among several others challenged by stagflation.\n\n\u201cStagflation is a situation where inflation is running high and prices are running high and at same time output growth is contracting. If you understand how this works, you will understand that as MPC, your core responsibility is to rein inflation by ensuring that you keep supreme your price stability mandate. And to do so means you have to tighten to rein inflation.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, government is confronted with contracting output and the normal way to recover from such is to stimulate the economy by injecting liquidity into the system.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said on consumption and investment, the committee noted that the intervention facilities under the anchor borrowers programme was N631.4 billion granted to 3,107,949 small holder farmers cultivating 3.8 million of land hectares; for the AGSMEIS, N111.7 billion to 29,026 beneficiaries; and for the Targeted Credit Facility, N253.4 billion to 548,345 beneficiaries \u2013 comprising 470,969 households and 77,376 SMEs.\n\nThe committee, according to him, noted that notwithstanding that all these have helped in boosting output, the CBN should continue to aggressively increase its interventions in these subsectors, including agricultural processing and manufacturing.\n\nHe said under the National Youth Investment Fund, N2.04 billion was disbursed to 7,057 beneficiaries, of which 4,411 were individuals and 2,646 were SMEs.\n\nAlso, under the Creative Industry Financing Initiative, the CBN has disbursed N3.19 billion to 341 beneficiaries across movie production, movie distribution, music and software development.\n\nAlso commenting on the recent controversy regarding state governments repaying their loan obligations to banks as well as those under the CBN intervention facilities, Emefiele said the state governors must honour their loan agreements to parties involved.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere are two aspects to these. There are intervention facilities granted by the CBN and there are bilateral facilities granted by the deposit money banks to them.\n\n\u201cThey went to deposit money banks, they asked for loans, they signed the offer letters with those banks.\n\n\u201cThey gave their ISPOs to the federal ministry of finance that on a monthly basis, the minister of finance should deduct from their money and pay the banks for the loans they have taken.\n\n\u201cAnd I am aware that the banks have written to finance and they have copied me that they want their money.\n\n\u201cIf it was a bilateral loan agreement, in fact, there is privacy of contract, yes, I am not part of it, they should pay their loans.\n\n\u201cOn the CBN intervention facility to the state governments, we are engaging the National Economic Council (NEC) and CBN is also insisting on its loan to be paid.\n\n\u201cBut depending on the outcome of the engagement between CBN, finance and NEC, we will begin to take the monies but in any case it\u2019s good for you to be a good debtor \u2013 when you take a loan you pay so that when you go back to the bank, you can get. But if refuse to pay, you will never smell the doorstep of the banker again.\u201d\n\nHe said while the CBN had extended repayment on its loan interventions till next year as part of the forbearances to cushion the impact of the pandemic, banks deserved the right to demand repayment of their loan disbursements following the rebound in economic activities.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn any case, the banks I must admit are seeking that there are some improvements in the economy, fragile as it may be- there are some improvements \u2013 crude prices have gone up and business activities are beginning to regain energy and life again.\n\n\u201cAnd if the banks ask for the repayment of their facilities, it will be justified.\n\n\u201cYou raised the issue of interest rates, that the banks are charging high interest rates. If we admit at CBN that we are controlling money supply and the banks raise interest rates in what I can call non-employment generating sectors or non-output generating sectors of the economy, we can\u2019t fault them.\n\n\u201cBecause we have our own intervention facility that are meant to target agriculture, SMEs and targeted households, which are meant to stimulate employment and also stimulate output for the country.\u201d\n\nOn whether the CBN had been vindicated following the crash of cryptocurrency market after the apex bank had opposed its operations in the country, Emefiele said it was not about CBN being vindicated.\n\nHe added that the CBN investigated and found out that a substantial percentage of Nigerians are involved in cryptocurrency which is \u201cnot the best.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, some may be legitimate but I dare say most are illegitimate and I will corroborate that. Under cryptocurrency and bitcoin, Nigeria comes second right? But in the global size of the economy, Nigeria comes 27th.\n\n\u201cSo do you think that there is some correlation? You think those countries whose economies are second and 26th will allow you to grow your cryptocurrency business to second position, if what is inside is a big deal that is going to profit everybody?\u201d\n\nEmefiele added: \u201cOf course, we saw it that the market collapsed\u2026Elon Musk twitted sometime about the time the CBN said our banking and payment infrastructure will no longer be available for cryptocurrency transactions \u2013 he twitted, that he was going to invest about $1.5 billion in crypto and the rates went to the highest roof.\n\n\u201cAnd he then twitted again and raised a fee concerns and the thing plunged. Elon Musk had himself decided that he will no longer deal in cryptos.\n\n\u201cAnd so if a man who felt it was good suddenly decides to say it\u2019s no longer good and then you\u2026don\u2019t forget, those who invented crypto said it is encrypted.\n\n\u201cWhen they say it\u2019s encrypted, it means that whatever is happening between me and you is only know to the two of us. And you know what? In case I defraud you because it is encrypted,y ou can\u2019t even disclose my name and you can\u2019t even get your money back.\u201d\n\nHowever, the CBN, while commending government\u2019s efforts in combating the headwinds imposed by the pandemic, advised against another nationwide lockdown as was experienced in 2020, adding that this will reverse the gains jointly achieved between the government and the apex bank in response to the outbreak of COVID-19.\n\nHe said the MPC assessed the options on direction of policy in the short to medium term and re-appraised current measures by the government to purchase COVID-19 vaccines and the general preparedness of relevant public health agencies to guard against the spread of the mutating strains of the virus.\n\nAccording to him, the committee noted the appropriate steps taken by the government to ensure that up to 70 per cent of the population get vaccinated to drastically drive down the infection rate in the country and hence, sustain economic activities.\n\nHe said:\u201dThe committee noted the persisting security crisis, especially in major food producing regions of the country and the severe toll on food supply and prices. It noted that inflation had moderated marginally due to the unrelenting effort of the bank in supporting agriculture to boost food supply and prices.\n\n\u201cThe committee, thus, reiterated its call to the government to intensify effort towards addressing the security situation in the country to ease supply bottlenecks and bring down food prices.\n\n\u201cThe MPC further noted government\u2019s commitment towards investing in public infrastructure despite constrained fiscal position and urged a continued focus on this objective, while exploring the option of effective partnership with the private sector, as improved road networks, telecommunications and power supply will greatly and proactively impact the supply chain and moderate price increments.\u201d\n\nEmefiele also stressed the need for collaboration with Nigeria\u2019s huge population living abroad, through the issuance of diaspora bonds targeted at specific infrastructure projects.\n\nThis is even as the committee noted that the public debt stock was currently high, it was of the view that project specific diaspora bond issues could conveniently pay itself back without imposing a burden on government finances.\n\nThe committee also noted the complementary role this would play in boosting foreign exchange supply, accretion to reserves and easing of the current exchange rate pressure.\n\nIn arriving at a decision to hold the rates, Emefiele said whereas the committee remained committed to supporting the efforts of the federal government in restorating the productive capacity of the economy, members remained much more focused towards achieving price stability in the short to medium-term.\n\nHe stated that economic growth could be hampered in an environment of unstable prices adding therefore, that the choice between loosening the stance of policy to ease credit further or tightening to moderate price development or maintaining a hold stance in order to allow previous policy measures continue to permeate the economy while observing global and domestic developments.\n\nHe said an expansionary stance of policy could transmit to reduced pricing of the loan portfolios of Deposit Money Banks and result, therefore, in cheaper credit to the real sector of the economy.\n\nHe added, however, that this expected transmission may be constrained by persisting security challenges and infrastructural deficits.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, while a contractionary stance will only address the monetary component of price development, supply side constraints such as the security crisis and infrastructural deficits can only be addressed by policies outside the purview of the central bank.\n\n\u201cA tight stance in the view of members, will also hamper the bank\u2019s objectives of providing low cost credit to households, Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), Agriculture, and other output growth and employment stimulating sectors of the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "He also announced that the central bank has been encouraged to increase its COVID-19 Targeted Credit Facility to N400 billion from N300 billion.\nAccording to Emefiele, his appeal to criminals to embrace family is because there is a linkage between security and economic growth.\nI am aware that six of them are coming to the country in the month of July and August.\n\u201cI, therefore, would like to appeal to our brothers, who decide that they want to live in bushes and forests, that they should please, begin to retreat, drop their arms and come and embrace the anchor borrowers\u2019 programme.\n\u201cI am optimistic before the end of the year that the security challenges confronting the country will substantially abate,\u201d he stated.",

I want to say here that Nigeria is at a crossroads today. The very essence of the existence of this country is under serious threat,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat started as insurgency in 2009 or so in the north-western part of Yobe has now snowballed into full scale insurgency in the entire north-east.\n\n\u201cWhat was not known to us in the north-west is now today the home of banditry and kidnapping. The north-central as we all know is not safe. It suffers the clashes between the herders and our farmers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd the recent introduction in the south-east is another serious threat to the existence of this country. Where government institutions are targeted, our police and security agencies personnel are being killed on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cOur institutions, buildings are burnt. I believe that these are threats not only to these areas but the entire nation. And our armed forces are doing their best.\n\n\u201cA criminal has only one name and that is criminal. No criminal should have comfort in his ethnic enclave. Whoever, where that person is, once he is a criminal, he is simply a criminal and must be dealt with in the appropriate manner regardless of where he or she is coming from.\n\n\u201cIt is also important that we provide resources \u2014 more resources \u2014 for our security agencies to enable them better tackle the criminal activities across the country. And our armed forces can do that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the fact remains that we have not enabled them enough. Today in this country, there is no better investment than investing in the security of our people.\u201d\n\nLawan added that the summit will generate ideas toward tackling insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cThe essence of this summit, I am sure, is to look for ways and means of improving the performance of our armed forces and other security agencies,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis summit is essential because we are tested as a country. We are tested as a people. Criminals everywhere have found probably comfort in doing what they do.

          "text": "Senate President Ahmad Lawan says the essence of Nigeria\u2019s existence is under \u201cserious threat\u201d as a result of insecurity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLawan stated this on Wednesday at the special summit on national security organised by the house of representatives.\n\nThe summit, which was scheduled to commence on Monday, was postponed till Wednesday over the death of Ibrahim Attahiru, chief of army staff, and 10 other military officers.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Lawan said the country has come under serious security threats, adding that even law enforcement agencies are not left out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLet me start by commending the leadership of the house for organising this very special summit on national security. I want to say here that Nigeria is at a crossroads today. The very essence of the existence of this country is under serious threat,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat started as insurgency in 2009 or so in the north-western part of Yobe has now snowballed into full scale insurgency in the entire north-east.\n\n\u201cWhat was not known to us in the north-west is now today the home of banditry and kidnapping. The north-central as we all know is not safe. It suffers the clashes between the herders and our farmers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd the recent introduction in the south-east is another serious threat to the existence of this country. Where government institutions are targeted, our police and security agencies personnel are being killed on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cOur institutions, buildings are burnt. I believe that these are threats not only to these areas but the entire nation. And our armed forces are doing their best.\n\n\u201cA criminal has only one name and that is criminal. No criminal should have comfort in his ethnic enclave. Whoever, where that person is, once he is a criminal, he is simply a criminal and must be dealt with in the appropriate manner regardless of where he or she is coming from.\n\n\u201cIt is also important that we provide resources \u2014 more resources \u2014 for our security agencies to enable them better tackle the criminal activities across the country. And our armed forces can do that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut the fact remains that we have not enabled them enough. Today in this country, there is no better investment than investing in the security of our people.\u201d\n\nLawan added that the summit will generate ideas toward tackling insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cThe essence of this summit, I am sure, is to look for ways and means of improving the performance of our armed forces and other security agencies,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis summit is essential because we are tested as a country. We are tested as a people. Criminals everywhere have found probably comfort in doing what they do. This is the time for the legislature and executive arm of government to come even closer in finding solutions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI want to take this opportunity to appeal and ask the executive arm of government to implement whatever would be the outcome of this summit.\u201d",

          "text": "OPay is reportedly in talks to raise $400 million from investors at a valuation of $1.5 billion, according to an exclusive report from The Information.\n\nOPay is looking to raise funding to finance its expansion plan, having launched in Egypt this year. The payments giant says it processed $1.4 billion in payments in October 2020 alone, and that number also reportedly increased to $2 billion by December 2020.\n\nHaving done impressively in Nigeria since its launch in 2018, the new push for funding means that the company has bigger plans.\n\nAn Africa-focused company with Chinese backers\n\nWhile OPay is based in Nigeria, its backers are mostly Chinese companies like Meituan, a multi-billion-dollar Chinese shopping platform.\n\nIn July 2019, OPay raised $50 million from Sequoia Capital, IDG Capital, Source Code, GSR Ventures and Meituan-Dianping. Opera itself also invested in the round. Four months later, it raised a massive $120 million in a Series B round.\n\nThe company\u2019s initial play seemed to be focused on building a super-app, and it led with its popular bike-hailing service, ORide. But the ban on bike hailing in Nigeria stopped that, and the company focused on what had always been at its core: payments.\n\nThe pandemic is one factor that spurred growth for OPay, and as social distancing and Covid-19 regulations made banking halls challenging to access, more people are leaning on mobile money services. The company also has plans to roll out debit and credit cards.\n\nCompetition in the mobile payments space is stiff; while at one time OPay seemed to be the only company growing its agent network, other rivals have now tapped into the same network. Telcos like MTN and Airtel are spinning their mobile money arm into standalone businesses as they are betting on it for the future.\n\nIt means that at home, where OPay may claim dominance, challengers are arising, and outside Nigeria, grabbing market share from more established players will be no easy feat. Yet, should they successfully raise $400 million, it will be the kind of war chest that makes anything possible.",

          "title": "Dominic Joshua\u2019s \u2018hedge fund\u2019 paid out 30% monthly returns. Then the scam unravelled",
          "text": "He claimed to be investing in real estate, forex and Chanel. There was no proof.\n\nIn December 2020, Michelle Adigun* transferred \u20a6300,000 ($750) to Brisk Capital, an investment firm she discovered on Instagram. The firm promised to pay her 30% of that capital for three consecutive months.\n\nThe promise was fulfilled. The last 30% was paid alongside her initial capital. Thrilled by this, Adigun more than doubled her commitment to \u20a6700,000 on March 2, 2021. Same monthly promise as above. No questions asked.\n\nBut on the 2nd of April when she was to receive the first payment, Adigun did not. \u201cThis is when trouble suddenly started,\u201d she says to TechCabal.\n\nThat payment arrived two weeks later after Adigun repeatedly pressured Dominic Ngene Joshua, the founder and head of Brisk Capital, on Instagram. But that was as good as it got. No return has been paid for May.\n\nAdigun says her sister also invested in Brisk Capital but never received any returns. They and two other people, who spoke to TechCabal anonymously, are among the latest victims of a familiar scam couched as an investment opportunity in Nigeria.\n\nJoshua, the 21-year-old self-styled \u2018Investment Maestro\u2019 behind the Brisk wheel, is now in the custody of the Nigeria Police Force on a number of charges including investment fraud and stealing. A picture of him holding a board with those charges is dated May 1st 2021.\n\nSource: Nnamdi Chife/Twitter\n\nThe police say that Joshua has diverted \u20a62 billion from over 500 investors. He has spent some of that money on \u201cparties, exotic cars, luxury watches, real estate in Abuja, Lagos and Port-Harcourt,\u201d according to a statement from the special fraud unit on Monday.\n\nHow the heck did a 21-year-old do all that in barely six months?\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk business\u201d\n\nBrisk Capital joined Twitter in October 2020. On the 19th of the same month, Joshua\u2019s caption on his first Instagram photo read \u201cLet\u2019s Talk Business. I am back\u2026\u201d\n\nHe had apparently been off social media for one year and had spent time \u201clearning and building a legacy focused on helping people gain financial security.\u201d\n\nIn the weeks and months that followed, his Instagram became a well-curated gallery of professionally taken pictures with apt captions. When EndSARS protesters were shot in Lekki, he said the right things \u2013 calling for calm and mourning the dead.\n\nAfter that week, he moved on to themes more in sync with the brand he was building: wealth, success and investments.\n\n\u201cFor the remaining part of the year, I would be committed towards empowering 5 business owners with $100 each every Friday,\u201d he said on October 26, 2020. Winners would be picked from the comments section. \u201c#fundsfriday.\u201d\n\nPerhaps that should have raised questions but Joshua did not invent giveaways on social media. Influencers with verifiable jobs do it all the time but anyone with enough followers and an image of wealth can also find a thirsty audience. Joshua did not have to prove anything about his job and income even if he was just twenty years old.\n\nPosh Josh sells Chanel\n\nEmpowered with an increasingly posh image and a slick Brisk Capital website, Joshua began taking funds from willing investors.\n\nThere is no difficulty with Brisk. We make investment a simple journey for you by taking the right investment decisions that yield the best result. We take up this responsibility and make your decision to invest a smooth, stress-free and easy one.\u201d Brisk Capital\n\nNnamdi Chife runs Chive GPS, a firm based in Abuja which does debt recovery and background checks. A client contacted him in December saying he wanted to invest with Joshua to earn the promised 30% monthly returns.\n\nAs part of a background check, Chife says he spoke with Joshua to verify Brisk Capital\u2019s business portfolio and investment methodology.\n\nJoshua explained that he invests his pool of client funds in real estate, forex trades and high-value fashion brands like Chanel \u2013 supposedly as a licensee who receives discounts on products.\n\nChife was anything but convinced, advising his client against investing.\n\nAn advisory note from ChiveGPS, a consultancy, to a client who wanted to invest with Dominic Joshua\u2019s Brisk Capital. Source: Chive GPS.\n\n\u201cThere was no record anywhere to establish that he did what he did,\u201d Chife says to TechCabal, describing Brisk Capital as a product-backed Ponzi scheme.\n\n\u201cWhat he provided was a manipulated dashboard of supposed forex trades.\u201d\n\nBut Joshua convinced people that he was legit. Adigun and one other victim say they were partly convinced to invest after a dinner party in December where some music artists performed. Rema, a Nigerian artist, made a gleeful post on Twitter celebrating returns from Brisk.\n\nScreenshot of a tweet by Rema, a Nigerian artist. It is not clear if this was a pad campaign on Brisk Capital\u2019s behalf.\n\nJoshua also had foot soldiers who drove sign-ups.\n\nOne victim who invested \u20a6500,000 and received 30% returns in February and March of this year says she was convinced by Brisk Capital\u2019s marketers in her school, Abia State University. According to Chife, one person brought in hundreds of people who invested up to \u20a6700 million with Brisk Capital.\n\nBut dark clouds began to converge around Joshua in April. After a heady start, his book was now filled with promises of payouts; too many to fulfill.\n\nVictims say Joshua and Brisk Capital stopped responding to payment enquiries on WhatsApp. The latest posts on the company\u2019s Instagram and Twitter accounts are from March.\n\nDoominic\n\nOn April 19, Chive GPS sent a demand notice to Joshua. It was on behalf of a client who had not received the second payment for a \u20a6200 million investment made in December.\n\nWhen Joshua failed to respond to the notice, Chive GPS involved the Nigeria Police\u2019s Special Fraud Unit. They tracked and arrested Joshua who was already making plans to leave Nigeria according to Chife whose tweet this week brought Joshua\u2019s escapades to light.\n\nThe Police said some of the properties Joshua bought with his victims\u2019 deposits have been recovered. He will be charged to a Federal High Court when an ongoing strike by the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria ends.\n\nVictims hope the process will help recover their deposits. \u201cI invested \u20a6200,000 in December, which was due by March.

I am just surprised that the guy\u2019s intent was to defraud after all.\u201d\n\nApparently, Joshua has admitted his crimes to the Police, pleading for time to return what he owes.

          "title": "Dr Vuyane Mhlomi is helping patients receive treatment from the comfort of their own homes",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is telling the stories of Africans making a difference in the world of tech.\n\nBefore he turned ten, a typical Friday would find Vuyane Mhlomi on one of many trains making his way back home from school.\n\nHis journey typically did not end at home. He would only stop there to pick up a change of clothes for his father who was very often hospitalised due to his poorly controlled diabetes.\n\nCoupled with his mother\u2019s cardiac condition, Vuyane spent a lot of his time in hospital queues waiting for any one of his parents to be attended to.\n\nHe tells me that the doctors worked hard. There were just too many people who needed help and not many doctors wanted to move to Khayelitsha, his hometown, due to the high crime rate.\n\nToday, Vuyane is a medical doctor, Rhodes scholar, and the co-founder of Quro Medical \u2013 a startup making it possible for patients to receive the best care from the comfort of their homes.\n\nWhile the company was founded in 2018, the pandemic made a case for what they had always wanted to achieve \u2013 a way for doctors to care for their patients outside of the hospital.\n\n\u201cThere is overwhelming scientific evidence that demonstrates that patients do better at home, but we have very hospi-centric healthcare systems that incentivise treatment in dedicated facilities,\u201d he said during our Google Meet call.\n\nFrom Khayelitsha to Oxford and back to Cape Town, his journey has been one of resilience and a desire to make healthcare accessible for everyone.\n\nHe is Dr Vuyane Mhlomi and this is his life in tech.\n\n\u201cCall my son, my son\u2019s a doctor\u201d\n\nOn the day he graduated from the University of Cape Town, Vuyane was all smiles. He had just finished in the top three of his class and he was standing on the steps outside UCT\u2019s Jameson Hall granting an interview to the Cape Times.\n\nIn this interview he spoke of his mother, Nomsa.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy mom has been my mother and my father. This belongs to her,\u201d he said.\n\nVuyane with his mother Nomsa at his graduation from UCT\n\nVuyane lost his father when he was eleven years old. His mother was left to care for him, his three siblings, and a few cousins, on her own.\n\n\u201cI remember at one point, there were about ten of us in the household,\u201d he told me.\n\nThe family relied on his mother\u2019s disability checks and social grants to get by and of course to go to school.\n\n\u201cI mean, we didn\u2019t grow up in squalor, my mum really did try to provide. But we were definitely poor.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in Khayelitsha was tough and from a young age, Vuyane knew that education was the one way he could possibly move upward socially. This was how he fell in love with studying; it was the way to change things \u2013 his ticket out.\n\nWhen the time came to choose a course to study, medicine was the winning choice.\n\nWhile his decision was due, in part, to the many hours spent sitting and waiting for a doctor to attend to his parents, Vuyane remembers one event that solidified his decision.\n\nIt was in his last year of high school. On the night before his matric exams, his mother had a stroke that they were lucky enough to catch early. She had developed a clot in her heart from an undiagnosed cardiac complication from when she was a kid and that clot had dislodged and gone to her brain.\n\nThankfully, she was able to get access to therapy and this helped to dissolve the clot and limited further neurological damage.\n\n\u201cAnd that inspired me. It told me that when medicine works in the way that it\u2019s supposed to work, there\u2019s a real potential to save lives.\u201d\n\nThere is something to be said about what happens when your loved ones buy into your dreams. In the middle of her stroke, with her speech slurred, Vuyane\u2019s mother said to the doctors attending to her, \u201cCall my son, my son\u2019s a doctor. Call my son.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was in grade 12, he had only just applied to study medicine and was yet to even write his entrance examinations. But there she was, in a time when she did not need to think of anything else, speaking of his dreams as if they had already come to fruition.\n\nOn the day he walked across the stage to accept his medical degree, in her excitement she would tell the Cape Times, \u201cI was sweating. I was sick. I was happy.\u201d\n\nThe road to Rhodes and the birth of a businessman\n\nAfter graduating from UCT, Vuyane could finally begin practicing as a doctor. He began his internship at Soweto\u2019s Chrishani Baragwanath Academic Hospital.\n\nIn his second year there, he applied for the prestigious Rhodes scholarship to Oxford University.\n\n\u201cI was determined to do a PhD, so I reached out to a prospective supervisor \u2013 who did not return my calls.\u201d\n\nNot one to back down easily, Vuyane made calls to Oxford to ask why he was being ignored. His call would eventually get picked up by a professor who was intrigued by his tenacity. He got an interview and the rest they say is history.\n\nIn his Rhodes profile, Vuyane speaks of the opportunity and acknowledges what his being there meant.\n\n\u201cYou can be a Rhodes Scholar even if you are from Khayelitsha.\u201d\n\nVuyane would pursue a PhD in cardiology with his thesis centering around the interesting concept of how the hearts of pregnant women rapidly increase in size to accommodate the foetus but they increase in a way that should normally cause a heart to go into shock.\n\nIn many ways this reminds me of the work Quro Medical is doing today in the field of Remote Fetal Monitoring \u2013 allowing doctors to keep a close watch of a pregnant mother and her foetus while she remains in the comfort of her home.\n\nFollowing his PhD, Vuyane began to figure out next steps.\n\n\u201cThe PhD is an incredibly lonely journey which kind of forces you to reflect a lot about your life and what it is you want to do.\u201d\n\nBy this time he knew he wanted to return home and improve the healthcare system in South Africa. He was a doctor now and could help patients but he knew he didn\u2019t want to just see one patient at a time. He could do more.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d always been entrepreneurial. However, the nature of our academic programmes was not to support anyone who had an interest in business. I recognised that I lacked the commercial attitude that would help me realise and bring the kind of projects that I had in mind to life such as Quro.\u201d\n\nVuyane enrolled in the Sa\u00efd Business School MBA at Oxford shortly after completing his doctoral studies. He would meet one of his co-founders and Quro\u2019s Chief Scientific Officer, Rob Cornish during this MBA.\n\nVuyane returned to South Africa ready to start a business that would change the healthcare landscape forever.\n\nStarting Quro and entrepreneuring while black in South Africa\n\nBefore starting Quro, Vuyane had tried setting up another tele-medicine startup with his friend, business partner and Quro\u2019s co-founder and COO, Zikho Pali. The venture didn\u2019t go far but it did provide a good springboard for the work they would eventually do.\n\nIn April, Quro announced they raised $1.1 million in a seed round. This was huge for many reasons.\n\nOn one hand, Quro finally had capital to begin expanding their services across South Africa and beyond. On the other hand it marked the beginning of a relationship with investors who were truly interested in their wellbeing.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that Zikho and I reflect on quite a bit is the manner in which the investors that we\u2019ve got engaged with us. It was a clear reflection that they didn\u2019t subscribe to the kind of belief systems and whatnot; that we see with white South Africans, given the history and culture of apartheid.\u201d\n\nWith a brilliant idea to bring healthcare directly to patients at home and the numerous use cases the pandemic helped explore, I tried to find out from Vuyane what were some issues he\u2019d faced in pushing a solution that I believe should have guaranteed support on all fronts.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realise how being black would count against me,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHere I was, having done all that people usually say you need to do; get yourself a solid degree, be on a prestigious scholarship, get yourself an MBA, if possible.\n\nI checked all of those things that people say contribute towards your success as an entrepreneur and people wanting to back you.\u201d\n\nBut the reality for black entrepreneurs like Vuyane in South Africa is that they need to go through even more hurdles to get a chance to be listened to.\n\nHe highlights a culture where black entrepreneurs are not getting \u2018backed\u2019 in the real sense. Many people are offered \u2018mentorships\u2019 but this is rarely followed up with actual capital.\n\n\u201cJeff Bezos, Steve Jobs and all of these guys, none of them were backed because they had a single idea and they made zero mistakes, backing someone recognises that you\u2019re going to make mistakes and you\u2019ll pivot as part of the business.\n\nHowever, when we look at the opportunities that have been given to black entrepreneurs in this country, across Africa, you\u2019re not being backed. You\u2019ve been given one miracle, and you\u2019re asked to make a wish. And your role is to try and make sure that you don\u2019t make those mistakes. And I do think that that\u2019s the culture that needs to change, that when we talk about backing black entrepreneurs and African entrepreneurs in particular, we need to make sure that we do just that, that we provide an ecosystem for them to learn.\u201d\n\nAn African solution to a global problem\n\nVuyane loves to cook. He also loves to travel. These are things he does often and, as soon as it is possible, he hopes to do soon. He would like to visit countries in West Africa.\n\nWhen I ask what plans he has for Quro\u2019s expansion across Africa, he gives what I consider a poignant answer.\n\n\u201cI always push back when people say this is an African solution to African problems. This is a global problem. We\u2019re seeing this everywhere. So in our context, it may be an African solution to a global problem.\u201d\n\nFor Vuyane, the goal is simple \u2013 to take over the world.",

          "text": "Lagos, Nigeria. 26th of May, 2021. \u2013 In the recently released Africa\u2019s Best Brands 2021, TECNO ranked for five consecutive years among the TOP 6 brands on the African continent, marking another prestigious recognition of the brand\u2019s leadership in Africa.\n\nEstablished in 2011, the Brand Africa 100: Africa\u2019s Best Brands rankings is the most authoritative survey and analysis on brands and underlying businesses in Africa, based on a study by Geopoll across 28 countries spanning all the five economic regions and analysis and ranking by Kantar and Brand Leadership. Collectively they account for over 80% of the population and over 80% of the GDP of Africa. The 2021 survey was conducted between March and April 2021 and yielded over 80,000 brand mentions and over 3,500 unique brands.\n\nSince its entry into the African market, TECNO\u2019s operations have been customer focused. Year in year out, they have ensured that their offerings are tailored to meet the needs of Africans.\n\nSpeaking to this at a virtual event organised by Brand Africa, Vincent Uzoegbu, Public Communications Manager, TECNO said; \u201cFrom the first day of our business, TECNO made a strategic decision to focus exclusively on Africa, and when we first entered Africa, our core strategy was to focus on sub-Saharan Africa, where mobile phone penetration was still very low and largely ignored by global mobile phone manufacturers. The aim was to bring a mobile phone that would suit African consumers and improve the lives of as many people in Africa as possible by bridging the digital gap through technology and innovation.\u201d\n\nTECNO has worked tirelessly all these years to do just that. With the brand\u2019s Phantom, Camon, Spark and Pova smartphone series, TECNO has been able to set numerous records that define its success and popularity on the continent, evident of its dogged resolve to present Africa with the best of technology and innovation. When TECNO launched dual SIM cards in Africa, there had been nothing of the kind before then. TECNO was also the first to develop long-lasting batteries that lasted 3 days to combat the epileptic power supply in places like Nigeria. The brand was also the first to bring camera solutions on their smartphones that suited the predominant African dark skin.\n\nAfter more than a decade of commitment and consistency, the rewards are finally falling in. Earlier in the year, Counterpoint Research ranked TECNO as Africa\u2019s number one smartphone brand in 2020, stating that TECNO made its breakthroughs in mobile photography technology and continued investment in the market throughout the pandemic despite a challenging year. And now, with Brand Africa\u2019s new rankings, TECNO has once again come out tops, becoming a leading player in mid to high-end mobile brand segments in Africa.\n\nAttai Oguche, Marketing Manager TECNO Nigeria said; \u201cWe\u2019re very honoured to be listed again amongst Africa\u2019s Best Brands ranking this year and to be part of the key contributors to the development of African business. Shouldering African consumers\u2019 trust and great support, we will keep the momentum to continuously unlock our best of contemporary products and technologies for consumers across Africa and inspire them to pursue a better life via mobile technology innovations.\u201d\n\nAbout TECNOTECNO Mobile is a smartphone brand from TRANSSION Holdings. With \u201cStop at Nothing\u201d as its brand essence, TECNO is committed to unlocking the best contemporary technologies for progressive individuals across global emerging markets, giving them elegantly designed products that inspires consumers to uncover a world of possibilities.

          "text": "OctaFX brought two popular bloggers together in a cooking studio: the comedian Apaokagi Maryam and the music video director Abdulazeez Greene. They prepared a special evening meal for Ramadan called Iftar and compared the subtleties of cooking with those ingrained in trading.\n\n\u2018Ramadan Special\u2019 is the first cooking show in Nigeria produced by a financial company. However, OctaFX had two great reasons for this accomplishment.\n\nFirst, the company honoured the Holy Month along with its clients. Ramadan is about being with your family, and what better way to bring the relatives together than cooking a tasty meal?\n\nSecond, trading and cooking surprisingly have a lot in common. The two hosts of the show explored this correlation while putting together ingredients for their very own blend of Iftar\u2014a popular evening meal for Ramadan.\n\nThe duo prepared this particular version of iftar quite close to Nigerian tradition, including a fruit salad, grilled chicken, grapes, dates, jollof rice, and a vegetable salad. Influencers Abdulazeez Greene and Apaokagi Maryam rose up to the challenge to deliver this delicious meal.\n\nApaokagi Maryam is a frequent collaborator of the global Forex broker and took part in the last OctaFX Goal Booster promotion. According to Rosbena, she ranked first among the \u2018Top Ten Nigerian Instagram Comedians\u2019. Neither influencers are professional traders but have already had their fair share of exciting Forex encounters.\n\nThe show went live on YouTube on 8 May and is available for viewing. This is not OctaFX\u2019s first take on producing a show. The company enjoys experimenting with formats to bring its clients the most engaging and useful content. In March 2021, OctaFX stepped into an exciting collaboration with the popular rapper Peruzzi, taking part in his music video \u2018Somebody Baby\u2019.\n\nOctaFX is committed to educating its clients about trading in accessible and appealing ways. The company is aspiring to create more shows like \u2018Ramadan Special\u2019 in the future.\n\nOctaFX is a global broker that provides online trading services worldwide since 2011. It offers a state-of-the-art trading experience to over 7 million trading accounts globally. OctaFX has won more than 40 awards since its foundation, including the \u2018Best ECN Broker 2020\u2019 award from World Finance and more recently the 2020 \u2018Best Forex Broker Nigeria\u2019 award and the 2020\u2032\n\nMost Transparent Broker\u2019 award from Global Banking & Finance Review and Forex Awards, respectively.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nNCC to take subscribers\u2019 IMEI | Newsbites\n\nMay 26: New Episode!

Techpoint Africa's editorial team doesn't write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email [email protected]\n\nIn the recently released Africa\u2019s Best Brands 2021, TECNO ranked for five consecutive years among the TOP 6 brands on the African continent, marking another prestigious recognition of the brand\u2019s leadership in Africa.\n\nEstablished in 2011, the Brand Africa 100: Africa\u2019s Best Brands rankings is the most authoritative survey and analysis on brands and underlying businesses in Africa, based on a study by Geopoll across 28 countries spanning all the five economic regions and analysis and ranking by Kantar and Brand Leadership. Collectively they account for over 80% of the population and over 80% of the GDP of Africa. The 2021 survey was conducted between March and April 2021 and yielded over 80,000 brand mentions and over 3,500 unique brands.\n\nSince its entry into the African market, TECNO\u2019s operations have been customer focused. Year in year out, they have ensured that their offerings are tailored to meet the needs of Africans.\n\nSpeaking to this at a virtual event organised by Brand Africa, Vincent Uzoegbu, Public Communications Manager, TECNO said; \u201cFrom the first day of our business, TECNO made a strategic decision to focus exclusively on Africa, and when we first entered Africa, our core strategy was to focus on sub-Saharan Africa, where mobile phone penetration was still very low and largely ignored by global mobile phone manufacturers. The aim was to bring a mobile phone that would suit African consumers and improve the lives of as many people in Africa as possible by bridging the digital gap through technology and innovation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTECNO has worked tirelessly all these years to do just that. With the brand\u2019s Phantom, Camon, Spark and Pova smartphone series, TECNO has been able to set numerous records that define its success and popularity on the continent, evident of its dogged resolve to present Africa with the best of technology and innovation. When TECNO launched dual SIM cards in Africa, there had been nothing of the kind before then. TECNO was also the first to develop long-lasting batteries that lasted 3 days to combat the epileptic power supply in places like Nigeria. The brand was also the first to bring camera solutions on their smartphones that suited the predominant African dark skin.\n\nAfter more than a decade of commitment and consistency, the rewards are finally falling in. Earlier in the year, Counterpoint Research ranked TECNO as Africa\u2019s number one smartphone brand in 2020, stating that TECNO made its breakthroughs in mobile photography technology and continued investment in the market throughout the pandemic despite a challenging year. And now, with Brand Africa\u2019s new rankings, TECNO has once again come out tops, becoming a leading player in mid to high-end mobile brand segments in Africa.\n\nAttai Oguche, Marketing Manager TECNO Nigeria said; \u201cWe\u2019re very honoured to be listed again amongst Africa\u2019s Best Brands ranking this year and to be part of the key contributors to the development of African business.

Yusuf Buba (APC-Adamawa) made the call in a statement on Wednesday after the committee interfaced with the Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Mr Gabriel Aduda in Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, the entire petition which held itself as a \u201cNon- Paper\u201d, with no authors and signatures was a mere calculated attempt by a faceless group hiding under the banner of a pressure group to halt the ongoing reforms.\n\nBuba said that the reform is dealing with the many years of suspected systemic corruption and official malfeasance in the ministry.\n\nHe described the petition as an attempt to thwart every move to sanitise the operations of the ministry\u2019s headquarters and the foreign missions abroad in order to continue to maintain their vicious grip on the ministry.\n\nThe lawmaker said that no group should be allowed to make such weighty allegations in public without putting their names to the document.\n\nThe lawmaker said that the writers of the faceless petition had sought nothing positive to achieve other than to maliciously malign the characters of the leadership of the ministry and the nation at large.\n\n\u201cPart of the allegations contained in the so- called petition dealt extensively with the fiscal years of 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively.\n\n\u201cMembers, therefore, wondered why Aduda, who assumed duties in January 2021 at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after his redeployment from the Ministry of Sports and Youth Development, was particularly singled out for castigation and indictment.\n\n\u201cThe committee calls on the security agencies to fish out the authors of the petition, which members observed, sought to place the image of the ministry and by extension, that of the entire Nigerian nation, in bad light globally.\n\n\u201cWe laud the current efforts, amidst great challenges, that have been made to promote the mandate of the ministry and drive President Buhari\u2019s reforms agenda by Aduda.\n\n\u201cHe has indeed, pointed out the way he intends to go in actualising the dreams of the National Assembly for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\n\u201cAs a result, the committee, unanimously commends the permanent secretary for his dogged commitment to upholding the reforms of President Buhari at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBuba said that the committee condemned in very strong terms the mischief and malicious damage contained in the said \u201cNon \u2013 Paper\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, some of these suspected corrupt acts and alleged official malfeasance, as is well-known, have been the infamous subjects of recent investigations by the National Assembly.\n\nBuba said that information available to the committee by independent sources, showed a long retinue of accomplices and benefactors inside and outside the Ministry.\n\nHe, however, called for a forensic audit on the finances of the Ministry in those fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020 with a view to ascertaining the true position of things in relation to the finances of the Ministry in those years.\n\nThe statement quoted Aduda to have described the petition as unfortunate saying that it came at a time efforts were being made to put things in their proper places in the ministry.\n\nAduda thanked committee for its commitment to ensuring that things were done right in the ministry, promising to do everything necessary to put the ministry in the right order.\n\nHe pledged to continue to reposition the ministry towards achieving its mandate and role of promoting the image of the nation through their representational mission of the country in the global community.\n\n...",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBuba Galadima, a former ally of President Muhammadu Buhari, has denied his affiliation with any of Nigeria\u2019s two dominant political parties.\n\nMr Galadima, at a webinar tagged \u201cIntra-Party Democracy in Nigeria: Challenges and Solution,\u201d said he has ceased being a member of either the All Progressives Congress (APC) or the country\u2019s main opposition, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nAt the webinar organised by the Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ), he presented himself as the National Chairman of the breakaway of the APC called Reformed All Progressives Congress (rAPC) adding that \u201dthe rAPC is coming back to take Nigeria\u2019s political space by storm\u201d.\n\n\u201cI want to make the biggest correction, I am not, I am not a member of the PDP. I am not. I am the national chairman of the breakaway rAPC and I remain so,\u201d Mr Galadima clarified.\n\n\u201cI want the nation to know that very soon, Nigeria will hear from us in the political environment with a big bang.\u201d\n\nThe rAPC broke away at the peak of the crisis which rocked the APC in 2018, accusing Mr Buhari-led government of underperformance and inability to live up to its promises for good governance three years after winning the first election.\n\nMr Galadima, a former National Secretary of defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), was one of the signatories to the merger that birthed the APC.\n\nIn his contribution as one of the four panelists at the Wednesday webinar designed to interrogate Nigeria\u2019s intra-party democracy since 1999, Mr Buhari\u2019s former ally said the country\u2019s politicians, himself inclusive, had failed to learn lessons on the subject.\n\nHe, alongside three other panelists, agreed that Nigeria\u2019s intra-party democracy \u201dremains crawling as money politics and candidate imposition had continued to rule political parties rather than true democratic tenets\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne could have thought that internal party democracy would be our watchword. If you cannot do justice to members of your party, how do you expect God to do justice to you. We must access the issues of electoral reform in Nigeria. It is only the people that have the right to choose who will represent them,\u201d Mr Galadima said.\n\nWhile he condemned the lack of internal democracy within the ruling APC and the PDP, other members of the panelists said minor parties in the country are also guilty of similar deficiencies.\n\nEzenwa Nwagwu of the Peering Advocacy and Advancement Centre in Africa (PAACA), raised the need to end this trend which he argued was ushered into the system by President Olusegun Obasanjo after the country returned to democratic governance in 1999.\n\n\u201cWe need to find a way to disrupt this inglorious decisions. If people don\u2019t own these political parties they cannot be stakeholders,\u201d he said.\n\nIn her assessment of the parties since the country return to democracy, the Director of Centre for Democracy (CDD), Idayat Hassan, posited that Nigeria\u2019s political parties have undermined \u201ctheir function as a school of democracy.\u201d\n\nAt the event sponsored by the European Union, the panelists advocated more open democratic system within individual party as well as more coordinated approaches from Nigeria\u2019s electoral body, INEC.",

          "title": "Children must be brought up to be most innovative \u2013 Modupe Adeyinka-Oni",
          "text": "Mrs. Modupe Adeyinka-Oni has been involved with teaching youngsters for 38 years. She was a teacher at the Corona Schools before establishing Standard Bearers School, Lekki some 24 years ago. She is very passionate about matters that have to do with the application of technology in the school system,bridging the gap between different categories of schools in the country, education for all and the continued development of the teacher. Here are excerpts from an interview with her:\n\nStandard Bearers School is 24 years old and you have raised children across this span of time. Now you see your products out there, children you have raised, and who have gone on to play roles in society. How do you connect with this as an educationist?\n\nIt is very simple. I was working with Corona School and I had a very fantastic career, I enjoyed my job but my first child was slightly introverted and I came to realize that the big school didn\u2019t really work for him. Corona school delivered their service in that the children did very well. But sometimes it goes beyond doing well in school. It is also about having the freedom to choose and having been taught in a different way myself, I could connect with the need for a bit more engagement. And I felt that my son would probably benefit from a smaller school.\n\nAs an educationist also, I could reflect on the positive and the negative sides of his school vis-\u00e0-vis his personality. I say this because before my son started with Corona, he had been in a very small nursery school. Now at Corona, for literally one and a half term, my son would go out at break time, stand on one spot, watch the other children play, and not play with anyone.\n\nAs a young mother, I was anxious. And because I was also a popular teacher in the school, everybody wanted to also play with him. I kept on talking about it at home, and then one day he decided to play with them, but he still didn\u2019t go out there to make a lot of friends.\n\nDifferent schools work for different children. And so, I needed a school where my children would not just go but will thrive. I did not go on and pull him out of Corona school at this time though because I didn\u2019t even understand it the way I understand it now. He however left to come to my school much later and that was because I discovered a learning gap and that gap was in reading. My son is extremely brilliant and he has the ability to memorize anything.\n\nBut then I discovered that though he was coming up in unit position in class, he couldn\u2019t read. We went through a series of questions and answers with him, and finally he revealed to us that his teacher had called him ode because when he came to the school, he was using phonics to pronounce words. And she said: \u2018why are you reading like an ode, read properly.\u2019 He didn\u2019t know what ode was, but other children laughed. And he made up his mind that he was never going to read in class again because he didn\u2019t want to be called ode.\n\nWhen they call him to read, he would just stand there. \u2018Okay you don\u2019t want to read, go and sit down.\u2019 And I didn\u2019t get to know about this until the summer of his fourth year, and when he was going to Grade 5.\n\nAnd so he came over to our school and in six months he was reading. And he tells the story with pride anytime; \u2018I learnt to read in primary 5, I learnt it and imbibed it, and not only did I then want to read but I also wanted to write.\u2019 He is indeed very good when it comes to reading and writing skills.\n\nSo, in talking about my children here in the school, and what I think is most notable about them, I will say it is their confidence. We don\u2019t tell them what they cannot do, rather we tell them that if you can dream it, you can do it. We are a small school, a family school, and we believe that children should be able to express themselves in their natural environment. Because if there is anything to correct, it is through their expression that we can see it. We make it a way of life for them, so, they are forever performing.\n\nWe dance. It is a skill that I came to understand, like speaking and listening, is also a language of communication and the children actually ascribe high value to it.\n\nDance for us is mandatory. I tell them when you get to secondary school and they call on you to dance, please step out and dance. Because that is one singular thing that will define where people place you. You don\u2019t know it but I know it as an educator.\n\nWhere the children will place you in terms of the seniors and where the staff will place you. They will say you are forward, but indeed if they see you as forward, they will continue to engage you in that way. So, it is mandatory for us. We got them a very good dance teacher who takes them through what we call creative development. Creative development is about dance, spoken word, drama, and music. And in this way, we have improvised a curriculum that is still fashioned along the line of the Nigerian and British curriculum but it is uniquely different in the sense that we have put the creative side of learning into everything. So, with every opportunity, we can turn any lesson into a movie production. If you came in here earlier today (International Cultural Diversity Day), every class had picked a country to focus on. The children in that class dressed themselves in the attire of, and learned about the country, and had to talk about what they learned. And every child has to say something; that is another thing that we do here.\n\nAnd so what happens when they leave? With the amount of confidence we have instilled in them and that ability to do, to innovate and think outside the box, we have had children who have gone into the entertainment world, some of them have gone to the banking sector, etc.\n\nRecently I bumped into a parent who I had not seen since the children left the school and he was so excited because he said his three children have done fantastically well because of the foundation we gave them.\n\nConfidence is a most important thing for children. For a lot of children, their voices are being drowned out under that old philosophy of children only being permitted to listen and not be heard.\n\nI believe so much in this soro soke generation; let them have their say and help them to shine the right values behind what they are saying. We are a school that has imbibed the very notable \u20187 habits of highly effective people\u2019 which we communicate through a programme called \u2018the leader in me.\u2019 So, our children understand the same thing. Right down to nursery, they know it.\n\nWhen we start putting those kinds of values in them, we believe that our children are born to be leaders, they have already learned the foundation. So, we have five pillars that we focus on: creativity, innovation, leadership, entrepreneurship, and technology. Outside of the core academics, they must absolutely embrace these five. We believe it is a combination of that and the academics that go on to set them apart. A lot of them have gone on to Ivy League universities, are working in Wall Street, Silicon Valley, etc. I have children that started in finance, and because of the knowledge of the fact that they can evolve, have also gone on to demonstrate interest in technology, Bitcoin, and stuff like that.\n\nHow do your children with such high competencies, high expectations eventually connect with the many other Nigerians who do not have the skill set we are talking about? Is there enough being done to ensure that this does not become a problem going forward?\n\nFirst of all, I want to go back to the question of those children you say we are raising. Yes, some of them are going abroad and some of them are attending universities here. Now I have mentioned the \u2018soro-soke\u2019 generation. Do you know what I think about them? Because of their education, their ability to conduct research, inquire to know more, and seek knowledge for knowledge sake, they have come to understand that the way Nigeria is being governed today is absolutely wrong. Our children are not tribal, they are not religious, indeed they respect everybody\u2019s religion. Even on issues of sexual orientation, they are not as shocked as we are.\n\nWhat I find that is unique about these children is that they are ready to work hard, and they understand that Nigeria will change when everybody is given a fair chance. And that is why those of my generation \u2013 people who went to school between 1955 and 1985 \u2013 must concede that we haven\u2019t done a good job. It is our fault.\n\nAnd I connect this to several factors, including the fact that we did not want to be in government ourselves and we thought that we were making a good decision for ourselves and our families, but the reality today is that though there are families that have benefited but Nigeria overall has suffered.\n\nSomeone said to me yesterday that when we call ourselves the giants of Africa, it is a lie. We are in truth, one of the poorest nations in Africa. In which other country do they treat their human resource the way Nigerian leaders do? When China began to educate their people, they amassed so much wealth and power that even America now feels threatened.\n\nBut what have we done? We have crippled our nation by our own selfishness and our own greed. I count myself as part of the problem because I am asking myself why do we have the private and public schools? Why is it that the private school is thriving and the public school is seemingly deteriorating? For someone who went to a public unity school, it does not make sense. I went to school with children from all types of backgrounds. I don\u2019t have an elitist mindset but somehow when we graduated and insisted on staying in our own personal spaces, we have now woken up to find out that 35% of our youth are illiterates.\n\nThen you also ask yourself; we have had 20 years of an elected government, and in these twenty years of democracy, the politicians, the leaders, the whole system, has practically failed the people.\n\nNow back to the children, the millennials, Generation Y, Generation Z; no matter how bad or corrupt they are, they will never be like our generation. This is because many of the children who came out for the #EndSARS protests are children of the elite who are questioning the decisions of their parents.\n\nIndeed, I think the first thing elite Nigerians need to do is to tell ourselves the truth because it is only through this that we can find solutions.\n\nLook at the kidnapping, I was asking the other day why is it so bad? Somebody said because people are hungry. And yes, they are hungry.\n\nSome people came to Nigeria to do a documentary of Nigeria and as they were getting ready to go back, we had a chat. From it, I found out that so many African countries no longer see us as the continental giant.\n\nI was told that it is not as if there is no corruption elsewhere in Africa, but nobody in Kenya will take a contract and not do the contract. They are so concerned about their image, especially in their communities. They want to be able to point to a project and say I did that for my community. But in Nigeria, the politicians think they can get away with it, so they just rob the nation.\n\nYou made some point about the use of technology in the educational space. That brings me to the Technovation Challenge. Thinking about it, I am asking myself how much technology can children grasp at this stage? How is it designed and how important is technology at this time?\n\nPrior to 2019, I had started to look more critically at the role of technology beyond the subject as ICT but I couldn\u2019t feel it in the mind because I am not very skilled in technology myself. In January of 2019, the coding instructor in school approached me and said there is a competition, and the period of time they had to take part in this competition was the period where they had finished their exams and I was myself trying to get my mind around how to engage the children as they had finished their exams. Exams that used to start after Easter in the country with common entrance, individual schools now set their date and time, and we start those exams now as early as October of the preceding year. So I called the children, about 5 of them, and told them that there is this competition, would they like to do it. They said yes, Mrs Oni. I said look this competition is going to require that you put in a lot of work. They said it was okay. I said it is going to require five to six hours a day, meaning you will come in and learn this thing. They said yes. Again, not everybody can get to that level of discipline at the age they were which is between 10 and 11. The whole techno-vation challenge is teaching not just the tech side of things but the business side also. So, they came in as project managers and they all had departments, learned the marketing side of things, and everybody found their own niche and together they built this app which got them into the finals. And when I got to hear that they were in the finals, the first thing that struck me was that we were in a competition with children from around the world, and most of the time without speaking their languages, the organisers were able to use technology to communicate with everybody, such that they will actually get them to collaborate on projects yet they could not speak each other\u2019s languages. I saw here there that there was something that had taken place that we had missed.\n\nThe second thing that caught my attention was that we visited Uber and we were talking to their top management and most of these people were under 30. There was only one Indian lady that was maybe like 33. And then I said to myself that something has happened here that Nigeria has refused to also allow to happen back at home. These are the people driving Uber in their jeans, khakis, and shorts. This is the environment where we are, the workforce of the future, and back in Nigeria we are still at the bottom. I had just encountered a shift and I came back with a stronger determination to ensure that we bridge the gap in our own teaching and learning.\n\nNow this is a very difficult thing to do because I had to come back and try to transmit that to my teaching staff and for a lot of us, when we look at the philosophies of education that inform our different practice in the classroom, the reality is that most teachers in Nigeria are oriented towards pouring both the wealth and limits of their knowledge into their children. So, the children are the receptors and they call it banking education.\n\nFrom my days in school, to what I saw in America, and coming back, I understood that there was a challenge. It is not easy to get people to change their teaching style, especially people who have become established. Because that pyramid shift is the toughest part of the change process. This requires having a different mindset to say the way I teach is wrong, I need to let go. It has therefore been a lot of push and pull. I model it, I talk about it, I wield the big stick if it is necessary, but at the end of the day the staff understand that my desire is to get them to be better in their teaching and to make the teaching and learning in the school more interesting.\n\nIt is the same process we have to go through nationally but our leaders don\u2019t understand it. These youths are trying to do things, trying to make a difference out there, giving online solutions to the back office of the school, to help with the collection of data, there are so many offerings, they need to be understood.\n\nI belong to a group where we have actually taken on board the assignment to actually help schools whose pupils are paying between N20-25, 000 and below as fees to help to train their teachers. And it is just a voluntary thing that we are doing.\n\nJust recently we had our first online version of the project and we were able to reach more people than we could have at a physical event. We had people from Port Harcourt and other places participating. It showed us that the teachers are actually looking for the help it is just that nobody really remembers them. We are committed to working with them. Next month, we are having another. What we do is that we partner with a few NGOs who bring us schools and they use their centres, and have representatives from various schools attending. But we also share the Zoom link for those that can go online from their private homes to join in as well. The feedback has been tremendous and we are all encouraged to keep at it.\n\nThere are so many other things. I am involved in projects working with IDP camps, we are trying to find educational and even online solutions to solving the problem of the lack of education among the IDPs. One of the pledges I made to God when I celebrated my 60th birthday was that I will dedicate time to the teaching of his children to ensure that they get better instruction. Because we are all creations of God and there is nobody that God created that he didn\u2019t give a talent to. It is the same with everybody, we are all on this line, everyone\u2019s talent is there, everyone has their place and their usefulness. For my team and for all those that have partnered with us, it is important that we correct the mistake and everybody makes a little bit of effort to support. And it is not a handout. You cannot continue to give money because it is said that it is better to teach a person to fish than to give them fish. And that is where I am.\n\nCovid happened and affected the world. You are talking about online interactions; I am not too sure a lot of that was going on before Covid?\n\nNo, it wasn\u2019t. For the education sector, Covid disrupted us into a much better place. It helped us see ourselves not just as Nigerians. One thing about Nigerians is that we compare ourselves and status by what is going on in Nigeria. But Covid pushed us to compare ourselves on a global stage, and so having exposed us to the world and exposed the world to us, there is no going back.\n\nIn education, we were teaching classes online on account of the COVID restrictions. Now, though we are back in physical school, every child is with their laptop. Assignments are done on the laptop. I tell parents when they complain about their children staying on the computer, that the key thing they have to learn from that computer is their typing speed because tomorrow that is how they are going to take their notes. Nobody writes long notes anymore and this is a good reality check for Nigerians.\n\nNow having said that, there is the expense of pivoting into digital learning and there is even a greater expense that has to be made and that is in upskilling.\n\nOn The Platform, they asked me at the end of my speech, \u2018we don\u2019t have computers, projectors, how will we do this online learning.\u2019 I said to them even my school has not yet attained to where it is supposed to be in digital learning. But the first thing beyond learning how to use the computer or projector is to identify what courses you are going to teach online. Because the teachers who are going to teach these subjects have to be taught. And many of them don\u2019t know how to put on the computer. So, it is an investment.\n\nNow during the World Economic Forum in 2019, there was this session on the future of work. And I recall a speaker saying that in sub-Saharan Africa there is going to be a loss of 55,000 jobs, but that the good news is that there will be replaced by 104,000 new jobs.\n\nThe question is how are we going to upskill the people to enter into these new jobs, because they are technology-related. We have the population, but the people that have the technology do not have the numbers. Africa has the population and does not have the knowledge. So, the world understands that they have to focus on Africa.\n\nIn fact, it is being said that in the next decade, Africa will be home to the headquarters of many global organizations. Now if that is going to happen, we have to have the local skills to take those jobs. So that got me thinking about this upscaling and upskilling. The cost of doing that is the problem. Africa/Nigeria does not have the resources for it now. The cost of building and equipping a school and training the teachers for just one school is massive. If we look at the budget of education in our country, basically what it does right now is that it pays salaries; there is no money for resources, maintenance, even sending teachers for programmes to improve themselves. And because of that, many teachers don\u2019t even know that they have inadequacies in their learning.\n\nWhen we are talking of the digital era, if we don\u2019t solve the human resource part of it then the other problem will not even go away. One of the things we are focusing on is the redevelopment of teachers, and it is only after we have gotten the trainers to our own side that we can now say let us start training the children. It is a somewhat long process but the truth is that it cannot be denied anymore; the Nigerian educational system is broken.\n\nOn the issue of the gulf in the sector and how we are to bridge it, our first note is that it wasn\u2019t always this wide. That said, we have to fix the trainers and fix the gap between the private and the public. One of the things we see now is that for beneficiaries of high-end private school education, many of them go away for more schooling and then stay abroad. Back at home, you have those who endure a lot of our broken systems which give very little value and it is these same children that some people are now calling hoodlums. I don\u2019t call them hoodlums, because at the end of the day if we failed to do something and we see the result of our own work, we should not now say that because we failed, they failed too. No, we must try educating them properly.\n\nWhy do we have so many hackers in Nigeria? Because they have gone to the dark side of the internet. Why not give them amnesty and say that this your skill, let us put you in a programme, take a job. They are brilliant, the fact that they can do the things they do shows that they are intelligent. But though many of them can do these things but they are not really able to read and write to pass and go on to the university because they were never really properly taught. But because they are smart, they are watching someone do it, and modelling the things they need to do and they do trial and error and they get it. So, they learnt on the job.\n\nIt is the same problem somewhat with Boko Haram. Half of those who are doing these things don\u2019t know that Saudi Arabia is like the city of gold where everything is so clean and fine, and Western education is thriving there. But here they are being conditioned to believe that western education is bad because they do not want their eyes opened. At the end of the day it is a lack of knowledge.\n\nIf you have to design something like an adjustment in our educational sector, take the Ministry of Education and tell us three to five things we have to turn around. What should we do, because if we don\u2019t fix education, we can\u2019t fix the country?\n\nIf I was in government and looking at what is going on, I think anybody will know that illiteracy is the problem. Whichever way we can do it, let us go back to the basics. When the white man came to Nigeria and brought education, how did they teach us their language that became our lingua franca. They taught it, they encouraged us to speak it. We saw it as something that was new, novel, and there were incentives for coming to school.\n\nWe need to look at some of the things that they did. Yes, some of the things that they did got to influence us but the truth of the matter is that Nigeria is influencing the whole world now because they are dancing to Burna Boy now, they are giving him a Grammy award. We have things that we are exporting that are good.\n\nLook at Nigerians abroad, how many of them are in Biden\u2019s administration. We are doing good things, but must our children have that mindset that except they escape from Nigeria, they cannot be better? Many of these people who are now in the oppressive state of mind went abroad and got western education themselves. Literacy is what is going to set the minds of each person free. Nigeria is in this state because we have too many illiterates who cannot think for themselves and all they do is listen to that mob voice, \u2018they say we should do this and we will do it.\u2019 They cannot stop to reason if that is good or not.\n\nMaslow\u2019s hierarchy of need places food and shelter at the base of the pyramid. Most of Nigeria is still wallowing in that place. If we don\u2019t do things about food and shelter by giving them the opportunity to earn, give incentives to people to learn to read and speak properly, and then empower them, we would still have issues.\n\nDid you see a recent video of ewedu being sold in Walmart? If we don\u2019t start farming it for exports, the Chinese and Malaysians will overtake us. Just like the way Malaysia took our oil palm. We need to go into mechanized farming, we need to upscale everything. So, farmers own everything, but we should have arrangements where farmers harvest their crops, you do quality control, and everybody knows that from your farm, whatever you harvest this company is buying it. It is a fixed price.\n\nWhat does this do for them? They can look after their children, they can improve their lives, they can send their children to school and at the same time they are working to ensure that the products get better and better, and they have a market and that market begins to export. We have to make them equitable people of society by giving them a better life.\n\nCan you see how many people are homeless in Lagos? We have to make them understand that people need to stop coming to Lagos, there is nothing in Lagos. Let them stay in their villages. There was a time when the community will find one smart child, put money together, and send that child to school. We need to go back to that. Communities need to get involved in the process of education. Leaders of the community are encouraging all the children to go to school, and in going to school they are putting incentives in front of them to keep going.\n\nHow much is our politics the problem?\n\nIt is a problem because we elected the wrong leader and we keep getting them there because they come every election year with their garri and their 500 naira and hungry people think this is our time to take from the purse. Immediately they get that mandate, they are gone for four years, and in that period, they don\u2019t see a need to do anything.\n\nParties are too expensive on the front end, and it is too expensive on the back end when they get into office because they feel that they have come to recoup the money that they spent in the process. So, it is winner takes all kind of mentality. That is not politics.\n\nWhat will be the shape of the school of the future. What are you seeing?\n\nI believe that because we now have digital meetings and can look at what the trends in the world are pointing to, schools will no longer exist as we have them today. I believe that children will have a greater choice and parents will allow them to make that choice. We have seen it with the Covid where some children have stayed home for a whole year and have not missed out on any activity. When they grow up, what is it that someone will say to them about keeping their children in online schools that will sound strange? They have experienced it even if it is for a month.\n\nI think that the evolution of schools is for us to think beyond the indoor. Recently, we had an event, an election, and the head boy candidate had to present his manifesto, and in his manifesto, he said I promise that I will work with the management to ensure that all of our classes are filled with engagements. What the children want is that they don\u2019t want you to talk to or at them, they want you to engage them.\n\nLearning in the future is going to be about doing. It is what we should have been doing, because in doing so many things happen. If you are having an engaging class, as a teacher you can direct the dialogue, you can listen and really understand if the children have learned what you are teaching because it would be demonstrated in the kind of conversations they have. You can also take advantage of that that kind of conversation to find out more about what they want.\n\nWe are all lifelong learners. The greatest lifelong learner is the teacher not the child. Your job is to bring together the collaboration of everyone, their efforts, their research into a position paper on that topic. So when before now, you will write notes and come and tell them that these are your notes, now that is becoming the wrong course to follow. The world is changing so fast and if you are not connected to the internet, you will miss out on a lot of information. What we do here is that we have partnered with a lot of organizations, and we are using their tools, we are opening up our schools to a more robust teaching and learning engagement environment.\n\nOur teachers have to go outside to teach. There is just so much that is new, existing, that is happening in the classroom. We all know that there are videos online that we can use to teach and also we are now getting our children to make videos. So instead of submitting plagiarised works, they understand research and copyright, they cannot just copy and paste. Summarize it in your own words. So, we now tell them instead of submitting a PowerPoint presentation, do a video.\n\nWhat this whole process is teaching us is that education is constantly changing. Children in primary school today we are teaching them for jobs that don\u2019t exist. If the jobs don\u2019t exist, why are we teaching them? Only the skills and competences of the 21st century are what we are focused on.\n\nWe seem to be caught between the old and the new. Your school has done a lot in managing the tension by being dynamic, but what about the bigger picture?\n\nChange happens in one community at a time. It takes one person to start it. That is not to say I am calling myself a change maker but who knows. I feel that a lot more people are aware, I feel that the soro soke generation are more demanding, especially of what they want for their children. I feel like this whole process cannot be stopped, and the fact that the government refused to acknowledge it but history has recorded it was actually the catalyst. From that we have seen a lot of things happening in the nation.\n\nFinally, CSR. You are engaged in a number of projects, helping with the training of teachers. How long have you been doing it and going forward what next should we expect?\n\nOver 10 years. We were doing it in physical schools. We started in Ijesha, we took about 30 schools in Ijesha and we had a five-day conference and we worked with them about how to teach English, classroom management, classroom discipline, and everything that had to do with teaching. We also talked about their personal development. We had people from HR, we had educators and we had this five-day programme with them. Again, it is voluntary work so we actually contributed the money ourselves.\n\nThe next one we took it to Ogudu and we had a bigger event with about 200 plus people in attendance. Then there was a third one. And then we now started having smaller ones because donor fatigue set in. We picked it up again during Covid and I think this time we have better chances.\n\nAnother thing that we tried to do was that they had the option of if we wanted, they could come to our school and shadow my teachers. That particular school in Ijesha did that and when I called the proprietress, she said it has totally transformed her school.\n\nWhat we are planning to do now is to take the initiative online. This is how we can bridge the gap.\n\nFinally, one of the benefits of the Covid-19 era for me is that the problem with the children on the street has become my problem. I know that I have made a pact with God that if he empowers me with the resources, this is going to be my legacy project. It is about impacting the children. Because we cannot multiply the teachers that quickly and in such mass through physical outreach, that is why we need an online solution.",

          "text": "A Christian cleric, Reverend Yomi Kasali has declared that Nigeria needs deep thinkers who can reinvent the country now more than ever, adding that alone will stall divisive tendencies currently bedeviling the nation and stunting its growth.\n\nThis forms the thrust of discourse, at a special communion and praise service cum Book dedication to commemorate Pastor Motunrayo Alaka\u2019s 40th birthday celebration held at Foundation of Truth Assembly Eric Moore Surulere, Lagos.\n\nThe Senior Pastor of Foundation of Truth Assembly, Rev. Kasali opined that the dearth of positive thinkers has been the bane of Nigeria\u2019s development thus far.\n\n\u201cIf we have deep thinkers we will not be where we are today. We have political thinkers, tribal thinkers, ethnic thinkers and religious thinkers.\n\n\u201cIf we were deep thinkers there are things that we will not do or say. We will know that our problems in this country are not political, it is not APC, PDP or CPC, it is purely morals.\n\n\u201cIf we were deep thinkers we will not look at issues from tribal perspectives alone,we will not demonize the ibos,Ibos are fantastic people or Fulanis who are equally great people or even the Yorubas.If we are deep thinkers we will look at issues sincerely and see how to move this nation forward.\n\n\u201cWe will not become bigots, saying Christians are better than Muslims, that is not true there are some Muslims who are good people maybe not of our faith. We will know that some Christians of my own constituency and faith can also be corrupt.\n\n\u201cInterest has influenced more of our actions than humanity, whenever you think, you think first Yoruba, next Christian and third my pocket.\n\n\u201cOf the three the pocket is number one, if I don\u2019t have anything in it I would not support it but that shouldn\u2019t be the case. We should think humanity, think nation, think development before we think me because if I think about the collective good it will come to me eventually. If there is no crime in the land things will get better.\n\n\u201cWe need people like Pastor Motunrayo a deep thinker, strong sound and balanced, very enlightened, who can offer selfless service to humanity.\n\n\u201cNew people who can deliver, who are honest, pure in heart and indeed sincere and detrabalized, who are not religious bigots, who will go out there and look at issues objectively. She will tell you this is right, this is wrong regardless of whose ox is gored,\u201d says Reverend Kasali.\n\nAn elated Pastor Motunrayo Alaka in a chat with newsmen after the event notes that Nigeria\u2019s potentials far out weighs all that tends towards division, she harps on the inherent strength in diversity and cultural values adding that the country\u2019s unity must be preserved.\n\n\u201cI will like to serve my country though politicking is not my stuff, I was raised as a child that position is not the most important thing, that leadership is about showing up and doing something.\n\n\u201cSo all my life I have always showed up and done something. Whether it is to support somebody or just cleaning a community and if we all have that attitude it is beyond position.\n\n\u201cI am not a position freak but I am the Chief Executive Officer of a centre but that is not me. I am serving the nation now and would love to keep serving but it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be through politicking.\u201d\n\nOn the new book she dedicated to mark her birthday, she noted that the book BITs is Bible Inspired Thoughts, a collection of articles written for about nine years now.\n\n\u201cI put it together because I want to do something for myself on my birthday. I always do alot for other people but my own things I leave them. Being an author is a dream in fact, I have two books I am authoring this year being the first, another one will come out later in the year.\n\n\u201cBITs is about the things I got inspired about reading the Bible and it is not just about the church but about the society, my biggest chapter is about governance, about Nigeria and the fact that we need to build this country because with 200 million people where are we going to go to?\n\n\u201cThis is the country is all that we have and we have everything that it takes to have a great nation, a place where visa to US,UK would be guaranteed, it is not something you have to go and take a long queue for, because we are a great people and we also have numbers to our favour,\u201d Pastor Motunrayo affirms.",

Until the appeal is decided, Rufai remains behind bars.\n\nHowever, federal attorneys stated in their appeal that Rufai\u2019s bail placement was a risky one, as the husband of Rufai\u2019s would-be guardian was convicted in 2014 of buying the stolen personal information of dozens of people and using it to commit fraud.\n\n\u201cWe do not think it\u2019s appropriate that someone who\u2019s been accused of wire fraud would be released into a home where \u2014 of the couple, the two people living there \u2014 the male part of the couple has already been convicted federally of wire fraud,\u201d Langlie said.\n\nShe explained that it is standard practice to keep someone released on bail away from former felons.\n\n\u201cGenerally, when someone is going to be released on bond, one of the conditions you often see is that they are not to associate with people who have criminal histories,\u201d Langlie said.\n\nThe appeal also noted that Rufai\u2019s named custodian was identified by her bank \u201cas a suspect in an email impersonation and money laundering scheme.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Western District of Washington believes that he needs to come out here and face these charges in the district where they\u2019re filed,\u201d said Emily Langlie, communication director at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Washington.\n\nRufai\u2019s travel documents were seized, and his movements, if he is released on bond, will be monitored with an ankle bracelet. He would also be forbidden from leaving the Eastern District of New York \u2014 or eventually, the Western District of Washington.\n\nHowever, federal attorneys stated in their appeal that Rufai\u2019s bail placement was a risky one, as the husband of Rufai\u2019s would-be guardian had been convicted in 2014 of buying the stolen personal information of dozens of people and using it to commit fraud.\n\nBesides the concern of guardianship, the appeal stated that Rufai is an extreme flight risk for several reasons.\n\nFor one, Rufai was already attempting to go back to Nigeria, and presumably would have done so had he not been detained; he was arrested at New York City\u2019s JFK International Airport on May 14 while attempting to board a flight back to Nigeria, by way of Amsterdam.\n\nThe appeal noted that Rufai has no clear ties to the Western District of Washington, and has just one family member living in the United States.\n\nIn contrast, Rufai\u2019s wife and children live in Nigeria, and he holds an appointed government position as senior special assistant to the governor of a Nigerian state. While he has been suspended from that position following his arrest, he has not been fired.\n\nAdditionally, Rufai allegedly has a history of forging identification documents, and prosecutors worry he could easily obtain a false passport. They noted that at the time of his arrest he held a first-class plane ticket and several other items of luxury, suggesting that he has the financial means of getting away.\n\n\u201cRufai is experienced in obtaining and trafficking in stolen identities and identification documents. He has the skills and resources to produce fraudulent documents that would allow him to leave the country,\u201d the attorneys wrote, adding, \u201cLocation monitoring will not guarantee Rufai\u2019s appearance. A defendant determined to flee can simply remove his location monitoring device and disappear.\u201d\n\nProsecutors believe that Rufai would be gone for good if he did get back to Nigeria, noting that it is hard enough to extradite ordinary Nigerian citizens, much less high-power government members.\n\n\u201cExtradition would be difficult \u2014 in part because he is a government official there,\u201d Langlie told KIRO Radio last week.\n\nIf prosecutors get their way, Rufai will be transported to Seattle \u2014 though he could still be let out on bail once in Washington.\n\n\u201cRather than have him released in New York, it\u2019s our preference that the U.S. Marshals Service transport him to the Western District of Washington, and then he can have another bail release hearing here,\u201d Langlie said.\n\nShe did not have a timeline on when that could happen, noting that, for security reasons, they don\u2019t tend to find out ahead of time when a person is being transported by the Marshals.\n\nWhatever the judge decides on the appeal, that decision could further be appealed by either side before it is considered final.",

All leaders should invest in one another and thinking of each other\u2019s well-being, and do whatever it takes to create a stable and sustainable African continent.\n\n\u201cThe continued emergence and spread of this crisis require resources and a mindset to pursue peace, also put in place good politics. We cannot just switch off crisis unless we invest in addressing the root causes of these problems.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, African leaders have had discussions, but there is the need to \u201cput a sense of urgency because we have other crises like poverty that we need to address.\u201d\n\nMr Kagame said to African leaders to capitalise and profit from the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCTA), adding that the continent stands to gain more by coming together.\n\n\u201cWe must utilise the youth, women, and other institutions to help us overcome the crises faced across the continent, but we cannot drop the ball right in the middle of it for smaller interests or benefits and forget about the common interest.\n\n\u201cFor example, we have put in place the AfCTA. We must capitalise on that and benefit from it so that we do not just have it in name but in the area of practice. We cannot benefit until countries work together in peace, with security in place and stability,\u201d explained the Rwandan president.",

Does it not violate the respective rights of the Fulani and Ibo people if you restrict their rights to movement of their possessed goods that are not legally outlawed?\n\n\u201dFulanis own cattle which they move around in possessive sense. Spare part dealers move spare parts in ownership and possessive sense. We submit that it is the encroachment of the right of others that has ever been punishable and not the act of lawful grazing. Identifying encroachment with an ethnic toga is dangerous and mischievous and it has ever been. A spare parts dealer that encroaches into other peoples land to store his wares has committed an act of trespass not because he is an Igbo man but because of his unlawful act.\n\n\u201dAs AGF, his role is to set out the law in precise terms and if we must understand, he is not the one that made these laws because it is not his duty to do so.\n\n\u201dWe also make bold to say that the Southern Governors\u2019 declaration is a blanket statement lacking in precision and legally wrong. The statement of the AGF in the interview was aimed at showing this.\n\n\u201dWe believe the AGF spoke strictly on the lawfulness of cattle rearing. Based on our laws, every lawful business is free and guaranteed by the 1999 Constitution. We are not also unmindful of the fact that in the course of doing business an act of criminality may occur and if that happens, it can be dealt with according to the extant law. We believe it is wrong from for the Southern Governors to throw a blanket ban because criminals have infiltrated a business. It is illogical to act in that regard and we urge the Governors to revisit their stand in the overall interest of unity and peaceful coexistence among all Nigerians.\n\n\u201dAt this stage of our national life when tackling insecurity is at the front burner of governance, the Governors should not distract citizens with the issue of open grazing. They should rather focus their energy on granting autonomy to States Legislature, Judiciary and Local Governments . By this we mean that the Governors should immediately implement the provisions of Executive Order 10 as signed by President Muhammadu Buhari. They should respect the democratic principles of independence of State Legislature and Judiciary in line with Section 121 (3) of the Constitution. Nigerians seek nothing less. The divisionary and diversionary techniques should be over.\n\n\u201dWe believe the AGF spoke strictly on the lawfulness of cattle rearing.

But the truth is that the money has not hit the Delta State government\u2019s account.\n\n\u201cWe saw it yesterday like every other Nigerian when the Accountant General of the Federation Ahmed Idris while appearing before the House of Reps committee on recovered loot made that statement and there was this avalanche of enquires to know whether that money has come to us and the truth is that the money has not come.\n\n\u201cWe are happy that they have shown willingness to return send the money and we know that very soon, the money will come,\u201d Ifejika said while addressing journalists at the Government House in Asaba, the state capital.\n\nHe assured that the Delta State government will ensure that the funds are judiciously utilised to improve infrastructure across the state, once received.\n\nThe loot \u2013 \u00a34.2 million \u2013 was seized from the associates of convicted former Governor of Delta State, Ibori by the United Kingdom and recently returned to Nigeria.\n\nWhere Is The Loot?\n\nThe recovered loot was recently received by the Federal Government from the United Kingdom.\n\nMr Idris while appearing before the committee investigating the status of recovered loot stated that \u201call recovered funds that belong to the respective states are paid directly to the states.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigeria Receives \u00a34.2m Ibori Loot\n\nWhen asked specifically if the Ibori loot was returned to Delta State, he responded that: \u201cIt was paid to the state, it was paid to Delta State.

Forty-eight other presidential aspirants had submitted requests for candidacy, but their applications were rejected.\n\nAl-Assad allies Iran and Russia, as well as Belarus, sent delegations to monitor the election.\n\nMeanwhile, the foreign ministers of the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy issued a joint statement in which they described the polls as a sham. \u201cFor an election to be credible, all Syrians should be allowed to participate, including internally displaced Syrians, refugees, and members of the diaspora, in a safe and neutral environment,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Council (SDC), which controls northeastern Syria, slammed al-Assad\u2019s government for obstructing negotiations and meetings. \u201cWe will not be part of the presidential election process and we will not participate in it,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nLike Western states, the SDC called for the full implementation of UN Security Council resolution 2254, which was passed unanimously in late 2015 and calls for an end to hostilities and a political solution to the Syrian conflict.\n\nThe resolution is meant to pave the way for internationally monitored elections following amendments to the constitution.",

          "text": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in Egypt on the next leg of a diplomatic mission aimed at strengthening a cease-fire that ended an 11-day war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nBlinken was scheduled to hold talks with Egypt\u2019s President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, Foreign Minister Sameh Shukry and the country\u2019s chief spy Abbas Kamel.\n\nBlinken wrapped up extensive talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, and is scheduled to travel to Amman, Jordan late Wednesday to meet with the Jordanian king and other officials.\n\nHe has vowed to \u201crally international support\u201d to rebuild the destruction in hard-hit Gaza, while also promising to make sure that none of the aid destined for the territory reaches Hamas.\n\nAhead of his departure, Blinken extended US President Joe Biden\u2019s invitation to Israeli President Reuven Rivlin to visit the United States in the coming weeks. Rivlin accepted, according to a statement from his office.\n\nBlinken described Egypt and Jordan as central players in trying to bring calm to the region. Both countries are key US allies that have peace agreements with Israel and frequently serve as mediators between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\n\u201cEgypt played a critical role in helping to broker the cease-fire and Jordan has long been a voice for peace and stability in the region,\u201d he told reporters late Tuesday.\n\nIn Egypt, which borders both Israel and Gaza, he was scheduled to meet with President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and other top officials. Biden spoke with el-Sissi during the war to help broker the cease-fire.\n\nDuring talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders on Tuesday, Blinken made clear that the US has no immediate plans to pursue peace talks between the sides, perhaps because previous efforts by past administrations have all failed. Instead, he expressed hope for creating a \u201cbetter environment\u201d that might lead to peace talks.\n\nThat could begin with the Gaza reconstruction effort. The 11-day war killed more than 250 people, mostly Palestinians, and caused heavy destruction in the impoverished coastal territory. Preliminary estimates have put the damage in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nIn a gesture to the Palestinians, Blinken on Tuesday announced plans to reopen the US consulate in Jerusalem \u2014 an office that historically handled diplomatic outreach to the Palestinians.\n\nBlinken also announced nearly $40 million in additional aid to the Palestinians. In all, the Biden administration has pledged some $360 million to the Palestinians, restoring badly needed aid that the Trump administration had cut off.",
