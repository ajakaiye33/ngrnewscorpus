          "text": "The Lagos State Real Estate Regulatory Authority on Thursday, clamped down on signages of unregistered real estate practitioners operating in the state.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria quoted the Special Adviser to the Lagos State Governor on Housing, Mrs Toke Benson-Awoyinka, as saying that the exercise was to enforce compliance with its directive to real estate practitioners to be duly registered with the authority.\n\nBenson-Awoyinka, represented by the Director, Enforcement Unit of LASRERA, Mr Deji Badejo, said this at the commencement of the exercise in Ikeja and Maryland.\n\nShe said the exercise was in line with LASRERA\u2019s mandate to regulate, sanitise and effectively monitor the real estate sector in Lagos State.\n\nAccording to her, it is an offence to practice real estate in any of its forms, which includes the display of signage and inscriptions such as: \u2018To Let,\u2019 \u2018To Lease,\u2019 and \u2018For Sale\u2019 among others, in their offices or on any property without being duly registered with the authority.\n\n\u201cThis enforcement and sensitisation exercise, which started at Ikeja and its environs, is expected to be replicated across other divisions of the state.\n\n\u201cIt is part of the strategies by LASRERA to raise public awareness about the state government\u2019s efforts to sanitise the real estate sector in the state,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to her, there is a need to restrict posting of signage on residential and commercial properties, by unregistered real estate individuals or organisations who can easily swindle unsuspecting members of the public.\n\nBenson-Awoyinka explained that many members of the public had been defrauded in the past by imposters and fraudulent real estate practitioners.\n\nShe emphasised that the government could not continue to ignore and allow irregularities capable of driving many genuine investors/ investees away from the sector.\n\nShe said LASRERA had earlier written to over 1,000 real estate individuals or organisations in the state to honour the state government\u2019s call for regularisation of the sector and also boost the confidence of those in diaspora to invest in the market.",

          "text": "The Northern Elders Forum on Thursday asked the Ohaneze Ndigbo to redirect its attention toward ensuring the security of South-East people rather than threatening other section of the country.\n\nThis as the Forum also raised the alarm over the life of its Director of Media and Publicity, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, which, it said, was at risk following alleged threat from the Ohaneze Ndigbo.\n\nThe Northern Elders Forum said should anything happen to him, it knows who should be held responsible.\n\nThe convener of NEF and former Vice Chancellor of the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Prof. Ango Abdullahi, said these in a statement issued on Thursday night in reaction to the statement earlier released by the Spokesperson of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Dr. Alex Ogbonnia.\n\nHe said, \u201cMy attention has been drawn to comments by spokesman of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Dr. Alex Ogbonnia, on the Director of Publicity and Advocacy of Northern Elders Forum, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed. These comments are, to say the least, dangerous and irresponsible, designed to achieve only one goal: to put the life of Dr. Baba-Ahmed in peril.\n\n\u201cThe Northern Elders Forum states categorically that all comments and statements made by Dr. Baba-Ahmed are authorized, and they represent its positions.\n\n\u201cThe press statement which he read on June 8 2021 at the Forum\u2019s Headquarters in Abuja in the presence of the full Forum was the statement of the Forum by which it still stands.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of attempts to create the impression that this statement is recent, as well as other attempts to misrepresent its contents to create scapegoats for the failure to limit the damage of irredentism.\n\n\u201cIn spite of many efforts to inform the public appropriately, it appears that Ohaneze Ndigbo has fallen prey to more mischief, or is itself actively involved in incitement against a citizen.\n\n\u201cThe Forum stands by its Director of Publicity and Advocacy, a Nigerian whose pedigree and service to our nation has few parallels. It sees the claim that Dr. Baba-Ahmed is a security risk, and the demand that he should be arrested as pathetic and beneath even the ordinary standards of Ohaneze Ndigbo.\n\n\u201cWe serve notice that we know who to hold responsible in the event of any harm to Dr. Baba-Ahmed.\n\n\u201cThe Forum advises Ohaneze Ndigbo to focus its attention on contributing to securing people of the South East from multiple threats, and ensuring that Ndigbo has a befitting relevance in Nigeria. The Forum affirms its full confidence in Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, who will continue to serve the country and the North as we search for a future that accommodates all interests in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

My last born was very close to him because he is a very friendly person. My son has been crying over the matter and has not been himself. It is because of this that the people in the street said okada should not work today.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Kontongs Bello could not reached for comments but a senior police officer in the State Command said \u201cWe are yet to get that report but I suspect the family would report to the police station close to the area and the DPO will definitely brief the Commissioner of Police later on.\u201d",

The plot is real, and those behind it had a deal with the leadership of APC in Imo State.\u201d\n\n\u201cI therefore, want to alert all the candidates for House of Assembly, House of Reps, and Senate in Imo State to mobilize and be on the lookout for such moves and insist on ensuring the electoral panel members show the list of the delegates which they are coming to the primary with before any accreditation can start and ensure at all cost that the illegal list is not used to avoid canceling all Imo PDP primaries because INEC monitors will record in their report that the fake list was used and anybody from the opposition can go to court and void our primaries,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Some Lagos residents on Thursday expressed divergent views over the ban on commercial motorcycles in the state by the state government..\n\nGov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Wednesday imposed a total ban on activities of commercial motorcycle operators in six local government areas of Eti-Osa, Ikeja, Surulere, Lagos Island, Lagos Mainland, and Apapa.\n\nSanwo-Olu directed security operatives to enforce the ban beginning from June 1.\n\nSome residents, however, told NAN in Lagos that the government decision on the ban was a welcome development while others frowned at it.\n\nMr Gbenga Ajayi, a teacher, resident of Ayobo, said that \u2018okada\u2019 ban was a good decision but should be extended to other local government areas, not only in selected areas.\n\n\u201cThe ban should be extend to all local governments in the state, if not the riders will migrate to the other parts of Lagos where it is not banned and the story will continue.\u201d\n\nHe said the proliferation of okada operators posed serious threats to security structure in the state.\n\n\u201cOkada is constituting security threats, it is being used to perpetuate evils.\n\n\u201cSome riders do arm themselves with dangerous weapons to rob their passengers and even pedestrians of their valuables.\n\n\u201cSome do not have regards for human life, they ride like they have extra lives. Some passengers have lost their lives while boarding motorcycles while others became disabled.\n\n\u201cMy brother was beaten and almost lynched last month over N100 by some okada riders.\n\n\u201cIt took the timely intervention of some policemen around to save the situation from further deterioration.\n\n\u201cSome riders drive recklessly, I lost a neighbour to bike accident last year.\n\n\u201cThere should be no going back, the ban must stay to save lives and reduce crime,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the same view, Mr Ayodele Ojo, a civil servant, who resides at Ojuelegba, Surulere, commended the state government for the ban.\n\nHe urged the government to enforce and ensure total compliance this time round.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time the governor is issuing such directive, announcement is not enough but enforcement.\u201d\n\nOjo said that some riders use their motorcycles to kill, steal and to destroy.\n\n\u201cMotorcycle is used for fast get-away in crime scenes, the ban should stay so that sanity can return to our roads.\n\n\u201cWe can no longer condone criminality all in the name of unemployment, motorcycle business is not the only means of livelihood, there are many other businesses that people can engage in.\n\n\u201cThe ban will rid the city of insecurity and other vices,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, a businessman, Mr Olaniyi Daniel, resident of Agege, frowned at the ban of commercial motorcycles.\n\nHe said banning okada would further broaden the way to unemployment.\n\n\u201cOkada creates massive job for the unemployed young people and the livelihood of many depend on it.\u201d\n\nDaniel said that banning okada was not the solution to okada riders\u2019 menace and would not solve insecurity instead, it would increase the rate of criminal activities in the state.\n\n\u2018Prohibiting okada will not solve the issue of crimes in the state; criminals are very sensitive and strategic in their ways if the government bans okada, they will find other ways to perpetuate their crime.\n\n\u201cI believe it is not only motorcycle that is used to commit crime, criminals use cars too.\u201d\n\nHe urged the government to provide alternatives to alleviate the initial inconveniences,\u201d he said.\n\nMrs Glory Ameh, resident of Apapa, said that the ban on okada was not a good move, adding that it would bring undue hardship to some residents of the state.\n\n\u201cMy area cannot be accessed except by Okada, it is the only means of transportation, if the ban is enforced, it will bring undue hardship.\u201d\n\nShe urged the state government to come up with a policy and regulation that would guide the okada riders, rather than outright ban.(NAN)",

          "text": "Last week, this column closed with Anthony Enahoro\u2019s apprehension about the fate of the Yorubas within the Nigerian state with leaders \u201cwho in pursuit of positions, are ready to inflict rain on themselves and undermine one another by declaring innocent guilty and guilty innocent because of wealth\u201d. He was reacting to Chief Akintola\u2019s decision to exploit his close relationship with Ahmadu Bello and Balewa to bring down his leader and the Yoruba nation rather than abide by the result of Enahoro\u2019s motion for his resignation for anti-party activities, carried by 3-1 votes.\n\nAkintola although, a master of ambiguity, (Macpherson) was nonetheless a man \u2018naturally opposed to violence and according to Trevor Clark, \u201cwould have never confronted his leader but for the pressure from his wife, a human reluctance to lose face\u201d. Thus with the characteristic display of Yoruba false sense of self-worth, Akintola resolved that if he could not have it, no one else would have it. Consequently, he sought the help of the Fulani and Igbo political elite that had an axe to grind with his leader. And with their help, he and his group of self-serving Yoruba leaders on May 29, 1962 buried their leader along with their 10 years of unparalleled achievements.\n\nApart from the troika of Ayo Rosiji, Okunowo and Akerele, who raised false allegations, there was Dr Majekodunmi who befriended Balewa and some northern leaders for which he was bountifully rewarded as personal doctor to Balewa and his two Lagos-based wives, graduating to Minister of State for the Army in 1959, and by 1962, the tyrannical administrator of the West under emergency, a period he fought like a slave to please his northern friends.\n\nHe did the bidding of Balewa by ensuring the dispersal and restriction of AG supporters across the old Western Region with Awo himself sent to mosquito-infested Lekki Government Guest House, accessible only through steam boat and a two-kilometre trek from the shore sometimes inside a knee-deep flood especially when there is a storm. When the probe therefore opened, he was denied access to his files which had been carted from Ibadan to IG Lynn\u2019s office in Lagos where Akintola and Coker had access to them. He also had no access to his restricted party members with whom he ran the government from 1952-1959\n\nOther key actors who were mostly NCNC sympathisers include Ayodola Coker, (chairman), a blood relation to Zik, Akintola Williams (member), brother-in-law to Coker and Kassim who was chief magistrate in the Eastern Region under Okpara. The Chief prosecutor, Okorodudu was of course a prominent member of NCNC while Sobo Sowemimo and Alhaji Sofola, counsels to the commission were also prominent members of NCNC.\n\nWhen the heat was turned on by a vindictive federal government, some of Awolowo\u2019s loyalists jumped boat to join Akintola now installed as governor without election. Even some concerned Obas including the Olubadan, the Olota of Ota and Oba Akran, mocked that \u201cAll the four governments of the federation are against you, what can you do, nothing; The wise course open to you is to go to the Sardauna and Balewa and beg them. Otherwise worse things will happen.\u201d\n\nBut Awo insisted that \u201cGod who sees our hearts and knows why we have refused to bow to blind tyranny\u2026 will protect me and my colleagues from any harm\u201d. Those who did not jump boat including those who upon resigning from government in 1959 claiming he could not work under Akintola and on request got about 3,000 pounds from the party to procure books in readiness for NPC\u2019s unconstitutional moves after independence, for fear of a vindictive federal government, resigned from the AG.\n\nCoker Commission of Inquiry into the affairs of Certain Statutory Corporations in Western Nigeria was based on May 29, 1962 allegations of Rosiji, Okunowo and Akerele. It according to Awolowo turned out to be \u201ca cruel quasi-judicial machine\u2026.for the total destruction of political rival\u2026.its proceeding were in the main a travesty, and its conclusions were a parade of naked and unabashed injustice, inequity and inhumanity dispensed under the auspices of a tyrannical reign, a reign of terror, of search without warrant, of restrictions and detention of persons without trial and without any specified charge\u201d.\n\nThe six statutory bodies investigated according to Professor H. A. Oluwasanmi (Daily Express January 28, and 29 1963) \u201cwere corporations established to perform functions that are fundamental significance to the economic, social and cultural development of the people of Western Nigeria\u201d. For instance, they helped in the procurement of farmers\u2019 farm products which they also helped to sell in foreign markets. They were responsible for provision of affordable houses on easy term. They contributed to the \u201cdevelopment of agricultural industrial and commercial potential of the West, through investment of surplus resources, through provision of credit to farmers, industrialists and business men and development and propagation of Yoruba culture through radio and television.\u201d\n\nOne of the principal targets of the inquiry was NIPC which according to A. O. Rewane was founded for the sole purpose of funding the AG. Following a survey of how political parties were funded in Europe and America, the AG committee saddled with the task recommended NIPC which was to be patterned after an Israeli Labour Movement -owned \u2018The HISTRADUT\u2019, which engaged in business activities with the largest shares in civil engineering firm, Israel Airlines and Shipping lines.\n\nThe Coker Commission and it sponsors were obsessed with the #6,210,000 pounds NIPC owed Western Region Marketing Board, WRMB. But the company even after \u201cgiving substantial financial assistance to the Action Group, its properties which include Investment House, Bristol Hotel, Bagatelle building, Cocoa House, LAPAL properties that owned all the SCOA buildings in Lagos Ibadan Port Harcourt Aba, Onitsha, Kano, Jos Gusau, Sapele and other places SCOA operated from and Amalgamated Press all valued at about nine million pounds thus fulfilling the purpose for which it was set up. When the properties were taken over by WRMB and transferred to a company known as WEMABOD Estate Limited by mid-eighties, they were worth about N80m.\n\nAs for the WRMB, the success was phenomenal. Between 1954-1959, surplus funds not needed for stabilisation purposes were used in building the infrastructure including road development and agricultural commercials and industrial undertakings. If there were problems after 1959, it was according to Professor Aluko, probably due to Akintola\u2019s dubious policy of transferring liquid assets of the board to the regional government, a deviation from the recommendations of the International Bank Mission.\n\nYet Akintola as \u201cNIPC first chairman for the two years, who presided over approval of investment, instructed and paid over #2.7m pounds for acquisition of companies and landed properties and personally intervened in the personnel affairs of the corporation, was never questioned along other chairmen of the company but found guiltless while Awo who was never chairman was indicted for alleged irregularities while he was premier\u201d. (S A Aluko Sunday Express January 27, 1963)\n\nIt was therefore not a surprise that Chief Awolowo according to Coker\u2019s report \u201chas failed to adhere to the standards of conduct which are required for person holding such a post, while there is no evidence in our view to say the same of Chief Akintola and we absolve him in all grounds\u201d.\n\nAlthough the report according to Oluwasanmi was however \u201csilent, funereally silent Awo\u2019s tremendous achievements as premier of western Nigeria, it can be said that long after the Coker Commission Report shall have been forgotten in the archives, as a spiteful document, the work of Chief Awolowo in Western Nigeria will remain monument to brilliant planning and administrative genius\u201d.",

So, Nigerians have to brace themselves up to do what needs to be done to put Nigeria back on the right path. And you are right in saying that wherever you go now, one of the things you hear is that Nigeria is not on the table, but why shouldn\u2019t Nigeria be on the table? What does it cost Nigeria to be on the table? I will say four things, of which I was reminded this morning. One is knowledge. If Nigeria is not at the table, may be the knowledge that we should have of ourselves, of our situation, of our continent and indeed of the world is not that adequate. If that knowledge is adequate, we will do what is right, when it is right and how it is right. The second is vision. What is the vision that we have? And if you have no vision, you may have eyes but you are blind. And I believe that is part of our situation. The third is passion. And when you said that you are involved in this with a passion\u2026 and I was telling some people this morning that passion means madness, that you are mad about Nigeria, I am and I have no apologies for that because I have no other country I can call my own and I have no other country I can go to and say, yes, I have come to live here. Passion means being mad about Nigeria, having a touch of madness and I look at you (Hayatu-Deen) and say yes, you are mad about Nigeria too. Fourth one is innovation. We cannot be doing the same thing that we have done in the past that did not pay us and continue to repeat it and expect any change, we have to move out it, we have to innovate, we have to re-strategise.\n\n\u201cLike you said, I couldn\u2019t agree with you more that no individual in Nigeria, no political party, no single person or individual can make a critical mass that will resolve the situation that we are today. It has to be an all Nigerians\u2019 hands on deck. No section of the Nigerian community should be left out. So, I believe you have knowledge. From what you have said, you have the vision. Also, you told me that you have the madness and you have innovation but let me add, Nigeria is a complex country. And we need to understand the complexity of Nigeria and that complexity if we take care of it, Nigeria is not a difficult country to rule or to manage, but we must all be ready,\u201d Obasanjo said.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

          "text": "\u2022Declares FG has no plan to ban Facebook\n\n\u2022FEC okays N169.7bn private sector investments in road Infrastructure\n\n\u2022Approves N3.4bn for purchase of aviation property\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has the final say on the fate of members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) who decided to renounce their political ambitions and remain in the cabinet, so says Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed.\n\nMohammed also disclosed that the federal government had no plan to ban the social networking website, Facebook, in Nigeria over alleged biased reportage of happenings in some parts of the country.\n\nThe disclosure came as FEC approved N169.7 billion private sector investments for road infrastructure through the government\u2019s Tax Credit Programme (TCP), during the weekly virtual meeting.\n\nFEC also approved the sum of N3, 491,622,340 for the purchase of a property in Abuja for the Ministry of Aviation.\n\nMohammed, who briefed newsmen after the FEC meeting yesterday at the State House, Abuja, said he would need to confirm the status of the returning ministers from the president.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe question about ministers returning or not going, I think you need to give me more time so that I can tell you exactly what the situation is. Right now, I need to crosscheck.\n\n\u201cI need to confirm again from Mr President what the situation is. You see, the final decision on who is going, who\u2019s coming back, who\u2019s not, lies with Mr. President.\u201d\n\nPresidency sources yesterday told THISDAY that President had since asked the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami and the Governor of the Central Bank, Godwin Emefiele to stay on in their jobs even though they had initially nursed the ambition of contesting the 2023 election. While Malami had purchased forms to vie for Governor in his home State of Kebbi, a group of rice farmers purchased forms for Emefiele to contest for ticket to vie for the presidential election.\n\nMinister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige; his Women Affairs counterpart, Dame Pauline Tallen; Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami; and Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timpre Sylva, had rescinded their decisions to contest for elective offices in the 2023 general election.\n\nMalami was physically present at yesterday\u2019s council meeting, while Tallen and Sylva attended the meeting virtually from their offices in Abuja.\n\nNgige was said to be away on official engagement in South Africa, where he was attending the global conference on child labour in Durban, organised by the International Labour Organisation (ILO).\n\nThe information and culture minister also shed more light on the recent meeting between the federal government and Facebook\u2019s management over the alleged biased coverage of the country by the blogging platform. He said both parties had a fruitful discussion, adding that the government is not contemplating banning Facebook operations in the country.\n\nMohammed stated, \u201cWe had a very robust discussion with Facebook. Facebook saw our point and they said they\u2019re going to do much more than what they were doing. So if they do that, why would we ban them? We don\u2019t ban for banning sake. We ban or we only suspend operations if, for any reason, lives are threatened and they do not listen.\u201d\n\nHe also said the government was able to express its reservation about some of the reports on Facebook.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAt that meeting, we expressed our displeasure that Facebook was becoming a power of choice for those who stay outside Nigeria, in particular, to incite violence, killings, burning of government properties, killing of soldiers and policemen. And that they do more than what they are doing now in looking at the contents, which are unwholesome, which are being used on their platforms.\n\n\u201cIncidentally, the BBC did a documentary on this particular issue and found out that some of them who call themselves social media warriors in England, in France, and other places, have in recent times been using the Facebook platform to incite violence in Nigeria. And we\u2019ve all seen the real life impact of those war mongering, the young couple who are going to marry, soldiers who were gruesomely murdered.\n\n\u201cOver this weekend in Anambra State, policemen were killed, military barracks were attacked. And we did warn Facebook to, please, do more than what they are doing now. And I must say that their response was quite encouraging. They said they are going to do much more.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the approval of N169.7 billion private sector investments for road infrastructure through the government\u2019s TCP, Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, who also briefed newsmen, stressed that the programme was initiated in 2019, through Executive Order 7 signed by the president, which allowed the private sector to finance public infrastructure in lieu of tax and then offset it overtime using tax credits.\n\nFashola said the first project FEC approved, based on TCP, was the 234-kilometre road from Bali to Sheti through Gashaka to Gembu in Taraba State at the sum of N95, 232,474,010.72. He disclosed that an existing N20 billion, under NNPC Tax Credit Scheme, would be used to kick-start the project.\n\nFashola said the second project, under the tax credit scheme, approved by Council covered three roads.\n\n\u201cThe applicant in this case is Mainstream Energy Solutions, a major energy player in the country, is now seeking to also participate in this policy by investing a total of N74, 486,577, 050,\u201d he said.\n\nFurthermore, Mohammed, who briefed journalists on behalf of his colleagues in aviation, power, and agriculture, said FEC approved the sum of N3, 491,622,340 for the purchase of a property in Abuja for the Ministry of Aviation. He said the property to be acquired was to enable the ministry co-locate with many of its agencies.\n\nThe minister stated, \u201cThis property will enable the ministry to be in the same building with many of its agencies. As of now, many of the agencies operate from rented properties and this is a drain on government, apart from the fact that it does not allow for good coordination of activities.\n\n\u201cNecessary checks and legal searches have been made and the council approved the purchase today.\u201d\n\nThe minister also said Council awarded a N553.575 million contract for the establishment and deployment of Advanced Report Generation Utility Engine Web-based Reporting Tools in favour of Messrs Sinecou Limited with delivery date of 12 months.\n\nMohammed further disclosed that the power ministry got approval for the upward review of the original contract sum in respect of the construction of 232 kilometres Yola, Song, Gombe, Mubi, Gulako 132 KV double circuit transmission line, from $16 million plus N1.248 billion, to $16.698 billion plus N2,337,643,640. He added that the sum of N409 million was approved for the power ministry to purchase replacements of defective circuit breakers, and disclosed that a memo from the Minister of Agriculture seeking approval for a National Agricultural Technology Innovation Policy was approved.\n\nMohammed stated, \u201cAnother memo by the Minister of Power also sought approval for the repair and refurbishment of defective nine sets of 330 KV, 13 sets of 132 KV, and 26 sets of 33 KV Crompton grips circuit breakers for the Transmission Company of Nigeria. Some of these circuit breakers are weak, having been there for more than 35 years and the total sum is N409, 089,841. And this is to help the network of the TCN.\n\n\u201cA memo of the Minister of Agriculture seeking approval for a national agricultural technology innovation policy was approved. It is a policy that aims at better synergy and alignment with MDAs to overcome inadequate coordination on policy implementation. It will address the issue of fragmentation of mandates and rivalries among MDAs in the agricultural sector. It will help livestock development and it will support the establishment of functional models of ranches, grazing reserves and integrated meat and dairy processing among others.\n\n\u201cThe policy is also going to help promote knowledge creation and transfer through reorganising, unbundling and strengthening agricultural research and training systems. The policy will give access to mechanisation via tractor and implement hiring scheme. It will also impact on quality extension service delivery, leading to enhanced technology adoption to strengthen the value chain for quality crops, fisheries and aquaculture, among others.\u201d\n\nMinister of State for Budget and National Planning, Clement Agba, who also spoke after the FEC meeting, said the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, presented a memo on the Phase 3 of the Lighthouse programme on digital infrastructure of voluntary assets and income declaration scheme bids and tax harmonisation normalisation analytics and application programme interface.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "When all is said and done \u2013 after all the back and forth, the frenzy by both pretenders and contenders \u2013 only 23 aspirants are up for screening. Twenty-four actually returned their nomination forms. But Akinwumi Adesina pulled out of the race a few days ago, leaving these 23 members (22 men and one woman) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to slug it out for the presidential ticket.\n\nBut questions remain about the strange rush to make a visible impression on the APC presidential dashboard. What do they really want? Why such an unwieldy number for just one office? Has the presidency become an all-comers affair? Is the motivation really the love of country, or personal aggrandisement, or just pursuit of ambition? How many of the aspirants actually have the capacity to manage a society as complicated as Nigeria?\n\nHow is the ruling party going to manage this huge number of people ready to take over from President Muhammadu Buhari without creating needless crises that may even ruin the party?\n\nThe questions are endless. But the D-Day is almost here.\n\nMeet the 22 men and one woman who want to succeed Buhari. They come from diverse backgrounds \u2013 reflecting Nigeria\u2019s rich diversity.\n\nYemi Osinbajo\n\nVice-President Yemi Osinbajo is believed by many as ordinarily the most ideal to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari after working together for almost eight years. And against all odds, Osinbajo, on April 11, 2022, declared his intention to succeed his principal, Buhari, through a short video uploaded on all the social media platforms. With his form submitted and consultations going on in almost every part of Nigeria, the die is cast.\n\nAhmad Lawan\n\nNews that the current President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, was eyeing the presidency was like a rumour many had thought would not evolve into reality and this was for obvious reasons. Interestingly, he is among the 23 other aspirants and appears to truly mean business. Even as many continue to say God forbid to Ahmad\u2019s presidential ambition, Lawan is unperturbed. No one knows what the owners of Nigeria have up their sleeves. Since he joined the race, he is not crisscrossing the country to woo delegates. Well, who knows, maybe his confidence comes from his backers \u2013 that he doesn\u2019t need to woo delegates. Or maybe it\u2019s just a reflection of his nature and how he treats otherwise important issues with levity \u2013 like the way he conducts Senate\u2019s business. He has practically turned the senate and by extension, the federal legislature into an appendage of the executive. This ironically, has remained what he\u2019s been selling in his public statements in the name of being cooperative with the executive. Everyone is waiting to see how he will emerge.\n\nBola Ahmed Tinubu\n\nIn many respects, a lot of political analysts, have begun to think that the tide is slowly tilting in the favour of a former governor of Lagos State, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. This though changes nothing about the swirling perception about him \u2013 his corrupt disposition \u2013 it has however, improved his standing in the race for the APC ticket. For a man, who considers this project a life-long ambition and the first to publicly declare his intention, he knows this is definitely not a sprint and is ready for whatever lays ahead.\n\nIbikunle Amosun\n\nThe former governor of Ogun State and senator for Ogun Central, Ibikunle Amosun, comes to the race with credibility, nobility and record of stellar performance as governor. A close ally of the president, Amosun boasts not just very deep knowledge in finance \u2013 combined with his executive and legislative exposures \u2013 he is not just ready for the race for the presidential ticket, but the task of leading the country to the next level. With his forms filed for consideration, maybe he is ready.\n\nAjayi Boroffice\n\nA senator from Ondo State, Ajayi Borrofice, incidentally, made it to the point of submission, even though the misgivings about his decision to run have yet to subside. The fact that he has also crossed this one line, counts form him in many ways, even though it has not fundamentally altered the subsisting beliefs about his aspiration and his true intentions.\n\nOgbonnaya Onu\n\nAt this stage, the Minister of Science of Technology and Innovation, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, is arguably one of the names to watch out for. Unlike some of his colleagues, who chickened out, when the reality of what might be lurking next door stared at them, Ogbonnaya is not joking with the demand for a president from the South-east part of the country, albeit for Nigeria and Nigerians. While some still have reservations about him, he certainly would stand shoulders higher than many of the other contenders.\n\nDimeji Bankole\n\nFormer speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Dimeji Bankole, might have sent a clear message too, staying up to this stage. Earlier considered as one of the jokers in the race, he cannot be described as such again, having made it to the second round. But how he plans to waltz through the political landmines and beat the heavyweights to their game, is yet to be seen. Young and personable, being Nigeria\u2019s president requires more, lest, he knows.\n\nYahaya Bello\n\nKogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, is one seemingly indomitable spirit in the race for Buhari\u2019s job. Despite many things working and standing against his plausible choice and decision, especially, the unsavoury public perception about him, he has continued to give his all, just to prove he was not in the race to play around. Bello remains one interesting character in the race for the APC ticket and can no longer be taken for granted.\n\nDave Umahi\n\nEbonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi, is in the race for justice, equity and fairness, which the Igbo demand. In addition, he is convinced he has the gravitas to turn things around. Interestingly, he has some good record of performance, after serving Ebonyi for nearly eight years now. But how far his record of a relatively small Ebonyi would take him cannot be taken out of the concerns for his decision, when push comes to shove.\n\nRochas Okorocha\n\nSenator and former governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, has always wanted to be president of Nigeria and this is about his fourth attempt. He might come off simple and sociable, he is equally of a serious and progressive standing. He means business and is determined to give all that it would take to, not only emerge candidate of the party, but also ensure that the Igbo gets its rightful place in the body polity.\n\nChukwuemeka Nwajuiba\n\nUnpredictable Minister of State for Education, Hon. Chukwuemeka Nwajuiba, appears to be one candidate setting the pace for the others in many respects, an indication he is not in the race to while away time. He obtained his form first and was the first to resign after Buhari handed the order. He submitted his form as quickly as he could and was ready early enough for screening. He is following rules and setting his own standards. Whoever underrates this south-easterner would do so at a huge cost, in addition to the fact that some northern elites seem to have a thing for him.\n\nGodswill Akpabio\n\nSince the former Minister of Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio, declared his intention to run for president, he has yet to catch the sort of attention expected to underscore his seriousness. Although he has been holding some skeletal consultations in view of his aspiration, Akpabio has not come out as strong as some of the frontliners. Yet, he is not one to be pushed behind in the scheme of things. He is grounded and understands the terrain as well as its tricks. With record of outstanding performance as governor, albeit largely superficial, he is probably coming into the race with an uncommon resolve to change the face of the presidential run.\n\nUju Kennedy Ohnenye\n\nAs the only female aspirant in the race for the APC presidential ticket, Uju Kennedy Ohnenye, has fought a good fight so far and to the awe of many, who had thought she would have long fallen by the way side. At this stage, nothing can be put past this woman of courage as she trudges on. Her confidence and belief in her ability to turn the tide are indeed, notes for file.\n\nTunde Bakare\n\nIf there was a list of people deemed as likely to chicken out from the race, one name most certainly to be missing in that list is the General Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church, Lagos, Pastor Tunde Bakare. He has not only been calling himself the number 16 to the office of the president, succeeding Buhari; he has been working to realising it too for some time. Thus, crossing the second round was not a surprise, and how far he would push this further is also not what anyone can envisage.\n\nNicholas Felix Nwagbo\n\nYoung and unknown Nicholas Felix Nwagbo, has sent a subliminal message to his critics by crossing the second stage of the process of his aspiration. A US-based Nigerian pastor at the Miracle Church International, is the second pastor in the race for APC ticket after Bakare. Whatever he intends to achieve with this, only time will tell.\n\nKayode Fayemi\n\nEkiti State Governor, Dr. John Kayode Fayemi, who has led his colleagues as Chairman of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), is without a doubt, a man of class, panache and character. And with capacity and competence not in question, he is one of those who has marked up the ranks and quality of those aiming Buhari\u2019s job, more so from the Southwest. Even though he kept this ambition close to his chest, he has never pretended about it and has always meant business. For Fayemi, the game is on and right.\n\nRotimi Amaechi\n\nUnquestionably the most-experienced in the race, having not just held different offices in the past 23 years, but has remained in government for that stretch of time since the return of civil rule in 1999, the immediate past Minister of Transportation, Hon. Rotimi Amaechi, is one issue, whose name is expected to send jitters each time it is mentioned. He knows the game, especially, palace politics, and has since declaring for the office of the president, shown the stuff he is made of. Amaechi is one man to watch out for and whose capacity for showing up insidiously is top notch. He boasts competence too.\n\nKen Nnamani\n\nRenowned largely for killing former President Olusegun Obasanjo\u2019s third term agenda, a former Senate President, Ken Nnamani, is another face of the South-east in the race that cannot be taken for granted. He has capacity, experience, maturity and has shown to know Nigeria and her challenges. Despite his personal inadequacies, he wouldn\u2019t stop getting a deserved mention until this is over.\n\nAbubakar Badaru\n\nA prominent and critical factor in some of the APC power centres is the Jigawa State Governor, Abubakar Badaru. He cannot be pushed back as far as the race for the APC ticket is concerned. Whilst a majority of the people think his being in the race is to negotiate the office of the vice-president, who says if the South mismanages their chance, he would not gladly take the presidency itself? This is why this Jigawa governor cannot be underrated.\n\nSani Yerima\n\nFormer governor of Zamfara State, Senator Sani Yerima\u2019s presidential ambition is one that a lot of political observers have yet to situate in context. But from the time he obtained his forms to submitting them, he has neither flinched not fidgeted about what he wanted. He clearly has some plans up his sleeves. Whatever they are, all eyes on him as the battle for the APC ticket thickens.\n\nIkeobasi Mokelu\n\nA former Minister of Information and Culture during the late Gen. Sani Abacha junta, Chief Ikeobasi Mokelu, was among the last to venture into the race for the APC ticket. But, he is already boasting that his presidency would apply honour, character, and integrity in the application of efficient and sustainable governance at all levels and in the three arms of government. Whatever his end game is, the floor is open, at least, for now.\n\nBen Ayade\n\nFustian and unashamed, the Cross River State Governor, Professor Ben Ayade, is another presidential hopeful on the APC long list of aspirants, whose intention is hard to decode. Disadvantaged from many points, this timid-looking former member of the opposition PDP, is gradually wearing a serious look, having crossed the second round of the nomination process. Although not much has been seen of him in terms of consultation, the question of how much of home support he could garner has kept coming back each time is name is put up in focus\n\nTein Jack-Rich\n\nForty-seven years old Tein Jack-Rich is the President and Founder of Belemaoil Producing Limited, a company often described as the first indigenous oil exploration and production company in Nigeria, even though that consideration is arguable. Coming from an oil producing community in Akuku-Toru Local Government Area of Rivers State, not a few understood yet what a completely apolitical Jack-Rick was doing flexing muscles in an otherwise muddy political terrain. But he seems convinced about his decision and is leaving nothing to chance as the journey to the presidential primaries continues.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "FG Declines Consent to Seplat, Mobil Oil Producing Assets Acquisition Deal",
          "text": "Obinna Chima\n\n\n\nThe federal government declined its consent to the proposed acquisition of oil and gas assets belonging to Mobil Oil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (MPNU) by Seplat Energy.\n\nThe government among others, cited overriding national interest as one of the reasons for rejecting the deal.\n\nThe Chief Executive, Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), Engr. Gbenga Komolafe, stated these in two separate letters addressed to the Chairman/ Managing Director, Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited, Mr. Richard Laing as well as the immediate past Chairman of Seplat Energy, Dr. ABC Orjiako. Both letters obtained by THISDAY yesterday, were dated May 13, 2022.\n\nSeplat Energy had in February this year, announced its acquisition of oil and gas assets belonging to MPNU. But the deal was subject to Ministerial Consent and other required regulatory approvals. However, few weeks after, it was reported that the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited had opted to exercise its Right of First Refusal (RFR) on the sale of the assets, which then put a hold on the transaction.\n\nBut Komolafe in the letter stressed that regardless of the mode of the transaction, Mobil Oil still remains to all intents and purposes, the assignor of the asset under the Nigerian law.\n\n\u201cWe also note that MPNU failed to follow the procedure for assignments laid down in the Guidelines by not providing the requisite notices to the Commission at all relevant stages of the transaction. Even if the transaction has been between Seplat Energy Offshore Limited and the MPNU shareholders, responsibility to ensure compliance with Nigerian laws, rules and regulations always remain that of MPNU, the entity that was awarded the assets.\n\n\u201cWe regret to inform you that His Excellency, the Minister of Petroleum Resources has declined his consent to the transaction.\n\n\u201cNothing in this letter shall be deemed to be a waiver, on the part of the Commission, of any rights under the Guidelines, any law, rule or regulation, and the Commission reserves all its rights in respect of the subject matter. Please accept the assurances of my highest esteem,\u201d the Commission\u2019s boss stated in the letter addressed to Laing, with reference number: NUPRC/LD/1189/01, titled: \u201cRe: Potential Sale and Purchase of the Equity (Shares) of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited.\u201d\n\nHe also made reference to the multinational oil company\u2019s letter dated March 30, 2022 with Ref: MPN-PGA-NUP-CCE-0322-0027 on the above subject matter.\n\nKomolafe highlighted contents of the letter MPNU wrote then to the NUPRC on the proposed acquisition, and in particular, the section that stated that the transaction was between parties who were not privy to the Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) between the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and the MPNU dated June 28, 1990, and that does not trigger any relevant rights or obligations under the JOA for either NNPC or MPNU. Also, the MPNU had stated in the letter that the sale of shares by shareholders of MPNU would have no bearing on the consent or preferential right and option requirements of the JOA in favour of NNPC and that the NNPC does not have preferential rights in respect to the transaction.\n\nIn addition, the regulator made reference to another aspect of the letter Mobil wrote to it on the matter that, the MPNU shareholders would be proceeding with their efforts to satisfy the conditions required for the approval of the proposed transaction, and the procurement of the consent of the Minister of Petroleum Resources.\n\nFurthermore, the Commission pointed out that: \u201cYou may also be aware that the Commission is in receipt of a letter of 10th March 2022, written by Seplat Energy to the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, requesting the consent of the Minister of Petroleum Resources to the transaction. This letter was received by the Commission on March 30, 2022.\n\n\u201cPlease be advised that even if the transaction in question were between parties who are not privy to the JOA, MPNU remains the leaseholder of the assets subject to the transaction and the focal point of contact with the federal government of Nigeria on any matter or dealings with the assets.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, you may wish to note that paragraph 3.1 of the Guidelines and Procedures for Obtaining Minister\u2019s Consent to the Assignment of Interest in Oil and Gas Assets 2021 provides, in line with extant Nigerian law, that \u2018an Assignment involves the transfer of an OPL, OML, MF or OGPL or an interest, power or right therein by any company or person with equity, participating, contractual or working interest in the said OPL, OML, MF or OGPL, through merger, acquisition, take-over, divestment or any such transaction that may alter the ownership, equity, rights or interest of the assigning company in question, not minding the nature of upstream arrangement that the assigning company may be involved in, including but not limited to Joint Venture (JV), Production Sharing Contract (PSC), Production Sharing Agreement (PSA),Service Contract (SC), Sole Risk (SR) or Marginal Fields operation.\u2019\n\n\u201cAlso note that overriding National interest will always be the compass of the law. Paragraph 3.1.1 of the guidelines also expressly restates that assignment shall include, but not be limited to: \u2018assignment by way of exchange or transfer of shares: This shall entail the acquisition of part or all of the shares of a company which holds an OPL, OML, MF or OGPL in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAccording to the regulatory commission, until an assignment was completed, including the granting of Ministerial consent to such assignment, the leaseholder remains the registered owner of the asset and the only one with the locus to interact with the government in respect of the asset.\n\nAlso, in the letter addressed to Orjiako, the regulatory commission also highlighted relevant sections in the Guidelines and Procedures for Obtaining Minister\u2019s Consent to the Assignment of Interest in Oil and Gas Assets 2021.\n\n\u201cThus, regardless of the mode of the transaction, MPNU, remains, to all intents and purposes, the assignor under Nigerian law and is the proper person to bring an application for Ministerial consent to the transaction, not Seplat. Consequently, you are hereby requested to revert to MPNU, the assignor, to receive updates on your application,\u201d it stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\n\n\nJustice Binta Nyako of the Abuja Division of the Federal High Court on Wednesday, told the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, that he cannot be granted bail until he explains to the court why he breached the previous bail given to him in April 2017.\n\nKanu is standing trial on alleged treasonable felony and terrorism charges.\n\nFollowing his failing health while in custody, Justice Nyako had admitted him to bail in the sum of N100 million with three sureties in like sum among whom must be a serving senator.\n\nHowever, a few months after his bail, he had fled the country after soldiers invaded his family house in Abia State, forcing the prosecution to apply for the revocation of his bail which was granted in 2019.\n\nHis absence stalled his trial until he was rearrested and brought to the country last year to continue trial.\n\nHowever, Kanu through his lawyer, told the court upon re-arraignnent that he didn\u2019t jump bail but only fled for his life after the military\u2019s attack on his family house in 2017.\n\nSubsequently, he applied for a fresh bail to enable him attend to his failing health and also prepare adequately for his trial.\n\nHowever, the court in a ruling delivered Wednesday rejected the application on the grounds that the defendant explained to the court his absence from trial since 2017 when he was granted bail until last year when he was re-arraigned.\n\nThe judge held that until that is done, the defendant cannot be considered for a fresh bail.\n\n\u201cUntil the issue of absence of the defendant for his trial, with all the bail conditions breached is determined, the instant application of the defendant for bail will at best be premature and it is refused.\n\n\u201cHowever, the defendant is at liberty to re-file the application,\u201d Justice Nyako held.\n\nJustice Nyako observed that Kanu\u2019s trial had suffered various setbacks owing to over 19 interlocutory applications that have been filed in the matter.\n\nShe appealed to parties to allow the case to proceed on trial and justice dispensed accordingly.\n\nDetails later\u2026\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

This is to allow for proper and unhindered investigation into the serious allegations in line with Public Service Rules 030406.\u201d\n\nIt added that during the period, Idris is not expected to \u201cattend your place of work or contact any official in your office except for any disciplinary hearing that may be advised\u201d.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported that Idris was arrested by the EFCC on Monday while on his way to Kano.\n\nThe anti-graft agency stated that he allegedly diverted funds and laundered N80billion.\n\nSaharaReporters had in a series of detailed investigations exposed how Idris acquired several properties whose values ran into many billions of naira since he was appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari as the administrative head of the treasury in June 2015.\n\nA visit to Gezawa Commodity Market Limited and Gezawa Integrated Farms Limited owned by Idris lend credence to the allegations made by concerned citizens and some stakeholders on how and where the AGF got the money he used in acquiring the multi-billion-naira firms, both in Kano through his direct family members.\n\nThe shareholdings of both firms indicate a spread of Idris family members on the official board.\n\nCertified copies of the documents from the Corporate Affairs Commission seen by SaharaReporters showed that the shares for Gezawa Commodity Market Limited are distributed among the family members of the AGF as follows:\n\n(1) Zainab Ahmed Idris: 35,000,000 shares\n\n(2) Shamsiyya Ahmed Idris: 35,000,000 shares\n\n(3) Nabila Mu\u2019azu Abubakar: 35,000, 000 shares\n\n(4) Zuhair Ahmad Idris: 22,500,000\n\n(5) Hussain Ahmad Idris: 22,500,000 shares\n\n(6) Abdulrraham Ahmed Idris: 22,500,000 shares\n\n(7) Khadija Ahmed Idris: 18,500,000 shares\n\n(8) Mua\u2019zu Abubakar lll: 40,000,000 shares\n\n(9) Mohammed Chiroma: 60,000,000 shares\n\n(10) Alh Usman Kansila Yahaya: 60,000,000 shares\n\n(11) Baloni Ibrahim Lawal (representing Silvermark Investment Limited) : 60,000,000 shares\n\n(12) Abubakar Nabila Mua\u2019zu (representing Gezawa Integrated Farms Limited): 20,000,000 shares.\n\nThere have also been questions asked about how the AGF bought \u201cSokoto Hotel\u201d in Kano with N500million cash.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that Idris upon acquiring the hotel ordered its immediate demolition with the intention to build a multi-billion-naira shopping mall on the property.\n\nDespite clocking 60 years in 2020, Idris succeeded in pulling different strings in the Presidency to secure an extension of his appointment beyond the legal limit.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that he engaged the services of highly placed persons including governors, senators and emirs who prevailed on President Buhari to give him the extension.\n\nThe action is however against the civil service rules, which state that a career civil servant must disengage from service either after attaining 60 years of age or having worked for 35 years, whichever comes first.\n\nIt was also against a circular from the office of the Head of Service to all agencies of the Nigerian Government which says, \u201cFor avoidance of doubt and in order to maintain discipline and integrity of the extant public service rule which prescribed 60 years of age or 35 years of service for mandatory retirement, should strictly be complied with.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the following guidelines shall apply. (I) that career officers who take up tenured appointment should at the point of taking up the appointment retire from service to ensure they run their term uninterrupted.\n\n\u201c(II) that career officers who have not retired from service before the commencement of their tenured appointment must leave office on attainment of mandatory age/years of service for retirement and (iii) that career officers who are currently holding tenured appointment are required to retire from service with immediate effect and continue to run their term. Failure to do so would mean that they would vacate office on attaining the mandatory age or at the expiration of their term whichever comes first.\u201d\n\nIdris\u2019 arrest is also coming a few months after he secretly married a 16-year-old Kano State girl, identified simply as Hussain.\n\nSaharaReporters had in a string of reports revealed that despite Hussain\u2019s family kicking against the wedding, Idris who turned 61 on November 25, 2021, insisted on marrying her.\n\n\u201cThis is our late sister\u2019s daughter by name Hussain; she\u2019s just sixteen, not long that she clocked sixteen years old but it\u2019s very unfortunate that a lady called Amina was the one that linked or brought the Accountant-General to our house in order to seek her hand in marriage.\n\n\u201cThis, she did, knowing that this is a very young girl, what does that mean? It shows the accountant general is just after that small girl to take advantage of her youthful age.\n\n\u201cImmediately I heard, I messaged him because when I was working with the then Head of Service, I had the opportunity of having his contact when we met over a serious matter about the country. So, I messaged him on WhatsApp regarding his wedding; I sent him my picture, that of my son, my late sister and the daughter, Hussain. He replied that it\u2019s a small world which confirmed the wedding was true,\u201d a top family source had confided in SaharaReporters.\n\nThe family source added that the Accountant-General bribed some media organisations they contacted for help and their request to expose his atrocities was therefore turned down.\n\n\u201cHe went as far as bribing this girl with gold of over N200million, iPhones, buying cars for her, giving her millions of naira \u2013 all to buy her attention. He started meeting different people that he wanted to know about the girl\u2019s family; he married the girl, just like that.\n\n\u201cThere was no investigation just because he is the Accountant General of the Federation. Why are things happening in this country like this? He even told the girl to go and look for any house of her choice in Abuja, that he is ready to purchase it for her.\n\n\u201cHe is spending the government money and every media house we go to report him, he pays them not to air or report the story. Please help us for justice to be done. This girl is just sixteen years old,\u201d the source had added.",

          "text": "On Wednesday, there was chaos at Dei-Dei, a suburb of Abuja, which houses the popular building materials market.\n\nAn accident said to have occurred in the area led to riot, which resulted in the destruction of shops and vehicles.\n\nSeveral persons were also said to have sustained gunshot wounds during the incident.\n\nAlthough the federal capital territory administration (FCTA) has since ordered an indefinite closure of the market, when TheCable visited the area on Thursday, several residents could be seen lamenting the consequences of the violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Sanni Idris, who identified himself as a tax collector, \u201can okada rider of Hausa extraction, who was conveying an Igbo woman, crashed into a truck\u201d.\n\nThe woman was said to have died in the accident, while the okada rider sustained injuries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what happened. I was just leaving a stall and I was in the area to collect tax. The motorcycle was burnt immediately in protest over the woman\u2019s death. Three other motorcycles were burnt; look at the ashes,\u201d Idris said.\n\nDairu Garba, secretary of the tomato sellers\u2019 association, corroborated Idris\u2019 claim.\n\n\u201cThe road safety said they will take the okada man and the corpse of the woman. The people there said they will be the ones to take the okada man. Right there, other okada riders disagreed with them, and insisted they wouldn\u2019t allow the okada rider to be taken away. And that\u2019s how the argument started,\u201d Dairu said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018THERE WAS SHOOTING IN THE MOSQUE\u2019\n\nAccording to Mohammed Mohammad, the chief Imam of Abu Huraira central mosque, the accident happened outside the gate of the main market, but within minutes, the chaos had spread to the timber shed division and other parts of the market.\n\nMohammad said the mosque provided cover for persons fleeing the violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn less than 15 minutes of observing the situation, an unidentified armed man shot a pump action rifle directly through the fence of the mosque,\u201d he said.\n\nThe shooting was said to have resulted in the death of five persons \u2014 including one person pronounced dead on Thursday morning \u2014 while 31 others sustained injuries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaba Ado, the chairman of the market, also said a total of five persons were reported dead, with 30 injured.\n\n\u2018WE HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOR MORE THAN 15 YEARS\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSunday Elijah was surrounded by his \u2018boys\u2019 who work with him on menial jobs inside the part of the market where timber is sold.\n\nSpeaking as he puffed heavy smoke after taking a drag from a rolled sheet of paper, Elijah said he has been in the market for more than 15 years as a casual worker.\n\nHe also said he had witnessed two of such riots \u2014 one in 2014 and another in 2015.\n\n\u201cThis is the third time I would witness a clash here, but this is the craziest. See my friend here, he is a Muslim and I am a Christian. We have been living and working peacefully in this timber shed for the past 15 years,\u201d Elijah said, while pointing to a man named Shamsudeen.\n\n\u201cSomeone was killed outside the market and it spread down here. We just saw people running. At exactly 12pm, I started seeing flames everywhere. My boss\u2019 shop is down. I have two children and a wife. I use the money I make here daily to feed them. I don\u2019t know how to survive this till Monday,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, Elijah and other traders in the market accused security operatives drafted to the area of not doing enough to douse the tension.\n\n\u201cSome of them only came to cause more commotion, which is not good in this country we are,\u201d Sunday said.\n\n\u201cTruly, one woman died and the woman\u2019s head exploded like a tire; That was the beginning of the problem. We that we are here, we do not know anything. Do you know how many millions of naira are invested here?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy boss\u2019 shop was burnt. He will need to start from square one. We had soldiers, police and the vigilante but the fight wasn\u2019t stopped on time.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Shamsudeen said his younger brother was shot in the leg while trying to flee the commotion.\n\n\u2018MY SON WAS SHOT IN THE STOMACH\u2019\n\nAminat Umar was just returning from Crown Hospital in Gwagwa when this reporter met her at the pedestrian entrance of the main market.\n\nShe said her son, Adamu Umar \u2014 identified as a 25-year old tailor \u2014 was shot around the stomach region while trying to help a trader who was also shot.\n\n\u201cHe was bleeding profusely. I only hope he survives. He bled too much. He was just trying to help before he was shot in the stomach,\u201d she said.",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya.

          "text": "Disney+ today launched in South Africa.\n\nEarlier in January, the Walt Disney Company confirmed the expansion of its streaming service, Disney+, to 42 new countries, including 6 African countries\u2014Egypt, Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, and South Africa.\n\nLaunched in the US, Canada, and the Netherlands in 2019, Disney+ is currently present in 64 countries, with 137.7 million subscribers worldwide.\n\nIts entry into South Africa will mark the service\u2019s first ingress into the continent, where it joins other international streaming services such as Amazon Prime Video, Shomax, and Netflix.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan, at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum. The plan, similar to Disney+\u2019s $8 plan in the US, allows users to stream concurrently on 4 devices and access unlimited downloads across 10 devices.\n\nOn the service, South Africans will access original Disney content like the Star Wars series and Encanto; and features from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) like Moon Knight. South African users will also access Disney+\u2019s Star Hub where they can view features from other platforms like FX, Hulu, Freeform, and 20th Century Fox.\n\nMore competition for DStv\n\nComparatively speaking, Disney+ is the cheapest international streaming service available to South Africans, beating Amazon Prime Video at R136 ($8.55)/month and Showmax at R225($14.14)/month. While Netflix does have an affordable R49/month Mobile plan in South Africa, the plan only allows 1 user and 1 device. The only Netflix plan similar to Disney+\u2019s Standard R119 plan is Netflix\u2019s Premium plan which costs R199 plan and allows Ultra HD streaming on up to 4 devices.\n\nDisney\u2019s launch will also bring more competition for DStv which has been struggling to retain its users\u2019 on the platform. Last year, it lost over 100,000 high-value subscribers in 6 months after it cut off access to some sports channels from its packages.\n\nDStv, however, does have cheap monthly plans at R59 ($3.71) and R115 ($7.23) and is still the preferred streaming service for most South Africans with over 12 million subscribers (58% of DStv\u2019s total subscribers) glued to the platform.\n\nWhile platforms like Netflix, Disney+, or Amazon Prime Video offer access to more international content, they also come with a major disadvantage, compared to DStv: users need to be connected to the internet to access their services.\n\nData is expensive in South Africa with 1GB costing an average of R78.50 ($5). An hour of streaming on Netflix consumes 1GB of data at standard definition, and 3GB at high definition. Watching just 20 hours of Netflix a month is equal to R1,560 ($98), almost twice the cost of DStv\u2019s most expensive Premium plan.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How Adora Nwodo is making a name for herself in the cloud",
          "text": "Adora Nwodo is a 25-year-old software engineer based in Lagos. She currently works as a cloud engineer at Microsoft and is the author of Cloud Engineering for beginners. I\u2019m bringing Adora to Centre Stage because she has shown great commitment to strengthening developer communities across Nigeria and is an advocate for African women in technology.\n\nAdora Nwodo on cloud engineering and mixed reality\n\nKoromone Koroye: Hi Adora, thanks for agreeing to speak with me. Please, tell me a little about yourself.\n\nAdora Nwodo: I am a software engineer currently building mixed reality on the cloud at Microsoft. I am also a public speaker, published author, digital creator, and occasional DJ.\n\nKK: Are there any differences between cloud and software engineering, or are the terms interchangeable?\n\nAN: There are differences. Anyone who designs, builds, implements, and maintains software applications is a software engineer.\n\nCloud engineers are typically hired to deploy or scale up new and existing cloud resources. Cloud engineers literally do their engineering on the cloud, whether software engineering or DevOps engineering.\n\nKK: What does it mean to build mixed reality (MR) products?\n\nAN: Before I talk about mixed reality, let me briefly explain the difference between augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\n\nAR is essentially an enhanced and interactive version of our physical and real world. If you have ever used Snapchat or Instagram filters, you have interacted with AR somehow.\n\nOn the other hand, VR is a computer-generated environment that usually requires a head-mounted display (HMD) or headset to enjoy a fully-immersed digital experience.\n\nMixed reality blends both AR and VR and provides an interesting middle ground for both technologies. MR gives you the immersive VR experience and the chance to interact with multiple digital objects. Furthermore, MR gives you the illusion that these digital objects exist in your physical space. I can see holograms in my room when I wear a mixed reality headset, but I still get to experience my room as it exists in real life.\n\nKK: Fascinating! What do you enjoy about building mixed reality products in your current role?\n\nAN: I\u2019m building a platform called Mesh for Microsoft. Mesh is the engine that will power the metaverse. Building Mesh has been an exciting experience, primarily because most of the ideas we are working on are relatively new and unknown. Sometimes, building in uncharted territory without a pre-existing playbook to fall back on, can be frustrating. Still, I choose to enjoy the learning process of pioneering a new industry or sector.\n\nDigging deeper with Adora Nwodo\n\nKK: How did you get into cloud engineering? What piqued your interest?\n\nAN: Before joining Microsoft, I already had a vested interest in technology, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and cloud engineering. When I found out about the Microsoft role and that it involved working with mixed reality, I was immediately interested in being a part of the team. During my early months in Microsoft, I primarily worked on the HoloLens before transitioning into cloud-related projects.\n\nKK: Is there a learning curve to accommodate cloud engineering? What are the specific courses people need to take?\n\nAN: If you\u2019re trying to come into cloud engineering, taking an introductory computer science course is essential. The cloud is basically a network of computers, so you need a foundational understanding of computers to understand what is going on. Take any fundamental course on computer science; learn about Linux, operating systems, networking, and cloud fundamentals of the computer.\n\nKK: Let\u2019s talk about your professional growth. Did your career kick off at a startup?\n\nAN: No, it didn\u2019t. I worked with an advertising agency as a software developer before moving to Microsoft.\n\nKK: What was it like transitioning from working at an agency to moving to a more structured and global company like Microsoft?\n\nAN: Joining Microsoft was a breath of fresh air for me, and it wasn\u2019t necessarily about the company as much as it was about the team. I\u2019m a big advocate for working with great teams rather than just great companies. The transition was easy for me because I was excited about the opportunity to build solutions I am passionate about and become the kind of engineer that I have always dreamed of.\n\nAdora on being an African woman in technology\n\nKK: What changes do you think need to be made for gender biases to be eradicated in our ecosystem? It\u2019s obviously going to take a while, but practically speaking, what kind of changes do you think need to be made?\n\nAN: When we talk about gender bias, some people think it\u2019s always conscious, but unconscious biases also exist. I implore African startups and businesses to hold recurring bias training sessions for their employees throughout the year. We can\u2019t start the mindset shift if we don\u2019t educate people and expose them to their conscious and unconscious biases.\n\nHannatu Asheolge: You are pretty influential in the Nigerian tech ecosystem. You\u2019re also a blogger, published author, and active YouTuber. How has putting yourself out there helped you grow?\n\nAdora Nwodo: Putting myself out there is one of the reasons I got into Microsoft at the time that I did. Being active in the developer community and on LinkedIn at that time put me on a recruiter\u2019s radar; it helped me acknowledge that I\u2019m a big fan of learning in public. If I didn\u2019t try to learn in public by posting tweets about things I was reading or learning, people wouldn\u2019t have reached out to me to offer help. Finally, it helped me build my network. Going to ecosystem-related events, meeting new people, and taking on collaborative projects has helped my professional growth.\n\nHA: You recently announced that you were accepted into a Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB) programme. What does this acceptance mean to you as a young Nigerian woman?\n\nAN: I am excited about learning career-accelerating skills like leadership and business management, and I get to be a part of the impressive GSB network.\n\nHA: Do you have any tips you\u2019d like to share about balancing work life and school?\n\nAA: First of all, I don\u2019t know if balance is achievable. I like to think we just try our best and leave the rest to vibes, to a great extent. Delegation is a skill everyone needs to learn on the job. You don\u2019t have to do everything, primarily when you work with a team of talented people. How you prioritise your tasks and assignments matters as well. Prioritise, delegate, and ask for help.\n\nMy calendar has also made my life easier recently. I use it to schedule most of my days to avoid wasting time on unnecessary tasks.\n\nHA: You\u2019re very vocal about your non-work-related hobbies and interests. Can you share some of your favorite hobbies or after-work activities?\n\nAN: I love going around drinking wine and eating steak and mashed potatoes. I enjoy the whole restaurant-hopping thing with a bunch of my friends where we\u2019re just eating good food and drinking wine. I also DJ at lounges and curated events.\n\nHA: You\u2019re currently part of several communities. Can you share a few that have helped shape your professional and personal growth?\n\nAN: I\u2019ve been a part of several communities, but the one that really helped a lot at the start of my career was Google Developer Groups(GDG). I was a co-organiser for GDG Ajah and a member of GDG Lagos. My involvement with them helped me meet many tech people at that time. Currently, I\u2019m VP for the Nigerian chapter of the VR/AR Association. The goal is to advocate for VR and AR usage in this region and let the world see what Nigerian companies are doing with VR and AR technology.\n\nHA: You\u2019re a young woman with a thriving career. Do you see yourself sticking with cloud engineering for a long time, or is there a career pivot in your future?\n\nAN: There\u2019s a career pivot in my future. I see myself taking on more roles that allow me to make business decisions within tech organisations pretty soon. Engineering decisions are fun, but I definitely want to take on roles that will enable me to make more business and product decisions at some point in my career.\n\nShare this article",

This means you can skip some boring parts of YouTube videos. And no, you haven\u2019t missed out because the feature was introduced yesterday, May 18, 2022.\n\nThe company said it added a graph that people can use to quickly locate and watch parts played the most by other users. Per YouTube, \u201cif the graph is high, that part of the video has been replayed frequently.\u201d\n\nYouTube is also introducing another feature, Single Loop, which allows users to loop a video indefinitely. Moreover, in full-screen mode, a new panel will appear to display video information like the video description, video chapters, and comments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, YouTube is expanding support for video chapters to smart TVs and gaming consoles. It\u2019s a feature that enables users to skip ahead to a specific video section or easily rewatch that section.\n\nSo, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAutochek\u2019s new acquisition\n\nTikTok\u2019s Branded Mission\n\nBamba\u2019s $3.2 million seed\n\nJumia\u2019s earnings for Q1 2022\n\nAutochek acquires Morocco\u2019s KIFAL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutochek, a digital automotive commerce company, has acquired Morocco\u2019s KIFAL Auto.\n\nThis follows Autochek purchasing Cheki\u2019s subsidiaries in Ghana and Nigeria and collaborating with the CFAO Group to launch the network in Ivory Coast last year.\n\nConsequently, Autochek is now available in West Africa (Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast). It\u2019s also present in East Africa (Kenya and Uganda). And thanks to the acquisition of KIFAL Auto, it now has a presence in North Africa, specifically Morocco.\n\nLaunched in 2019 by Nizar Abdalaoui Maane, KIFAL claims it\u2019s one of the leading auto marketplaces in Morocco, one of Africa\u2019s largest markets for used and new cars.\n\nKIFAL Auto, like Autochek, connects car buyers and sellers and, through partnerships, provides financing and insurance.\n\nFollowing this acquisition, Maane and the KIFAL Auto team joins Autochek to lead the company\u2019s North African expansion efforts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Autochek, it has 1,500 dealers as partners across its markets and partnerships with over 70 financing partners, including Access Bank, Ecobank, UBA, Bank of Africa, and NCBA Bank.\n\nFor more information on this acquisition, listen to today\u2019s episode of the Techpoint Africa Podcast here.\n\nTikTok to roll out a new ad product\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTikTok has announced the launch of \u201cBranded Mission,\u201d a new advertising product.\n\nWith this product, creators will be able to connect with brands and potentially earn rewards for their videos using this product.\n\nAdvertisers can use the new ad product for crowdsourcing content from creators and turning top-performing videos into ads. Also, they can launch branded campaigns and encourage creators to participate in them.\n\nThey\u2019ll create a brief and distribute it to the creator community to encourage them to participate in Branded Missions. TikTok creators can then choose which Branded Missions to join.\n\nIn summary, Branded Mission allows emerging and aspiring creators to respond to ad casting calls directly on TikTok.\n\nSo, who is eligible to participate? Branded Missions are open to all creators who are 18 years old and above and have at least 1,000 followers.\n\nPer TikTok, eligible creators whose videos are chosen by brands will \u201cbenefit from a cash payment and increased traffic.\u201d\n\nAlso, the company believes that this product will allow the TikTok community to have a creative hand in brand campaign ads.\n\nBranded Mission is currently in beta testing and is available to brands in over a dozen markets. Plus, it will be available in more markets later this year.\n\nSimilar, but kinda different: Recall that earlier this month, TikTok introduced Pulse, a new advertising program that allows brands to place advertisements alongside the platform\u2019s most popular videos.\n\nWell, the company emphasises that it is constantly looking for innovative ways to support creators and assist brands in reaching users on its platforms with relevant content.\n\nBesides, the product is currently available in 12 countries, with plans to expand into additional markets by the end of the year.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022) will take place in two days!

The startup is focused on simple tools for merchants to manage their customers, record stocks, receive payments, make payments, and access cash advances against their future cash flow.\n\nBamba aims to be one of the innovators in addressing the lack of digital solutions for record-keeping and payments, which creates a barrier that prevents these businesses from scaling due to insufficient access to credit facilities.\n\nConsequently, it plans to use the funds to expand its engineering team and user base in 12 sub-Saharan African countries where mobile money is prevalent.\n\nJumia\u2019s Q1 2022 report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJumia, the pan-African e-commerce company, announced its first-quarter financial results on Tuesday, May 17, 2022.\n\nOn today\u2019s podcast, Chimgozirim refers to Jumia as \u201c\u2026the guy who never fulfils his potential.\u201d What?! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d That was brutal, if you ask me. What do you think?\n\nAnyway, when you compare this report to the first quarter of 2021, you\u2019ll see how Jumia\u2019s results demonstrated consistent growth.\n\nNow, you\u2019re asking me how. Well, I\u2019ve got you. The report shows that Jumia experienced significant growth in orders, gross merchandise value (GMV), and revenue.\n\nIn other words, orders increased by 40% year on year, from 6.6 million to 9.3 million. GMV increased by 27% year on year, from $198.9 million to $252.7 million. And Jumia\u2019s revenue reached $47.6 million, up 44 percent from $33 million in Q1 2021.\n\nHowever, these figures fell far short of where the eCommerce giant ended 2021, with the last quarter recording GMV sales of $330 million, revenue of $62 million, and orders of 11.3 million.\n\nDespite \u201ccontinued global supply chain volatility for these categories,\u201d food delivery grew 86% year over year, while phones and electronics grew 19%.\n\nOther negatives include its Q1 2022 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) loss, at $53 million, up 70% year on year.\n\nIf you want to know why Chimgozirim said what he said, don\u2019t forget to listen to the podcast.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nSEC\u2019s rules: Crypto exchange CEOs to retire after 10 years\n\nOpportunities\n\nDo you breathe crypto or are you simply crypto-curious?

Using the National Identification Number (NIN), the organisation wants to track financial transactions in the country to tax Nigerians effectively. Your NIN will be required for any transaction you engage in, including paying school fees or purchasing a car.\n\nThis was how we kicked off proceedings on the Techpoint Africa podcast today. While this development could increase government revenues, Oluwanifemi wondered how good this could be in light of revelations that cast doubt on the safety of data collected by Nigerian government agencies.\n\nNext was a look at Jumia\u2019s financial report for the first quarter of 2022. Compared to Q1 2021, the company witnessed impressive growth with revenue growing to $47.6 million, orders growing to 9.3 million, and gross merchandise value hitting $252.7 million.\n\nWith the company announcing that it had acquired a payment service solution provider license (PSSP), we explored the possibility of the company growing its fintech footprints. We also touched briefly on its healthtech ambitions and its chances of survival.\n\nWe rounded up the day\u2019s discussion with news of Autochek\u2019s acquisition of the Moroccan cars marketplace KIFAL Autos and the viability of the BNPL model for cars. Emmanuel shared a Technext report that revealed that most car marketplaces in Nigeria made up to 150% profit from car sales. With many Nigerians earning below 200,000, it\u2019s not clear how profitable these companies could be in the long run.\n\nFor a more detailed discussion, please follow the links attached to get this episode on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and Google Podcasts.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued rules and guidelines for all crypto and digital asset service providers on Friday, May 13, 2022.\n\nThe rules in the document, New Rules on Issuance, Offering Platforms and Custody of Digital Assets, include:\n\nNew licence requirements for platforms that deal with digital assets\n\nCategorisation of the platforms\n\nGuidelines for their operations\n\nSEC Rules for virtual asset service providers (VASPs)\n\nAnyone offering crypto or digital assets-related service in Nigeria is a VASP. The categorisation of VASPs is further broken down into:\n\nDigital Assets Offering Platforms (DAOPs): These platforms enable the issuance of digital assets for fundraising purposes. They can also be called Initial Coin Offering platforms. You can liken it to a place where public companies offer their stocks for sale, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).\n\nDigital Asset Custodians (DACs): According to the SEC, \u201cthis means a person who provides the services of providing safekeeping, storing, holding or maintaining custody of virtual assets/digital tokens for another person\u2019s account.\u201d These are crypto wallets like Metamask and Trust Wallet. Crypto exchanges fall into these categories too because they offer wallet services.\n\nDigital Assets Exchange (DAX): This is \u201can electronic platform which facilitates the trading of a virtual asset or digital asset.\u201d They are simply crypto exchanges such as Binance and Quidax.\n\nWho are considered VASPs?\n\nThe SEC identifies any platform that facilitates trading, exchange, issuance, and digital and virtual assets transfer as VASPs. It is an umbrella term for a person or entity that uses/offers any crypto-related services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Commission did not mention any monetary requirement for the registration of VASPs, but there are several requirements and obligations for the registration.\n\nRules for crypto exchanges\n\nIn addition to the general requirements for all VASPs, registering as a Digital Assets Exchange (DAX) \u2014 crypto exchange \u2014 operator requires the following:\n\n\u20a6100,000 application fee ($240)\n\n\u20a6300,000 processing fee ($722.46)\n\n\u20a630 million registration fee ($72,000)\n\nMinimum paid-up capital of \u20a6500 million ($1.2 million)\n\nEvery exchange serving Nigerians must be duly certified by the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). This means exchanges such as Binance and Paxful will have to be registered with the CAC.\n\nEvery exchange will also have a SEC-approved board. The Commission will also approve the appointment of CEOs and other principal officers in exchanges.\n\nCEOs will hold office for no more than ten years. In the words of the SEC, \u201cThe Chief Executive Officer of a DAX Platform shall hold office for five years in the first instance and may be re-appointed for a further period of five years and no more.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commission did not clarify if the CEO\u2019s tenure period will be applied at one crypto exchange or at different exchanges.\n\nThis model is similar to the Nigerian Stock Exchange. The Nigerian Stock Exchange CEO, Oscar Onyema completed his 10-year tenure in April.\n\nExchanges will now be required to submit weekly and monthly trading information, quarterly, and annual financial reports, including compliance reports to the Commission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe SEC must also be notified before an exchange can cease trading operations. They are also not allowed to grant financial assistance to investors or employees to trade digital tokens.\n\nBefore any token or digital asset can be listed for trading on an exchange, the SEC must first issue a \u201cno objection\u201d approval for the token.\n\nThe exchange needs to demonstrate some level of information concerning the token or project. It must have the project\u2019s whitepaper \u2014 an informational document that contains why a token is being created, a roadmap and an incentive for investors \u2014 know its level of security, how secure its blockchain is and the number of nodes it has.\n\nIn addition, it should reveal if the project has suffered any hacks in the past and any security vulnerabilities it has.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s rules on exchanges signify a thorough understanding of how cryptocurrencies work. This has helped the Commission develop measures to protect crypto traders from trading scam tokens and ensure the safety of their funds in exchanges.\n\nHowever, sharing data with the SEC could be a privacy concern for many. Cryptocurrencies, after all, were created to give pseudonymity to financial transactions.\n\nSEC crypto regulations on creating or issuing tokens\n\nThere are currently 19,443 crypto tokens in existence, according to CoinMarketCap. Creating and issuing tokens is relatively easy, making it possible to develop scam tokens.\n\nWith crypto scammers stealing up to $14 billion in 2021, the need for even more protection for investors has never been more apparent.\n\nThe ease of token creation has led to the creation of popular scam tokens such as the Squid Token, which saw investors lose $3 million in two weeks.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s rules on token issuance are to tackle this problem and minimise victims of scam tokens.\n\nThe SEC will now require any business or entity looking to conduct an initial asset offering or initial coin offering (ICO) in Nigeria or targeting Nigerians to submit an assessment form and a draft of its white paper \u2014 an informational document that contains why a token is being created, a roadmap, and incentive for investors.\n\nAfter receiving all necessary filings, the Commission will take 30 days to determine if the project should be offered to Nigerians.\n\nBefore the assessment is complete, all digital asset offerings must have the disclaimer in the whitepaper clearly stating that the SEC has not determined if the asset is suitable for offerings or considered a security.\n\nAccording to the SEC, some digital assets can now constitute securities. The problem of identifying digital assets and cryptocurrencies has always been a major obstacle to their regulation.\n\nIf the SEC considers a digital asset a security under the Securities Act of 2007, the asset will be registered as a digital asset and security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does the SEC determine digital assets as security?\n\nGenerally, a security is a financial instrument that holds monetary value, can be traded publicly, and represents part ownership in a company that has gone public.\n\nFor example, company stocks, bonds and mutual funds are examples of securities. Buying Tesla stock, for example, means you own securities and are a part-owner of the company.\n\nTherefore, it can be inferred that a digital asset that has the characteristics of a security will be considered a security by the SEC.\n\nIn the crypto world, governance tokens are examples of such tokens. They represent a level of ownership or control of an entity, and holders of the token have a right to vote on how a company should be run.\n\nThere\u2019s a \u20a610 billion ($24 million) cap on the amount of money that can be raised through digital assets.\n\nIn recent years, we\u2019ve seen crypto-focused companies try to raise money by issuing crypto tokens to the public. The SEC\u2019s new rules would mean that if a company, say Bitmama, wants to raise funds by issuing tokens, it has to do so on a platform that is VASP registered.\n\nIf the asset offering is to raise money for an entity that deals with digital/virtual assets, then it is a VASP and will need the proper registration to be considered as such.\n\nRules for Digital Assets Offering Platforms (DAOPs)\n\nDAOPs are platforms where digital assets are issued. They can also be called ICO platforms. Tokens are issued on these platforms for people to buy by entities looking to raise money. It is the same way public companies like Tesla and Google sell stocks. Registration for DAOPs is also quite similar to DAXs.\n\nApplication fee of \u20a6100,000 ($240)\n\nProcessing fee of \u20a6300,000 ($722.46)\n\nRegistration fee of \u20a630 million ($72,000)\n\nMinimum paid-up capital of \u20a6500 million ($1.2 million)\n\nAccording to the SEC, DAOPs are expected to carry out due diligence on all digital asset offerings and determine whether to approve them or not. They\u2019re also expected to provide investors with updated information on all digital asset offerings.\n\nLimitations to SEC\u2019s rules\n\nDecentralisation of the crypto space has been a significant challenge to its regulation, and the SEC\u2019s rule does not clearly state its regulatory plans for VASPs operating in the decentralised space.\n\nWhile the Commission can control what goes on in centralised exchanges, it is unaware of what people do on decentralised exchanges where no know-your-customer (KYC) protocol is required.\n\nEnforcing the rules on token issuance and determining which are securities is also limited by decentralised structures of crypto tokens.\n\nTokens that have the characteristics of securities are usually governance tokens mainly used by Decentralised Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and are governed by smart contracts that carry out any actions agreed upon.\n\nWhile the SEC has its rules, following them could be a choice for some VASPs. However, the SEC can bank on investors to only invest in VASPs approved by the Commission for their safety.\n\nOf course, this is not a given.\n\nFor centralised and international crypto companies like Binance, it will be interesting to see how the SEC plans to enforce its rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

Paragraph 3.1.1 of the guidelines also expressly restates that assignment shall include, but not be limited to: \u2018assignment by way of exchange or transfer of shares: This shall entail the acquisition of part or all of the shares of a company which holds an OPL, OML, MF or OGPL in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nRead also: Seplat-ExxonMobil $1.2bn deal delayed on politics\n\nAccording to the regulatory commission, until an assignment was completed, including the granting of Ministerial consent to such assignment, the leaseholder remains the registered owner of the asset and the only one with the locus to interact with the government in respect of the asset.\n\nFailure to follow due process\n\nAccording to Komolafe,\u201dWe also note that MPNU failed to follow the procedure for assignments laid down in the Guidelines by not providing the requisite notices to the Commission at all relevant stages of the transaction.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cEven if the transaction has been between Seplat Energy Offshore Limited and the MPNU shareholders, responsibility to ensure compliance with Nigerian laws, rules and regulations always remain that of MPNU, the entity that was awarded the assets.\u201d\n\nInappropriate application\n\nAlso, in the letter addressed to Orjiako, the regulatory commission also highlighted relevant sections in the Guidelines and Procedures for Obtaining Minister\u2019s Consent to the Assignment of Interest in Oil and Gas Assets 2021.\n\n\u201cThus, regardless of the mode of the transaction, MPNU, remains, to all intents and purposes, the assignor under Nigerian law and is the proper person to bring an application for Ministerial consent to the transaction, not Seplat. Consequently, you are hereby requested to revert to MPNU, the assignor, to receive updates on your application,\u201d it stated.",

          "text": "Motorists and other road users, especially those that are frequently on Eko Bridge, have cried out to both federal and Lagos State governments to end their suffering arising from long hours in terrible traffic on that bridge.\n\nSince March 23, 2022, when the bridge was partially closed to traffic following the fire incident on Akpangbon bridge, the driving experience on Eko Bridge which is a major route to Lagos Island from the Mainland, has been anything but pleasurable.\n\nWhile motorists groan over increased travel time and waste of quality man-hour on the bridge, those who commute to the island through public transport lament increased travel time and cost.\n\nA Lagos resident who lives on the island but has his business on the mainland shared his daily harrowing experience with BusinessDay. \u201cOrdinarily, it takes me less than 30 minutes to get to my office from my house on the island. Now it takes me about three times that time because, to get back to my house after the day\u2019s job, I have to go through Third Mainland Bridge which also has its own traffic challenge.\n\n\u201cIt is as bad as that and you needed to go through Eko Bridge to understand what Lagosians go through on daily basis on that stretch of road just to go to work or get back to their houses,\u201d said the business owner, who did not want his name mentioned.\n\nHe called on the authorities concerned, whether it is the federal government or Lagos state or both, to hasten the palliative work on the burnt Akpangbon Bridge to enable the reopening of the closed bridge and end people\u2019s suffering.\n\nOn his part, Raymond Okon, a banker who works on Victoria Island but lives in Festac Town, lamented how his transport fare has more than doubled from N600 on a motorbike (okada) from Mile 2 to N1,200 to the Island.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s beside the fare from my house which is N200,\u201d said the banker who shared an \u2018okada\u2019 ride with this reporter from Mile 2 to CMS on Wednesday this week.\n\nHe wondered why it was taking so long for the repair work to be completed, calling on the Lagos State government to intervene because, according to him, the state owed its residents the moral duty of making life less stressful, especially in areas where it has capacity.\n\n\u201cThe people who are using this bridge are Lagosians, not people from Kano or Rivers state. They are Lagos residents, many of whom are paying their taxes responsibly to the state government. So, for me, waiting for the federal government to fix the problem amounts to punishing Lagosians,\u201d he said.\n\nRead also: Akpongbon, Eko Bridges to be rehabilitated in phases\n\nWhen Babatunde Fashola, minister of works and housing, came a couple of weeks ago to inspect the burnt bridge along with other bridges in Lagos, he assured that government would soon complete repair work that had already started. But no timeline was given by the minister.\n\nOlukayode Popoola, the federal controller of works in Lagos, had assured of speedy completion of the repair work on the bridge without giving any completion date even though he said it was an emergency.\n\nIn a telephone interview with BusinessDay, the controller said,\u201ddo not go out there and tell them that I gave you a date when the bridge would be reopened because here we are talking about engineering work in which we follow procedures.\u201d\n\nWhen this reporter visited the site of the burnt bridge, one of the workers on-site who volunteered to talk, simply repeated what the contractor said when the minister came, saying that \u201cthe repair work will be done in phases, beginning from the worst areas.\u201d\n\nThe worker, who declined to mention his name, added that how soon or otherwise the repair work would be completed depended on funding from the federal government.\n\nPopoola was not available to comment on the current status of the repair work as his phone rang full circle when this reporter called Thursday afternoon but he did not pick up.",

So, without education and healthcare, at the basis, to strengthen your population, nothing else is going to happen.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThat is why we have prioritized education in Edo and we are spending as much as we can afford on those two issues that affect the people. In the case of education, our focus is on the foundation, because once you have a sound foundation, that child can build on that foundation subsequently.\n\n\u201cThe children in our public schools can compete with their colleagues anywhere in the world. Certainly, we want to extend this to your barracks if you allow us. The Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EdoBEST) is acclaimed as one of the most transparent educational projects on the continent.\n\nEarlier, Mrs. Salamatu Yahaya, said that they were in Edo to launch a skill acquisition empowerment programme and inaugurate a daycare facility, both in Ekehuan cantonment, Benin City.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Anthony Eze, the father of Chidera Eze, a five-year-old pupil of the Redeemers Nursery and Primary School, Ogba, Lagos State, who drowned during a swimming lesson organised by the school in Ikeja, has accused the school staff of neglect.\n\nSome teachers and caregivers of the school took Chidera and his colleagues for the swimming lesson at the Ivory Health Club, Ogundana Street, Ikeja, during which he drowned.\n\nChidera and his colleagues were said to be playing at the tip of the pool when he slipped into it on Monday.\n\nAnthony, while speaking to Punch on Wednesday, said the teachers, caregivers and lifeguards were not aware that his son had fallen into the pool until he drowned.\n\n\u201cI dropped my children at the Redeemers Nursery and Primary School on Acme Road, Ogba, on Monday morning, and I went to work. At 10.52am, I got a call from their head teacher, Mrs Adeola Oladipo, and she told me that my son was involved in an accident and that he had been rushed to the Ikeja Medical Centre,\u201d he told Punch.\n\n\u201cI rushed down there, but what I saw was the lifeless body of my son. I asked the head teacher what happened and she said she did not know. I asked the doctor what happened and he said he was brought in dead. I asked the teachers, caregivers and workers at the club what happened and they gave no explanation.\n\n\u201cAs I was crying, my wife came in; I was trying to manage the information, but the head teacher also informed her and as she ran into the hospital, I became totally confused. I went to the Area F Police Station and after the policemen took pictures of my son\u2019s corpse, we went to the club.\n\n\u201cWhen we got there, we discovered that it was the adult swimming pool section that they took the pupils to. I was alarmed and while the policemen were investigating, we realised that CCTV was installed at the club. So, we demanded to check the CCTV footage and it revealed everything.\u201d\n\nAccording to Anthony, the footage revealed that his son was in the pool for over 30 minutes before he died, adding that his son\u2019s corpse was discovered by another person, who came to swim in the pool.\n\nHe told Punch, \u201cIn the footage, we saw that the school brought more than 15 children, took them to the adult side of the swimming pool and made them sit at the tip with their legs in the water and without wearing any kits. We saw only one caregiver in the video and she was just going in and coming out, leaving the children unmanned.\n\n\u201cMy son was at the tail end of the line when he slipped into the pool the first time but he was able to bring himself out of the pool. But the second time he slipped into the water, he could not come out. All these happened and none of the teachers, caregivers, and lifeguards took notice of what was happening.\n\n\u201cMy son was under the water for over 30 minutes and we were all shouting as we watched the video. Another pupil also fell into the water, but her colleagues raised the alarm and they pulled her out and while this was going on, nobody noticed my son was inside the water.\n\n\u201cMy son died because of the recklessness of these people who were supposed to take care of him. I want justice to forestall this kind of thing happening again. The caregivers, lifeguards, school management and the Ivory Health Club can\u2019t go unpunished. My son\u2019s corpse has been deposited in the morgue.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson for the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Olaitan Olubiyi, did not take his calls and had yet to respond to a text message sent to his mobile number as of press time, according to Punch.\n\nThe state Police Public Relations Officer, Benjamin Hundeyin, said some members of staff of the school and the club had been arrested.\n\n\u201cA thorough investigation into the circumstances that led to the drowning of the boy is ongoing,\u201d he added\n\nMeanwhile, the school has been shut since the incident happened on Monday, as confirmed by a security guard who said the there hasn\u2019t been any activity in the school since Monday when the tragedy struck.",

          "text": "The federal government has said that though the newly promoted former acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, has been retired, he would be prosecuted if eventually indicted by the probe panel chaired by Justice Ayo Salami (retd).\n\nMinister of Police Affairs, Maigari Dingyadi, disclosed this to State House correspondents on Thursday during the weekly ministerial briefing organised by the presidential communication team at the Presidential Villa.\n\nRecall that following the accusations raised against the former anti-graft czar by the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, President Muhammadu Buhari had set up an investigative panel chaired by Justice Salami to probe him in July 2020.\n\nThe Salami panel upon conclusion of its assignment had submitted its report in November of the same year to the President.\n\nAsked why the Police authorities were yet to act on the recommendations of the panel but chose to promote Magu to the position of the Assistant Inspector General (AIG) of Police before his eventual retirement, Dingyadi said \u201cthis is an issue that should have been addressed by the Police Service Commission, who have the responsibility to conduct promotions of the police.\n\n\u201cThey are not here. And I am aware that the Police Service Commission is directly under the presidency. So, I cannot speak for them. But what I know is that Mr. Magu has already retired and that is what I can tell you now.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he was promoted is a matter for the Police Commission to maybe throw more light on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not aware of the position of the government on the report you are talking about and I think it is still being under consideration. It doesn\u2019t mean that when he retires, the laws will not catch up with him whenever he is found guilty. So, I think it\u2019s not a finished business.\u201d\n\nHe also disclosed that the Police has begun to deploy technology in dealing with crimes and criminalities in the country.\n\nAccording to him, the Police authorities were striving hard to be civil in their operations but would deploy firearms when necessary for the discharge of their responsibilities.\n\nDingyadi also disclosed that the Ministry was considering the recruitment of additional 10,000 police constables in the next one month or two in line with the President\u2019s directive to employ 40,000 men within his second tenure in office.\n\nResponding to the request for psychiatric tests for policemen to ascertain their psychological stability, the minister said the men were being made to undergo rigorous and extensive screening, including medical tests on prospective recruits, assuring that the best available were those engaged in the system.\n\nWhile noting that the demands of the ENDSARS protesters boiled down to police welfare, which the government has begun to implement, the minister disclosed that 25,000 constabularies have been trained for community policing.\n\nHe, however, urged the community leaders to cooperate with the constabularies posted to them by gathering and sharing intelligence as well as reporting cases that needed to be reported.\n\nAsked to identify the unknown gunmen causing havoc in the South-east since the members of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) have disowned the killings in the region, Dingyadi said \u201cOkay, the unknown gunmen, you want to know who they are? I want to tell you that they are unknown gunmen and they are also criminals. They\u2019re terrorists and we are dealing with them in the language they understand.\u201d",

          "text": "Europe and the United States have raised alarm over the rising cases of monkeypox, a viral disease, which spreads through close contact and was first found in monkeys.\n\nBritain, Portugal, Spain and the United States have reported a handful of cases.\n\nThe outbreaks are raising alarm because the disease mostly occurs in west and central Africa, and only very occasionally spreads elsewhere.\n\nHere is what scientists know so far.\n\n\u2018HIGHLY UNUSUAL\u2019\n\nMonkeypox is a virus that causes fever symptoms as well as a distinctive bumpy rash. It is usually mild, although there are two main strains: the Congo strain, which is more severe \u2013 with up to 10% mortality \u2013 and the West African strain, which has a fatality rate in about 1% of cases.\n\nThe UK cases have been reported as the West African strain.\n\n\u201cHistorically, there have been very few cases exported. It has only happened eight times in the past before this year,\u201d said Jimmy Whitworth, a professor of international public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who said it was \u201chighly unusual\u201d.\n\nPortugal has logged five confirmed cases, and Spain is testing 23 potential cases. Neither country has reported cases before. read more\n\nThe United States has also reported one case.\n\nTRANSMISSION\n\nThe virus spreads through close contact, both in spillovers from animals and, less commonly, between humans. It was first found in monkeys in 1958, hence the name, although rodents are now seen as the probable main animal host.\n\nTransmission this time is puzzling experts, because a number of the cases in the United Kingdom \u2013 nine as of May 18 \u2013 have no known connection with each other.\n\nOnly the first case reported on May 6 had recently traveled to Nigeria.\n\nAs such, experts have warned of wider transmission if cases have gone unreported.\n\nThe UK Health Security Agency\u2019s alert also highlighted that the recent cases were predominantly among men who self-identified as gay, bisexual or men who have sex with men, and advised those groups to be aware. read more\n\nScientists are now carrying out genomic sequencing to see if the viruses are linked, the World Health Organization (WHO) said this week.\n\nWHY NOW?\n\nOne possible scenario behind the rise in cases is increased travel as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted.\n\n\u201cMy working theory would be that there\u2019s a lot of it about in west and central Africa, travel has resumed, and that\u2019s why we are seeing more cases,\u201d said Whitworth.\n\nMonkeypox puts virologists on the alert because it is in the smallpox family, although it causes less serious illness.\n\nSmallpox was eradicated by vaccination in 1980, and the shot has since been phased out.\n\nBut it also protects against monkeypox, and so the winding down of vaccination campaigns has led to a jump in monkeypox cases in areas where the disease is endemic, according to Anne Rimoin, an epidemiology professor at UCLA in California.\n\nShe said urgent investigation of the new cases was important as \u201cthey could suggest a novel means of spread or a change in the virus, but this is all to be determined\u201d.\n\nExperts urged people not to panic.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to cause a nationwide epidemic like COVID did, but it\u2019s a serious outbreak of a serious disease \u2013 and we should take it seriously,\u201d said Whitworth.",

          "title": "Sowore needs to graduate from \u201cStudents\u2019 Union\u201d mentality",
          "text": "By Olalekan Adigun\n\nI read the news piece 2023: I\u2019ll Scrap Nigerian Senate, Invest Funds Saved From The \u2018Coven Of Thieves\u2019 On Education \u2014 Sowore on Yele Sowore\u2019s SaharaReporters and was caught aback as to what is going on in this country. My first instinct was \u201cMaybe he was misquoted\u201d or it\u2019s the usual \u201csensational headline\u201d that Sowore\u2019s online news platform is known for. Alas, in feeding my curiosity, it wasn\u2019t the clickbait type of piece I hoped it was: Sowore meant what he said in the headline!\n\nLet me set a background here. Sowore was president of the University of Lagos Students\u2019 Union (ULSU) in 1992. As it is typical of ex-Students\u2019 Union activists, there is the tendency to always bask in the euphoria of their numerous \u201cvictories\u201d whilst on campus. Many of these activists were \u201clords\u201d or \u201ccabals\u201d whilst on campus. These guys had all the solutions to societal problems whilst on University campus especially during the military era in the 1990s.\n\nDo not get me wrong, there is nothing bad about Students\u2019 Unionism. I often encourage students to take an interest in their Students\u2019 Union activities. I am of the belief that Students\u2019 Unions serve as the basis for political leadership. It should be a training ground for future leaders(hip). Like St Paul said in his letter to the Church in Corinth, \u201cWhen I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things\u201d (1 Corinthians 13:11). On his part, Sowore has refused to grow. He may have attained age 50, but unfortunately still thinks or acts like the teenager who was ULSU president about three decades ago. If not, he would, by now, know what works when he was a Students\u2019 Union president and what does not work in the reality of political life. That is why political scientists talk about realpolitik.\n\nFrom Sowore\u2019s tweets, from which the news was scooped, it is obvious he is still imbibed in the populism that wins elections for student leaders on campuses. One then wonders if Sowore knows what it takes to expand, or reduce the membership of the Nigerian Senate, let alone abolish it. While it is convenient to excuse Sowore as a Students\u2019 Union leader who was active during the military era, can we say he has imbibed the military authoritarianism he claimed to be fighting as ULSU president? If not, does he think it takes just the Nigerian president to scrap the Senate\u2013an arm of the National Assembly that can consume even the President himself?\n\nFor the records, I served the Great Ife Students\u2019 Union as a two-time member of the Students\u2019 Representative Council (SRC) and I know there were attempts to amend its Constitution. One such attempt is a proposed clause for a minimum of the controversial 2.5 CGPA requirement for contestants for elective offices (introduced by the university management in 2008). Those who served in this period know it was nearly impossible to include this clause in the sacrosanct Constitution of the Great Ife Students\u2019 Union.\n\nI was added to the WhatsApp group of ex-Students\u2019 Union leaders of the Obafemi Awolowo University. This group comprises people who distinguished themselves in the service of the Union and are still committed to the ideals of independent students\u2019 unionism. In one of our discussions, one member, who was frustrated as to how the once-vibrant Union has become engulfed in corruption and decadence, suggested a clause should be added in the Constitution that allows five former Speakers to impeach a sitting Students\u2019 Union president or any other official. Curiously, I asked where this strange procedure is being practiced. I wanted to know how that would work. This comrade\u2019s argument was that the five speakers should act as Nigeria\u2019s Council of State, which comprises former presidents. I made extra effort to educate this hyper-active comrade that the Council of State is a purely advisory body and lack the power to impeach or remove a sitting president. To say this comrade who was supposed to have graduated several years ago still thinks this way makes you wonder what is still happening!\n\nIn any case, this is a Sowore-type mentality. All noise, no substance. The earlier people realize that running a Students\u2019 or Labour Union as a \u201ccomrade\u201d is dialectically different from holding political offices, the better for everyone. For Sowore, who was ULSU president about three decades ago, to still think he can unilaterally scrap the Senate-something even a military governor won\u2019t dare say should convince you he\u2019s not mentally graduated from \u201ccomrade\u201d group think.\n\nFor Sowore to be able to pull this through, he will need the input from the same Senators he wants to lose to jobs, at least 25 state Houses of Assembly, and the 36 powerful Governors. Does Sowore know when populism ends? To know this, he needs to graduate from this students\u2019 union mentality \u2013 and fast!\n\n-Olalekan Adigun, an Accidental Writer, sent this piece from Lagos.

          "text": "Former President Olusegun Obasanjo says Nigeria requires a leader driven by passion and madness to rule the country and put it on the right footing.\n\nObasanjo, who stated this when he played host to a presidential aspirant under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, at his Abeokuta, Ogun State residence, said he is mad about Nigeria and has no apology for that.\n\nHe lamented that the current situation in Nigeria is not only agonising for him, but for other Nigerians who also desire a better country.\n\nThe former President insisted that, Nigeria can overcome its security challenges within two years with the right leader who is willing to make tough decisions.\n\nObasanjo, therefore urged Nigerians to brace up and be ready to made sacrifices to put the country back on the right path.\n\nHis words: \u201cSome people say the human memories are short, maybe they are right because if human memories are not short, some of the mistakes that we are making, we will not be making them.\n\n\u201cYes, we have a record which some people may find a little bit not what they want to hear, but whatever people want to hear, I believe like you (Hayatu-Deen) have rightly said, that this period is not like any other period in the history of Nigeria and you used two words, decomposing and dissolving. I can\u2019t find any better words to describe the situation we have found ourselves.\n\n\u201cIt is an agonising situation for you obviously and also for me. I want to emphasise the point that the Nigerian situation, bad as it is, will only be put right by Nigerians at the forefront of our situation. So, Nigerians have to brace themselves up to do what needs to be done to put Nigeria back on the right path.\n\n\u201cAnd you are right in saying that wherever you go now, one of the things you hear is that Nigeria is not on the table, but why shouldn\u2019t Nigeria be on the table? What does it cost Nigeria to be on the table?\n\n\u201cI will say four things, of which I was reminded this morning. One is knowledge. If Nigeria is not at the table, maybe the knowledge that we should have of ourselves, of our situation, of our continent and indeed of the world is not that adequate, if that knowledge is adequate, we will do what is right, when it is right and how it is right.\n\n\u201cThe second is vision, what is the vision that we have? And if you have no vision, you may have eyes, but you are blind. And I believe that is part of our situation.\n\n\u201cThe third is passion. And when you said, that you are involved in this, with a passion and I was telling some people this morning that, passion means madness, that you are mad about Nigeria, I am and I have no apologies for that because I have no other country I can call my own and I have no other country I can go to and say yes, I have come to live here.\n\n\u201cPassion means being mad about Nigeria, having a touch of madness and I look at you (Hayatu-Deen) and say yes, you are mad about Nigeria too.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Hayatu-Deen declared that, Nigeria is \u201cdecomposing and dissolving very fast.\u201d\n\nHayatu-Deen, a former Managing Director of FSB International Bank, is currently meeting with the PDP delegates at the party secretariat in Abeokuta.",

Based on that Act, the tenure of the Chairmen would end today and the new Chairmen, based on the elections held in February this year, would be sworn in on 20th May 2022.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut a few days ago, we received communication of a judgment by a court in the Federal Capital Territory directing us to suspend the inauguration of the new Chairmen, based on the fact that the current Chairmen\u2019s tenure would end today, 19th May 2022.\n\n\n\n\u201cAccording to the judgment, based on the recently signed Electoral Act of 2022, which stipulates that the tenure of office of the Chairmen of the Area Councils in FCT would now be four years instead of three years, the existing Chairmen whose tenure were meant to expire or end today, have another one year to continue, based on the new law.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, as a law-abiding government, the FCT Administration has no option than to suspend the planned inauguration of the Six Area Council Chairmen of the Federal Capital Territory who were duly elected some weeks ago as a result of this injunction of the court.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlso, as an administration that is very conscious of the need to abide by the rule of law, even though we are not satisfied with the judgment of the court, we have no option but to comply.\n\n\u201cWhile complying, we are also making efforts to vacate the judgment and if need arises, to appeal the judgment, so that the correct position of the law will be determined by the legal processes.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the interim therefore, we are very conscious of the fact that the stand of the court has raised a lot of concerns within certain sections of the Federal Capital Territory residents. I wish to appeal to everyone to be calm, to be law abiding and to await the outcome of the legal processes.\n\n\n\n\u201cFCT is a creation of law. The FCT has always been known to be a place of unity, peace and good governance and populated by law abiding residents. Please let us continue the way we are and await the court processes. At the end of the court processes, the clear direction of what needs to be done would be clearly stated and then as an administration, we will do the needful.\u2019\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "Minister of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), Mallam Muhammad Musa Bello, has revealed that the violence that erupted at one of Abuja\u2019s popular markets in Dei-Dei was not triggered by religion or ethnicity, but criminal elements.\n\nMallam Bello who spoke Wednesday evening when he visited the market to ascertain the cause and extent of the violence which claimed four lives and resulted in the razing of shops and vehicles within the market.\n\nAccompanied by the Chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council, Mr Abdullahi Adamu Candido, FCT Commissioner of Police Mr Sunday Babaji and other top security and senior officials of the FCTA, the Minister met with the various market and community leaders and took an assessment tour of damage in the market.\n\nSpeaking passionately after the tour, the Minister said \u201cAfter an emergency security meeting with the relevant security agencies including the Commissioner of Police and the Director of the DSS and senior management officials of the FCT, we decided to come here.\n\n\u201cAnd we came here specifically because on the social media, all kinds of stories are being circulated saying there is an inter-ethnic crisis in Abuja with one tribe fighting against the other. I have come here and met the leadership of the market, I have met the leadership of the communities and met the political leadership as represented by the Chairman and vice chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council, and what really came out very clearly was that this was an accident that occurred when a lady on a commercial motorcycle fell off and a vehicle ran over her and unfortunately, she passed on.\n\n\u201cAs a result of this incident tension rose and hoodlums took over and like they do everywhere in the world, their target is economic assets and they burnt down a substantial part of the timber market and other markets around here and they burnt many vehicles.\n\n\u201cThere was no communal clash here and I appeal to all residents of Abuja to continue to live here as we have always lived in peace as the center of unity.\u201d\n\nThe Minister called on the community leaders to work at fishing out the bag eggs within their folds and help in bringing them to justice.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhat I told the community leaders is that they have to fish out the hoodlums and the bad eggs amongst them. This is because this time around, hoodlums carried arms and they shot innocent people. This is very sad and totally, unequivocally, unacceptable in Abuja.\u201d\n\nHe said a full scale investigation will be carried out by the security organisations with the full collaboration of the affected communities adding, \u201cI am appealing to other communities within the FCT that this is not a tribal or religious misunderstanding. All the leadership of the various stakeholders have lived here in peace for many, many years.\n\n\u201cIt is simply a matter of criminals and hoodlums taking the law into their hands and I implore every community in the FCT to ensure that community leaders identify miscreants, drug pushers, drug dens and drinking joints where crime and criminality takes place. The police and the military cannot be everywhere at the same time.\u201d\n\nReacting to a request by one of the market leaders that the police presence in the market be improved, the Minister pledged that the police post in the market will be upgraded and the FCT administration will provide the needed support while the police commissioner equally pledged more personnel.\n\nWhile commending the efforts of the security agencies and community leaders for their efforts in containing the violence, Malam Bello prayed for the repose of the souls of those who lost their lives and ordered the immediate closure of the timber market and adjoining markets.\n\nIn the same vein, Malam Bello also ordered the immediate ban on all trading activities along the road sides and directed that all transactions be carried out within the shops.\n\nThe Minister was accompanied on the visit by the Permanent Secretary, FCTA, Mr Olusade Adesola, the Chief of Staff, Malam Bashir Mai-Bornu, the Secretary, Area Council Services secretariat Alhaji Ibrahim Abubakar Dantsoho and other senior officials of the FCTA.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "title": "Border Demarcation, A Big Challenge In The Curbing Of Petrol Smuggling \u2013 Customs",
          "text": "\u2026stakeholders call for deployment of technology\n\nThe Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has identified inappropriate border demarcations and massive physical territory at Nigeria\u2019s borders with neighboring countries as major challenges in stemming the increasing rate of petrol smuggling.\n\nThe disclosure is coming on the heels of a recent investigation by The Cable, which exposed that petrol smuggling across Nigerian borders is booming and aided by a conspiracy between security agencies, cartels, and non-state actors.\n\nDeputy Comptroller of Customs, Timi Bomodi, who made known the challenges of Customs in tackling petrol smuggling in the border communities, said the service has been devising strategies to reduce smuggling along Nigeria\u2019sporous borders.\n\nHe disclosed that the customs service is applying the rules in ensuring that bad eggs within and outside the service are dealt with appropriately.\n\nBomodi\u2019s revelations came during an anti-corruption radio programme, PUBLIC CONSCIENCE, produced by the Progressive Impact Organization for Community Development, PRIMORG, Wednesday in Abuja.\n\nExplaining the difficulties with border demarcations, Bomodi had this to say: \u201dWe have families that are spread between both countries, and we have houses that are sitting in the middle of these borderlines, and you can\u2019t tell. The frontage of a house may be in Nigeria, and the back of the house is in Niger, so it is in Cameroon, so it is in Benin, and in these other places.\n\n\u201cCommunities are split between Nigeria\u2019s neighboring countries because their lives are always interfacing. It becomes difficult to manage since it is not a straightforward approach that any government can adopt, but it is important to note all these factors. Then you can appreciate the efforts of the Nigeria Customs Service is making to stem the incidence of smuggling petroleum products.\u201d\n\nBomodi, who doubles as the Public Relations Officer of Customs, also disclosed that the Service is confronted by a lack of adequate personnel to man the border territories while assuring their continued efforts to fight corruption within the service. He added that strategies and technology are already reducing petrol smuggling across Nigeria\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cIn the past three or four years, the service (NCS) has dismissed, demoted, and suspended a huge number of its complicit personnel in any smuggling.\n\n\u201cIt is not only border officers. We are talking about officers that work even in the ports or airports, there are sanctions, and the current Comptroller General is indeed very strict about this.\n\n\u201cNigeria Customs Service is gradually tilting towards minimizing physical contact in all its activities. We are deploying technology and moving into the era of e-Customs,\u201d Bomodi stated.\n\nReacting to the investigation, the Executive Director, Center for Transparency Advocacy, Faith Nwadishi, noted that impunity is the primary reason petrol smuggling is still thriving across Nigeria\u2019s borders. She backed the deployment of technology in customs operations at the border posts while urging citizens to demand accountability from public servants and always report corruption.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we keep giving estimates of local consumption of petrol that we have in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe solution is that Nigerians should wake up. We have to demand accountability because when we don\u2019t demand accountability, nobody gets it. It is not for the security agencies alone, or those in government or NASS,\u201d Nwadishi said.\n\nOn his part, the Executive Secretary, Anti-corruption Network, Hon. Ebenezar Oyetakin stated that different forms of corruption plague Nigeria and that the lack of will is a major reason smuggling could not be nipped in the bud.\n\nOyetakin suggested the establishment of petrol stations in neighboring countries to reduce smuggling drastically.\n\nHe backed the calls for technology to be deployed in Customs operations.\n\nEarlier on, an investigative journalist with TheCable, James Ojo, had disclosed that petrol smugglers at borders communities across the country are organized in connivance with security personnel.\n\nAccording to Ojo, smugglers pay an agreed amount to have a free passage with the petrol they bought from the Nigerian side.\n\nTo stem the tide of smuggling of petrol within Nigeria\u2019s borders, Ojo called for more robust border control and urged the Nigeria Customs to evaluate and monitor the activities of their personnel more.\n\n\u201cWe (NCS) have to carry out evaluations to ensure that the officials are doing what they are supposed to do. We need a strong border control system, and there should be a kind of monitoring or a kind of whistleblower policy to track the area or places involved in all these corrupt activities,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), 116.46 million liters of petrol valued at N18. 88bn was stolen in 2021. Consequently, the increased smuggling of petrol across Nigeria\u2019s borders has pressured the NNPC to meet the national daily demand, currently estimated at 72.72 million liters.\n\nPublic Conscience is a syndicated weekly anti-corruption radio program used by PRIMORG to draw government and citizens\u2019 attention to corruption and integrity issues in Nigeria.\n\nThe program has the support of the MacArthur Foundation.",

          "text": "By Eunice Orike\n\nAs part of economic diversification priority of the present administration, the Federal Government and Czech Republic has launched a Call for Public Proposals on Delta-2 Programme worth $16.2 million Co-funding Research and Development R&D,project.\n\nThe Delta-2 Programme is the cooperation model of the Technology Agency of Czech Republic TA CR, running for the period from 2020-2025, through which TA CR sponsors applied research and innovation of manufacturing companies and innovative institutions.\n\nNigeria had just become new beneficiary of the programme.\n\nIt could be recalled that Nigeria and Czech Republic signed a Memorandum of Understanding MoU, in 2014, in Prague by NASENI and TA CR on some critical areas of technology transfer and innovations which had resulted in the Co-Funding of Czech-Nigeria Bilateral R&D Project on Delta-2 Programme.\n\nSpeaking at the launching of the programme, the Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive of the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure NASENI, Engr. Prof. Mohammed Sani Haruna said the Call for Public Proposal for the Delta-2 programme is one of the projects to be implemented under the Agreement between the two countries.\n\nAccording to Haruna, the priority areas of the MoU which includes Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Research, agricultural and Food Technology, Mining Industrial Development among others were unable to take off earlier due to bureaucracy until the Presidential Implementation Committee PICTT, on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between Nigeria and Czech Republic, PICTT was inaugurated by President Muhammed Buhari in November 2020.\n\n\u201cThe PICTT would be sourcing technologies from the Czech Republic\u2019s manufacturing companies; tertiary; research; and development institutions. The sum of CZK 250 million (250 million Czech Koruna, approximately US$10.5 million) has been a allocated as research fund by the government of the Czech Republic, through the TA CR and will be supplemented by NASENI on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria to the sum of 2,000,000,000 or US5.7 million\u201d.\n\n\u201cTechnology acquisition and domestication through this collaboration will help in bridging technology gap between Nigeria and the advanced countries of the West and to facilitate Nigeria\u2019s transition to a manufacturing economy. Indeed, deployment of technology is crucial to mitigate our socio-economic and security challenges. The Delta-2 Programme is uniquely designed to catalyze technology transfer and mobilize positive interventions and investments among private sectors and relevant stakeholders in Nigeria and Czech Republic for technology advancement. The project seeks to mobilize investments to help developing countries like Nigeria meet their needs for environmentally sound technology\u201d, he explained.\n\nHowever, he noted that the output of the collaborative projects are expected to yield patents, pilot plants, development of proven technologies, industrial designs, prototypes, functional samples, software, certified methodologies processes and specialized maps, databases, commercialization among others.\n\nIn his welcome address, the Chairman Presidential Implementation Committee on Technology Transfer/Information Exchange between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Czech Republic, Dr. Muhammed Dahiru said the Launch of Call for Public Proposals which is simultaneously being hosted by the TA CR and at least eight other participating countries is the first part of the project procedure/schedule on TA CR Delta-2 programme for Bilateral cooperation in Applied Research and Technology Transfer for Agriculture, Mining and General Manufacturing.\n\n\u201cResearch and Development R&D, proposals are now invited from Nigeria academic community, research and development institutions, as well as private companies or entrepreneurs and independent researchers on the three priority areas of Agriculture and Food Technology; Mining and Industrial Development; and General Manufacturing for SMEs Development\u201d, he said.",

What does it cost Nigeria to be on the table?\n\n\u201cI will say four things, of which I was reminded this morning. One is knowledge. If Nigeria is not at the table, maybe the knowledge that we should have of ourselves, of our situation, of our continent, and indeed of the world is not that adequate, if that knowledge is adequate, we will do what is right, when it is right and how it is right.\n\n\u201cThe second is vision, what is the vision that we have? And if you have no vision, you may have eyes, but you are blind. And I believe that is part of our situation.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, Hayatudeen said that even as a military Head of State, former President Olusegun Obasanjo brought about many policy reforms that transformed the nation.\n\nHe said he was grateful to the former leader for playing host to him and his entourage.",

          "title": "Turkey\u2019s Erdogan Digs in Over NATO Expansion as Biden Hosts Finnish, Swedish Leaders",
          "text": "Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan dug in over his rejection of Sweden and Finland joining NATO, casting a shadow over a White House visit on Thursday by the leaders of the Nordic nations who applied this week to join the U.S.-led alliance.\n\nFinland and Sweden say they have been spurred into joining NATO by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, reversing generations of military non-alignment to bring about the biggest shakeup in European security for decades.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden hosted Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson and Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6, a chance for Washington to demonstrate that Russia\u2019s invasion has backfired, bringing about the very expansion of NATO that Moscow has said it was fighting to halt.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic event, a watershed moment in European security. Two nations with a long tradition of neutrality will be joining the world\u2019s most powerful defensive alliance,\u201d said White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan.\n\nBut Turkey has surprised its allies by objecting to the move, accusing the two Nordic states of harbouring Kurdish militants.\n\n\u201cWe will continue our policy in a determined way. We have told allies that we will say no to Finland and Sweden\u2019s NATO membership,\u201d Erdogan said in an interview with students late on Wednesday. \u201cNATO is a security alliance and we cannot accept terrorists to be in it.\u201d\n\nWashington has so far played down the Turkish objections, saying it expects the issues to be resolved.\n\nThe past week has seen Russia secure its biggest victory since the invasion began in February, with Kyiv announcing it had ordered its garrison in a steelworks in Mariupol to stand down, after a nearly three month siege of the city.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of the bloodiest battle in Europe for decades has remained publicly unresolved, with no confirmation of the fate of hundreds of Ukrainian defenders. Moscow said on Thursday that 1,730 Ukrainian fighters had surrendered so far, including 771 in the past 24 hours.\n\nUkraine, which says it aims to secure a prisoner swap, has declined to say how many were inside the plant or comment on the fate of the rest since confirming that just over 250 had surrendered in the initial hours after it ordered them to yield.\n\nThe Switzerland-based International Committee of the Red Cross said it has registered hundreds of prisoners from the plant now held by Russia, but it has not given a precise number.\n\nThe leader of Russian-backed separatists in control of the area said nearly half of the fighters remained inside the steelworks, where underground bunkers and tunnels had protected them from weeks of Russian bombardment.\n\n\u201cMore than half have already left \u2013 more than half have laid down their arms,\u201d Denis Pushilin told the Solovyov Live internet television channel. \u201cLet them surrender, let them live, let them honestly face the charges for all their crimes.\u201d\n\nThe wounded had been given medical treatment while those who were fit had been taken to a penal colony and were being treated well, he said. Ukrainian officials say they cannot comment publicly on the fate of the fighters while negotiations are under way to rescue them.\n\nRussia denies that it agreed to a prisoner swap. Many of the Azovstal defenders belong to a Ukrainian unit with far-right origins, the Azov Regiment, which Moscow calls Nazis and says must be prosecuted for crimes.\n\nUKRAINE ADVANCES\n\nThe success in Mariupol comes as Russian forces have been losing ground elsewhere: driven from northern Ukraine and the area around the capital at the end of March, and pushed this month from the outskirts of the second-largest city Kharkiv.\n\nOleksiy Gromov, Deputy Chief of the Main Operational Department of the General Staff of Ukraine\u2019s Armed Forces, told an online briefing that Ukraine had recaptured 23 settlements near Kharkiv in the last two weeks.\n\nOn Thursday, the crash of artillery duels resounded across sun-lit fields and woodlands north of Kharkiv near the village Slatyne.\n\nUkrainian troops pressing on with their advance said fighting was under way around the nearby village of Demetiivka, which the Ukrainian military said was recaptured the previous day, only about 8 km from the Russian border.\n\nVitalyi, a military ambulance driver, had parked his vehicle, which he had christened \u201cAngel\u201d, under cover to avoid being spotted.\n\n\u201cDrones are always a big problem, during the day as well as at night,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause after the drones come the shells.\u201d\n\nIn a sign of the return of normal life in the capital, the United States reopened its embassy on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe Ukrainian people\u2026 have defended their homeland in the face of Russia\u2019s unconscionable invasion, and, as a result, the Stars and Stripes are flying over the Embassy once again,\u201d said Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\nBut Russia is still pressing its main offensive using massed artillery and armour, trying to capture more territory in the eastern Donbas, comprised of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which Moscow claims on behalf of separatists.\n\nUkraine\u2019s general staff said Russia\u2019s attacks were focused on Donetsk. Russian forces \u201csuffered significant losses\u201d around Slovyansk to the north of Donetsk.\n\nPolice said on Thursday that two children had been killed in the Donetsk city of Lyman. Serhiy Gaidai, governor of neighbouring Luhansk region, said four people had been killed and three wounded in shelling of the frontline city of Sievierodonetsk.\n\nIn Russia, the regional governor of the Kursk border region accused Ukrainian forces of shelling a border village, killing at least one civilian. Both sides have accused each other of cross border shelling for weeks. Reuters was unable to verify the reports.",

          "text": "The Taliban have ordered female Afghan TV presenters and other women on screen to cover their faces while on air.\n\nMedia outlets were told of the decree on Wednesday, a religious police spokesman told BBC Pashto.\n\nThe ruling comes two weeks after all women were ordered to wear a face veil in public, or risk punishment.\n\nRestrictions are being tightened on women \u2013 they are banned from travelling without a male guardian and secondary schools are shut for girls.\n\nOne female Afghan journalist working for a local TV station in Kabul, who did not want to be named, said she\u2019d been shocked to hear the latest news.\n\n\u201cThey are putting indirect pressure on us to stop us presenting on TV,\u201d she told the BBC.\n\n\u201cHow can I read the news with my mouth covered? I don\u2019t know what to do now \u2013 I must work, I am the breadwinner of my family.\u201dThe new decree will take effect from 21 May, Reuters news agency reported, quoting a spokesman for the Taliban\u2019s Ministry for the Prevention of Vice and Promotion of Virtue.\n\nThe spokesman referred to the ruling as \u201cadvice\u201d \u2013 it is not clear what will happen to anyone who fails to comply.\n\n\u201cBased on information received by Tolo news, the order has been issued to all media outlets in Afghanistan,\u201d the news channel reported.\n\nThe decision is being widely criticised on Twitter, with many calling it another step by the Taliban to promote extremism.\n\n\u201cThe world deploys masks to protect people from Covid. The Taliban deploys masks to protect people from seeing the faces of women journalists. For the Taliban, women are a disease,\u201d one activist tweeted.\n\nThe private Shamshad news channel posted a photo of its news presenter wearing a mask, and other similar images are being shared on social media.\n\nDuring their first stint in power in the 1990s the Taliban forced women to wear the all-encompassing burka in public.\n\nThe hardline Islamist movement was driven from power by US-led troops in 2001, after which many restrictions eased. Women appearing on television showing their faces became a common sight.\n\nAfter retaking power last August, following the withdrawal of foreign forces, the Taliban had held off issuing new laws on what women should wear.\n\nThis raised hopes they would govern Afghanistan, a deeply conservative and patriarchal country, more flexibly this time.\n\nMany women still wore the burka, but in bigger cities it was also common to see women continuing to wear headscarves.\n\nHowever in early May the Ministry for the Prevention of Vice and Promotion of Virtue announced that all women would have to cover their face in public, and indicated that a burka would be the ideal garment to achieve this.\n\nAnyone refusing to comply with the ruling risks an escalating series of punishments.\n\nMost Muslims around the world do not consider women covering their face mandatory, or oppose them working.\n\nWomen are still employed in some jobs in Afghanistan, such as healthcare and education, but many others have been told not to return to work now the Taliban are back in power.\n\nThe country has been plunged into economic crisis and famine under Taliban rule.\n\nWestern diplomats have indicated that resuming development funding and unlocking frozen cash depends on better treatment of women.\n\nBut early hopes the Taliban might relax their approach have been eroded amid signs influential hardliners in the group have the upper hand.\n\nThe journalist in Kabul who spoke to the BBC wanted the international community to put pressure on the Taliban.\n\n\u201cThey should tell them you have 10 days to change otherwise we are going to cut off relations and aid.\u201d\n\nShe said she believed the Taliban planned to stop women doing all kinds of work outside their homes. \u201cThey want women to live like prisoners at home. Every day they issued decrees against us \u2013 I don\u2019t think we can survive.\u201d\n\nBBC",
