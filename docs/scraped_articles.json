          "text": ".Renews call for release of Nnamdi Kanu\n\n. Says IPOB, product of injustice\n\n. Fulanisation agenda, very real \u2013 Uwakwe\n\nBy Steve Oko\n\nThe apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has called for immediate arrest and prosecution of the Emir of Sabon Birnin Yandoto, Tsafe Local Government Area of Zamfara State, Aliyu Garba Marafa, who conferred a chieftancy title to a notorious \u2018repentant\u2019 bandits\u2019 leader, Adamu Aliero, crowning him Sarkin Fulani (leader of Fulani).\n\nOhanaeze argued that it was not enough to just suspend him and let him off the hook, saying that his action amounted to open endorsement of banditry.\n\nZamfara State Government, had Sunday, announced the suspension of the Marafa for \u2018turbaning\u2019 the bandit leader.\n\nThis is as a former General Manager of Abia Network Transport Company, Hon. Ugochukwu Uwakwe, has said that the action of the Emir was a confirmation that the much-talked about Fulanisation agenda is real and fast approaching.\n\nThe Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Alex Chiedozie who spoke exclusively with Vanguard in Umuahia, expressed furry over the action of the Emir which he described as an international embarrassment to Nigeria.\n\nHe argued that the action of the Emir was a clear indication that \u201che is an accomplice\u201d.\n\nHis words:\u201dThat Emir has shown by his action that he is an accomplice. He is one of them. He should be arrested. He should be arrested without delay and treated as a bandit.\n\n\u201d Government should use him to locate other bandits wherever they are. \u201c\n\nThe Ohanaeze chieftain described the development as very sad and annoying.\n\n\u201d What is happening in Nigeria is annoying; it\u2019s a huge embarrassment and a puzzle to the international community.\n\n\u201d To turban a bandit is a grievous offense. And you have about 100 other bandits that accompanied him to the ceremony jubilating and later went scot free. Who is fooling who?\n\n\u201d Where are those other bandits now? Why is it that non of them has been arrested? Where are the security agencies? All the money being spent on security, how is it used?\u201d\n\nThe Ohanaeze Spokesman restated call for the release of the detained Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, arguing that his continued detention will not bring any solution.\n\nHe urged the Federal Government to consider political solution to the matter concerning Kanu, and IPOB, arguing that IPOB is a product of marginalisation and injustice.\n\n\u201d Mazi Nnamdi Kanu should be released. What we require in his matter is political solution. Detaining him will not solve anything.\n\n\u201d Nnamdi Kanu/ IPOB phenomenon is a product of injustice, a reaction to marginalisation and alienation.\u201d\n\nHe observed that the careful exclusion of Ndigbo by the two major political parties in the country in their presidential tickets was part of the injustice that the IPOB is complaining against.\n\n\u201d Look at the trend of the 2023 election when everybody knew that it was the turn of Ndigbo/ South East to produce the next President, how the two major political parties started playing around it until they tactfully schemed South East out of it and gave their presidential tickets away from Igbo land.\n\n\u201d And when Nnamdi Kanu talks, somebody will say that Kanu is agitating! What do you want Nnamdi Kanu and IPOB to do?\n\nUwaeke told our Correspondent that Nigerians should be circumspect over the Fulanisation agenda, arguing that if an Emir can openly confer a Chieftaincy title to a self-acclaimed repentant mass murderer, one therefore can only imagine what goes on behind the scene.\n\nHe said that the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, who is a Fulani should not be allowed to succeed the incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari, also a Fulani, saying it could spell doom for the country.\n\nAccording to him, another Fulani succeeding Buhari will embolden Fulani bandits to take their atrocities to higher dimension.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the reasons Atiku should not be allowed to succeed Buhari. Fulanization is real. It\u2019s gaining grounds. Allowing another Fulani Muslim will sound a death knell to Nigeria.\u201d",

          "text": "The professionals under the platform of Coalition of Nigeria Professionals for Good Governance (CNPGG), have called out the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, over a statement credited to him to the effect that the October, 2020 EndSARS protest, was allegedly sponsored by the Presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Mr. Peter Obi.\n\nAccording to some online reports, Mohammed was said to have claimed that most of the young men and women that were at the forefront of the EndSARS Movement, are currently campaigning for the LP flag-bearer on Twitter, and other influential social media platforms.\n\nBut CNPGG insisted that the EndSARS protest was a consequence of bad governance, occasioned by insecurity, youth unemployment, poverty and police brutality.\n\nAccording to them, the fact that the Minister had yet to deny the vexatious report credited to him more than twenty-four hours after, suggests that he, indeed, authored it.\n\nIn the said report, Mohammed was quoted to have said: \u201cRecent development has now unveiled the brain behind ENDSARS Protest in Nigeria which led to the destruction of Government properties and security agencies losing their lives.\n\n\u201cOver the years, investigation has been going on in order to unveil those behind this wicked act just to tarnish the good image of President Muhammadu Buhari and his good works.\n\n\u201cMostly all the people and the misguided youths who championed the ENDSARS Protest are all campaigning for Peter Obi for President. All of them, no exception. That will go a long way in telling you that Peter Obi knows much about the ENDSARS Protest and those behind that ugly act must be brought to book to face disciplinary actions.\n\nReacting, in a statement jointly signed Dr Ado Manir (National President), and Dr Mrs Modupe Olalekan Mohammed (National Secretary), the Coalition said the unusual campaign was a spontaneous expression of frustration, disillusionment, and anger by concerned youths, who feared that the ship of state was navigating dangerously towards a precipice.\n\nAccording to the coalition, the youths, in their wisdom, initiated the movement, which was anchored on the urgent need to disband the then dreaded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), an elite unit of the Nigeria Police, which carried out serial abuses.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cOur attention has been drawn to a press statement credited to the Minister of Information and Culture, Mr. Lai Mohammed, which is currently trending on some social and traditional media platforms, alleging that the presidential candidate of Labour Party, Mr. Peter Obi, was the brain behind the EndSARS campaign that rocked the nation in October, 2020.\n\n\u201cWe are surprised that the minister has not denied the report that is vexatious in nature, and patently false in content, several days after.\n\n\u201cThis development is suggestive of the fact that he may have actually authored the unpatriotic and irresponsible statement, which flies in the face of reason and valued judgement.\n\n\u201cNigerians know that the LP presidential candidate, is a fine gentleman, whose uncommon patriotism is exemplified in his commitment to the Nigerian Project; a characteristic that is unparalleled.\n\n\u201cWhile we are not holding brief for Peter Obi and his campaign organisation, as concerned Nigerians with vested interest in the Nigerian project, we will not be silent in the face of deliberate attempt at blackmailing a quintessential politician that the LP standard-bearer is\u201d.\n\nIt continued: \u201cThe EndSARS campaign was a carefully-planned and executed protest by frustrated and disillusioned Nigerians, who were, and have continued to be angry with the bad governance of the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led government, which Lai Mohammed, incidentally, typifies.\n\n\u201cThe APC project is one that is characterised by failed promises and arrogance of power, which Lai Mohammed embodies.\n\n\u201cIt is curious that a man, who apologised personally and on behalf of the Nigerian Government for their failure, would now have the audacity to blame Peter Obi for instigating the famous EndSARS protest.\n\n\u201cNigerians are tired of insecurity and bad governance hence they have moved to take back their country from the likes of Lai Mohammed and his collaborators, and no amount of blackmail can stop the movement of a new and progressive Nigeria with Peter Obi as the captain.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, call on Nigerians to remain steadfast and focused, as more campaigns of calumny against the captain of the \u201cforward Nigeria Project\u201d, are expected in the coming weeks,and months leading to the February, 2023 presidential election\u201d.",

The lady accepted responsibility and stated that she brought the luggage for the two passengers to give to her husband in Oman.\n\n\u201cMujidat, who hails from Oyo East LGA in Oyo State, confessed during preliminary interview that the bag containing the food items were packed by her with different items, including the black soap used to conceal the illicit substance,\u201d he said.\n\nBabafemi also said that in Nasarawa State, NDLEA operatives intercepted over 91 jumbo bags of cannabis, weighing 1,029.5kg concealed in a truck mounted on a gas tank by Doma Road, around 500 Housing Estate, Lafia.\n\nHe said a 52-year-old suspect, Ernest Ojieh, was arrested in connection with the seizure on Saturday.\n\n\u201cThis was barely four days after operatives at Agwan Doka, Lafia, seized 38 big bags of the same substance with a total weight of 367kg. Two suspects: Abdullahi Iliyasu, 30, and Bashir Mohammed, 29, were arrested over the seizure,\u201d he said.\n\nThe spokesman also said that in Kaduna and Adamawa, over half a million pills of pharmaceutical opioids were seized and suspects arrested in raid operations across the two states.\n\n\u201cIn Kaduna alone, 294,400 pills of Tramadol and Diazepam were seized from: Shaban Nasir, Aminu Usman and Shamsudeen Hussaini, along Abuja-Kaduna express road as well as Sa\u2019idu Yahaya and Umar Abubakar, during a follow up operation in Kano, all on Friday 15th July.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, over 227,000 different grades of Tramadol tablets were seized during the raid of a patent medicine store at Sabon Layi, close to Mubi main market, Mubi North LGA, Adamawa State on Sunday 3rd July. Recovered from the store where a suspect, Nasiru Abubakar, 27, was arrested include Tramadol 250mg (aka Boko Haram); Royal Tramadol 225mg (aka Vectra); Tramaking Tramadol 225mg (aka Jan Dara); Tramadol 200mg (aka Dogari); and Tramadol 100mg(aka Green), among others.\n\n\u201cAnother suspect, Idris Adamu, 25, was also arrested in a shoe shop in the same Sabon Layi where over 5,000 tablets of Tramadol 225mg were recovered from him.While commending the officers and men of the MMIA, Nasarawa, Kaduna and Adamawa Commands for the arrests, seizures and their dexterity, Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd) warned the drug cartels that no matter the ingenuity of their modes of concealment, the dedicated workforce of the Agency will always expose them and their tricks.\u201d",

          "title": "2023: Reject candidates with links to Boko Haram, drugs, corruption, CAN directs Christians",
          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nChristian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has directed all churches in Nigeria to advise their members not to vote any presidential candidates with links to hard drugs, Boko Haram or any violent religious groups.\n\nIn a video clip seen by Daily Sun, senior pastor of Family Worship Center, Abuja, Pastor Sarah Omakwu, read out a circular which emanated from the Political and Strategy Committee of CAN and sent to all churches in Nigeria.\n\nIn the circular titled: \u201c2023 General Elections; Whom To Vote For,\u201d CAN enumerated qualities that the presidential candidate must possess and the policies that should either be implemented or rejected.\n\nAmong the qualities CAN said Christians should look out for in a candidate are honesty, truthfulness, respect for the rule of law, respect for religious and ethnic diversity, compassionate, disciplined and credible.\n\nThe body said the candidate must not be a member of any cult, must not have any involvement with drugs, witchcraft, Boko Haram or any violent religious group. The candidate is required to have performed excellently in previous positions, must have good education sufficient to manage a complex society, effective management skills of human and natural resources.\n\nOn policies, CAN said the issue of state police was critical and there must be religious neutrality of the country, enforcement of fundamental rights of all Nigerians, restructuring to decentralise governance and equitable sharing of executive offices.\n\n\u201cOffices must be shared fairly to every section of Nigeria. There must be equal ethnic and religious representation in military and security agencies. We say no to the RUGA settlement policy and yes to ranching. There should be education and free healthcare to all Nigerians including almajiris. We reject open grazing, rather, there should be modernisation of animal husbandry, local control of economy including waters, rivers and forests. Everyone should control what we have.\n\n\u201cThe candidate must not be a member of any cult, must have no involvement in drugs and witchcraft, no fanaticism, no relationship to Boko Haram or other violent religious groups. The person must have quality performance in previous positions, good education sufficient to manage a complex society, effective management of human and natural resources. The person must have the ability to envision transformation, ability to communicate the vision to diverse peoples, ability to effectively effect the vision of transformation, must be in good health, sound mind and physical fitness for the job,\u201d CAN said.\n\nCommenting on CAN\u2019s directive, Pastor Omakwu said: \u201cBy the grace of God, He will give us this kind of leader we want. I will add my own advice and say that we should do what Bishop Abioye said this time, we should fight to defend our faith. Power is first about spiritual control before the physical. These people don\u2019t care about governance. This time around, anyone that has the inclination to continue what we have been going through, we would say no that person. Anyone that has the inclination to side one religion above the other, we would fight that person.\n\n\u201cEvery Nigerian has the right to worship. If they want to worship a stone, the constitution allows everyone that freedom. This year by the grace of God, we would select a good person. God forbid that a Christian would take their thumb and vote for someone that would restrict our religious freedom. May that person not be named. We would vote and defend our faith. Every Christian has a right to be a Christian and every Muslim has the right to be a Muslim, so also does every traditional worshiper has a right to worship. Even if you don\u2019t want to believe in God, He gives you the freedom not to believe in Him and no one must contain those liberties,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nThe suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Abba Kyari, has filed a fresh bail application, pending his trial, in the wake of the terrorist attack on the Kuje Correctional Centre.\n\nKyari, who is facing drug trafficking charges, predicated his application on safety grounds.\n\nAlready, Justice Emeka Nwite has fixed tomorrow to hear the bail application.\n\nIn like manner, three other police officers who are equally on trial over the alleged offence- ACP Sunday J. Ubia, Insp. Simon Agirigba and Insp. John Nuhu- also prayed the court to okay their release on bail on similar grounds. However, the third defendant, Bawa James, an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), did not join them in the application.\n\nKyari\u2019s counsel, Ikpeazu, said his client\u2019s fresh application became necessary, considering the nature of assignments he undertook while performing his duties as a police officer. Ikpeazu submitted that some of the inmates on remand at the Kuje Correctional Centre were people who Kyari\u2019s team at the Police IRT made their arrest possible.\n\nThis came as the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), through its Director, Legal Services, Mr. Sunday Joseph, opened its case against Kyari and his co-defendants after urging the court to refuse their fresh request for bail.\n\nMeanwhile, the NDLEA, yesterday, opened its case against the defendants by presenting its first witness before the court. The first prosecution witness, Mrs Patricia Afolabi, a Commander of Narcotics, attached to the forensic unit of the agency, told the court that part of her job specification involves receiving and conducting forensic analysis on drug exhibits.\n\nShe told the court that she had, on February 7, received from the forensic liaison officer of the agency, Abubakar Aliyu, one sealed transparent evidence pack that contained 24 dispensing packs each. The PW1 said each of the parks contained white substance measured at 0.5grams. She said the package also contained a request form for analysis.\n\nTrial Justice Emeka Nwite admitted all the exhibits without objection from the defendants. Under cross examination by counsel to Kyari, the witness said it was not true that every suspect in a drug deal must be present before such analysis could be conducted. Afolabi said it was not customary that all suspects would be present when substances are also handed over for analysis.\n\nThe witness confirmed that NDLEA operatives are stationed in all entry points in Nigeria, including at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu. Asked if she knew if it was NDLEA that recovered the cocaine at the Airport in Enugu, the witness said she was not aware.\n\nMeanwhile, the court has adjourned further cross- examination of the witness to today.",

          "text": "From Desmond Mgboh, Kano, Aidoghie Paulinus, Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja, Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa, George Onyejiuwa, Owerri, Lateef Dada, Osogboand Noah Ebije, Kaduna\n\nCongratulatory messages have continued to pour in for Senate Ademola Adeleke, Governor-elect of Osun State and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nThe candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had defeated the incumbent and candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Gboyega Oyetola and 13 others in the poll on Saturday.\n\nYesterday, the United Kingdom and the United States governments applauded the people of the state for their active, peaceful and democratic participation in the poll.\n\nThe British High Commission, Abuja, in a statement on its social media platforms said the results released by INEC were consistent with results obtained through civil society-led Parallel Vote Tabulation process.\n\nIt commended INEC, security agencies, civil society partners and all stakeholders for their contribution to the success of the election.\n\n\u201cOur mission which observed the election on Saturday was encouraged by the continuing improvements in the electoral process, following the governorship election in Ekiti State last month. The timely opening of polls, functionality of the BVAS devices for accreditation of voters and electronic transmission of results, accessibility provisions for people with disabilities and vulnerable voters and increased turnout of voters were all factors worth commending about the process.\u201d\n\nThe UK, however, expressed concerns over reports from some locations of apparent vote buying, even as it hoped that those involved would be held to account by the relevant authorities.\n\nIn the same vein, the U.S. Mission to NIgeria lauded Osun State citizens on the peaceful gubernatorial poll.\n\n\u201cWe commend the concerted efforts of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) staff and security personnel who helped facilitate a secure process that reflected the will of the people. We encourage all Nigerian citizens to register to vote now so that your voice can be heard in the national and state elections in 2023,\u201d it said.\n\n\u2026PDP\u2019s victory test case for 2023 poll \u2013 Diri\n\nBayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, declared that the victory is a test case for the 2023 election which he predicted the opposition party candidate, Atiku Abubakar would win.\n\nDiri who was chairman of the National Campaign Council for the Osun governorship Election said Senator Adeleke\u2019s victory was a statement of intentions by the PDP to reclaim the presidency.\n\nThe North West Zonal Vice Chairman of the PDP, Bello Hayatu Gwarzo, described Adeleke as dogged fighter who fought hard for the stolen mandate of the PDP in the last governorship election in the state.\n\n\u201cHis victory is a light for our party and an indicator that PDP will emerge victorious in the 2023 poll,\u201d he said.\n\nNnamani, Ihedioha hail gov-elect\n\nFormer governors of Enugu and Imo states, Chimaroke Nnamani and Emeka Ihedioha also hailed the victory.\n\nNnamani, in a statement, yesterday, praised the presidential candidate of PDP, Atiku Abubakar, his running mate, Ifeanyi Okowa, and the party\u2019s national chairman, Prof. Iyorchia Ayu, for their support.\n\n\u201cIt is not in doubt that the victory of Adeleke was largely influenced by the team work of the chieftains who provided leadership.\u201d\n\nNnamani reminded Adeleke that his victory is a call to higher duty, service to God and humanity.\n\nHe commended the people of Osun for the overwhelming support given to the PDP at the polls.\n\nIhedioha, in his message, said the victory was well deserved. He also congratulated the PDP and the people of Osun State for their steadfastness, courage and vigilance during the election .\n\n\u201cYour emergence as governor-elect is, no doubt, a confirmation of the people\u2019s confidence in your leadership capabilities and a proof of the unbreakable bond of friendship and solidarity between you and them. That is the hallmark of leadership,\u201d he said\n\nI was so sure PDP\u2019ll win -Jibrin, BoT Chair\n\nThe Board of Trustees Chairman, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Walid Jibrin, has said Senator Adeleke\u2019s victory did not come to him as a surprise.\n\nThe second republic senator, in a statement, said he had before the election assured the governor-elect of victory.\n\n\u201cI was there at Osun during the last campaign and the number of people that turned out for the rally was unbelievable and I was so sure that the PDP will win Osun state.\n\n\u201cAnd this is just the beginning of victory. What has happened in Osun State is an indication of PDP\u2019s stand in the whole country. We, as a party, have learned our lessons and the Yoruba are beginning to learn their lessons too, by coming out to elect Chief Adeleke. We are rest assured that other states in western Nigeria will be won by the PDP come 2023.\n\n\u201cBy the grace of God, all other states in the country will vote for us. So, the issue of the APC campaign for a Muslim-Muslim presidency will not work. You can bear me witness that it didn\u2019t work in Osun state, so we should not support this kind of politics.\n\n\u201cOur concern should be based on who is the best candidate for us that can be in charge of the country.\u201d\n\nThe PDP BoT Chairman decried politics of religion, describing it as the highest level of division among citizens, adding that it is capable of breeding confusion and war on a people that have been existing peacefully.\n\nTMG salutes INEC, residents\n\nTransition Monitoring Group (TMG), has lauded Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), efforts at the just concluded Osun governorship election held over the weekend.\n\nIn a statement entitled: \u201cPost Election Statement on the Gubernatorial Election in Osun State, July 2022\u201d signed by its Chairman, Auwal Ibrahim Musa Rafsanjani, the body praised the electoral body for complying with the provisions of the Electoral Act, especially with regards to improving inclusivity by providing assistance technology for persons with disabilities, and for efficient election logistics arrangement which saw early deployment of officials and materials to the polling units across the state of Osun.\n\nIt also praised the media other stakeholders for their efforts in ensuring peaceful and non-violent elections and the people of the state for an inclusive and participatory election in the state.\n\nRegarding vote buying, TMG insisted that voters must avoid selling their future and good governance because vote buying does not provide good governance, transparency, or accountability.\n\nObservers laud INEC, police for peaceful conduct\n\nElection monitoring groups, Pan African Women Projects (PAWP) and Intercontinental Leadership Initiative (ILI), commended INEC and policemen for their roles in ensuring that Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Osun State was peaceful.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Osogbo, yesterday, Dr. Eno Udensi, said reports gathered from 125 short-term and eight long-term observers deployed showed that the election was peaceful and transparent.\n\nShe said despite the credibility of the election, \u201cOsun elections experienced vote buying at some polling units, especially in the testing ground where we observed voters voting and crossing over to the other side of the road to collect money dramatically.\n\n\u201cThe vote buying in Osun was not as unhealthy as that of Ekiti where many persons were trading at the polling units environment.\u201d\n\nHe said results from 50 field observers deployed for the election showed that BVAS worked perfectly, security conducted itself and the electorate participated fully in the election.\n\nAlso, Transition Monitoring Group (TMG) lauded INEC\u2019s efforts at the Osun election.\n\nIn a statement titled \u201cPost Election Statement on the Gubernatorial Election in Osun State, July 2022\u201d signed by its Chairman, Auwal Ibrahim Musa Rafsanjani, the body praised the electoral body for complying to the provisions of the Electoral Act, especially with regards to improving inclusivity by providing assistance technology for persons with disabilities, and for efficient election logistics arrangement which saw early deployment of officials and materials to the polling units across the state of Osun.\n\nThe group also praised the media other stakeholders for their efforts in ensuring peaceful and non-violent elections and the people of the state for an inclusive and participatory election in the state.\n\nTMG, which monitored the electioneering process, expressed satisfaction with the high level of voter mobilisation activities carried out by the media and civil society organisations.\n\nAdeleke cautions supporters ageist attacking opponents\n\nMeanwhile, the Governor-elect, has cautioned his supporters against attacking members of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nSome youths celebrating the victory had gone around destroying posters and billboards of Governor Oyetola and also attacked the residence of Commissioner For Lands, Physical Planning and Urban Development, Nathaniel Agunbiade.\n\nIt was gathered that some aides to the commissioner were injured while vehicles and other properties were vandalised.\n\nIn a statement by his spokesperson, Mallam Olawale Rasheed, Adeleke condemned the reported violence of youths celebrating his victory, dissociating himself and his political party from such negative activities.\n\n\u201cThis is unacceptable conduct and those involved in such behaviour are warned to stop forthwith,\u201d he said while commiserating with victims.",

          "title": "Religiosity Versus Spirituality \u2013 THISDAYLIVE",
          "text": "THE ALTERNATIVE\n\nBy Reno Omokri\n\nTry this physical experiment. Plant two seeds. Water one daily, then pray on it. Pray on the other one daily, but don\u2019t water it. Then see which one grows.\n\nThe result will teach you a spiritual principle established in Genesis 8:22-\u201cAs long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will never cease.\u201d\n\nIf you want your life to grow, stop relying on prayer alone. Plant a seed of effort. Then pray. God always ensures that effort, plus prayer equals success.\n\nThe reason I just asked you to try this exercise is because Nigeria has become an increasingly religious society, yet, we are a very carnal nation. We hardly have any spirituality.\n\nIf you go through the statistics of paternity fraud, gay and straight pornography, online fraud, and money rituals, you will find us at or near the top. Yet, at every other corner in Nigeria, there is a church or mosque. Nigeria is a very religious nation that is also uber-carnal.\n\nIn fact, the only times many Nigerians ever fast, is when they want God to deal with their enemies. Not only will they fast, they will meditate and sow seeds. They plot. And pray in tongues over their plots. But our people, with exceptions, tend to be unwilling to apply the same effort for God to help them deal with their poverty.\n\nRecently, an African-American preacher named Creflo Dollar, admitted that he had been in error over his teachings on the issue of tithing. He not only made the admission, he also asked those who had bought his tapes and books on the subject to bin them.\n\nThis comes two years after the famous televangelist, Benny Hinn, made a similar public admission. In his case, he lamented that he had spent his career largely teaching the wicked prosperity Gospel.\n\nIn both instances, the Nigerian evangelical and Pentecostal churches hit back with such vicious ferocity. As I observed their ferocity, I wondered where it was during the Deborah Samuel affair.\n\nI have literally gone round the world on my own dime (if anyone has given me a penny, speak now or forever remain silent) pleading for world leaders to help me put pressure on the Buhari government to secure the release of Leah Sharibu, the Christian girl abducted by Boko Haram from Government Girls\u2019 Science and Technical College, Dapchi, on February 19, 2018.\n\nHow many of these men of God who were vituperating when Creflo Dollar threatened their bread and butter have spoken up for Leah Sharibu?\n\nYet, Christ said:\n\n\u201cWhen did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?\u2019 \u201cThe King will reply, \u2018Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.\u2019-Matthew 25-39-40.\n\nAnd then we wonder why Nigeria is the world headquarters for extreme poverty. Can Scripture lie?\n\nWhat does Scripture say in Proverbs 14:34?\n\n\u201cRighteousness exalts a nation, But sin is a reproach to any people.\u201d\n\nJapan is 1% Christian. But the Japanese are some of the most righteous people on Earth. They are notoriously honest and hard-working.\n\nPrince, the late singer, once talked about how he performed a concert at a 30,000-seat stadium in Japan, and being the eccentric that he was, he insisted that a tambourine be placed on each seat, so the crowd could play along with his song, Tambourine. After the concert, not one tambourine was missing.\n\nI do not know of even one Christian nation, with perhaps the exception of Ethiopia, where this can be possible.\n\nCan you forget your phone and return back to get it in many of today\u2019s mega churches? Their mega is maga!\n\nThe Japanese reflect righteousness, not religion. And that is why God has exalted them.\n\nScripture says: \u201cfor when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do the things in the law, these, although not having the law, are a law to themselves. \u201dRomans 2:14.\n\nChristianity that has both morality and prosperity is the ultimate. However, a Christianity that has morality, even if it lacks prosperity, is preferable to a Christianity that has prosperity, and lacks morality.\n\nWe cannot keep gaining the world and losing our souls. But, whether you pursue morality, or prosperity, do not forget eternity!\n\nRecently, I had to counsel a Christian who claimed he was being haunted by his village people. I asked him why he felt so. He responded that a bird usually comes every night and makes weird noises on the roof of his house.\n\nHe has been binding and praying.\n\nBut all over Nigeria, forested areas are being deforested at a ferocious rate and state governments are doing nothing about it. Where do we think birds live? Largely in forests.\n\nAnd when we destroy their habitats, where do we expect them to live?\n\nWhen I explained this to him, his response was \u2018but why must it make weird noises?\u2019\n\nThe truth is that the noise from a human will be weird to a bird and the noise from a bird will be weird to humans.\n\nMany Nigerians do not even read Scripture. There is nothing in Scripture about witches or demons turning into birds. Belief in such comes from pre-Christian African and European superstition.\n\nYou go to the average Nigerian church, and you will find that members have read all the books written by their founding pastors, yet, have not read Scripture from beginning to end. So, when the pastor goes off script from Scripture, they all follow along unquestioningly, because he (or she), has become their standard, rather than Scripture!\n\nYet, Acts 17:11 says:\n\n\u201cNow the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.\u201d\n\nThe greatest idolatry in Nigeria does not happen in a fetish shrine. It happens in Nigerian Pentecostal and Evangelical churches where people worship men of God, instead of God. We no longer call on the God of Scripture. We instead call on the God of the pastor so and so!\n\nAm I lying?\n\nSome persons may respond and say but Elisha called on the God of Elijah. Yes. That happened once. But have you considered that Elisha called a bear to kill youths who mocked him (2 Kings 2:23-25)? Would that be okay by you today? Elisha, unlike you and I, did not have DIRECT ACCESS to God because the Messiah had not come-John 16:23.\n\nThe enemy does not care how you commit your idolatry, as long as you commit it.\n\nThis does not mean that we should do away with the Old Testament. Far from it.\n\nThe Old Testament should not be scrapped. Rather, it should be adapted to the New Testament. When they clash, the teachings of Christ ALWAYS prevail.\n\nJust imagine a High Court and a Supreme Court. In the RARE event that they clash, the ruling of the Supreme Court will prevail. Not because the High Court is or was wrong. But rather because the knowledge available to the Supreme Court is more than that available to the lower court. We see this in Isaiah 28:10.\n\nScripture makes a very big distinction between religiosity and spirituality. 1 Corinthians 2:14 says:\n\n\u201cBut the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.\u201d\n\nWithout going into too many details (because I do not want to offend members of certain denominations), a lot of doctrines that many \u2018Christians\u2019 believe today are not even of Scriptural origin. And when they were first introduced, people who refused to believe them were killed in the most horrible manner.\n\nIt was not faith that made the remaining people believe them. It was fear. The fear of being killed. What mainstream Christendom (different from Christianity) did to propagate these beliefs (which are really of pagan origin) is worse than any Jihad ever carried out in the Islamic world. Please research this.\n\nForget about Reno Omokri. Forget about your church denomination. And get Scripture in the original language and read it yourself. Let me shock you. The King James Version was not even translated from the original Scriptures. It was largely translated from the Latin Vulgate, and other TRANSLATIONS. Mind you, Latin was not used in any of the original Scriptures.\n\nThat is just like making a photocopy from different photocopies, instead of the original. The challenge with Christians is that we are largely not ready to put in the effort to study Scripture in the original languages.\n\nI was moved to study Scripture in the original language after seeing a girl (not a woman, a girl!) recite several surahs of the Quran in Arabic, from memory, in Sokoto in 1994.\n\nAnd from that time till today, my spirituality has deepened, and my religiosity has loosened.\n\nExcept you do that as a follower of Christ, you might inadvertently spend your life following men, and or church denominations, and think you were following Christ.\n\nReno\u2019s Nuggets\n\nLearn From Davido. Use your influence and money to support your family. Build each other up. Don\u2019t tear each other down. Don\u2019t wash your dirty linen in public. Do not even let your wives or husbands come between you and your BLOOD family. Unite. Don\u2019t divide. Be greater together. Don\u2019t let the hater be the victor. Congratulations go to the entire Adeleke family!\n\nSenator Adeleke won partly because of Davido. Going forward, Davido will win more because of Governor Adeleke. But look at your family. Whatever energy, money, and influence you have is dedicated to pulling each other down. Learn from the Adelekes!\n\nHow many celebrities could have done for their families what Davido did for his? Some even publicly fight their blood brothers. Others fight their own birth parents. Moral of the story: One family member who is committed to you is better than millions of fans who are interested in you!\n\n#RenosNuggets #OsunDecides2022 #FreeLeahSharibu #TableShaker",

          "text": "The Ghana Health Service (GHS) has confirmed the country\u2019s first-ever outbreak of the Marburg virus disease.\n\nThe development was announced in a statement issued on Sunday.\n\nAccording to the statement, two deaths have been recorded, while at least 98 contacts have been traced and quarantined.\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) identifies the Marburg virus as one that causes fever as experienced by persons who contract Ebola.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the WHO, \u201cMarburg is a highly infectious viral haemorrhagic fever in the same family as the more well-known Ebola virus disease\u201d.\n\nIn a statement on the development, the WHO added that the two persons confirmed to have died after contracting the Marburg virus, had reported at the same hospital.\n\n\u201cThe Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, received samples from each of the two patients from the southern Ashanti region of Ghana \u2013 both deceased and unrelated \u2013 who showed symptoms including diarrhoea, fever, nausea and vomiting,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe laboratory corroborated the results from the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, which suggested their illness was due to the Marburg virus.\n\n\u201cOne case was a 26-year-old male who checked into a hospital on 26 June 2022 and died on 27 June. The second case was a 51-year-old male who reported to the hospital on 28 June and died on the same day.

A much smaller proportion of people had lighter periods,\u201d the article reads.\n\n\u201cGreater than a third of respondents who used gender-affirming hormone treatments experienced breakthrough bleeding after vaccination. The majority of premenopausal respondents on long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) and the majority of postmenopausal respondents experienced breakthrough bleeding as well.\n\n\u201cAmong regularly menstruating respondents, those who had heavier bleeding after vaccine were more likely to be older, be Hispanic/Latinx, have experienced fever and/or fatigue side effects, have a lighter typical menstrual flow, have been pregnant, and/or have given birth. Regularly menstruating people with endometriosis, menorrhagia, fibroids, and PCOS were slightly more likely to experience heavier bleeding.\n\n\u201cAmong nonmenstruating premenopausal respondents, those with breakthrough bleeding after vaccine were more likely to have been pregnant and/or given birth. Last, among postmenopausal respondents, those with breakthrough bleeding after vaccine were more likely to be younger and/or be Hispanic/Latinx.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe nature of this survey means that we cannot compare the incidence of different experiences here with the general population (meaning, 40% of this sample having an experience does not mean that is the rate of that experience out in the world). The associations described here are not causal but provide evidence to better study these trends further.

          "title": "The leading African tech moves from June 2022",
          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Two fintech executives and a manager at a US-based money transfer company have been sentenced to a combined 8 years in US federal prison.\n\nThe firm, Ping Express, admitted in US district court filings that it broke money laundering rules after it transferred $167 million out of the US. One hundred and sixty million dollars of that money was sent to Nigeria over a period of 3 years, some of which were proceeds from online romance scams.\n\nAccording to a statement released by US Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, Chad E. Meacham, the firm admitted it failed to maintain an effective anti-money laundering programme and operated without a licence in at least 5 US states.\n\nPing Express CEO Anslem Oshionebo, 45, and COO Opeyemi Ode, 43, both recently received 27-month prison sentences, and the company\u2019s business manager, Aleoghena Okhumale, received a 42-month prison sentence for intentionally transferring criminal proceeds.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Oshionebo, a former senior manager at PwC, said in an email that he did not have the resources to continue fighting the case and \u201chistory will be the best judge\u201d. On his part, COO Odeyale claimed the case against him had \u201cgross violations\u201d.\n\nAccording to the US Department of Justice (DoJ), Ping\u2019s anti-money laundering policy claimed it limited first-time customer transactions to $499, daily transactions to $3,000, and monthly transactions to $4,500. The company admitted in court filings that it \u201callowed more than 1,500 customers to violate these rules. In one instance, Ping allowed a customer to remit more than $80,000 in a single month\u201417 times more than the purported limit,\u201d read part of the statement.\n\nPing Express also admitted it failed to seek sufficient details about the sources or purposes of the funds it helped to transmit, or the customers initiating the transmissions. By law, the company was supposed to report any suspicious transactions to regulators. But according to the company\u2019s court filings, it failed to make a single anti-money laundering report in 3 years of operation.\n\nAccording to DoJ statements, Collins Orogun, one of Ping\u2019s top customers and a co-defendant in the case, admitted to receiving a fee for laundering money for \u201cromance scam\u201d fraudsters and other criminals. Over a period of 2 years, the DoJ says he received more than $1.3 million in cash, cashier\u2019s cheques, and wires into several US bank accounts he controlled, and then quickly moved more than $1 million of the funds to Africa through Ping.\n\nIn one incident, an Indiana woman wired $15,000 to \u201cCarson Jacks\u201d, a putative oil roughneck in the Gulf of Mexico she fell in love with online, after he claimed to have malaria. Another Indiana woman claimed to have fallen in love online with an Irish ship captain named \u201cThomas Ken\u201d and wired him $6,300 to fix his ship. Orogun facilitated both payments through Ping.\n\nOrogun now faces up to 20 years in federal prison when sentenced on January 23, 2023.\n\nPing Express itself faces up to 5 years of probation and a $500,000 fine.\n\nPing COO Odeyale also founded a UK-registered electronic money firm, Payzen Limited, formerly Clicks FX Limited in 2013. In December 2020, about 10 months after he was formally charged by US DoJ officials for failing to maintain an effective AML programme and operating without a licence, he relinquished his controlling stake in Payzen. The UK business was not mentioned in the US case, but filings on the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) website show that Payzen also trades as Ping Express. Per Bloomberg, the current controlling shareholder of Payzen, Adekanmi Adedire, said that his company is \u201cunrelated\u201d to Ping Express, which is a \u201ctotally different entity\u201d. However, Payzen\u2019s website on the FCA\u2019s online database is still listed as ping-express.com.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Earlier on Friday, many African fintech startups offering virtual dollar card services sent emails to their customers stating that their virtual card service will be unavailable indefinitely starting Saturday, July 16, 2022. Virtual cards are digital replicas of physical bank cards. They are created and stored within digital virtual wallets.\n\nAn email sent to Barter customers by Nigerian-born unicorn Flutterwave read, \u201c\u2026effective Sunday, 17th July 2022, all our Virtual Dollar cards will be unavailable for any transactions and purchases.\u201d The payments giant attributed the reason for this suspension to \u201can update from the company\u2019s card partner\u201d. Barter is a Flutterwave consumer-facing virtual card platform that launched in early 2017.\n\nThis announcement by Flutterwave is bound to affect many other startups who use the company\u2019s white-labeled virtual card service to issue virtual cards to their customers.\n\nOther fintech startups including crypto exchange Busha, Rwanda-headquartered Payday, and Ugandan Eversend also issued similar notices.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear which \u201ccard partner\u201d Flutterwave and the other fintech startups are referring to, but these platforms have issued virtual cards powered by MasterCard and Visa\u2014two leading global card issuers. TechCabal is yet to confirm what exactly happened that led the \u201ccard partner\u201d to take this decision.\n\nIndividuals and businesses in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem affected by the unexpected notifications went on social media to complain about the widespread suspension of virtual card services.\n\n\u201cIt affects us in a big way because all our Facebook ads are connected to our Barter virtual card,\u201d Douglas Kenydson CEO Selar said. \u201cOur Amazon web services (AWS) plan is also connected, and you can\u2019t even afford to miss one payment, or else they\u2019ll take you off.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his other options, Kendyson expressed uncertainty about switching to existing virtual cards by Nigerian banks. He complained about the hassle of changing dollars and potentially dealing with failed card payments.\n\nKendyson\u2019s best alternative is to turn to the virtual card services of Mercury, a San Francisco-based digital bank for startups, that had restricted tens of African startups\u2019 accounts in March.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that this happened in the middle of the month so that whatever payment you need to make, make it,\u201d Kendyson said.\n\nIn the midst of the widespread announcement, startups like Bitmama and Mono took the opportunity to announce that their virtual card services are still up, a reminder that not all fintech startups were affected.\n\nBest in email from @bitmamaexchange \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Today\u2019s guest on Everyday People is someone whose magic you\u2019ve probably experienced at any Burna Boy, Wizkid, or Fireboy DML\u2019s concerts. Without further ado, let\u2019s meet Precious Tawo, freelance sound engineer and production manager. He has worked with firms like Google, IBM, and MultiChoice, and is a die-hard perfectionist, perhaps in recovery. He also runs Decibelz Production Limited, a one-stop-shop for all your audio rental needs.\n\nThere\u2019s this saying my sister made all of us get used to, which is still on my email address now:\n\nGood, better, best.\n\nI will never rest,\n\nUntil my good is better\n\nAnd my better best\n\nWe grew up singing that. We always lived by that mantra.\n\nSo I kept on putting my best into what I was doing. Everybody was interested in sitting on the console, but I was interested in knowing the whole craft.\n\nOn the 20th day [of the Calabar festival], we were doing a sound check in the stadium for the band, and my boss was not on the stage.\n\nSo he said, \u201cPrecious, please go to the console in front and mute the whole Front of House.\u201d\n\nFront of House is basically the mix the engineer mixes for the audience. So I ran there and quickly muted it. And he was shocked. Because he knew that at this point, he had not shown me anything that concerned the board.\n\n\u201cHow did you know how to mute the board?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been reading.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou this boy! You are a Puma!\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know how they say it in Yoruba, but he called me Puma because he says I jump. At the end of the festival, I became the first trainee to join the main crew in less than three weeks. I was paid \u20a6230,000 ($1,403)*, which was the highest [amount of] money I had ever received.\n\nPrecious Tawo\u2019s journey into sound engineering\n\nPrecious Tawo\n\nI didn\u2019t choose the path; the path chose me. So sometime after I finished secondary school, I wanted to study marine engineering real bad because I had friends in the marine space.\n\nI even had to wait one year at home for the entrance exam period. And I even went as far as Ibadan [Oyo State, Nigeria] to write for Polaris Marine Academy entrance exam. Then I went to the Maritime Academy in Oron to write the exam.\n\nFortunately, I got admission into the Maritime Academy, Oron, but before it came out, I was already working as a facility manager in a hotel in Calabar [Cross River State, Nigeria] because I just wanted to while away time.\n\nI\u2019m not an idle person. And then I\u2019ve always been someone that\u2019s been independent, and I wanted my little stipend. I got to work in a hotel thanks to my dad\u2019s South African friend \u2014 the manager \u2014 who gave me a job as one of the facility guys.\n\nBecause of how fast I was and everything, I was transferred from the hotel to the event centre, where I worked for over six months. And this was when I wrote the Polaris entrance exam. As at November, I knew full well that my time there was done because I know when it\u2019s time for me to leave somewhere.\n\nI don\u2019t need to pray about it; I feel it in my tummy that it\u2019s time to go, and I leave without a plan, but I always have something all worked out later on. So I felt it was time to leave.\n\nAnd in 2013, the Calabar Festival was very popular. This was something that we normally went to the stadium to watch every December and wish that we were on stage or part of the crew.\n\nAt this point, I had no audio background. The only knowledge I had about audio came in November [2013] when we had the Beer Festival in 520 [Hotel, Calabar], and they wanted to rent equipment worth about \u20a65,000,000 ($31,645)**.\n\nI made the company give me \u20a6700,000 ($4,430)** to buy some equipment, and I was like, \u201cI am gonna make this work.\u201d\n\nAnd I did DJ for the Beer Festival with Virtual DJ on my laptop and saved them over \u20a63,000,000 ($18,987)**. That\u2019s the only thing I knew about audio, which was basically from YouTube; plug this here, plug this there, turn this here, turn this there.\n\nWorking at The Voice in 2021\n\nSo on November 25, 2013, I resigned and told my dad that I would like to work with the crew for the Calabar Festival because he had his friend there.\n\nMy dad was an immigration officer in the Tourism Bureau, so he sorted out the passports for most foreigners working in Calabar. So he had relationships with these guys.\n\nThe production manager then was one of his friends, and he told him his son was interested in working with the guys for the December festival.\n\nI heard they were paying them \u20a6200,000 ($1,255)***. And how much was I earning at my place of work? It was just \u20a618,000 ($113)*** initially, then it went up to \u20a625,000 ($156)***. If I could make \u20a6200,000 a month, it\u2019d actually be better than what I was making in a year or close to what I made in a year if I stayed at the event centre.\n\nI planned to join them only for that month and then use the \u20a6200,000 to start school when results come out in January or February.\n\nOn the first day, I was told to go to the Governor\u2019s office for the interview. I dressed in my nicely starched shirt and trousers, and a nice pair of shoes.\n\nOnly for me to walk into the office and they were like, \u201cOh, you are the Precious. Okay, no problem. Hop into the Hilux; let\u2019s go to the warehouse and show you around.\u201d\n\n\u201cAm I going to change?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no. Just come.\u201d\n\nWhen I arrived, they were loading trucks to move the equipment to the studio. This was the 28th of November. And when I got there, I had this whole \u201cbig boy\u201d thingy going on, so seeing boys loading trucks, I was like, \u201cNah, that\u2019s not what I came for; I came for the cool stuff.\u201d\n\nSo they asked me what I wanted to do, and I said, \u201cThe sound department,\u201d because I really loved the whole sound thing. When you went to the Festival, you could hear the speakers pumping from miles away, and I really wanted to be a part of that.\n\nPlus, I had just finished the Beer Festival and wanted something higher than I\u2019d experienced. They introduced me to Aigbovosa Giwa-Osagie, my boss. They took me around and showed me speakers I\u2019d never seen before up close.\n\nThen they introduced me to another person who would be my head.\n\nI was like, \u201cOkay, cool. I\u2019ll resume tomorrow. Nice meeting you guys.\u201d\n\nNext thing, \u201cNo o!. You are resuming now and joining them to load that truck.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, no problem. Easy thing,\u201d I told him.\n\nLuckily, I had a singlet and a pair of jeans in my bag because I was supposed to go somewhere from there. Nice pair of jeans o!\n\nWizkid\u2019s concert\n\nSo, I started loading with the guys. The equipment was very heavy, and there I was, not used to carrying heavy things, seeing young people like me doing it, and told myself I could too.\n\nWe finished loading four trucks after almost four hours and headed to the venue for the Festival\u2019s first event. And I was told to jump into the back of the truck because the Hilux was full.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: senior crew sits in the Hilux, junior crew at the back, and trainees like me sit on the equipment inside the 40-foot truck like the one used to convey cows.\n\nAt first, I was like no way, especially since Calabar is such a small place, but I eventually jumped in. Part of the price you have to pay, you know. At this point, my jeans were gone, and my singlet was like rags.\n\nWe got there, and my boss walked up to me and asked me what audio background I had. And I told him I had none, but the only thing I knew was the entry stuff, but I was willing to learn.\n\nSo when we started setting up, he asked me to go and get the 10 mm ep5 cable. In my head, I was supposed to go and see a cable labelled 10mm ep5.\n\nHe pointed in a direction of over 65 open cases, so I went there straight, and for like 40 minutes, I was searching for the ep5 cable, and I didn\u2019t even know what I was looking for. And then I couldn\u2019t even ask because the way he said it, it was like I was supposed to know the cable.\n\nSo I did not ask, and I didn\u2019t want to look small. After 40 minutes, I went back to him.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t find the cable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I see it, what should I do to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you want to do, but I can\u2019t find the cable in the box.\u201d\n\nAnd then he asked another guy that had been there for like four years to get the cable for him and take me and show me the cable.\n\nThis guy just opened the case, stretched his hand, and picked up the cable.\n\nMixing in a studio.\n\nYo! It was super embarrassing. And I didn\u2019t like the way everyone was laughing and everything. So I told myself that I was going to know everything in the company, how it works, and I was going to know all their needs.\n\nSo that night, I started downloading the PDF files for the equipment manuals and spent another hour downloading more when I got home at 3:00 a.m. before I slept.\n\nThe next night, since I was just a trainee, I sat in one corner with all the loud music and was just reading stuff, checking stuff, and going behind the Front of House to peep and see what they were doing even though it looked like they were running a spaceship.\n\nAfter the Festival, my boss gave me the opportunity to go to an event in Lagos for IBM computers. Then I also did Love Like a Movie by Darey Art Alade in February 2014, the outdoor version with Kelly Rowland.\n\nLong story short, I kept on growing, going from event to event. I\u2019m a sucker for information, always trying to keep myself updated. People were recommending me because no matter how good you are, you need people to recommend you.\n\nOn February 20 [2014], my mom called me to tell me that the result for the Academy was out, and I passed. My name was announced on NTA [a state-owned broadcasting station]. But, I had no plans to go to school anymore.\n\nThat February, I was also offered a position with the company, but my boss advised me not to take it.\n\nHe said, \u201cEvery week and every day, experts fly in from South Africa and the United States or wherever to come and work in Nigeria. And if you are good at what you do, they\u2019ll fly you from whatever hole you are in to come and do an event.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve worked with different companies and been exposed to various equipment and clients.\n\nAnd I will not put this achievement on one company. If I was working with one company, I\u2019d be stuck with their clients and the kind of events they do. I learn from everybody, and I also like the way I\u2019m being treated like the golden egg.\n\nI love my job. I\u2019ve done stuff for Google, Amazon, IBM, Airtel, MTN, MultiChoice, and The Voice. Presently I\u2019m Burna Boy\u2019s monitor engineer and Fireboy\u2019s Front of House engineer. I\u2019ve mixed for Wizkid\u2019s December concerts, Cardi B, and Davido; any big artiste really.\n\nLearning from mistakes\n\nMixing at Burna Boy\u2019s Dakar concert in 2022\n\nSometime in 2015, we had an event in Eko Atlantic; it was supposed to be the launch for Majestic Voyage and ten minutes before the show, we did the sound check. Everything was sounding all right and I was mixing monitors.\n\nFive minutes to the show, I tapped my screen and it was frozen. I tried restarting the console, but nothing. That meant every artiste who climbed that stage was not going to hear jack!\n\nI felt like the ground should open for me to enter. We tried everything and eventually had to plug my monitors into my boss\u2019 equipment. By this time, the first artiste, Yemi Sax, was already on stage. I had already explained to him and everything but the first three minutes of the show were hell.\n\nI somehow survived the performance and my boss stabilised everything and that\u2019s how we ran the show. Another moment was when I was doing a show at Calabar Cultural Centre, and then we had power issues in the middle of the show and the console went off.\n\nThe show was cancelled and they had to fix another date. I spent four years trying to correct that mistake. I was hard on myself for four years. I\u2019m a perfectionist so I like to give 110%. Eventually, I had to accept that every engineer has bad days.\n\nGiving back\n\nIn line with what I\u2019ve learnt over the years, I decided to try and pass on this knowledge because I found out that, at the end of the day, we have to leave a legacy.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about money to me, my job is like my life right now. And I\u2019ve seen that many engineers have come and gone but there\u2019s nothing anybody can point to that they made. And so I started sharing knowledge at every opportunity I got. If I went to an event, I\u2019d teach the in-house engineer things I knew they would need if they asked politely, of course.\n\nI run a clinic for engineers, although I haven\u2019t done it since 2019. I also have some people I mentor, all so I can give back.\n\n*Average dollar to naira to rates in February 2014.\n\n**Dollar to naira rate in November 2013.\n\n***Average dollar to naira rates in 2013.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nAsaba \u2013 Delta State Government on Monday said protesting pensioners in the state are not retirees of the state government but primary school retirees under the local government councils.\n\nBriefing journalists in Asaba, Mr Charles Aniagwu, Commissioner for Information, stated that the protests targeted at maligning and impugning the reputation of Governor Ifeanyi Okowa was politically motivated.\n\nAccording to him, the leader of the protesting retirees is Mrs Helen Ejie, APC Delta North Woman Leader and accused her of misleading the public on whose responsibility it was to pay the pensioners.\n\n\u201cWe have it on good authority that the incessant protests emanating from a section of pensioners in the state have become politically motivated.\n\n\u201cThe leader of the protesters is Mrs Helen Ejie, a retired teacher from Iyiatu Primary School, Utagba-Ogbe in Ndokwa West. She retired in 2016 and is the coordinator of APC women in Delta North.\n\n\u201cWe have seen some stage-managed protests by individuals who ordinarily are supposed to appreciate what the state government has done.\n\n\u201cIt is public knowledge that primary schools are under the local government councils in terms of how they are remunerated and how they operate.\n\n\u201cSometime last year, this same woman led a few persons contrary to the reality of what we are doing they come to Asaba, rub themselves on the ground, pour invectives on the governor in line with what those who have asked them to go and demonstrate.\n\n\u201cThey will begin to shout and cast aspersions on the person and office of the Governor. I have never seen where somebody will work in UAC and proceed to LEVENTIS to receive salary.\n\n\u201cWhat we have always done is to assist them because we believe that they are Deltans and you can recall in 2015 when we came into office, we met over seven months salary arrears owed local government council staff and primary school teachers.\n\n\u201cWe assisted them to clear up that arrears and even when we got bailout from the federal government we gave them a grant of N3billion which aided in clearing the backlog,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the issue of pensions, Aniagwu said the state government didn\u2019t employ the staff but assisting because the local government councils are not in a financial position to do so at the moment.\n\n\u201cIn the area of pensions we have also assisted them to pay, as at when we came they were getting N150m to tackle pensions and we upscaled it to N300m and to fastrack it further, we increased it to N500m monthly.\n\n\u201cWe have so far cleared Local Government Pensions to early 2018 and Primary School Teachers owed several years of arrears of pension to August 2016.\n\n\u201cWe have said that in addition to the N500m monthly grant, when we access the N150billion bridging finance we will release the sum of N10billion as grant to offset part of the pensions owed these pensioners by the local government councils.\u201d he said.\n\nOn the constant attacks on the governor by a former member of the State House of Assembly, Hon. Evance Ivwurie, the Information Commissioner said it was a mere politics of bitterness and hatred.\n\nHe said Ivwurie failed to return to the State Assembly on account of not being popular among his people and had since resorted to insulting the governor for no just cause.\n\n\u201cHe went about alleging that several funds have been taken and misappropriated but let me put it on record that all the loans we obtained are properly directed to areas they were meant for.\n\n\u201cAs a government we will remain steadfast and stay on course in delivering our promises to Deltans,\u201d\n\nAniagwu also took a swipe on Minister of State For Labour and Employment, Chief Festus Keyamo over an uncharitable comment on the state-of-affairs in the state.\n\nHe reminded Keyamo that students who were supposed to be in school are still at home because of lingering ASUU strike that the federal government failed to resolve.\n\n\u201cWe need to remind Festus Keyamo that in Delta, our universities are working while the ones that belong to the Federal government are still at home.\n\n\u201cWe remind Festus Keyamo that our children who are supposed to be in school are still at home and we urge him to work seriously with his senior colleague to ensure that the issues raised by ASUU are resolved as soon as possible,\u201d he stated.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n...",

With about 60 members within the group and counting, it provides a strong voice for the aggregation of the critical voices of readers within the Nigerian books ecosystem. It was founded in February 2020 and is led by the writer and books enthusiast, Mr. Richard Mammah.\n\nAt the Nigerian International Bookfair in May 2022, the organisation presented a preliminary report of its survey on the state of reading infrastructure in Nigeria. The report covered Lagos, Abia, Akwa Ibom, Rivers and the Federal Capital Territory, FCT. Work on the comprehensive coverage of the state of reading in all Nigerian states is to commence soon.\n\nIn September, NBRP members and stakeholders in the book ecosystem would be converging in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital for the second edition of its Annual General Meeting and National Conference. That occasion would also be used to select the Nigerian National Book Clubs City, 2024.\n\nAn initiative of the NBRP that is modelled after the UNESCO World Book City Project, the National Book Clubs City for 2022 is Uyo while Lagos is already waiting in the wings to flag off its tenure as National Book Clubs City 2023.",

          "text": "By Onu Okorie\n\nIn Nigeria today, when agents of transformations in the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari are being counted, the Director General of Securities and Exchange Commission SEC, Mr. Lamido Yuguda will definitely standout, if the numerous reforms he has introduced is anything to go by.\n\nIn less than two years after assuming office the SEC management under Mr. Yuguda has not only set strategic goals but also continued to expand the frontiers of investment space thereby attracting improved local and foreign direct investment, FDIs into the economy through innovative regulatory guidelines and collaboration with other relevant institutions.\n\nFor instance, on market-wide issues, the Commission has drafted and presented an amendment to ISA Bill to the National Assembly as part of its efforts to enhance the regulatory framework of the Nigerian capital market, lead to the introduction of new products into the market, and increase the effectiveness of the Investments and Securities Tribunal, amongst other benefits to ensure that the provisions of the Bill represent realities in the nation\u2019s investment climate.\n\nAlso, the Commission is collaborating with National Assembly Business Environment Roundtable NASSBER to prepare a roadmap towards passage of the Bill within the shortest time frame.\n\nAlso, the Yuguda-led executive management team has been implementing capital market development goals set out in the Capital Market Master Plan (CMMP) (2015-2025) and successfully completed the review of CMMP to realign the initiatives/deliverables to prevailing market conditions and keep the document relevant in the dynamic capital market due to issues related to Fintech, sustainability and regional integration.\n\nTo resolve legacy issues of Identity Management which is a crucial driver in improving market participation and solving unclaimed dividends and related problems, the management also inaugurated a market-wide Identity Management Committee with mandate to harmonize the various databases of investors in Nigerian capital market, facilitate data accuracy in the market, mitigate fraud, improve KYC requirements and manage AML/CFT risks, among others.\n\nThe report of the committee is expected to resolve issues that have hindered growth of the Market, hampered investor confidence, and matters that serve as barriers to entry for potential investors, amongst other benefits.\n\nOn primary market activities, the Yuguda-led executive management of the SEC has also in the past two years approved 41 new equities issues valued at N656.9 billion, 37 bonds valued at N776.2 billion, 28 applications for shelf programmes valued at N2.5 trillion and 21 Exchange Traded Derivatives Contracts.\n\nThis is even as it processed six Schemes of Merger, seven Acquisitions, 21 Corporate Restructurings, and three Takeovers during the period. It also ensured that over N11 billions of untraceable shareholders\u2019 funds from Schemes of Arrangement in the custody of Registrars were transferred to the National Investor Protection Fund NIPF.\n\nAs part of the process of improving time to market of transactions and fast tracking the review process, the Commission conducted training for issuing houses to help improve the quality of applications submitted.\n\nSimilarly, Commission also recorded a landmark achievement on the first electronic offering with combined feature of book building to Qualified Institutions and use of the price discovered from book-build for sales to Retail Investors. It also granted approval for the first 21 derivatives contracts which had seven and 14 different contracts from both the NGX and FMDQ Exchanges respectively in the past two years.\n\nOn Collective Investment Scheme CIS, the Yuguda-led management has also, following completion of series of monitoring and evaluation processes, commenced implementation of 100 per cent custody requirement in the CIS sector to protect investors. As a result, all clients\u2019 assets currently managed under discretionary and non-discretionary mandates are to be held under independent custodial agreements in custodial banks.\n\nThe Commission has also recorded remarkable milestones in its secondary market activities in the past years with successful demutualization of the Nigerian Exchange Limited NGX which investment analysts see as milestone in the development of Nigerian capital market.\n\nThis is even as the management collaborated with University of Cambridge\u2019s Centre for Alternative Finance, UK for the training of its select employees on a certified course on Fintech & Regulatory Innovation, to enhance the Commission\u2019s capacity in regulating Fintech.\n\nAlso, it collaborated with the World Bank to commission a Fintech Scoping project and held collaborative engagements with 15 International and local Fintech stakeholders to guide the Commission on its Fintech policies.\n\nThe Regulatory Incubation Guidelines to operationalize provisional regulation for aspiring Fintech firms were released within the period. In furtherance of its market regulation roles, management of the Commission was able to ascertain the quantum of unclaimed dividends of publicly traded companies that fall within the categories eligible to be borrowed by the Federal Government.\n\nThis amounted to N56, 584,795,648.71 and $8,153,118.41 respectively. In addition, it also facilitated the transfer into the SEC/CNB NIPF Account of N2.3 billion in excess of return monies and N11.4 billion in Schemes consideration money, both of which had previously been held in the custody of the Registrars.\n\nOn the pesky issue of Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing Of Terrorism AML/CFT, following the GIABA Mutual Evaluation of Nigeria, the Yuguda-led executive management had made concerted efforts in the capital market to meet both the GIABA Mutual Evaluation Report MER Follow-Up Process and the FATF International Cooperation Review Group ICRG requirements in order to avoid Nigeria being placed on the FATF public grey list at the Plenary when the grace period expires in October, 2022.\n\nFor instance, following the MER findings that Nigeria had several important deficiencies in its AML/CFT/CPF system in relation to Technical Compliance, and that its effectiveness controls were insufficient to mitigate its high ML/TF/PF risks, the Commission championed the amendments of Rules and Regulations of the Virtual Asset Service providers; the sector specific regulations to repeal the 2013 SEC AML/CFT Regulations and enactment of the 2022 AML/CFT Regulations; the SEC AML/CFT RBS Framework.\n\nThese new rules and amendments were done in order to address Nigeria\u2019s MER deficiencies and broaden the scope of preventive measures available to VASPs. In furtherance of its regulatory mandate, the Commission conducted investigations into complaints by investors and out of the 250 complaints brought forward into the period, 182 were resolved.\n\nAlso, out of the 58 complaints in relation to Ponzi schemes received, 45 were resolved. The Commission was able to recover 10,659,168 units of various companies\u2019 shares as well as the sum of N1, 384,255,526.73 recovered for investors during the period under review.\n\nIt issued New Rules on Robo-Advisory Services to guide the regulatory requirements and expectations for providing automated advisory services in the market and released the Rules on Trade Repositories during the period under review.\n\nSimilarly, the Yuguda-led executive management of the Commission also introduced new rules on Crowd Funding, Social bonds, Digital Assets Exchange DAX, Digital Assets Custodians DACs, Issuance of Digital Assets as Securities and Requirements for registration of Digital Assets Offering Platforms as part of its efforts to guarantee security of investments in the capital market.\n\nOn Corporate Governance measures, the Commission also released guidelines on the Implementation of Sections 60-63 of Investments and Securities Act (ISA), 2007 and in order to strengthen the disclosure regime in capital market, the Commission in a circular dated January 19, 2022 provided public companies a fast track option for filing Audited Financial Statements.\n\nIn addition, the Commission also developed the SEC Corporate Governance Guidelines SCGG to address corporate governance issues not considered in the NCCG, and released same in October 2020. As part of its efforts to harmonise the reporting timeline of the SEC Corporate Governance Guideline SCGG with that of the National Code of Corporate Governance NCCG, it also in year 2021 exposed to the public for comments an amendment to Rules 42(2).\n\nThe Commission has also as part of its regulatory interventions to amicably resolve disputes between the board and shareholders of listed companies resolved the disputes between Alhaji Muneer Alade Bankole (the Chief Executive Officer and Sheikh Abdulmohsen A. Al-Thunayan Chairman of the Board, of Medview Airlines, resolved those between major shareholders of Ikeja Hotels Plc and returned the company to profitability and also reached a settlement with Oando Plc in 2021 after concluding investigation of Corporate Governance allegations levelled against the company.\n\nIn regard to its market development mandate, the Commission has continued its Investor Education and Public enlightenment programmes by organizing workshops on infusion of Capital Market Studies into the curricula of Basic and Secondary Schools in Nigeria and also collaborated with the Standards Organization of Nigeria SON and other partners to organize Stakeholders\u2019 Sensitization Workshops on Commodities Standards in Lagos and Kano during the period under review.\n\nFurthermore, the Commission held webinars on Non-Interest Capital Market Products, Financial Inclusion, Ponzi Schemes and Solid Minerals targeted at the pension industry, investor protection, women, Youth/millennial and the commodities segment of the market.\n\nAlso in pursuit of non-interest market education and enlightenment programmes, the Commission collaborated with Islamic Financial Services Board IFSB and the Auditing and Accounting Organisation of Islamic Financial Institutions AAOIFI to organize Non-Interest Capital Market training for over 1000 participants.\n\nAlso, the Yuguda-led executive management of the Commission has led the team to improve the capacity of the Nigerian Capital Market Institute NCMI by providing it with necessary tools to train Capital Market Operators CMO in different fields.\n\nOn international engagements, Mr Yuguda is now saddled with leadership of West African Securities Regulators Association WASRA. Under his leadership, rules for the integrated West African Capital Market were developed and reviewed.\n\nOn human capital development, the Commission had in 2019 conducted an internal capacity assessment that outlined staffing deficits and needs.\n\nAlso, in furtherance of its drive to leverage its operations by deploying innovative technologies and solutions to its departments and units, the Commission conducted a review of its IT infrastructure and determined that it was in a poor state.\n\nThe investigations focused on the internal and external perceptions of the Commission with the conclusion that the IT infrastructure was out dated and needed to be upgraded to international standards of securities regulators.\n\nAlso, on its Risk-Based Supervision Framework Implementation and Capacity Building Project the Commission secured a $400,000 grant from the African Development Bank AfDB to support capacity building projects in the areas of RBS, Derivatives and Green Bonds.\n\nThe Commission has also secured counterpart funding of $450,000 from AfDB on its Nigeria Securities Market Surveillance System Project to support the deployment of a real-time market surveillance system for the Nigerian capital market.\n\nIn addition, it has also secured from the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN the sum of N3.5 billion for Information Technology transformation project. Given the unparalleled achievements recorded so far, it has been argued by some financial experts that there is nexus between Yuguda\u2019s reforms and investors\u2019 making Nigeria a preferred destination in recent times.",

In the Osun governorship election, we were shy of two million registered voters.\n\n\u201cThese are stand-alone elections. For the Ekiti election, we utilised the service of the Nigerian Air force and they flew the materials into Akure airport. We did the same thing with the Osun election, and we moved the materials to our state offices.\n\n\u201cBut for the 2023 general election, we are going to have over 95 million ballot papers printed for the presidential election.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari, on Sunday, described the outcome of Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Osun State, won by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke, as an expression of the will of the people through ballot, which must matter and be respected.\n\nThe president, who congratulated Adeleke, as well as commended the maturity and commitment of all stakeholders, however, reiterated his commitment to a credible electoral system in the country.\n\nThis is as congratulatory messages, have continued to come for Adeleke from different strata of the system, particularly, members of his political family, including person like the presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar; National Chairman of the PDP, 7/17/22r. Iyorchia Ayu; former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki; Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri and his Edo State counterpart, Godwin Obaseki, among others.\n\n\u201cWith the election over, the president expressed conviction that the people of Osun have expressed their will through the ballot, and the will of the people must always matter and be respected in a democracy,\u201d he said in a release by his Media Adviser, Femi Adesina.\n\nContinuing, he noted further that the successful conduct of the election was a further testimony to the maturity and commitment of all stakeholders \u2013 the electoral body, security agencies, political parties, the media, civil society and the electorate \u2013 to further strengthen the integrity of the electoral process in the country.\n\nBuhari, therefore, reassured the nation that the commitment of his administration towards having credible elections remained unshaken.\n\nAtiku, Ayu, Saraki, Diri, Obaseki Salute Adeleke\n\nIn his congratulatory message, Atiku Abubakar said, \u201cAt this point in time when our country needs to take a break from the shameful effects of bad governance, it shall be on record that Osun State provided the compass into that brighter future that awaits us at the horizon.\n\n\u201cThe referendum on the administration of the APC, has commenced with the verdict of the people of Osun State in electing Senator Ademola Adeleke, while we know that the 2023 general election will be a full referendum.\n\n\u201cIt is inconceivable that Nigerians will reward the APC for the failings of the last seven years. And in a state like Osun, for example, it\u2019s been a long time since the people last felt the effect of good governance.\n\n\u201cThe ship of hope is already at the harbour under the umbrella of the Peoples Democratic Party. We shall intensify the work to ensure that we uproot all vestiges of bad governance and false hopes towards the 2023 election. The Imole (light) that has started to shine from Osun shall soon have a national coverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongratulations to Sen. Ademola Adeleke, on a well-fought victory. Also, hearty congratulations to the PDP family and all stakeholders, who came together to make this sweet victory possible. But even more importantly, congratulations to the great people of Osun State for proving that power truly belongs to the people.\u201d\n\nAyu, who in his congratulatory message, said the Osun people have spoken, recalled how the defeated governor denied the party the use of facilities for its campaign.\n\n\u201cA few days ago, the defeated and outgoing Governor, HE Adegboyega Oyetola and his party, the APC, did everything to frustrate us. This included denying us the use of any public facility in the state capital for our mega-rally.\n\n\u201cWe had to use the party\u2019s state secretariat. As it were, we couldn\u2019t have access to the stadium, but we had access to the people\u2019s hearts, loyalty and votes,\u201d adding that, the convincing win of 403, 371 against Governor Oyetola\u2019s 375, 027 was ample proof of that.\n\nAyu said, \u201cToday is, therefore, not just a day of double restoration \u2013 it\u2019s a day of redemption too. It restores PDP to power and redeems the Osun people from the scourge of mediocrity, empty promises and excuses.\u201d\n\n\u201cI congratulate the two-time winner, the tenacious Adeleke. I congratulate the good people and residents of Osun State. I hail every party stakeholder, who stood with us in action, prayers and hope.\u201d\n\nIn his message, Saraki too said, \u201cToday, all across Nigeria, the nation has watched as the people of Osun State deliver a clear, loud, and strong message: \u201cImole De\u201d \u2014 which means that light has come.\n\n\u201cWe have watched, as the people of this great state have reclaimed their mandate and the mandate of my dear friend and brother, Senator Ademola Adeleke, the PDP governorship candidate, which was surreptitiously stolen at the polls exactly four years ago.\n\n\u201cWith everything that we have all witnessed here in Osun State, one lesson remains clear: the people of Nigeria want better. They want lives that are not hampered by the rising cost of living, the flailing economy, and the insecurity. They want a conscientious government \u2014 one that works for and represents the best interests of themselves, their families, and their communities.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake, this victory was not easily attained. It is the culmination of the sacrifice and hard work of our party leaders, stakeholders, and leaders, who all played specific roles to ensure that this time around, our party\u2019s mandate has been protected, and our candidate has now emerged victorious.\n\n\u201cI congratulate my brothers, Governor Douye Diri of Bayelsa and Governor Godwin Obaseki, for taking the time out of their busy schedules to ensure that our victory was not only concise but complete.\u201d\n\nObaseki: Osun People Chose Progress over Retrogression\n\nEdo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has congratulated the PDP governorship candidate in Osun State, Ademola Adeleke, following his victory in Saturday\u2019s election, saying the Osun people chose progress over retrogressive politics.\n\nObaseki, who also said Osun people made their choices through the ballot, choosing the PDP and its ideals of equity, unity and progress over the retrogressive policies that had put them in dire straits, however, stood with the people of Osun in sending a clear message to Nigerians that, \u201cwe are prepared and ready to rescue them from the hardship and woes that they have been thrown into.\n\n\u201cWe thank the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for sustaining the electoral reforms, which started in the September 19, 2020 Edo State governorship election. These reforms have ensured a peaceful, fair and credible conduct of the election, which gave the people the freedom to elect their preferred candidate.\n\n\u201cAs a party, we remain steadfast in our commitment to rescue Nigeria and are, by this victory, fired up to go into the 2023 general elections to win.\u201d\n\nMakinde: People\u2019s Power\u2019ll Continue to Triumph\n\nOyo State Governor, \u2018Seyi Makinde, has congratulated Senator Ademola Adeleke, over his victory at the just-concluded Osun State governorship election, saying the power of the people has again triumphed and would continue to triumph.\n\nAccording to him, Adeleke\u2019s victory was similar to what happened in Oyo State during the 2019 governorship election, when the people exercised their franchise in support of an opposition party.\n\nMakinde, who hailed the teeming voters across the 30 local governments of Osun State for standing by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and staying resolute to ensure that their votes counted, said: \u201cit\u2019s great to have a second PDP flag flying in the South-West.\u201d\n\nAccording to a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, Makinde lauded Adeleke, PDP members and Osun State voters for remaining strong and unwavering throughout the electioneering period.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the government and the good people of Oyo State, I congratulate the Osun State Governor-Elect, Senator Ademola Adeleke and the people of Osun State on this victory.\n\n\u201cIt is great to have a second PDP flag flying in the South West and this victory teaches all politicians an important lesson \u2013 that truly, power resides with the people. The power of the people will continue to triumph, the earlier politicians realise this fact, the better for our democracy,\u201d he said.\n\nObi Congratulates Adeleke\n\nPresidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, has extended what he described as his warmest personal congratulations to Ademola Adeleke on wining the Osun State gubernatorial election.\n\nObi also congratulated candidate of the Labour Party in the election, Hon Lasun Sulaimon Yusuff and his running mate, Adeola Adekunle Atanda, for a hard fought battle and their spirit of resolve and sportsmanship, despite the outcome.\n\nHe said, \u201cTo our the Obidient Movement Family and our supporters nationwide, the outcome of this particular election is not a verdict on our exponentially growing strength nationwide especially, when viewed against the fact that we are barely one month old in the party and we had to contend with forces that have been entrenched in the state for the last two decades.\n\n\u201cHowever, within this very short period of only a few weeks, the Labour Party has made its presence and political impact felt nationally. We must strengthen our collective resolve not relent in our noble march to take back our country. Much work remains to be done, hence we must focus the totality of our efforts now on the forthcoming 2023 General elections.\n\n\u201cIn the fullness of time, our message of rescue and recovery will resonate through out the length and breath of the Nation and most Nigerian electorate will buy in into our mission to take back Nigeria, for the purpose of rescuing it from continued decline , shift the National psyche from consumption to production and from sharing dwindling resources to creating wealth and frontally combating poverty.\u201d\n\nNwobodo: Adeleke\u2019s Victory, Precursor to PDP\u2019s Success in 2023\n\nA former governor of Anambra State, Senator Jim Nwobodo, has described the victory of Osun State Governor-elect, Senator Ademola Adeleke, as a precursor to the success awaiting PDP in the 2023 general election.\n\nNwobodo, in a statement last night, said Adeleke\u2019s victory showed that the presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar, would win the presidency in 2023 and that the PDP would win in the Southwest and the other geopolitical zones.\n\n\u201cI congratulate the governor-elect of Osun State, Senator Ademola Adeleke for his victory in the well-conducted polls last Saturday. Adeleke\u2019s victory is a forerunner to the electoral fortunes of the presidential candidate of the PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. Atiku will win the presidency for the PDP in 2023.\u201d\n\nNwobodo recalled that Adeleke had in 2018 won the same governorship position through the ballots but was \u201crobbed of victory through the rigging machinery of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\u201d\n\n\u201cThis time around, he has won again in another clear victory, and I congratulate the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for conducting a credible poll in Osun State.\u201d\n\n\u2018Buhari\u2019s Negligence Responsible for Edo, Osun Losses\u2019\n\nA Chieftain of APC in Edo State, Mr. John Mayaki, has laid the blames for the party\u2019s recent struggles, including a crushing defeat in Osun State with the ouster of incumbent Governor Gboyega Oyetola, at the feet of President Muhammadu Buhari, whom he accused of negligent management of party activities and \u2018suicidal\u2019 tolerance of anti-party activities within the ranks.\n\nHe also added that the anti-party activities of top ranking APC members, governors and ministers under the President Buhari-led administration was to blame for the electoral misfortune of the party in Edo and Osun states.\n\nMayaki noted that the poor reward system of the party and that of the president, posed another negative impact on the party, adding that Buhari as the leader of the party does not appear concerned if the party collapsed under his watch.\n\nMayaki, who chaired the Media Council of the Edo APC in the 2020 governorship election, maintained that although the president\u2019s non-interference through the infamous \u2018federal might\u2019 represents a good development for the country\u2019s democracy, it still doesn\u2019t excuse the observed \u201cabandonment of his obligations as the leader of the party, who ought to be spearheading efforts to unite the ranks, enforce loyalty, and expand political control.\u201d\n\nHe warned that unless the President changes tack, his \u2018look the other way\u2019 approach to party issues might complicate the party\u2019s chances in 2023, adding: \u201cThe anti-party activities of top ranking APC members, governors and Ministers under the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration is to blame for the electoral misfortune of the party in Edo and Osun states.\n\n\u201cPoor reward system of the party and that of the president, if not checked, could impact negatively on the party just as the \u2018I don\u2019t care attitude\u2019 of Mr. President as a party man. The president is the leader of the party and he doesn\u2019t appear concerned if the party collapses under his watch.\u201d\n\nOrtom: Takeover of Nigeria by PDP Has Begun\n\nBenue State Governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom, has said the election of Senator Ademola Adeleke as the next Osun State Governor, was a precursor to the round of victories awaiting the PDP as it began to take back all the states in its resolve to rescue Nigeria from the destruction meted to it by the APC-led federal government.\n\nWhile congratulating Adeleke for his victory at Saturday\u2019s gubernatorial election, he praised him for his steadfastness, hard work and commitment to the welfare of the people that earned him the victory, saying \u201c the people have spoken\u201d.\n\nOrtom also praised the people of Osun state, the INEC, the media, civil society organisations (CSOs) and the security operatives for ensuring that the will of the people prevailed.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of myself, the government and the PDP family in Benue State, I congratulate Senator Ademola Adeleke on his election as the Governor-elect of Osun State. I am convinced that you will provide an enduring leadership for the people in appreciation for the massive support they have given you by your election.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe victory of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate; Senator Adeleke in the Osun election is a measure of trust and confidence of the citizens on him and the party \u201c, Ortom stated.\n\nWhile congratulating the National Chairman of the PDP, Senator Iyorchia Ayu and the National Working Committee of the PDP, Governor Ortom also expressed confidence that the victory of the party in Osun State would further change the political map of the South West as the PDP is ready to rescue the country from its undertakers in the APC.\n\nElumelu: PDP\u2019s Victory in Osun Marks APC\u2019s Exit in 2023\n\nMinority Leader of the PDP in the House of Representatives, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, has congratulated Ademola Adeleke, on his victory in the Saturday, governorship election, saying it marked the exit of the APC in 2023.\n\nElumelu, in a congratulatory message, said the victory and recovery of the mandate that was allegedly stolen from Adeleke by the APC in 2018, further reinforced his popularity and that of the PDP not only in Osun State, but also in the South West geo-political zone and the nation as a whole.\n\nAccording to him, this showed that the PDP would win 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the members of our great Party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the House of Representatives, I congratulate you, the Osun State Governor-Elect, Your Excellency, Sen. Ademola Adeleke, on your well-deserved victory in the Saturday, July 16, 2022 Governorship election.\n\n\u201cYour overwhelming defeat of a sitting governor underscores the well-founded confidence and trust the people of Osun State repose in you as the leader with the desired capacity, integrity, humility, love for the people and the political will to lead their state in the right direction.\u201d\n\nAdeleke\u2019s Victory Has Vindicated Diri, Says IYC\n\nThe Ijaw Youths Council (IYC) Worldwide said the victory of Senator Ademola Adeleke at Saturday\u2019s governorship election in Osun State, was a proof of the commitment, loyalty and capacity of the Bayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri, to his party, the PDP.\n\nIn a statement by the President of IYC, Peter Timothy Igbifa, he said Diri as the Chairman of the PDP Electoral Committee in Osun, proved that an Ijaw man could be trusted to deliver in a national assignment.\n\n\u201cAs a council, we noticed that some PDP leaders were not happy that an Ijaw man was appointed to handle the Osun electoral matters. They conspired against Governor Douye Diri to make him fail in his first national party assignment.\n\n\u201cThey referred to him as an inexperienced politician and tried to demean and relegate him to the background. But man is not God. Diri triumphed as a miracle governor and delivered a resounding victory to his party\u201d.\n\nIgbifa, who congratulated Diri for piloting the success of his party in Osun, said the victory of PDP had brought shame to the enemies of the Bayelsa governor and the Ijaw nation within the PDP, who had earlier conspired to make the Bayelsa governor fail in his first national party assignment.\n\nFemale Lawyers Commend INEC, Women Turn-out\n\nThe International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA) in a preliminary report on its observation of the governorship election in Osun State, has commended the efforts of the INEC, for the efforts at ensuring a free and fair election in Osun State.\n\nThe body also commended women for turning out en mass to exercise their franchise in selecting who governs them in Osun State for the next four years.\n\nFIDA Nigeria, in its preliminary report on the Osun poll, signed by its Country Vice President and National President, Mrs Amina Agbaje, noted that women and persons with disability were also accorded priority by the electoral umpire.\n\n\u201cReports across the Local Government Areas in Osun state observed indicate that there was early and high voter turnout for the polls across the state as security personnel, electoral officers and election materials arrived at most polling units between the hours of 8:00 \u2013 9:00am.\n\n\u201c24% of the polling units had the election materials before 8AM, 48% by 8AM and 28% by 8:30AM. Furthermore we observed that 64% polling units visited had more than one electoral official, 24% had 3 electoral officials, and 12 % had two (2) electoral officials.\n\n\u201cWith regards participation of female electoral officials, we observed that a larger percentage of the polling units visited , that is about 76% had more than 2 female electoral officials, 12% had less than 2 officials, while 12% were above 2 officials.\n\n\u201cFor instance, at polling unit 007, Ward 3, Boluwaduro LGA, polling unit 012, ward 2, Ife North LGA, accreditation commenced between 8.20- 8.30am, Similarly at polling unit 7, ward 6, Iwo LGA, accreditation commenced as early as 8am, however at polling unit 23, ward 5 , Oshogbo LGA, voters were accredited at 9.45am\u201d, Mrs Agbaje said.\n\nOn the turn out. of female voters and Persons with Disabilities, FIDA, claimed it observed a large turnout of female voters in about 88% of the polling units observed, adding that only 12% of the polling units visited had low voters.\u201d\n\nUtomi: With Transactional Politics, APC, PDP Can\u2019t Produce Good Leaders\n\nNational Leader of Labour Party, Prof Pat Utomi, has declared that, with structural deficiency by reason of their transactional politics, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) could not produce good leaders.\n\nHe also said his 2012 Leadership Newspaper Annual Lecture gave birth to the APC but that people, who hijacked power then never wanted people like him to come closer.\n\nUtomi, a Professor of Political Economics and Management, made the assertion in Benin City, capital of Edo State, weekend, at a one-day sensitisation programme organised by \u201cNigeria Can\u2019t Continue Like This\u201d NCC-LIT, with the theme: Supporters of Good Governance.\n\nAccording to him, what attracted persons him then was the anti-corruption thing, because Buhari said, when elected, he would kill corruption, so that Nigeria could make progress.\n\n\u201cHowever, because of this transactional politics, we can see what has become of the government and in my opinion, this government is the most corrupt Nigeria has ever had.\n\n\u201cASUU has been on strike forever, and look at what they are just asking for and it is for the sake of our children and this is what one man, called Accountant General can just take N170 billion from our treasury. You can see that their conscience don\u2019t worry them again, because of the structure,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, the desire to change Nigeria made him to start working with some persons on the need for a third force and that made him to be working with some groups including the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), the Labour Commission from the thirty-six states of the country and that was how the Labour Party allied to the Labour Congress.\n\n\u201cSo, when some persons begin to project me for the presidency, and Peter Obi said the PDP thing will not work for him and came to the LP, I said okay, I will step down for him, because I am for anything that will make Nigeria work,\u201d Utomi noted.\n\nHe also disclosed that the formation of APC as a party began from a lecture he delivered in Lagos in 2012.\n\n\u201cAPC started from a lecture that I gave at the Leadership Newspaper Annual Lecture, 2012 with the title, \u2018Political Parties: Will Opposition Save Nigeria?\u2019 At the Sheraton Hotels. When I finished the lecture, Chief Paul Unongo, accosted me and said, can I just close this gate so that about one thousand persons at the lecture will not go until we know how opposition political parties should be created.\n\n\u201cOn the high table were Muhammadu Buhari, Bola Tinubu, Bisi Akande and others. In that meeting, I was mandated to go and write APC manifesto with the Vice President Yomi Osinbajo. But from the day one, it seemed that people that captured power do not want people like us around, and I just decided to stay on my own.\u201d\n\nNwosu: Relegation of Founding Fathers, Arrogance Cost APC Osun\n\nA Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and former governorship candidate of APC in Imo State, Mr Uche Nwosu, has blamed internal crisis, arrogance, reliance on power of incumbency and poor reward system for the inability of the party to win the just concluded Osun State governorship election.\n\nNwosu, in a statement shortly after the result was announced by the INEC, noted that the APC leadership allowed internal crisis to engulf the structure of the party in nearly all the states, adding that the loss the APC suffered in Osun State was self-inflicted.\n\nHe stressed further that the arrogance of the people in power had led them to play God, while losing the commitment of party faithful.\n\n\u201cAPC lost because the party leadership allowed internal crisis to kill the structures in all the states. Secondly, arrogance contributed to the fall of the party. They believe that once you are in power, no one can do anything. APC has always believed in the power of incumbency and also remember that we have been saying it that their reward system is zero.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the founding fathers of the party are relegated to please new members. Look at how they treated the former governor of Osun State, Rauf Aregbesola, see how he was relegated, a founding member of the party and they believed he can\u2019t do anything, he should go to hell. They have seen it now,\u201d he said.\n\nOn whether the party could still bounce back ahead the 2023 general elections, Nwosu lamented that the party does not have the luxury of time to make amends.\n\n\u201cIt is getting late, in fact it is already late for the APC to retrace its steps. If they wanted to make corrections, they could have done that since; they had every opportunity to do that, but because some of the leaders in the party are very arrogant, they don\u2019t care, they are selfish and only think about themselves and we have been shouting about this but no one cared to listen. They think that once you become a governor then you have everything and nothing else matters anymore.\n\n\u201cI strongly blame the leadership of our party for the woes that have befallen the APC. God gave us power in 2015 and became arrogant with the power. We no longer care what happens, how the people feel, we don\u2019t care how the founding fathers of the party are treated, see where the arrogance has gotten us today,\u201d he said.\n\nPDP Governors Say It\u2019s Time for APC to Go\n\nThe PDP governors congratulated Ademola Adeleke and said his victory on Saturday was because of the trust Osun people reposed on him, adding that it was time for APC to go.\n\nThe party\u2019s governors said because the people could see Adeleke\u2019s heart, which was full of love and concern for the wellbeing of his people, they elected him\n\nIn a statement by the chairman of the PDP Governor, Governor Aminu Tambuwal, the party\u2019s governors said, \u201cThis victory is as a result of the sagacity, hard work, teamwork, skillful campaigns, efficient resource allocation, openness and humility exhibited by the Governor-elect \u2018\n\n\u201cHe concentrated on issues that mattered most to Osun people and they responded in kind, bestowing on him and PDP an earth-shaking victory of historic proportions. This victory is a lesson for all. It shows that everyone matters in politics, particularly the electorate. It also confirms the famous dictum that \u2018God\u2019s time is the best\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe must remain vigilant and anticipate all the antics the dying All Progressives Congress (APC) will come up with. But rest assured that we are all with you in this great effort to reset the trajectory and story of Nigeria, positively. The light has shone on Osun State, in July. It is time for the light to shine on Nigeria, again through the instrumentality of the PDP, come February, 2023.\u201d\n\nPSC, IG Say Osun Signposts Peaceful 2023 Elections\n\nThe Police Service Commission (PSC), said at the weekend, that, the commendable performance of the personnel of the Nigeria Police and during the just concluded Osun State governorship election was a signal that future elections in the country may witness good coverage by police and other security agencies.\n\nSpeaking in the same breath, the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mr Usman Baba, commended security operatives particularly, officers of the Nigeria Police, the military, and other security agencies as well as the electorate in Osun State for the peaceful conduct of the elections held last Saturday in the three Senatorial Districts, 30 Local Government Areas (LGAs), and 3753 polling units of the State.\n\nThe commission, in a statement, said it monitored policemen on election duties in the 30 Local Government Areas of the state and rated their performance above average.\n\n\u201cThe police men arrived the polling centres on time and were professional in their conduct. They exhibited a high level of commitment to their duties and were able to restore orderliness in most of the polling units.\n\n\u201cThere were an average of three policemen in most of the units who were properly dressed with their name tags and were also firm and courteous to voters.\u201d\n\nThe IGP applauded the massive deployment of police operatives, specialised units, and other human and operational assets including three helicopters and a couple of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for aerial surveillance in the the senatorial districts, four adequately manned gun boats for the riverine areas, and Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs) which enabled swift responses to the pockets of electoral issues.\n\nAs statement by Force Headquarters said the IGP also lauded the collaborative efforts of other security agencies which assisted in the peaceful conduct of the elections.\n\nAvoid Litigation, Congratulate Adeleke, Lawyer Tells Oyetola\n\nHuman rights lawyer, Pelumi Olajengbesi, has asked the Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, to concede defeat and congratulate the governor-elect of the state, Senator Ademola Adeleke.\n\nOlajengbesi, who is also a member of the Peoples Democratic Party, also said Oyetola would disgrace himself if he dares heads to court to challenge the electoral victory of Adeleke as announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission.\n\nThe lawyer described as a waste of time, any litigation by the APC candidate, saying even the Supreme Court cannot save Oyetola from his defeat at the polls of Saturday, July 16, 2022.\n\nHe therefore asked Oyetola to do the honorable thing and congratulate the governor-elect (Adeleke) just as President Muhammadu Buhari has done on Sunday.\n\nSecondus Felicitates Adeleke\n\nA former National Chairman of the PDP, Uche Secondus, has congratulated Ademola Adeleke on his well deserved victory at the Saturday\u2019s Osun State governorship election.\n\nSecondus said the victory was a clear affirmation and demonstration of the people\u2019s goodwill in appreciation of the efforts of the Adelekes in the development of the state.\n\nHe commended all those who contributed greatly to the victory, in particular, the PDP 2023 presidential candidate, Atiku and his running mate, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State, among others.\n\n\u201cBy this brave and courageous act, Osun people have shown their determination to take their collective destiny in their own hands and for this PDP and all lovers of democracy are proud of them.\u201d\n\nMark: Adeleke\u2019s Victory, PDP\u2019s Gateway to 2023\n\nFormer President of the Senate, Senator David Mark, has said the victory of Ademola Adeleke, was a gateway for the PDP in 2023.\n\n\u201cYour perseverance, steadfastness, focus, determination and unwavering commitment to the wellbeing of the citizens of Osun State has paid off. Their votes are investments and trust in you to lead them to the promised Land,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former Senate President told Adeleke to see his victory as a call to higher responsibility, and the power to do good and emancipate the people from deprivation, poverty and want.\n\nHe praised the people of Osun State for remaining steadfast and believe in the capacity of Adeleke to deliver dividends of democracy to them hoping that the governor- elect will live up to expectation.\n\nMark also praised the Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC), the security operatives and the media for the enabling environment that guaranteed free, fair and credible election in Osun state.\n\nHe said the PDP victory in Osun State shows that, \u201cthe PDP is the party of choice and the vehicle to usher In positive changes for Nigeria in 2023.\u201d\n\nAbdulsalami\u2019s Peace Committee Urges Adeleke to be Benevolent in Victory\n\nThe National Peace Committee (NPC) has described recently concluded governorship election in Osun state as a triumph of democracy.\n\nIn a statement signed by the former Nigeria\u2019s Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar (rtd), the group urged the winner of the election, Senator Adeleke Ademola Jackson Nurudeen of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to be benevolent in victory, urging him and his political party to eschew triumphalism that may make peace-building difficult after what at certain moments was a fractiously fought election\n\n\u201cWe wish to commend and congratulate the people of Osun State over their peaceful conduct during the July 16, 2022, governorship election making the following observations.\n\n\u201cWe particularly commend the people of Osun State for coming out in large numbers abiding to the procedures set out by the Electoral Act and implemented by the electoral commission. Your conduct is an admirable example of proper voter behaviour to the nation, even as we look forward to the General Elections in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe note with certainty, the efforts put in place by various stakeholders in government, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), traditional and religious leaders, and various development partners, to ensure a peaceful and transparent atmosphere before, during and after the elections in Osun State. We are elated over this development and call for further cooperation in future elections.\n\n\u201cWhile the elections were not devoid of incidents, particularly the scourge that is vote trading, we commend the efforts of all stakeholders who have tirelessly worked either as ombudsmen or observers or participants to ensure that the elections were conducted according to the rules,\u201d. It said.\n\nAdeleke\u2019s Emergence, Victory for Democracy, Says Yaman\n\nGovernorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in Kwara State, Alhaji Shuaibu Abdullahi Yaman, has described the electoral victory of Senator Ademola Adeleke as the governor-elect of Osun State as one for democracy.\n\nYaman also said the victory was an indictment of betrayers and traitors.\n\nHowever, in a statement in Ilorin, congratulated Adeleke and said, \u201cthe nascent Nigeria\u2019s democracy is gradually coming to an age, where the voices of the masses are resonated and counted. The PDP victory in Osun is a victory for democracy and a clear signal to political demagogues to prepare their handover notes, as the majority of the people can no longer be deceived.\u201d\n\nYaman urged Adeleke to remain committed to his electoral promises and also congratulated the PDP leadership for the support given to the winner while the campaign lasted.\n\n\u201cI, especially, congratulate the President, 8th National Assembly, Dr Abubakar Bukola Saraki, for his pioneering role in the Osun struggle,\u201d Yaman said, and implored the good people of state to vote out the clueless government in the state come 2023 election so as to create a better and prosperous future for the state.\n\nTHISDAY",

          "title": "Nigeria to Continue Setting Petrol Prices Despite NNPC\u2019s Transition to Commercial Entity",
          "text": "The Group Chief Executive Officer (GCEO) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, has maintained that determination of fuel prices would continue to be a decision by the federal government despite the firm\u2019s transitioning to a commercial entity.\n\nBut unlike his counterpart in Brazil state-run Petrobras oil company, Jose Mauro Coelho, who resigned from his post as CEO last month over President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s interference in the company\u2019s fuel pricing policy, Kyari said that the exercise would henceforth be performed for a fee for the Nigerian government.\n\nCoelho was forced to step down from his role just days after Petrobras announced that it would increase petrol and diesel prices and Bolsonaro who is seeking re-election in October described the move as one that, \u201ccould sink Brazil into chaos.\u201d\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari also holds the same view.\n\nCoelho would be the third Petrobras CEO to have come and gone since Bolsonaro took office in early 2019, with the disagreements earlier leading to the ouster of former CEOs Roberto Castello Branco and Joaquim Silva e Luna.\n\nSpeaking during a prerecorded interview with Channels Television, on Sunday, Kyari stated that whereas before now the NNPC\u2019s function of being the sole importer may not have been on a commercial basis, it would henceforth charge a fee for the service.\n\n\u201cIn the case of the price of petroleum, this is a policy matter. And the NNPC is going to be a supplier to the Federation at a fee. So, the issue of at what price you sell petroleum will be the decision of the state.\n\n\u201cThe state has continued to maintain that we must continue to pay subsidy on petroleum products. We are happy to do this, but as a commercial venture, we will have a service-level agreement between us to render that service,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough it became a Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) on July 1 by the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the NNPC is expected to be officially unveiled by Buhari on Tuesday.\n\nThe president recently deferred the full deregulation of the sector, which would have seen the removal of the controversial and opaque petrol subsidy and will gulp at least N4 trillion this year, by 18 months.\n\nBut Kyari reiterated that it would no longer be business as usual, insisting that as a commercial venture, the NNPC would just be a service provider to government, rather than shouldering the responsibility of importation and allowing it hurt the company\u2019s bottom line.\n\n\u201cWe will procure the products and we will sell to the state, and will be step on step with the country and literally, I\u2019ve seen no indication at this point in time that the state is ready to change any price of petroleum products. It has nothing to do with our operations.\n\n\u201cFor us, what it really means is that this is business for us. We\u2019ll charge them a fee and at any point, so that the company can make money on behalf of its shareholders,\u201d he said during the interview.\n\nKyari, who also spoke on the new demands on the new NNPC explained that it would henceforth take the issue of transparency more seriously, having earlier joined the global Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).\n\n\u201cMore than anything else, there\u2019s really no plan of tying this (subsidy) to our turnover and they have no relationship,\u201d he noted.\n\nAccording to him, the new NNPC will not withdraw from the international organisation, but will rather continue to ensure more openness in its operations to attract more investments and foreign partnerships.\n\n\u201cActually it now becomes more demanding to be more transparent. NNPC is a partner company for the global EITI initiative, like very many other private companies that voluntarily chose to become partner company to the EITI.\n\n\u201cThe meaning of this is that you\u2019re going to make certain disclosures to your shareholders and to the world community that companies ordinarily are not required to do and we will keep to that because we\u2019re not going to withdraw as a partner company to the EITI.\n\n\u201cThat means that there are further requirements beyond what we are doing today. Beyond just publishing your financial statements, there are very many other disclosure requirements for being a partner company to EITI.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this is good for our company, we will continue to sustain this. And as a matter of fact, as you may be aware, we\u2019re the only company that publishes its operational reports: production, sales and everything on a monthly basis,\u201d he said.\n\nKyari explained that although there\u2019s no statutory obligation to make those operational disclosures, the new NNPC\u2019s commitment to getting it right remains unwavering.\n\n\u201cNo company does this anywhere in the world. There\u2019s no requirement to do this. As a matter of fact, I\u2019ll borrow one of my colleagues\u2019 view that we\u2019re actually not just transparent, we are actually naked.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy telling people that this is who we are. This is what we\u2019re trying to do and on their behalf and also because companies and partners, particularly the lending community, the global energy community would like to see what you\u2019re doing.\n\n\u201cOnce they do, trust becomes higher and your ability to access capital becomes real and easier. And ultimately it gives you all the advantage that you require, so you lose nothing by being transparent,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAside being the sole importer of petroleum products, the NNPC has yet to explain what happens to its other major function of contributing monthly to the Federation Account since by law CAMA companies only pay dividends to their shareholders annually.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has expressed its resolve to hold a two-day national protest to demand the immediate reopening of the country\u2019s public-owned tertiary institutions which have been shut for five months.\n\nThe resolution by the NLC came just as the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Usman Danfodio University chapter has debunked claims by the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige that its medical lecturers have backed out of the ongoing strike embarked upon by the university lecturers\u2019 union.\n\nThe NLC accused the federal government of not negotiating in good faith to resolve the crisis in Nigeria\u2019s public Universities.\n\nThe Labour movement had at its National Executive Council (NEC) meeting held in Abuja, on June 30, 2022, threatened to embark on a nationwide protest to compel, \u201cthe federal government to conclude the ongoing negotiation with trade unions in Nigeria\u2019s universities and be prepared to commence implementation of whatever Collective Bargaining Agreement arising therefrom so that public universities in Nigeria can resume normal activities.\u201d\n\nThe federal government was then given a 21-day ultimatum to resolve the dispute or face a one-day nationwide labour protest which might culminate in a full blown worker\u2019s strike.\n\nThe ultimatum would end on July 26.\n\nHowever, in a mobilisation letter sent to all the state branches of NLC and the Federal Capital Territory, the Congress directed them to activate all the mechanisms to implement the decision of NEC to organise a national protest beginning from Wednesday, July 26 to Thursday, July 27.\n\nAmong the resolutions reached at the NEC meeting were the condemnation of the alleged unserious attitude of government to negotiations as well the activation of, \u201cno work\u2013no pay\u201d policy on the striking university workers.\n\nThe NEC described the stoppage of salaries of the university workers as draconian.\n\nThe NEC went on to resolve to organise a one-day solidarity action in support of Congress affiliates in the education sector.\n\nBut in a statement issued Sunday, NLC President, Ayuba Wabba, said the decision of the NEC have been activated accordingly with a circular to affiliates and state councils for compliance.\n\nThe NLC lamented the delay in resolving the dispute between members of ASUU and other non-teaching staff unions despite the setting up high-powered negotiating team headed by the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Agboola Gambari for that purpose.\n\nIt also recalled that a tripartite meeting was convened by the federal government on May 12, 2022, at the instance of the organised labour and well-meaning Nigerians to resolve the crises in the tertiary institutions.\n\nAccording to NLC, negotiations were held and the meeting was adjourned for three weeks to allow the Prof. Nimi-Briggs Committee to turn in their report and also to allow the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) to subject all the proposed unviersity payment platforms to integrity test including IPPIS.\n\n\u201cThe committee was asked to conclude its work and report back to the negotiation meeting.\n\nIt was the federal government at the Tripartite Plus negotiation meeting, that requested that the meeting be adjourned for three weeks to enable the Briggs Committee to submit their report and for integrity test to be conducted on the payment platform proposed by the trade unions.\n\n\u201cHow can government now turn around to blame the unions for the work of a committee they appointed? This was the same way the last committee report on this matter was aborted,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe NLC statement added: \u201cGiven the foregoing and in line with the resolutions of the NEC of the Nigeria Labour Congress which took place on the 30th of June 2022, we demand the following from the federal government:\n\n\u201cThe federal government should immediately conclude the ongoing negotiation with trade unions in Nigeria\u2019s universities and be prepared to commence implementation of whatever Collective Bargaining Agreement arising therefrom so that public universities in Nigeria can resume normal activities.\n\n\u201cThe federal government should immediately pay the salaries of striking university workers which had been frozen on the premise of the so-called \u201cno work-no pay\u201d policy especially as recommended by the leaders of Nigeria\u2019s two major faiths.\n\n\u201cWe demand that the federal government meets these demands in line with the resolutions of the statutory organs of the Congress.\n\n\u201cAll the decisions of the NEC have been activated accordingly with a circular to affiliates and state councils of Nigeria Labour Congress.\u201d\n\nNLC also spoke on the need for the review of the 2009 Collective Bargaining Agreement between the federal government and the union in the tertiary institutions, saying that it had expired long before now.\n\n\u201cGiven the free fall of Nigeria\u2019s currency, the naira, and its continuous devaluation, the need for the review of the 2009 Collective Bargaining Agreement is public knowledge.\n\n\u201cAs it stands today, the highest earning university Professor and staff earns less than $800 as take-home pay. This is indeed very ridiculous and is a major factor to the high rate of brain drain in our system making us unable to retain our best brains.\u201d\n\nASUU Debunks Minister\u2019s Claims That Medical Lecturers Suspended Strike\n\nMeanwhile, ASUU, Usman Danfodio University Chapter has debunked claims by Ngige that its medical lecturers have back out from the ongoing strike embarked upon by the union.\n\nIn a statement at the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) Secretariat, Sokoto, Sunday, the chairperson of the union, Prof. Muhammad Almustapha accused Ngige of misleading Nigerians.\n\nHe added that recently Ngige in an interview with Arise TV on 14 July, 2022, had said the medical lecturers of the university had suspended the strike since it didn\u2019t produce the desired results.\n\n\u201cNgige on the July 14, 2022 pitiably and shamefully said medical lecturers of the university are at work, they have written their Vice Chancellor that they are at work.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the statement was the imagination of the minister which was intended to misinform the general public against the sensibility of Nigerians.\n\nHe explained that Ngige depicted his inhumane nature and wanton disregard for truth, honesty and integrity a character unbefitting of a federal minister.\n\n\u201cHow could a senior minister of the Federal Republic, who is supposed to be an elder statesman continue to dish out disinformation to over 200 million Nigerians, knowing fully well that he was not saying the truth,\u201d he added.\n\nHe maintained that Ngige had not be telling the president the true picture of things about the negotiations, calling on the minister to resign with immediate effect.\n\nHe further disclosed that the entire members of ASUU, UDUS branch including the College of Health Sciences were fully on total and comprehensive strike and have never had the intention of calling it off until federal government wake up to its responsibilities.\n\n\u201cContrary to Ngige claims there is no letter written by the Vice Chancellor of Usman Danfodio University, Sokoto or any of his representatives or any union officials, depicting that the medical lecturers are not on strike.\n\n\u201cWe challenge the self-acclaimed \u201cConciliator,\u201d Dr. Chris Ngige to produce any factual evidence to back his crooked claims,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe said his calling on Ngige to resign was not on personal hatred for the minister, but based on his antics and biasness which earned Nigeria number of strikes during his tenure.\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja and Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto",

          "text": "Sri Lanka\u2019s acting president, Ranil Wickremesinghe, has declared a state of emergency as his administration seeks to quell social unrest and tackle an economic crisis gripping the island nation.\n\n\u201cIt is expedient, so to do, in the interests of public security, the protection of public order and the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community,\u201d a government notice released late on Sunday said.\n\nWickremesinghe had announced a state of emergency last week, after president Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country to escape a popular uprising against his government.\n\nIt was unclear whether that order had been withdrawn or had lapsed, or whether Wickremesinghe had reissued the order in his capacity as acting president, having been sworn in on 15 July. A spokesperson for Wickremesinghe\u2019s office did not respond to Reuters request for comment.\n\nThe specific legal provisions of the latest emergency are yet to be announced by the government but previous emergency regulations have been used to deploy the military to arrest and detain people, search private property and dampen public protests.\n\nThe country\u2019s commercial capital, Colombo, remained calm on Monday morning, with traffic and pedestrians out on the streets.\n\nBhavani Fonseka, senior researcher at the Centre for Policy Alternatives, said declaring a state of emergency was becoming the government\u2019s default response.\n\n\u201cThis has proven ineffective in the past,\u201d Fonseka told Reuters.\n\nRajapaksa\u2019s resignation was accepted by parliament on Friday. He flew to the Maldives and then Singapore after hundreds of thousands of anti-government protesters came out on to the streets of Colombo a week ago and occupied his official residence and offices.\n\nSri Lanka\u2019s parliament met on Saturday to begin the process of electing a new president, and a shipment of fuel arrived to provide some relief to the crisis-hit nation.\n\nWickremesinghe, an ally of Rajapaksa, was nominated by the ruling party as its candidate to be the next president but protesters also want him gone, leading to the prospect of further unrest should he be elected.\n\nWickremesinghe was appointed interim president on Friday after informally occupying the role since Wednesday, and the announcement was greeted with anger and frustration on the streets of Colombo.\n\nWickremesinghe, who has now been prime minister six times, stands accused of protecting and propping up the Rajapaksa family dynasty for years, shielding them from corruption charges and enabling their return to power.\n\nHis decision to agree to become a caretaker prime minister two months ago was seen by many as the reason Rajapaksa stayed in power for weeks longer than he would have otherwise.\n\nThe public frustration at Wickremesinghe has manifested multiple times, from his private residence being burned down to his offices being stormed by protesters on Wednesday.\n\nWickremesinghe will be the candidate for the Rajapaksas\u2019 ruling party, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), which still has the largest number of seats in parliament. He stands a high chance of being elected after the vote by MPs in parliament scheduled for next Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nWickremesinghe\u2019s nomination even appeared to cause divisions with the SLPP. The party chair, GL Peiris, sent a letter to the party\u2019s general secretary expressing \u201camazement and total disbelief\u201d at the statement that it would be backing Wickremesinghe as its presidential nominee.\n\nHowever, Wickremesinghe will be up against several candidates in the presidential secret ballot next week, including the leader of the opposition, Sajith Premadasa \u2013 who has vowed to make sure \u201can elective dictatorship never, ever occurs\u201d and go after the leaders who \u201clooted the country\u201d \u2013 and another SLPP politician, Dullas Alahapperuma, which could split the vote of the ruling party.\n\nFormer army chief Sarath Fonseka has also signalled his intention to run.",
